2990,one of the largest contiguous karst areas in the world is southwest china where special geological conditions shallow soil layers the frequency of precipitation extremes unreasonable land use and dam construction have rendered the relationship between water discharge and sediment load increasingly complex few studies have been devoted to this region to clarify the potential influencing factors of the water sediment relationship on a monthly basis correspondingly the present study evaluated the temporal variations in sediment rating curves srcs qs a q b where qs is the sediment concentration or load q is the water discharge the coefficient a and index b are fitted parameters and decoupled the effects of climate change and vegetation dynamics on src parameters using partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem to these ends 2003 to 2017 data on the monthly water discharge sediment load climatic and vegetation factors of six karst watersheds were collected and analyzed no significant trends in interannual variations of src parameters occurred the pls sem showed that the combined effects of climate and vegetation explained 18 to 43 and 8 to 57 of the variations in coefficient a and index b respectively in most cases however no significant relationship was found among climate vegetation related factors and the src parameters special hydrogeological conditions and dam construction in the area increasingly complicated the sediment transport process thus potentially weakening the influence of climate and vegetation on the src parameters this study can serve as guidance for regional ecological management and the sustainable development of soil and water resources keywords soil erosion sediment transport coefficient a index b karst ecosystems data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the relationship between water discharge and sediment transport in watersheds is the result of the combined effects of natural and human factors syvitski et al 2000 wang et al 2016 soil erosion reservoir deposition river pollution and other issues have recently rendered the evaluation of the water sediment relationship a topical hydrological issue that has elicited considerable concern vercruysse et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 in rivers changes in the aforementioned relationship occur over time because of climate lithology land use human activities and other factors rodríguez blanco et al 2010 sun et al 2016 such changes in turn influence river erosion and deposition thereby tremendously affecting river environments and ecosystems achite and ouillon 2007 borrelli et al 2017 these problems have highlighted the paramount importance of identifying temporal variations in the water sediment relationship in reasonably managing watersheds and effectively controlling sediment delivery the characteristics of the water sediment relationship are commonly investigated through sediment rating curves srcs which have been widely used in explorations of many large rivers in the world wang et al 2008 rajaee et al 2009 sheridan et al 2011 gao et al 2017 this method empirically describes the relationship between sediment load qs g s or sediment concentration cs g m 3 and water discharge q m3 s asselman 2000 typically expressed as a power function or a linear form on the basis of its logarithmic deformation 1 q s a q b 2 cs q s q a q b 1 3 lg q s lg a b lg q where a and b are the coefficient and index respectively srcs are easy to sample and construct requiring only one discrete and relatively small data series gao 2008 yang and wendroth 2014 li et al 2017 vercruysse et al 2017 previous studies indicated that sediment parameters a and b are closely related to channel morphology channel shape slope and flow power per unit the abundance of erodible materials and the sediment transport capacity of rivers peters kümmerly 1973 morgan 1995 asselman 2000 morehead et al 2003 yang et al 2007 specifically as an indicator of sediment yield in a source region coefficient a can represent an index of erosion severity and mainly reflects the intensity of sediment yield in watersheds where the higher the coefficient the greater the soil loss desilets et al 2007 peters kümmerly 1973 and morgan 1995 suggested that coefficient a denoted as erosion severity is related to the amount of sediment material available for potential erosion zhang et al 2018 in other words in areas rich in strongly weathered materials sediment is easily erodible and transportable and a high coefficient a easily occurs syvitski et al 2000 found that coefficient a is highly linked to climate and watershed slope another important factor that influences this coefficient is the size of a watershed area finally coefficient a varies significantly owing to the influence of natural and human activities wang et al 2008 river erosivity is proportional to flow that can be described by rated index b which represents the amount of sediment transported per unit of increased water flow peters kümmerly 1973 as clarified by asselman 2000 index b represents the erosive power of rivers with high values generally implying that a small increase in river flow leads to a large increase in river erosivity adding to this insight syvitski et al 2000 showed that index b is considerably affected by climate soil erosion and sediment grain size sediment transport in rivers with substantial sand content is stronger than that occurring in rivers with clay content and index b in the former is larger temporal variations in srcs and their potential influencing factors are well documented for example wang et al 2008 reconstructed the changes in sediment transport that have occurred in the yangtze river since 1865 and found that human activities dam construction soil and water conservation projects have significantly affected src parameters in the river on the basis of 40 year daily water discharge and sediment data on the yellow river basin zhang et al 2018 explored changes in srcs and their influencing factors discovering that src parameters are more strongly affected by the watershed areas of loess regions and the slopes of rocky mountainous areas vaughan et al 2017 used srcs to analyze daily discharge data on 36 rivers in minnesota and showed that index b is closely related to river topography and slope and that land use change has a significant influence on srcs under medium and low flow conditions collecting six years worth of data on water discharge and sediment transport in the trask basin of the united states bywater reyes et al 2017 indicated that lithology most strongly influences srcs notwithstanding the insights provided by previous studies however they concentrated primarily on daily or yearly water discharge and sediment transport data few studies have used monthly data to investigate temporal variations in srcs and their influencing factors especially in karst regions where ecologically vulnerable areas experience severe soil erosion karst landforms account for about 7 to 12 of global continental territories and approximately 1 4 of the populations in these regions are completely or partially dependent on karst aquifers for drinking water hartmann et al 2014 they are typified by large surface porosity high infiltration rates well developed underground water systems and runoff coefficients that are considerably lower than those in non karst areas the carbonate widely distributed on the surfaces of karst areas is mostly dissolved by rainwater the dissolution of surface and underground rocks exceeds mechanical erosion to a substantial extent forming karst landforms with unique morphological and hydrological properties ford and williams 2007 gutiérrez et al 2014 in china karst areas span approximately 3 44 million km2 accounting for 36 of the country s total land area jiang et al 2014 among these southwest china is one of the largest continuous karst distribution regions in the world hartmann et al 2014 li et al 2016 its shallow soil covers the highly irregular surface with a high infiltration rate a special geological condition that combined with unfavorable land use has led to serious soil erosion and rock desertification jiang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 moreover given the influence of frequent precipitation extremes dam construction and vegetation restoration in recent years the water sediment relationship in southwest karst areas significantly differs from that in non karst territories an essential task therefore is to clarify the characteristics and driving factors of the water sediment relationship in karst watersheds for soil and water conservation and the sustainable development of water resources in these regions previous studies showed that climate exerts a tremendous direct influence on the parameters of srcs in high altitude areas a rise in temperature can melt ice and snow increase river flow enhance sediment transport capacity and thus lead to src parameters change syvitski et al 2000 syvitski et al 2000 evaluated the factors that influence srcs and found that air temperature is positively related to coefficient a and inversely correlated with index b precipitation is the direct external force of soil erosion gao 2008 and the distribution duration frequency and intensity of rainfall can affect srcs rodríguez blanco et al 2010 sun et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 for example the index b in rivers located in humid areas is generally higher than that of rivers found in arid areas and index b during the wet season is higher than that during the dry season in a single watershed the summer temperature is high and the strong evapotranspiration process reduces river runoff thus playing an important role in src variations juez et al 2021 vegetation is another important influencing factor for src parameters vercruysse et al 2017 sheridan et al 2011 found that after a fire the vegetation coverage rate and index b in australian rivers are markedly reduced additionally climate exerts indirect effects on srcs via its influence on plant growth but such effects are a challenging issue that has yet to be fully resolved in consideration of the above mentioned issues this study was intended 1 to investigate temporal variations in the water sediment relationship in karst watersheds on the basis of srcs and 2 to quantify the direct and indirect effects of climate change and vegetation dynamics on src parameters 2 study site and data 2 1 study area the study area is located in china s xijiang basin 21 36 17 27 00 21 n 102 16 52 113 23 51 e where karst landforms are widely distributed fig 1 the xijiang basin originates in the yunnan guizhou plateau and flows through the provinces of yunnan guizhou guangxi and guangdong with a total length of 2 214 km and a drainage area of about 35 104 km2 the xijiang river is the largest tributary of the pearl river and the fourth largest river in china this region has a subtropical and tropical monsoon climate with an annual temperature of 18 c it has its highest temperature in july and its lowest in january the annual precipitation is 1 470 mm which is unevenly distributed throughout the year with more rain occurring in summer than in winter eighty percent of this precipitation occurs during the rainy season of april to october to explore the influence of climate change and vegetation dynamics on src parameters in karst regions of southwest china we selected six watersheds of the xijiang basin nanpan liujiang yujiang hongshui xunjiang and wuzhou fig 1 2 2 data sources the datasets used in this study included data on monthly water and sediment discharge temperature precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi data series on monthly water and sediment discharge 2003 2017 were collected from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china provided by the ministry of water resources monthly temperature and precipitation data were obtained from the china meteorological data network https data cma cn and monthly pet was calculated on the basis of weather station data mccoll 2020 monthly ndvi and evi data were acquired from the dataset of the global inventory modeling and monitoring study https www nasa gov nex 3 methods for each year during the period 2003 to 2017 srcs were calculated to obtain the coefficient a and index b i e the src parameters of the six karst watersheds then the time series trends of the src parameters were analyzed using the mann kendall m k trend test the effects of climate and vegetation changes on the src parameters were decoupled via partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem 3 1 m k test the m k statistical test which was originally proposed by mann 1945 and later reformulated by kendall 1975 has been extensively used to determine hydroclimatic time series gao et al 2017 the m k test does not require data to be normally distributed and individual outliers do not affect the analysis results it is a non parametric method that features easy calculation in this study the m k test was employed to determine the trend of the src parameters in the selected watersheds from 2003 to 2017 the specific procedures implemented are as follows the assumed h0 time series x1 x2 xn are n independent samples equally distributed with random variables and the alternative hypothesis is that h1 is a two sided test xk and xj differ for all k j n and k j the test statistic s is defined thus 4 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x k in which 5 sgn x j x k 1 x j x k 0 0 x j x k 0 1 x j x k 0 6 v ar s n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 q tp t p 1 2 t p 5 18 7 z s 1 var s 0 s 1 var s s 0 s 0 s 0 where z is the standardized test statistic value xj and xk are the values of year j and k respectively q is the number of tied groups and t p is the number of data values in the pth group for a given confidence level α if statistic z z 1 α 2 the original hypothesis is unacceptable and there is a significant upward or downward trend in the time series data at a given confidence level for statistic z the upward trend is 0 and the downward trend is 0 when z is greater than or equal to 1 96 it has passed significant tests with confidence levels of 95 3 2 pls sem pls sem is a causal modeling approach that combines the features of principal component analysis and multiple linear regression it can explore the relationships and critical paths between variables shi et al 2014 thus potentially explaining variances r2 value in a dependent structure to the maximum extent this method has been widely used because of its fewer restrictions on data and simple use of structure hair et al 2011 a partial least squares structural equation model is composed mainly of two parts a measurement model external model which describes the unidirectional predictive relationship between each latent construct and associated observed indicators and a structural model internal model which describes the relationship between the latent variables and explicit variables hair et al 2011 the parameter estimation method in pls sem is divided into two steps first the estimated value of a latent variable is obtained through repeated iteration second the partial least squares method is used to perform linear regression and the parameter estimates of the structural and measurement models are obtained if there are k latent variables then there are k groups of explicit variables and each group contains m variables in these conditions each group of explicit variables can be expressed as 8 x i x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x im i 1 2 3 k it is assumed that there is a linear combination between latent variables and between latent and explicit variables each explicit variable is associated with a unique latent variable accordingly the equation of the measurement model is 9 xij λ i j ξ i σ i j the equation of the structural model is 10 ξ i i j β i j ξ j ε i where ξi is a standardized latent variable λij denotes the factor load βij represents the path coefficient and σij and εi are error correction terms which are unrelated to the prediction variable and have a mean value of 0 we hypothesized that climate factors not only directly affect srcs but also indirectly affect them via their influence on vegetation growth coefficient a represents an index of erosion severity and index b refers to the sediment transport capacity of rivers a conceptual model was constructed to test the hypothesized paths of climate change and vegetation dynamics on the src parameters on the basis of information derived from the literature 1 the distribution intensity frequency and duration of precipitation directly affect the sediment transport capacity of rivers rodríguez blanco et al 2010 sun et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 2 increasing air temperature substantially influences water discharge thereby influencing sediment load syvitski et al 2000 3 different temperature and precipitation conditions can affect plant types and growth forms thus influencing vegetation coverage pruski and nearing 2002 nearing et al 2005 4 changes in pet can affect changes in water availability in soil thus influencing river runoff and vegetation growth burns et al 2007 5 a high vegetation coverage presents considerable potential to enhance soil structure and reduce soil erosion vercruysse et al 2017 4 results 4 1 characteristics of monthly discharge and sediment the statistical characteristics of monthly water discharge sediment concentration and sediment load from 2003 to 2017 in the six karst watersheds are shown in table 1 the mean water discharge sediment concentration and sediment load ranged considerably from 2 108 to 162 108 m3 18 to 602 g m3 and 63 to 509 kg s respectively according to the classification proposed by nielsen and bouma 1985 water discharge exhibited moderate variability except in the liujiang watershed whereas sediment concentration and sediment load both showed high variability with the hongshui watershed exhibiting the strongest levels interestingly the coefficients of variation cvs of sediment load were higher than those of sediment concentration the temporal changes in water discharge sediment concentration and sediment load in the six watersheds are illustrated in fig 2 monthly sediment load and sediment concentration fluctuated considerably over time temporal variations in sediment load and sediment concentration were greater than those in water discharge consistent with their corresponding cvs table 1 generally monthly water discharge and sediment concentration showed single peak curves each year but the peak values differed considerably across different years 4 2 srcs table 2 shows the parameters and the determination of the coefficients r2 of the srcs in each watershed the mean r2 value of the relationship between water and sediment concentration ranged from 0 41 to 0 65 which was significantly lower than the corresponding values of 0 76 to 0 87 for the association between water and sediment load fig 3 the values of coefficient a and index b varied tremendously across the watersheds table 2 the mean values of coefficient a ranged from 0 03 to 28 98 with the nanpan watershed showing the highest value the mean values of index b ranged from 1 67 to 2 28 with the highest value observed in the hongshui watershed index b varied relatively slightly whereas coefficient a varied substantially to several orders of magnitude fig 4 shows the interannual variations in the src parameters the coefficient a of the nanpan watershed reached maximum values in 2014 and 2015 the annual sediment load of this watershed in 2014 was 22 higher than the mean value while its annual runoff was 27 lower than the mean value the nanpan river transported 99 of the annual sediment load from june to november 2014 resulting in a sharp increase in coefficient a in the liujiang watershed the maximum coefficient a occurred in 2013 since a large amount of sediment load was transported in a short period of time interestingly with a major flood in 2005 the coefficient a of yujiang hongshui xunjiang and wuzhou showed peak values there was a close relationship between coefficient a and index b fig 5 coefficient a significantly decreased as a power function of index b under a coefficient of determination ranging from 0 90 to 0 98 to better evaluate the interannual variations in the src parameters the results of the m k trend test were used as reference table 3 in most cases the src parameters exhibited no significant change trend p 0 05 coefficient a showed an upward trend in the nanpan p 0 05 and liujiang watersheds p 0 05 and a decreasing trend in the yujiang p 0 05 hongshui p 0 05 xunjiang p 0 05 and wuzhou p 0 05 watersheds in terms of index b a decreasing trend was observed in the nanpan p 0 05 liujiang p 0 05 and yujiang p 0 05 watersheds whereas a non significant increasing trend was found in the hongshui and xunjiang watersheds p 0 05 4 3 decoupling the influence of climate and vegetation on src parameters before performing the pls sem the coefficients of correlation between the src parameters and temperature precipitation pet ndvi and evi were evaluated fig 6 the correlation coefficients markedly varied among the six watersheds no significant correlation was found between temperature and the src parameters of all six watersheds p 0 05 but precipitation was significantly correlated with both parameters in nanpan p 0 01 and index b in hongshui p 0 05 pet was significantly correlated with coefficient a in the yujiang watershed and index b in the nanpan and liujiang watersheds p 0 05 ndvi was significantly correlated with coefficient a and index b in the xunjiang and nanpan watersheds respectively p 0 05 evi was significantly correlated only with index b in the nanpan watershed p 0 01 to decouple the effects of climate and vegetation factors on the src parameters the results of the pls sem were used as basis fig 7 climatic factors explained 31 to 57 of vegetation dynamics and climatic and vegetation factors explained 18 to 43 and 8 to 57 of the variations in coefficient a and index b respectively in pls sem the path coefficient β is equivalent to the standardized regression coefficient which can reflect the intensity and direction between predictors and variables huang et al 2019 in this study climate had a significant direct influence on vegetation β 0 56 0 76 p 0 05 but generally had no significant effect on parameter a or b p 0 05 vegetation had a significant negative effect only on coefficient a in the xunjiang watershed β 0 74 p 0 05 and exerted a significant positive influence on index b in the yujiang watershed β 0 75 p 0 05 table 4 presents the correlations among all the variables in the pls sem which were divided into direct indirect and total effects except in the liujiang and yujiang watersheds climate change had a direct positive impact on a with an impact range of 0 26 to 0 76 vegetation in the watersheds except liujiang had a negative impact range of 0 74 to 0 1 climate exerted an indirect negative influence on a through its effects on vegetation for all except liujiang watershed with the extent of influence ranging from 0 46 to 0 06 except in the hongshui watershed climate posed a direct negative influence on b with the effect ranging from 0 64 to 0 2 except in nanpan and liujiang vegetative influence on b ranged from 0 13 to 0 75 and climate indirectly and positively affected b via vegetation with the effects ranging from 0 09 to 0 53 except nanpan and liujiang in most of the watersheds the indirect effects of climate through vegetation on a were greater than the direct effects of climate and the direct effects of climate on b were greater than its indirect effects in terms of total effects changes in vegetation had the greatest impact on coefficient a except in the nanpan and yujiang watersheds climate change had a negative impact on coefficient a vegetation dynamics also had a negative impact on coefficient a finally with respect to index b climate change had a negative influence and vegetation dynamics had a positive influence 5 discussion we analyzed temporal variations in the src parameters of six karst watersheds from 2003 to 2017 and investigated whether climate and vegetation influenced the parameters to an extensive degree coefficient a decreased in four of the six watersheds which may be related to the reduction in sediment load in these sites generally the upper reaches of the rivers in these locations tend to have low a values and high b values because of the tremendous stream power generated by high gradients high flow rates and deep channels lower reaches with wide river surfaces slow flow velocity and weak sediment carrying capacity have high a values and low b values asselman 1999 2000 yang et al 2007 in this study the high b value appeared in hongshui and nanpan watershed with high altitude while the low value appeared in yujiang watershed with relatively gentle terrain interestingly the mean value of coefficient a gradually decreased with increasing watershed area which may be ascribed to the gentle slope of large watershed areas and the easier deposition of sediment in these locations furthermore relatively wide valleys have well developed floodplains which protect non alluvial river banks from bank erosion and reduce the intensity of sediment remigration as a result these areas are not sand producing sites thus diminishing sediment sources walling 1983 syvitski 2003 de vente et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2019 2020 with low coefficient a compared with large watersheds small watersheds have steeper slopes and less vegetation rich sediment sources and few opportunities for sediment deposition thus sediment is more likely to be carried away by running water lu et al 2005 griffiths et al 2006 de vente et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 li et al 2020 generating a higher coefficient a in a similar vein reid and frostick 1987 found that the coefficient a and index b of arid rivers range from 100 to 80 000 and 0 2 to 0 7 respectively whereas corresponding values in humid rivers range from 0 004 to 40 and 1 4 and 2 5 respectively syvitski et al 2000 wang et al 2008 as reflected in fig 5 the nanpan watershed had a high coefficient and a low inedx which may be related to the characteristics of the watershed that is because it is small nanpan has a stronger sediment transport mechanism a steeper surface slope and less vegetation resulting in higher erosion and richer sediment sources than those found in the other five watersheds morehead et al 2003 zhang et al 2019 we compared the src parameters of the six watersheds explored in this work with those of other watersheds in china on a monthly scale for the period 2003 to 2017 as can be seen in fig 8 the coefficient a of the rivers in the current study area significantly differed from that of the yellow river huai river and the northeast and northwest rivers in china p 0 05 in karst areas surface carbonate is widely distributed and the soil layer is shallow although southwest china is a humid region its coefficient a is generally low however loess vegetation coverage in the yellow river is relatively low with abundant erodible materials and heavy rains occur more frequently in summer this frequent high intensity precipitation can considerably erode soil resulting in a high coefficient a in the yellow river rustomji et al 2008 gao et al 2018 similarly the climate in northwest china is dry with the landform developing due to yardang wind erosion being widespread this landform has low vegetation coverage and loose soil layers resulting in an abundance of erodible materials and therefore a high coefficient a overall the upper reaches of the huai river are plagued by the severe soil erosion caused by deforestation and reclamation and the high coefficient a in the river is caused by heavy rains and mountain floods in the upper reaches of some river watersheds in northeast china coefficient a is high because intense reclamation for agriculture has generally caused high erodibility interestingly the yellow river huai river and the northeast and northwest rivers located in the semi humid semi arid and arid areas of china have significantly greater a values than those of the karst areas whereas the coefficient a of the yangtze river and southeast rivers in humid areas is non significantly different from those of karst areas p 0 05 in terms of index b no significant difference was found between the study area and the yangtze river and yellow river p 0 05 but significant differences were found between the study area and the huai river northeast rivers southeast rivers and northwest rivers p 0 05 compared with precipitation and sediment carrying capacity in humid areas those in other areas decreased resulting in a low index b no significant difference in index b was found between the examined karst areas and the yellow river p 0 05 this result may have been driven by the fact that most of the sediment erosion in the yellow river occurred during several major storms in which transport capacity was strong rustomji et al 2008 however the low b value of rivers in southeast humid regions may be due to high vegetation coverage and the presence of viscous red soil in southeast hilly regions resulting in a low index b for the pls sem results it is important to note that climate and vegetation factors generally had no significant influence on the src parameters the unique lithology and human activities in the area such as dam construction may have driven this non significant influence lithology typically has a considerable influence on sediment generation de vente et al 2011 shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 in the karst areas of southwest china hydrogeological conditions are complicated by fissures fractures and the network of solution conduits embedded in karst aquifers hartmann et al 2014 martin et al 2016 rainfall rapidly seeps into groundwater systems through carbonate fractures and fissures and only 5 is transported to rivers as surface runoff peng and wang 2012 fu et al 2015 li et al 2018 eroded soil normally fills karst sinkholes and blocks the drainage outlets of karst depression jiang et al 2014 many eroded sediments are deposited before they are transported to rivers and part of the sediments are transported by rivers causing low soil loss and accumulating less soil that can be easily eroded li et al 2017 in non karst areas precipitation and vegetation generally have a direct significant influence on sediment transport and thus src parameters accordingly the special lithology and sediment transport mechanisms in karst areas weaken the influence of climate and vegetation on src parameters human activities such as dam construction extensively affect river sediment transport yang et al 2006 wang et al 2008 water is discharged annually into a reservoir in stages in most cases hence dam construction exerts little impact on runoff in karst regions dai et al 2008 unlike runoff eroded sediment is easily deposited especially after dam construction wu et al 2012 under these conditions a significant difference in sediment transport occurs between pre and post dam construction periods but there is no significant difference in runoff wu et al 2012 li et al 2016 the construction of reservoirs and dams intercepts large amounts of sediment and reduces sediment supply in source regions thus diminishing coefficient a although no significant difference in runoff was found because of the retention of sediment in reservoirs sediment concentration in the river decreased leading to the enhancement of river erosion the scouring of the river and an increase in index b wang et al 2008 li et al 2016 this is consistent with the work of wang et al 2008 who found a trend of variation in the src parameters of the yangtze river after the completion of the three gorges dam in karst and non karst areas the magnitude of the effects of dams on sediment reduction differs in some rivers with high sediment discharge the effectiveness of dams in reducing sediment decreases over time wang et al 2016 for example in the yellow river watershed where sediment transport is high a large amount of eroded sediment has been deposited in the reservoir area the storage capacity of dams has become saturated furthermore many dams have gradually failed or even been damaged by frequent floods as a result dam storage capacity has gradually decreased since the 1980s with this phenomenon having relatively little impact on sediment discharge wang et al 2011 2016 liang et al 2015 by contrast sediment accumulation owing to dams in karst areas is lower and dams still play a leading role in reducing sediment in the short term li et al 2016 li et al 2018 evaluated changes in sediment transport in karst watersheds and found that in the hongshui watershed such transport sharply declines after the construction of a dam due to the sharp decrease of sediment transport the coefficient a of the hongshui watershed shows a significant decrease trend p 0 05 while the increase of the erosive power of the river leads to a increase trend of index b table 3 in the liujiang watershed vegetation decreases and soil erosion increases because of human activities such as massive logging or agricultural reclamation the coefficient a of the liujiang watershed increased p 0 05 whereas its index b showed a downward trend table 3 therefore similar to lithology dam construction can reduce the influence of climate change and vegetation dynamics on the parameters of srcs in karst areas further studies are required to quantify the effects of lithology and dam construction on src parameters in karst watersheds 6 conclusion in this study we calculated the 2003 to 2017 srcs of six karst watersheds in southwest china and quantified the relative importance of climate and vegetation factors in src parameters via pls sem the results indicated that coefficient a exhibited a decreasing trend in four of the karst watersheds and index b showed a decreasing trend in three of the karst watersheds the coefficient a of karst watersheds is lower than that of non karst regions such as the yellow river basin while the index b of karst watersheds is greater than that of most non karst regions such as the huai river basin the pls sem results reflected that the combined effects of climate and vegetation explained 18 to 43 of the variations in coefficient a and 8 to 57 of the variations in index b climate not only directly affected the src parameters but also indirectly affected them through its influence on vegetation vegetation was negatively correlated with coefficient a and positively correlated with index b the direct effect of climate on coefficient a was less than its indirect effect but in most cases there was no significant relationship among climate vegetation factors and the src parameters this result is attributed to the fact that the special hydrogeological conditions and dam construction in the study sites made sediment transport more complicated thereby weakening the influence of climate and vegetation on the src parameters further studies using pls sem are necessary to consider the influence of lithology and dam construction on src parameters in different climate zones credit authorship contribution statement

human factors syvitski et al 2000 wang et al 2016 soil erosion reservoir deposition river pollution and other issues have recently rendered the evaluation of the water sediment relationship a topical hydrological issue that has elicited considerable concern vercruysse et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 in rivers changes in the aforementioned relationship occur over time because of climate lithology land use human activities and other factors rodríguez blanco et al 2010 sun et al 2016 such changes in turn influence river erosion and deposition thereby tremendously affecting river environments and ecosystems achite and ouillon 2007 borrelli et al 2017 these problems have highlighted the paramount importance of identifying temporal variations in the water sediment relationship in reasonably managing watersheds and effectively controlling sediment delivery the characteristics of the water sediment relationship are commonly investigated through sediment rating curves srcs which have been widely used in explorations of many large rivers in the world wang et al 2008 rajaee et al 2009 sheridan et al 2011 gao et al 2017 this method empirically describes the relationship between sediment load qs g s or sediment concentration cs g m 3 and water discharge q m3 s asselman 2000 typically expressed as a power function or a linear form on the basis of its logarithmic deformation 1 q s a q b 2 cs q s q a q b 1 3 lg q s lg a b lg q where a and b are the coefficient and index respectively srcs are easy to sample and construct requiring only one discrete and relatively small data series gao 2008 yang and wendroth 2014 li et al 2017 vercruysse et al 2017 previous studies indicated that sediment parameters a and b are closely related to channel morphology channel shape slope and flow power per unit the abundance of erodible materials and the sediment transport capacity of rivers peters kümmerly 1973 morgan 1995 asselman 2000 morehead et al 2003 yang et al 2007 specifically as an indicator of sediment yield in a source region coefficient a can represent an index of erosion severity and mainly reflects the intensity of sediment yield in watersheds where the higher the coefficient the greater the soil loss desilets et al 2007 peters kümmerly 1973 and morgan 1995 suggested that coefficient a denoted as erosion severity is related to the amount of sediment material available for potential erosion zhang et al 2018 in other words in areas rich in strongly weathered materials sediment is easily erodible and transportable and a high coefficient a easily occurs syvitski et al 2000 found that coefficient a is highly linked to climate and watershed slope another important factor that influences this coefficient is the size of a watershed area finally coefficient a varies significantly owing to the influence of natural and human activities wang et al 2008 river erosivity is proportional to flow that can be described by rated index b which represents the amount of sediment transported per unit of increased water flow peters kümmerly 1973 as clarified by asselman 2000 index b represents the erosive power of rivers with high values generally implying that a small increase in river flow leads to a large increase in river erosivity adding to this insight syvitski et al 2000 showed that index b is considerably affected by climate soil erosion and sediment grain size sediment transport in rivers with substantial sand content is stronger than that occurring in rivers with clay content and index b in the former is larger temporal variations in srcs and their potential influencing factors are well documented for example wang et al 2008 reconstructed the changes in sediment transport that have occurred in the yangtze river since 1865 and found that human activities dam construction soil and water conservation projects have significantly affected src parameters in the river on the basis of 40 year daily water discharge and sediment data on the yellow river basin zhang et al 2018 explored changes in srcs and their influencing factors discovering that src parameters are more strongly affected by the watershed areas of loess regions and the slopes of rocky mountainous areas vaughan et al 2017 used srcs to analyze daily discharge data on 36 rivers in minnesota and showed that index b is closely related to river topography and slope and that land use change has a significant influence on srcs under medium and low flow conditions collecting six years worth of data on water discharge and sediment transport in the trask basin of the united states bywater reyes et al 2017 indicated that lithology most strongly influences srcs notwithstanding the insights provided by previous studies however they concentrated primarily on daily or yearly water discharge and sediment transport data few studies have used monthly data to investigate temporal variations in srcs and their influencing factors especially in karst regions where ecologically vulnerable areas experience severe soil erosion karst landforms account for about 7 to 12 of global continental territories and approximately 1 4 of the populations in these regions are completely or partially dependent on karst aquifers for drinking water hartmann et al 2014 they are typified by large surface porosity high infiltration rates well developed underground water systems and runoff coefficients that are considerably lower than those in non karst areas the carbonate widely distributed on the surfaces of karst areas is mostly dissolved by rainwater the dissolution of surface and underground rocks exceeds mechanical erosion to a substantial extent forming karst landforms with unique morphological and hydrological properties ford and williams 2007 gutiérrez et al 2014 in china karst areas span approximately 3 44 million km2 accounting for 36 of the country s total land area jiang et al 2014 among these southwest china is one of the largest continuous karst distribution regions in the world hartmann et al 2014 li et al 2016 its shallow soil covers the highly irregular surface with a high infiltration rate a special geological condition that combined with unfavorable land use has led to serious soil erosion and rock desertification jiang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 moreover given the influence of frequent precipitation extremes dam construction and vegetation restoration in recent years the water sediment relationship in southwest karst areas significantly differs from that in non karst territories an essential task therefore is to clarify the characteristics and driving factors of the water sediment relationship in karst watersheds for soil and water conservation and the sustainable development of water resources in these regions previous studies showed that climate exerts a tremendous direct influence on the parameters of srcs in high altitude areas a rise in temperature can melt ice and snow increase river flow enhance sediment transport capacity and thus lead to src parameters change syvitski et al 2000 syvitski et al 2000 evaluated the factors that influence srcs and found that air temperature is positively related to coefficient a and inversely correlated with index b precipitation is the direct external force of soil erosion gao 2008 and the distribution duration frequency and intensity of rainfall can affect srcs rodríguez blanco et al 2010 sun et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 for example the index b in rivers located in humid areas is generally higher than that of rivers found in arid areas and index b during the wet season is higher than that during the dry season in a single watershed the summer temperature is high and the strong evapotranspiration process reduces river runoff thus playing an important role in src variations juez et al 2021 vegetation is another important influencing factor for src parameters vercruysse et al 2017 sheridan et al 2011 found that after a fire the vegetation coverage rate and index b in australian rivers are markedly reduced additionally climate exerts indirect effects on srcs via its influence on plant growth but such effects are a challenging issue that has yet to be fully resolved in consideration of the above mentioned issues this study was intended 1 to investigate temporal variations in the water sediment relationship in karst watersheds on the basis of srcs and 2 to quantify the direct and indirect effects of climate change and vegetation dynamics on src parameters 2 study site and data 2 1 study area the study area is located in china s xijiang basin 21 36 17 27 00 21 n 102 16 52 113 23 51 e where karst landforms are widely distributed fig 1 the xijiang basin originates in the yunnan guizhou plateau and flows through the provinces of yunnan guizhou guangxi and guangdong with a total length of 2 214 km and a drainage area of about 35 104 km2 the xijiang river is the largest tributary of the pearl river and the fourth largest river in china this region has a subtropical and tropical monsoon climate with an annual temperature of 18 c it has its highest temperature in july and its lowest in january the annual precipitation is 1 470 mm which is unevenly distributed throughout the year with more rain occurring in summer than in winter eighty percent of this precipitation occurs during the rainy season of april to october to explore the influence of climate change and vegetation dynamics on src parameters in karst regions of southwest china we selected six watersheds of the xijiang basin nanpan liujiang yujiang hongshui xunjiang and wuzhou fig 1 2 2 data sources the datasets used in this study included data on monthly water and sediment discharge temperature precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi data series on monthly water and sediment discharge 2003 2017 were collected from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china provided by the ministry of water resources monthly temperature and precipitation data were obtained from the china meteorological data network https data cma cn and monthly pet was calculated on the basis of weather station data mccoll 2020 monthly ndvi and evi data were acquired from the dataset of the global inventory modeling and monitoring study https www nasa gov nex 3 methods for each year during the period 2003 to 2017 srcs were calculated to obtain the coefficient a and index b i e the src parameters of the six karst watersheds then the time series trends of the src parameters were analyzed using the mann kendall m k trend test the effects of climate and vegetation changes on the src parameters were decoupled via partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem 3 1 m k test the m k statistical test which was originally proposed by mann 1945 and later reformulated by kendall 1975 has been extensively used to determine hydroclimatic time series gao et al 2017 the m k test does not require data to be normally distributed and individual outliers do not affect the analysis results it is a non parametric method that features easy calculation in this study the m k test was employed to determine the trend of the src parameters in the selected watersheds from 2003 to 2017 the specific procedures implemented are as follows the assumed h0 time series x1 x2 xn are n independent samples equally distributed with random variables and the alternative hypothesis is that h1 is a two sided test xk and xj differ for all k j n and k j the test statistic s is defined thus 4 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x k in which 5 sgn x j x k 1 x j x k 0 0 x j x k 0 1 x j x k 0 6 v ar s n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 q

is the number of data values in the pth group for a given confidence level α if statistic z z 1 α 2 the original hypothesis is unacceptable and there is a significant upward or downward trend in the time series data at a given confidence level for statistic z the upward trend is 0 and the downward trend is 0 when z is greater than or equal to 1 96 it has passed significant tests with confidence levels of 95 3 2 pls sem pls sem is a causal modeling approach that combines the features of principal component analysis and multiple linear regression it can explore the relationships and critical paths between variables shi et al 2014 thus potentially explaining variances r2 value in a dependent structure to the maximum extent this method has been widely used because of its fewer restrictions on data and simple use of structure hair et al 2011 a partial least squares structural equation model is composed mainly of two parts a measurement model external model which describes the unidirectional predictive relationship between each latent construct and associated observed indicators and a structural model internal model which describes the relationship between the latent variables and explicit variables hair et al 2011 the parameter estimation method in pls sem is divided into two steps first the estimated value of a latent variable is obtained through repeated iteration second the partial least squares method is used to perform linear regression and the parameter estimates of the structural and measurement models are obtained if there are k latent variables then there are k groups of explicit variables and each group contains m variables in these conditions each group of explicit variables can be expressed as 8 x i x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x im i 1 2 3 k it is assumed that there is a linear combination between latent variables and between latent and explicit variables each explicit variable is associated with a unique latent variable accordingly the equation of the measurement model is 9 xij λ i j ξ i σ i j the equation of the structural model is 10 ξ i i j β i j ξ j ε i where ξi is a standardized latent variable λij denotes the factor load βij represents the path coefficient and σij and εi are error correction terms which are unrelated to the prediction variable and have a mean value of 0 we hypothesized that climate factors not only directly affect srcs but also indirectly affect them via their influence on vegetation growth coefficient a represents an index of erosion severity and index b refers to the sediment transport capacity of rivers a conceptual model was constructed to test the hypothesized paths of climate change and vegetation dynamics on the src parameters on the basis of information derived from the literature 1 the distribution intensity frequency and duration of precipitation directly affect the sediment transport capacity of rivers rodríguez blanco et al 2010 sun et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 2 increasing air temperature substantially influences water discharge thereby influencing sediment load syvitski et al 2000 3 different temperature and precipitation conditions can affect plant types and growth forms thus influencing vegetation coverage pruski and nearing 2002 nearing et al 2005 4 changes in pet can affect changes in water availability in soil thus influencing river runoff and vegetation growth burns et al 2007 5 a high vegetation coverage presents considerable potential to enhance soil structure and reduce soil erosion vercruysse et al 2017 4 results 4 1 characteristics of monthly discharge and sediment the statistical characteristics of monthly water discharge sediment concentration and sediment load from 2003 to 2017 in the six karst watersheds are shown in table 1 the mean water discharge sediment concentration and sediment load ranged considerably from 2 108 to 162 108 m3 18 to 602 g m3 and 63 to 509 kg s respectively according to the classification proposed by nielsen and bouma 1985 water discharge exhibited moderate variability except in the liujiang watershed whereas sediment concentration and sediment load both showed high variability with the hongshui watershed exhibiting the strongest levels interestingly the coefficients of variation cvs of sediment load were higher than those of sediment concentration the temporal changes in water discharge sediment concentration and sediment load in the six watersheds are illustrated in fig 2 monthly sediment load and sediment concentration fluctuated considerably over time temporal variations in sediment load and sediment concentration were greater than those in water discharge consistent with their corresponding cvs table 1 generally monthly water discharge and sediment concentration showed single peak curves each year but the peak values differed considerably across different years 4 2 srcs table 2 shows the parameters and the determination of the coefficients r2 of the srcs in each watershed the mean r2 value of the relationship between water and sediment concentration ranged from 0 41 to 0 65 which was significantly lower than the corresponding values of 0 76 to 0 87 for the association between water and sediment load fig 3 the values of coefficient a and index b varied tremendously across the watersheds table 2 the mean values of coefficient a ranged from 0 03 to 28 98 with the nanpan watershed showing the highest value the mean values of index b ranged from 1 67 to 2 28 with the highest value observed in the hongshui watershed index b varied relatively slightly whereas coefficient a varied substantially to several orders of magnitude fig 4 shows the interannual variations in the src parameters the coefficient a of the nanpan watershed reached maximum values in 2014 and 2015 the annual sediment load of this watershed in 2014 was 22 higher than the mean value while its annual runoff was 27 lower than the mean value the nanpan river transported 99 of the annual sediment load from june to november 2014 resulting in a sharp increase in coefficient a in the liujiang watershed the maximum coefficient a occurred in 2013 since a large amount of sediment load was transported in a short period of time interestingly with a major flood in 2005 the coefficient a of yujiang hongshui xunjiang and wuzhou showed peak values there was a close relationship between coefficient a and index b fig 5 coefficient a significantly decreased as a power function of index b under a coefficient of determination ranging from 0 90 to 0 98 to better evaluate the interannual variations in the src parameters the results of the m k trend test were used as reference table 3 in most cases the src parameters exhibited no significant change trend p 0 05 coefficient a showed an upward trend in the nanpan p 0 05 and liujiang watersheds p 0 05 and a decreasing trend in the yujiang p 0 05 hongshui p 0 05 xunjiang p 0 05 and wuzhou p 0 05 watersheds in terms of index b a decreasing trend was observed in the nanpan p 0 05 liujiang p 0 05 and yujiang p 0 05 watersheds whereas a non significant increasing trend was found in the hongshui and xunjiang watersheds p 0 05 4 3 decoupling the influence of climate and vegetation on src parameters before performing the pls sem the coefficients of correlation between the src parameters and temperature precipitation pet ndvi and evi were evaluated fig 6 the correlation coefficients markedly varied among the six watersheds no significant correlation was found between temperature and the src parameters of all six watersheds p 0 05 but precipitation was significantly correlated with both parameters in nanpan p 0 01 and index b in hongshui p 0 05 pet was significantly correlated with coefficient a in the yujiang watershed and index b in the nanpan and liujiang watersheds p 0 05 ndvi was significantly correlated with coefficient a and index b in the xunjiang and nanpan watersheds respectively p 0 05 evi was significantly correlated only with index b in the nanpan watershed p 0 01 to decouple the effects of climate and vegetation factors on the src parameters the results of the pls sem were used as basis fig 7 climatic factors explained 31 to 57 of vegetation dynamics and climatic and vegetation factors explained 18 to 43 and 8 to 57 of the variations in coefficient a and index b respectively in pls sem the path coefficient β is equivalent to the standardized regression coefficient which can reflect the intensity and direction between predictors and variables huang et al 2019 in this study climate had a significant direct influence on vegetation β 0 56 0 76 p 0 05 but generally had no significant effect on parameter a or b p 0 05 vegetation had a significant negative effect only on coefficient a in the xunjiang watershed β 0 74 p 0 05 and exerted a significant positive influence on index b in the yujiang watershed β 0 75 p 0 05 table 4 presents the correlations among all the variables in the pls sem which were divided into direct indirect and total effects except in the liujiang and yujiang watersheds climate change had a direct positive impact on a with an impact range of 0 26 to 0 76 vegetation in the watersheds except liujiang had a negative impact range of 0 74 to 0 1 climate exerted an indirect negative influence on a through its effects on vegetation for all except liujiang watershed with the extent of influence ranging from 0 46 to 0 06 except in the hongshui watershed climate posed a direct negative influence on b with the effect ranging from 0 64 to 0 2 except in nanpan and liujiang vegetative influence on b ranged from 0 13 to 0 75 and climate indirectly and positively affected b via vegetation with the effects ranging from 0 09 to 0 53 except nanpan and liujiang in most of the watersheds the indirect effects of climate through vegetation on a were greater than the direct effects of climate and the direct effects of climate on b were greater than its indirect effects in terms of total effects changes in vegetation had the greatest impact on coefficient a except in the nanpan and yujiang watersheds climate change had a negative impact on coefficient a vegetation dynamics also had a negative impact on coefficient a finally with respect to index b climate change had a negative influence and vegetation dynamics had a positive influence 5 discussion we analyzed temporal variations in the src parameters of six karst watersheds from 2003 to 2017 and investigated whether climate and vegetation influenced the parameters to an extensive degree coefficient a decreased in four of the six watersheds which may be related to the reduction in sediment load in these sites generally the upper reaches of the rivers in these locations tend to have low a values and high b values because of the tremendous stream power generated by high gradients high flow rates and deep channels lower reaches with wide river surfaces slow flow velocity and weak sediment carrying capacity have high a values and low b values asselman 1999 2000 yang et al 2007 in this study the high b value appeared in hongshui and nanpan watershed with high altitude while the low value appeared in yujiang watershed with relatively gentle terrain interestingly the mean value of coefficient a gradually decreased with increasing watershed area which may be ascribed to the gentle slope of large watershed areas and the easier deposition of sediment in these locations furthermore relatively wide valleys have well developed floodplains which protect non alluvial river banks from bank erosion and reduce the intensity of sediment remigration as a result these areas are not sand producing sites thus diminishing sediment sources walling 1983 syvitski 2003 de vente et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2019 2020 with low coefficient a compared with large watersheds small watersheds have steeper slopes and less vegetation rich sediment sources and few opportunities for sediment deposition thus sediment is more likely to be carried away by running water lu et al 2005 griffiths et al 2006 de vente et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 li et al 2020 generating a higher coefficient a in a similar vein reid and frostick 1987 found that the coefficient a and index b of arid rivers range from 100 to 80 000 and 0 2 to 0 7 respectively whereas corresponding values in humid rivers range from 0 004 to 40 and 1 4 and 2 5 respectively syvitski et al 2000 wang et al 2008 as reflected in fig 5 the nanpan watershed had a high coefficient and a low inedx which may be related to the characteristics of the watershed that is because it is small nanpan has a stronger sediment transport mechanism a steeper surface slope and less vegetation resulting in higher erosion and richer sediment sources than those found in the other five watersheds morehead et al 2003 zhang et al 2019 we compared the src parameters of the six watersheds explored in this work with those of other watersheds in china on a monthly scale for the period 2003 to 2017 as can be seen in fig 8 the coefficient a of the rivers in the current study area significantly differed from that of the yellow river huai river and the northeast and northwest rivers in china p 0 05 in karst areas surface carbonate is widely distributed and the soil layer is shallow although southwest china is a humid region its coefficient a is generally low however loess vegetation coverage in the yellow river is relatively low with abundant erodible materials and heavy rains occur more frequently in summer this frequent high intensity precipitation can considerably erode soil resulting in a high coefficient a in the yellow river rustomji et al 2008 gao et al 2018 similarly the climate in northwest china is dry with the landform developing due to yardang wind erosion being widespread this landform has low vegetation coverage and loose soil layers resulting in an abundance of erodible materials and therefore a high coefficient a overall the upper reaches of the huai river are plagued by the severe soil erosion caused by deforestation and reclamation and the high coefficient a in the river is caused by heavy rains and mountain floods in the upper reaches of some river watersheds in northeast china coefficient a is high because intense reclamation for agriculture has generally caused high erodibility interestingly the yellow river huai river and the northeast and northwest rivers located in the semi humid semi arid and arid areas of china have significantly greater a values than those of the karst areas whereas the coefficient a of the yangtze river and southeast rivers in humid areas is non significantly different from those of karst areas p 0 05 in terms of index b no significant difference was found between the study area and the yangtze river and yellow river p 0 05 but significant differences were found between the study area and the huai river northeast rivers southeast rivers and northwest rivers p 0 05 compared with precipitation and sediment carrying capacity in humid areas those in other areas decreased resulting in a low index b no significant difference in index b was found between the examined karst areas and the yellow river p 0 05 this result may have been driven by the fact that most of the sediment erosion in the yellow river occurred during several major storms in which transport capacity was strong rustomji et al 2008 however the low b value of rivers in southeast humid regions may be due to high vegetation coverage and the presence of viscous red soil in southeast hilly regions resulting in a low index b for the pls sem results it is important to note that climate and vegetation factors generally had no significant influence on the src parameters the unique lithology and human activities in the area such as dam construction may have driven this non significant influence lithology typically has a considerable influence on sediment generation de vente et al 2011 shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 in the karst areas of southwest china hydrogeological conditions are complicated by fissures fractures and the network of solution conduits embedded in karst aquifers hartmann et al 2014 martin et al 2016 rainfall rapidly seeps into groundwater systems through carbonate fractures and fissures and only 5 is transported to rivers as surface runoff peng and wang 2012 fu et al 2015 li et al 2018 eroded soil normally fills karst sinkholes and blocks the drainage outlets of karst depression jiang et al 2014 many eroded sediments are deposited before they are transported to rivers and part of the sediments are transported by rivers causing low soil loss and accumulating less soil that can be easily eroded li et al 2017 in non karst areas precipitation and vegetation generally have a direct significant influence on sediment transport and thus src parameters accordingly the special lithology and sediment transport mechanisms in karst areas weaken the influence of climate and vegetation on src parameters human activities such as dam construction extensively affect river sediment transport yang et al 2006 wang et al 2008 water is discharged annually into a reservoir in stages in most cases hence dam construction exerts little impact on runoff in karst regions dai et al 2008 unlike runoff eroded sediment is easily deposited especially after dam construction wu et al 2012 under these conditions a significant difference in sediment transport occurs between pre and post dam construction periods but there is no significant difference in runoff wu et al 2012 li et al 2016 the construction of reservoirs and dams intercepts large amounts of sediment and reduces sediment supply in source regions thus diminishing coefficient a although no significant difference in runoff was found because of the retention of sediment in reservoirs sediment concentration in the river decreased leading to the enhancement of river erosion the scouring of the river and an increase in index b wang et al 2008 li et al 2016 this is consistent with the work of wang et al 2008 who found a trend of variation in the src parameters of the yangtze river after the completion of the three gorges dam in karst and non karst areas the magnitude of the effects of dams on sediment reduction differs in some rivers with high sediment discharge the effectiveness of dams in reducing sediment decreases over time wang et al 2016 for example in the yellow river watershed where sediment transport is high a large amount of eroded sediment has been deposited in the reservoir area the storage capacity of dams has become saturated furthermore many dams have gradually failed or even been damaged by frequent floods as a result dam storage capacity has gradually decreased since the 1980s with this phenomenon having relatively little impact on sediment discharge wang et al 2011 2016 liang et al 2015 by contrast sediment accumulation owing to dams in karst areas is lower and dams still play a leading role in reducing sediment in the short term li et al 2016 li et al 2018 evaluated changes in sediment transport in karst watersheds and found that in the hongshui watershed such transport sharply declines after the construction of a dam due to the sharp decrease of sediment transport the coefficient a of the hongshui watershed shows a significant decrease trend p 0 05 while the increase of the erosive power of the river leads to a increase trend of index b table 3 in the liujiang watershed vegetation decreases and soil erosion increases because of human activities such as massive logging or agricultural reclamation the coefficient a of the liujiang watershed increased p 0 05 whereas its index b showed a downward trend table 3 therefore similar to lithology dam construction can reduce the influence of climate change and vegetation dynamics on the parameters of srcs in karst areas further studies are required to quantify the effects of lithology and dam construction on src parameters in karst watersheds 6 conclusion in this study we calculated the 2003 to 2017 srcs of six karst watersheds in southwest china and quantified the relative importance of climate and vegetation factors in src parameters via pls sem the results indicated that coefficient a exhibited a decreasing trend in four of the karst watersheds and index b showed a decreasing trend in three of the karst watersheds the coefficient a of karst watersheds is lower than that of non karst regions such as the yellow river basin while the index b of karst watersheds is greater than that of most non karst regions such as the huai river basin the pls sem results reflected that the combined effects of climate and vegetation explained 18 to 43 of the variations in coefficient a and 8 to 57 of the variations in index b climate not only directly affected the src parameters but also indirectly affected them through its influence on vegetation vegetation was negatively correlated with coefficient a and positively correlated with index b the direct effect of climate on coefficient a was less than its indirect effect but in most cases there was no significant relationship among climate vegetation factors and the src parameters this result is attributed to the fact that the special hydrogeological conditions and dam construction in the study sites made sediment transport more complicated thereby weakening the influence of climate and vegetation on the src parameters further studies using pls sem are necessary to consider the influence of lithology and dam construction on src parameters in different climate zones credit authorship contribution statement

2991,there now exists clear evidence of the impact of climate change on flooding creating need for new methodologies for design flood estimation that account for warming induced nonstationarity current alternatives for nonstationary flood frequency analysis require the specification of a nonstationary probability model often with time varying parameters that requires sufficient data to be stable reliance on the trend in observed data often ignores the dissimilar behaviour of frequent and rare quantiles under a warming climate this in turn results in the direction of change to be consistent across both rare and frequent projected flood quantiles however results of multiple recent studies suggest that rarer floods are likely to increase while more frequent floods may decrease in magnitude into the future in this study we highlight this limitation of existing nonstationary flood frequency approaches and propose a novel nonstationary regional flood frequency analysis approach that captures the differing behaviour of more frequent and rare flood quantiles under a warming climate the need for longer flood data to model nonstationarity is accommodated by pooling regional information which makes the projections more precise data for 105 australian catchments are used to validate our proposed approach results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing the variation of flood quantiles with varying average recurrence intervals in a changing climate finally a few important statistics of future projections are also presented keywords regional flood frequency analysis climate change nonstationarity design flood data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction flood frequency analysis ffa is an essential tool for water resource management hydraulic infrastructure design and risk assessment ever since the pioneering work by hurst 1957 ffa techniques have experienced considerable attention in hydrological research with representative examples meticulously documented in multiple articles and textbooks bobée and rasmussen 1995 hamed and rao 2019 stedinger 1993 stedinger and cohn 1986 conventionally the core competence of ffa lies in estimating the magnitude of rare flood events with a corresponding frequency of occurrence i e return period which has traditionally been performed by fitting a suitable probability distribution to observed extremes e g annual maximum streamflow ams series or peak streamflow over a specified threshold traditional ffa approaches critically follow the assumption that the observed streamflow extremes are independent identically distributed and consequently stationary and therefore their key summary descriptors including moments or l moments are stationary over time however rapid industrialisation and increased human activities over the past century have led to elevated levels of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions pall et al 2011 satterthwaite 2008 2009 all these factors have contributed to climate change and the ensuing intensification of hydrologic and meteorologic processes ipcc 2013 with new records of climate extremes being witnessed almost every year it is now apparent that the traditional approaches that assume stationarity are no longer valid at least for projecting predicting climate extremes into the future in this context detecting nonstationary trends and modelling nonstationarity in hydroclimatic extremes has become a hot topic and has received a great deal of attention in recent years a few examples include those relating to precipitation extremes alexander et al 2006 donat et al 2013 groisman et al 2005 min et al 2011 o gorman and schneider 2009 wentz et al 2007 westra et al 2013 droughts dai 2013 dai 2011 naumann et al 2018 trenberth et al 2014 zarch et al 2015 and flood magnitudes blöschl et al 2017 do et al 2017 hall et al 2014 ishak et al 2013 knox 1993 mccabe and wolock 2002 mirza 2002 the detection and adoption of nonstationary trends in hydroclimatic data has raised questions on the use of conventional stationary ffa approaches and shifted attention to alternatives that model nonstationarity in ffa nffa echoing the proclamation by milly et al 2008 that stationary is dead and should no longer serve as a central default assumption in water resource risk management and planning a wide variety of literature and myriad approaches have emerged under the umbrella of nffa techniques these approaches follow different assumptions and sophisticated statistical rationales including but not limited to the adoption of projections from atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms gilroy and mccuen 2012 hirabayashi et al 2013 li et al 2019 considering time varying covariate moments for distributions aghakouchak et al 2012 el adlouni et al 2007 menéndez and woodworth 2010 salas and obeysekera 2014 applying bayesian based frameworks bracken et al 2018 kwon et al 2008 ouarda and el adlouni 2011 as well as their combinations and related methods cunderlik and ouarda 2006 o brien and burn 2014 serago and vogel 2018 the fundamental principles state of art techniques and the history of evolution of nffa development are well summarized in several outstanding review articles for example bayazit 2015 hall et al 2014 khaliq et al 2006 salas et al 2018 interestingly on the other hand opposition to the statement that stationary is dead has gained attention as well exemplified by a series of publications for instance stationarity wanted dead or alive lins and cohn 2011 comment on the announced death of stationarity matalas 2012 stationarity is immortal montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 and stationarity is undead uncertainty dominates the distribution of extremes serinaldi and kilsby 2015 among others the reason behind this disagreement could be the elusive evidence and considerable uncertainty associated with our current knowledge and ability in detecting attributing and modelling observed flood trends due to limited data availability archfield et al 2016 blöschl et al 2017 do et al 2017 hall et al 2014 mccabe and wolock 2002 sharma et al 2018 and the fact that such uncertainty would undoubtedly be amplified when projecting into the future hirabayashi et al 2013 madsen et al 2014 for example petrow and merz 2009 analysed recent studies on flood trends in observational streamflow records and concluded that opposite flood magnitude trends could be observed even within a same region a phenomenon that could be more confusing when record length is short koutsoyiannis 2011 advocated that the current detected changes in hydroclimatic processes are not synonymous with nonstationarity and such changes whether large or small can be described satisfactorily by a stochastic approach assuming stationarity while there is no consensus on whether nffa is necessary it is worth mentioning that precipitation extremes exhibit a clearer pattern of nonstationarity in line with the clausius clapeyron relationship trenberth 2011 trenberth et al 2003 this pattern is replicated also in aogcm simulations of the future it is interesting to note that such a pattern however is not reflected universally in flood extremes as catchments are subject to increased rates of drying which counter the increase in precipitation depending on the extremeness of the event being modelled plus the complex land use changes which is affected by both agricultural practice and climate variability and changes in a recent study titled if precipitation extremes are increasing why aren t floods sharma et al 2018 the authors argued that the rate of increase in precipitation extremes should not and does not match that of flood extremes not all extreme precipitation events eventually result in extreme discharge ivancic and shaw 2015 and different flood percentiles present different conceptualized sensitivity to changes in temperature wasko and sharma 2017 this forms the motivation of the present study wherein we propose an empirical alternative in regional flood frequency analysis rffa within a nonlinear dynamical system framework that recognises the differing pattern of changes one expects in frequent versus rare flood quantiles while the empirical nature of rffa enables a clearer reflection of the observed patterns of changes in the flood peaks an added advantage is the use of available regional flood information which increases the data availability that allows formulating a more complex nonstationary flood model the long records of annual maximum flood time series from australia are used to test the efficacy of the nonstationary rffa approach proposed the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief review of existing nffa approaches this is followed by our proposed methodology the flood dataset used and key results obtained section 4 presents the estimates of changes in flood quantiles in year 2100 finally discussion and conclusion are presented in section 5 2 existing alternatives for nffa due to the growing evidence of the impacts of the warming climate on hydroclimatic extremes e g heavy precipitation droughts and floods the importance of nonstationary design frameworks for modern risk assessment has been highlighted by many prominent hydrologists worldwide the inclination towards nffa though controversial cannot be ignored nevertheless there is no consensus on selecting the most appropriate model for nffa under changing climatic conditions in this section we review the two most widely adopted nffa approaches and highlight the limitations associated while fitting the conventional extreme value distributions at present a common approach to estimate flood quantiles under a future climate is to consider aogcm or downscaling model outputs dsms examples of such applications can be found in dankers and feyen 2008 gilroy and mccuen 2012 hirabayashi et al 2008 hirabayashi et al 2013 lehner et al 2006 and milly et al 2002 the core concept behind this method relies on first calibrating the parameters of hydrologic models e g rainfall runoff and river routing model using historical observations and thereafter running them using the downscaled projections from aogcms or dsms in this way the river discharges for future periods can be simulated for different aogsms representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios and a probabilistic approach i e fitting extreme distribution function applied to carry out flood frequency analysis even though this nffa approach exhibits superiority in simplicity and efficiency as well as its flexibility in local regional continental and global scales the major concern associated with it is the inconsistency between different aogcms hirabayashi et al 2013 according to hirabayashi et al 2013 the use of single aogcm to predict future flood frequency could lead to a great source of uncertainty and a region may represent opposite trend of floods under a future climate by considering different aogcm projections although a possible alleviation is the use of multiple aogcms it comes at the cost of the simplicity and efficiency to the approach in addition it brings additional uncertainties that are embodied in different aogcms such as different assumptions calibration procedures and downscaling techniques etc another way to consider nonstationarity in conventional ffa models is to adjust their parameters based on climatic covariates normally this nffa technique comprises fitting appropriate extreme value distribution functions and modifying the corresponding parameters as function of one or several explanatory variables in most of the applications to capture the nonstationarity of observed datasets these explanatory variables are selected to be related to drivers of nonstationary behaviour usually the considered explanatory variables are time temperature visser et al 2020 atmospheric moisture roderick et al 2019 2020 and climate oscillation indices such as the southern oscillation index soi pacific decadal oscillation pdo atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and mediterranean oscillation index moi among others leclerc and ouarda 2007 o brien and burn 2014 pui et al 2011 pui et al 2012 serago and vogel 2018 strupczewski et al 2001 villarini et al 2009 this nffa concept has received extensive attention among the hydrological research community due to its flexibility in the selection of explanatory variables and the adoption of covariates that make physical sense change with time and are related to the drivers of nonstationary to some extent it is noteworthy that the essential step associated with aforementioned approaches is to fit a predefined probability density function pdf to the extracted extreme values i e ams as the tail behaviour of the distribution is of interest to flood design generally a three parameter pdf defined by location scale and shape parameters is fitted to the observed flood data under the nffa framework explanatory variables are used to modify the pdf parameters to allow capturing the trend of changes in the future flood quantiles while there exist a wide set of candidate pdfs to describe the behaviour of flood data the selection of a pdf becomes secondary in nffa as the main challenge resides in characterising the nonstationarity in the parameters of the selected pdf in a typical nffa method the selected pdf type and shape parameter generally remain constant while the location and scale parameters in some cases only location parameters vary with covariates however a recent study by ouarda and charron 2019 advocated that more efforts should be devoted to finding out the necessity of changing distributions and shape parameter in nonstationary analyses the results of a typical nffa method can be classified into four different trend categories fig 1 in case of a synthetic generalized extreme value gev distribution these can be summarized as 1 type i both frequent and rare flood magnitudes are increasing under warming climate 2 type ii both frequent and rare flood magnitudes are decreasing under warming climate 3 type iii frequent flood magnitudes are decreasing while rare flood magnitudes are increasing under warming climate 4 type iv frequent flood magnitudes are increasing while rare flood magnitudes are decreasing under warming climate it is important to highlight that the flood regime under a future warmer climate mainly depends on how rare the extreme event is the rate at which precipitation increases and projected antecedent wetness conditions e g the antecedent wetness of catchment before precipitation extremes wasko et al 2020 wasko et al 2019 westra et al 2013 he et al 2022 according to the mechanism discussed by sharma et al 2018 precipitation extremes do not always translate to flooding events as a fraction of precipitation contributes to increasing soil moisture storage or evapotranspiration loss with only the remaining fraction eventually contributing to the formulation of streamflow theoretically frequent floods e g floods with return periods of 2 and 5 years are more likely to be dominated by both catchment antecedent wetness condition and precipitation intensity however the extreme precipitation intensity is more likely to lead to the saturated condition in a catchment regardless of the catchment antecedent wetness condition less time for precipitation to infiltrate into the ground with the subsequent precipitation contributing to rarer floods e g with return periods exceeding 50 years sharma et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017 wasko et al 2019 under a future warming climate with the rising temperature the interaction of increasing precipitation extremes under drier catchment conditions due to increased evaporation will result in dissimilar catchment response to the floods of different return periods therefore with temperature increase the rarest flood events are expected to increase due to the increase in precipitation extremes while less extreme flood events particularly for large catchments are likely to decrease overall due to the increase in dryness do et al 2017 knox 2000 milly et al 2002 wasko and sharma 2017 in the context of fig 1 this equates to type iii being the most likely scenario for flood magnitudes in the future however if the nffa approach only considers the location parameters to be varying and keeps the scale and shape parameters unchanged only the uniform increasing decreasing trends i e type i and type ii can be achieved for the flood events of differing magnitude frequencies under future climate conditions the fact that flood events with different rarity i e different return periods may have inconsistent sensitivity to climate change type iii and type iv is therefore neglected by the fitting of such a nonstationary model for example let us consider a typical example of nffa using the gev distribution where the location parameter µ varies linearly with time t such as μ t μ 0 a t where a is a constant calibrated using the observed data sets while the shape parameter ξ and scale parameter σ are kept fixed then the quantile function for the nonstationary gev distribution can be explicitly expressed by the following equation 1 q p μ t σ ξ μ t σ l o g l o g p f o r ξ 0 a n d p 0 1 μ t σ ξ l o g p ξ 1 f o r ξ 0 a n d p 0 1 o r ξ 0 a n d p 0 1 as can be seen projections of flood quantiles under this nonstationary model are monotonic and the trends of quantiles are uniform regardless of different return periods i e 1 p therefore as the statistical properties i e mean and standard deviation of observed ams data are coupled the simple assumption of a constant scale parameter for nonstationary gev distribution may not hold true salas et al 2018 in fact most of existing nffa approaches only focus on changes to rare flood events e g flood with return period of 50 or 100 years and pay less attention to frequent flood events e g flood with return period of 2 or 5 years as these are of a lower concern from a design perspective in these approaches the initial analysis is based on the identification of observed runoff trends therefore the location and scale parameters of selected pdf are elaborately calibrated by explanatory variables to model the defined future flood trends i e either increasing or decreasing type i or type ii most importantly to explicitly determine the flood trend so that the varying parameters can be trained to develop the nffa approach like any other statistical approach the key prerequisite is the availability of long records of at site runoff which has been a long concerned limitation in the analysis of both ffa and even more so for nffa to mitigate the aforesaid issue a flood quantile regression model rooted in the framework of regional flood frequency analysis rffa has been adopted in the present study rffa is one of the most important and commonly utilized tools to estimate design floods in an ungauged catchment at the core of which is the idea of transferring available flood information from hydrologically similar gauged catchments to the target catchment thereby alleviating the limitation of insufficient no data availability at the target catchment rffa comprises of two major steps i e the delineation of homogeneous neighbours and the development of a regional flood estimation model burn 1990 haddad and rahman 2012 hosking and wallis 1993 micevski and kuczera 2009 ouarda 2016 under the rffa framework that is based on quantile regression models e g perez et al 2019 individual flood quantiles are estimated by respective regression models thus assuring the ability to capture all potential flood trend categories i e type i ii iii and iv including the differing patterns of changes in different flood quantiles more specifically the flexibility of formulating varying regression model structures and selecting appropriate explanatory variables for different flood quantiles offered by the approach creates the basis of the novel approach proposed here 3 proposed method and a case study 3 1 data and study area as mentioned in the previous section accurate flood quantile estimation requires long records of streamflow compared with other hydrologic variables such as precipitation the streamflow datasets are of shorter length and poorer quality both spatially and temporally this insufficient data length can result in large estimation errors especially for the estimation of rarer flood events in ffa due to the large uncertainties associated with the tail behaviour of fitted pdfs based on this consideration australian catchments with data length more than 50 years are considered in this study a data set of 105 catchments across the states of queensland qld new south wales nsw and victoria vic in australia is selected fig 2 shows the locations of these 105 catchments these catchments are unregulated and comparatively smaller in size with areas ranging from 101 to 1 002 km2 and averaged at 405 km2 the daily streamflow measurements are sourced from the australian government bureau of meteorology bom the corresponding ams series of these 105 catchments is extracted gap filled checked for outliers and impacts of rating curve error on the flood quantiles following the procedure of haddad et al 2010 the missing data in filling procedure involves comparison of the monthly instantaneous maximum im data with monthly maximum mean daily mmd data at the same station for years with data gaps and using a simple linear regression of the annual mmd flow series against the annual im series of the same stations the detail method description can be found at haddad et al 2010 in order to consider similar climate conditions in time across all catchments the temporal coverage is kept fixed at 50 years from 1969 to 2018 in the analysis a summary of a few important catchment physiographic and hydrometeorologic characteristics such as catchment area latitude and longitude slope of mainstream annual average rainfall annual average potential evapotranspiration stream density are presented in table 1 the potential evapotranspiration and rainfall data used to derive catchment annual average potential evapotranspiration annual average rainfall and rainfall intensities was obtained from bom website 3 2 at site flood quantile trends at site flood quantiles are estimated to test the viability of our proposed nffa approach conventionally the estimation of upper quantiles of ams and the assessment of the trend depends on the selection of an appropriate probability model however even under the stationary conditions the choice of the best fitted probability model is uncertain and can even become worse given the nonstationarity exhibited by the ams data as our aim is to calculate the flood quantiles in a future climate following our earlier discussions fitting a pdf offers reduced flexibility in modelling differing changes in the trends of flood quantiles for different return periods following this we apply the routinely adopted plotting position cunnane 1978 instead the 50 years of ams series is divided into two parts to estimate the changes in the flood quantiles with time the first 25 years i e from 1969 to 1993 and the remaining 25 years i e from 1994 to 2018 owing to data length limitations and the fact that we estimate quantiles empirically we restrict our analysis to flood quantiles with return periods up to 20 years we focus on two return periods with 2 years q2 representing frequent and 20 years q20 representing rarer flood evens the cunnane plotting position cunnane 1978 is then applied to estimate at site flood quantiles 2 pp r 0 4 n 0 2 where pp represents the empirical exceedance probability or plotting position r is the rank of individual observations of ams series arranged in an ascending order and n is the sample size which is 25 years in our analysis the procedure is repeated for all catchments and both time periods based on these estimated at site flood quantiles trends percent differences between first and second halves of the data quantiles are estimated and are categorized into three groups namely a rising trend where flood quantiles increase by over five percent a decreasing trend where flood quantiles decrease by over five percent with remaining catchments falling under a no trend category it may be noted that there is uncertainty in the quantile estimation procedure as the data length is limited however given that the analysis is performed over many catchments and the information is pooled together the results can be considered as reliable and representative fig 3 summarizes all trends for at site flood quantiles these have been ascertained by empirically estimating the q2 and q20 for the first and second half of the 50 year observed ams record and the differences quantified some interesting patterns are noted as can be seen the trends for q2 and q20 show clear regionalised differences in space for q2 almost all catchments in northern queensland have a rising trend red colour symbols while most catchments in victoria show a decreasing trend blue colour symbols in the eastern coastal region and in the southern part of queensland most catchments reveal a decreasing trend with only a few of them showing the rising trend in terms of q20 many catchments reveal the strong opposite trends compared with q2 catchments located in northern queensland southeast queensland southern new south wales northeast new south wales and middle victoria are good examples of this phenomenon as results of fig 3 are based on actual at site observations these can be considered as the ideal benchmark to validate the limitations of current nffa alternatives limited in their representation of varying exceedance extremes and the benefit of our proposed novel nrffa approach uses regional information to mitigate the limitation of at site data length and considers trends of individual flood quantiles in a future setting in isolation 3 3 proposed nonstationary regional flood frequency analysis nrffa framework our novel nrffa approach is based on quantile regression for each flood quantile of interest the major difference between our method and the conventional nffa logic is that we make no assumption about the probability distribution of observed ams and equally importantly reduce the impact of data length limitation by pooling regional information for this purpose we borrow the logic from the classical rffa framework as presented below identification of homogeneous neighbours for the target catchment forms an essential step in rffa it is now widely accepted that a proper delineation of homogeneous neighbours for a target basin can significantly improve the accuracy of estimated flood quantiles ouarda 2016 ouarda et al 2001 we adopt the network based delineation of homogeneous region method developed by han et al 2020 due to its simplicity effectiveness and accuracy based on the constructed network for each catchment the existence of a link between two catchments is determined by their hydrologic similarity all catchments that have a significant link with the target catchment are considered as the homogeneous neighbours the reader is referred to han et al 2020 for further details after the determination of homogeneous neighbours for each catchment the next step is to develop relationships between flood quantiles and catchment characteristics for every return period to accurately represent the flood mechanism and to consider the climate conditions for different flood quantiles in a future climate the selection of exogenous variables representing catchment physiographic and climatic conditions must be performed carefully haddad and rahman 2012 through an extensive and careful selection process stepwise regression approach identified and considered four exogenous variables in their regionalised rffa approach these include catchment area mean annual rainfall mar mean annual potential evapotranspiration mpet and rainfall intensity with a duration of 24 h for the return period being estimated ii the rainfall intensity is achieved based on fitting a gev distribution to the annual maximum daily rainfall time series the subscript i represents the return period which means for more frequent flood quantiles e g with return period of 2 years rainfall intensity with a duration of 24 h and return period of 2 years i e i2 would be considered however for more rare flood quantiles e g with return period of 20 years in this study only rainfall intensity representing more rare rainfall events which is with a duration of 24 h and return period of 20 years i e i20 would be included in equation 3 the adoption of mar and mpet represents the average input and output hydrologic information that influences runoff volume and wetness within the catchment the extreme rainfall information i e rainfall intensity ii modulates flood magnitudes and is likely to change in the changed climatic conditions milly et al 2002 wasko and sharma 2017 the catchment area directly influences the flood magnitude and remains unchanged in the future the adopted flood quantile regression model is described below 3 l o g q i t β 0 β 1 l o g a r e a β 2 l o g mar t β 3 l o g mpet t β 4 l o g i i t where the subscript i represents the considered return periods i e 2 and 20 years for the results presented later and t stands for the observed or future time periods considered it should be noted that like any model the regression model used here provides an estimate of the so called true value therefore the the estimate quantile is likely to contain an error in equation 3 mar mpet and ii represent time varying variables and all are directly impacted by climate change generally in most evidenced cases rising temperature will lead to higher mpet and a changed mar for a catchment wasko et al 2018 wasko et al 2019 similarly the extreme rainfall is expected to increase according to the clausius clapeyron relationship trenberth 2011 trenberth et al 2003 once the regression models for the flood quantiles of individual return periods are calibrated using observed data use of future climate variables provides the pathway to derive future flood quantiles this form of the regression model offers the flexibility to calculate flood quantiles in a future climate conditional on the climate covariates without assuming a pdf and modifying associated parameters as is followed in a usual at site nffa approach in the results presented next first the rffa model is applied to both 25 year segments of data separately in a leave one out cross validation setting and thereafter the nrffa model is specified using the first 25 years of the ams series and is applied on the next 25 year record using the climate information of the later period to ascertain q2 and q20 similar to the at site results presented earlier in fig 3 fig 4 shows the rffa results excluding the ams data at the site of interest a so called leave one out cross validation estimate the trend reported in fig 4 are thus based on the difference in the respective quantile q2 or q20 estimated using rffa for each 25 year block in a leave one out cross validation setting notwithstanding a few minor differences between fig 3 and fig 4 there are broad similarities between them including the opposite trend for q2 compared to q20 such similarity would not have been possible to achieve using a traditional nffa alternative as our nrffa method is based on transferring gauged flood information to the target catchment via quantile regression the appropriate flood trends that should be considered for validation are the simulations by leave one out rffa estimation that are rooted in the same regression principle rather than the at site trends that were reported in fig 3 therefore results of fig 4 are subsequently considered as the benchmark i e real trends to validate our proposed nrffa method in the present study 3 4 flood quantile changes using the proposed nrffa approach like any other model the underlying logic behind the proposed nrffa approach is to use the observed data to train regression model parameters i e β0 β1 β2 β3 and β4 and then use the developed model and projected predictors to estimate different flood quantiles for the future in the present study the parameter estimation procedure for equation 3 is followed by a bayesian generalised least square bgls approach as suggested by haddad and rahman 2012 which is currently considered to be the most reliable parameterization approach for australian catchments kuczera and franks 2016 on this basis the variation in the magnitude of selected predictors with time should be reflected in the changes in estimated flood quantiles table 2 describes the trends and variations for these time varying predictors i e mar mpet and ii according to table 2 90 of the 105 catchments show a deceasing trend in mar and 100 of the catchments have a higher mpet value for the later 25 years besides the variation in the magnitude of mar is greater than that for mpet with the average reduction being around 10 for mar while the average increase for mpet is around 3 on the other hand the trend and variation of rainfall intensity estimated empirically based on the plotting positions in equation 2 using long time series of point observed rainfall given the limitations in fitted probability distributions noted before are more dramatic and noisier compared with mar and mpet almost half of the catchments have either increasing or decreasing trends for both rainfall intensities i2 and i20 respectively the magnitude of variation of rainfall intensities is also much larger than mar and mpet as shown in table 2 the regression models for q2 o and q20 o are calibrated separately using the initial 25 years ams data and two sets of model parameters are obtained here subscript o stands for observed data by using the calibrated model and the later 25 years catchment characteristics flood quantiles of q2 t and q20 t together with their trends i e increasing if qt qo with increase more than five percent and decreasing otherwise are simulated a snapshot of the change in flood quantiles using the nrffa framework above is presented in figs 5 and 6 these figures present the increasing top row and decreasing bottom row signs of trends for observed first column and proposed nrffa last column approaches for q2 and q20 respectively plots in fig 5 suggest that the proposed nrffa last column efficiently captures the increasing decreasing trends of the 2 year flood quantile as depicted by the observations first column this figure also includes a contingency table at the bottom about 62 9 i e 66 catchments of the simulated flood quantile trends are aligned with the actual trends while only 10 catchments show opposite trends by the proposed approach similarly fig 6 presents the trends in 20 year flood quantile by both the approaches the proposed approach last column captures the increasing and decreasing trends of observations quite effectively the contingency table at the bottom suggests that around 51 4 of catchments i e 54 catchments predict correct trend and 11 catchments have the opposite trends overall the spatial distribution of increasing decreasing trends is also interesting for example the proposed approach accurately simulates the rising trend of q2 for the catchments located at northern queensland as well as the decreasing trend for the catchments at eastern coastal area and southern new south wales for q20 the rising trend for several clusters of catchments in northern queensland southeast queensland and southern new south wales as well as the decreasing trends at eastern coastal region and southern new south wales can be accurately captured finally fig 7 presents the cases where in comparison to the trend of observations opposite trends are simulated by the proposed nrffa approach in this figure first column presents the results for q2 while last column for q20 with top row showing results for underestimation and bottom for overestimation as we can see only a limited number of catchments show the opposite trend in flood quantiles for both q2 and q20 and there is no spatial clustering noticeable suggesting the outcomes could be a result of sampling variability more so for the extreme quantiles with 25 years of data the 20 year quantile could have larger uncertainty which is also reflected in the results presented here 4 changes in flood extremes in the year 2100 once the proposed approach is validated it is possible to use the complete data length of 50 years to calibrate model parameters and estimate the future flood quantile trends for longer recurrence intervals by adopting the future projected hydrological variables i e mar mpet and ii from climate model simulations the future projections of these variables are available for a wide range of aogcms and a simplified approach is presented here the projections of future precipitation temperature and radiation are derived from the cmip6 access esm1 5 gcm runs ziehn et al 2019 and pet are estimated according to hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1982 the percentage changes in mar and mpet with respect to current climate projections from the same model run is used to estimate the future mar and mpet values among a variety of different shared socioeconomic pathway representative concentration pathway ssp rcp scenarios which represent the index that describe different levels of socioeconomic factors and greenhouse gases emissions that might occur in the future we consider the future emission scenario ssp370 which represents an increasing global warming environment under a moderate increase of co2 emission riahi et al 2017 due to the uncertain and unstable projections of extreme rainfall intensity in the aogcm outputs kim et al 2020a kim et al 2020b we adopt scaling estimates of future rainfall intensities for gauges located within or in vicinity to each of the catchments considered based on evidenced precipitation temperature sensitivities reported in earlier studies visser et al 2020 wasko et al 2018 therefore following the clausius clapeyron relationship the site specific sensitivity along with changes in temperature from the access esm1 5 gcm runs detailed above were used to ascertain future rainfall intensity for both return periods i e 2 and 20 years alexander et al 2019 hettiarachchi et al 2019 using this information and our proposed approach percentage changes in flood quantile estimates for the year 2100 with respect to the observed record are obtained are presented in fig 8 results indicate differences in the trend between frequent q2 and rare floods q20 at the end of the century under a warming climate summarized in table 3 a clearer understanding of the full extent of change in future flood quantiles can be inferred from fig 9 which presents historical plotting positions fitted rffa flood quantiles representing the observed record and the projected future flood quantiles at two representative locations in australia an opposite pattern of changes of q2 and q20 at the two locations is noted it is clear that the pattern of changes reported would have been improperly projected had the classical nffa procedures been used 5 discussion and conclusion the study highlights the non uniform behaviour of flood quantiles of different return periods under a warming climate i e nonstationary conditions the existing nffa approaches assume same directional changes of the flood quantiles of different return periods we recognise and highlight this limitation using synthetic and real datasets and present an alternative based on a nonstationary rffa or nrffa framework that provides an alternative solution to model the differential pattern of flood peaks with different extremes additionally as our approach pools the information from the nearby locations it also helps to address the concern of limited data length the study has highlighted several findings and concerns that are of general interest to the hydrology scientific community we believe that the proposed method though nascent has significant potential and can be further improved by addressing the limitations and concerns the study validates the approach based on split samples of historical observations as such the more extreme flood events such as q50 and q100 are difficult to estimate and validate due to the limitation of available data length although once approach is validated it is possible to use the complete data length to calibrate model parameters and estimate the future flood quantile trends for longer recurrence intervals by adopting the future projected hydrological variables i e mar mpet and ii from climate model simulations the regression model structure adopted in the present study is quite common and accepted in the rffa literature however the comparison of different model structures and the stepwise selection of explanatory predictors can help further refine the model structure adopted a log linear regression model is considered due to its wide acceptance and effectiveness within the framework of rffa nevertheless the impact of climate change on hydrologic process is complex including the direct influences on precipitation and evapotranspiration indirect influences such as groundwater and soil moisture and the complicated interactions between these variables which contribute to a vague understanding and poor estimation ability of future floods in a nonstationary setting we believe a more detailed analysis of the regression model residuals could provide additional valuable information on the model structure such as a non linear model and in achieving better results during the past few decades with better understanding of atmospheric and oceanic mechanisms our knowledge of the large scale climate drivers has also improved significantly an appropriate incorporation of these climate drivers into the nrffa model structure may help improving the results further besides the growing population along with a series of impacts due to the subsequent anthropogenic activities on significant changes and stresses to land use environment and water quality are also major factors affecting flood quantiles in the future therefore the approach may also consider these factors as additional explanatory variables or predictors in the regression model as the approach is based on the concept of regionalisation a few additional considerations are highlighted the approach relies on the identification of homogeneous neighbours to develop the regression model therefore the quantity and quality of identified homogeneous neighbours ultimately determine how much information could be transferred to the target catchment in this present study the availability of a large group of gauged catchments with streamflow observations over 50 years is representative of a comparatively rare situation however in many other countries and regions the gauging streamflow network may be limited by low density and short record length it could influence the accurate application of the approach proposed another consideration is about the homogeneity of the catchments into the future the homogeneity between catchments is determined by both physiographic and hydrologic characteristics we assume that the catchment physiographic attributes such as area slope and others are not likely to change significantly with the warming climate while the hydrological attributes such as mar mpet and others are more sensitive to temperature and climate change however with the developmental activities human interferences and population growth these attributes may evolve and the homogeneity may also change leading to different homogeneous neighbours the number of identified homogeneous neighbours is a key to determine regression model parameters and the flood quantile estimates ignoring this aspect is likely to bring in some uncertainty in the flood quantile estimates finally there is an ongoing debate in the literature whether the design flood is best estimated using the ams or using partial duration series or other alternatives that require continuous flow data while there is considerable merit in each of the alternatives in place the intent of this paper is to present a way of incorporating nonstationarity in regional flood frequency procedures arising from a warming climate we believe the essence of the logic proposed here is extendable to all such alternatives in conclusion we must reiterate that there exists no universally agreed approach for projecting design floods into future the idea of calibrating the statistics of floods based on climate covariates and thereby simulating the future flood attributes by adopting the future climate projections is sensible and appealing however the assumption that future flood attributes obey the same trend as observations or stationarity of the nrffa model proposed poses a big question mark theoretically under the nonstationary condition every single sample we measure could come from a different distribution due to the changing population distribution over time thus fitting a pdf to the observed data could raise issues we believe that while further work needs to focus on formulating better alternatives for nonstationary flood frequency analysis that can simulate the type of changes we have illustrated here the approach proposed here is useable under the assumption that the flood model in equation 3 does not change with time the last and most important concern is about the uncertainties associated with nffa and nrffa there are a wide range of different sources of uncertainties that need to be taken into consideration when estimating future and regional flood quantiles including but not limited to insufficient data length uncertainty of observed streamflow records accuracy the method used to delineate homogeneous neighbours the determination of model parameters the considered prediction intervals to describe the precision of predictions and many other factors that have been discussed elsewhere in the literature the method proposed here is a step forward in creating a better understanding of the flood quantiles behaviour under a future climate credit authorship contribution statement xudong han

2991,there now exists clear evidence of the impact of climate change on flooding creating need for new methodologies for design flood estimation that account for warming induced nonstationarity current alternatives for nonstationary flood frequency analysis require the specification of a nonstationary probability model often with time varying parameters that requires sufficient data to be stable reliance on the trend in observed data often ignores the dissimilar behaviour of frequent and rare quantiles under a warming climate this in turn results in the direction of change to be consistent across both rare and frequent projected flood quantiles however results of multiple recent studies suggest that rarer floods are likely to increase while more frequent floods may decrease in magnitude into the future in this study we highlight this limitation of existing nonstationary flood frequency approaches and propose a novel nonstationary regional flood frequency analysis approach that captures the differing behaviour of more frequent and rare flood quantiles under a warming climate the need for longer flood data to model nonstationarity is accommodated by pooling regional information which makes the projections more precise data for 105 australian catchments are used to validate our proposed approach results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing the variation of flood quantiles with varying average recurrence intervals in a changing climate finally a few important statistics of future projections are also presented keywords regional flood frequency analysis climate change nonstationarity design flood data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction flood frequency analysis ffa is an essential tool for water resource management hydraulic infrastructure design and risk assessment ever since the pioneering work by hurst 1957 ffa techniques have experienced considerable attention in hydrological research with representative examples meticulously documented in multiple articles and textbooks bobée and rasmussen 1995 hamed and rao 2019 stedinger 1993 stedinger and cohn 1986 conventionally the core competence of ffa lies in estimating the magnitude of rare flood events with a corresponding frequency of occurrence i e return period which has traditionally been performed by fitting a suitable probability distribution to observed extremes e g annual maximum streamflow ams series or peak streamflow over a specified threshold traditional ffa approaches critically follow the assumption that the observed streamflow extremes are independent identically distributed and consequently stationary and therefore their key summary descriptors including moments or l moments are stationary over time however rapid industrialisation and increased human activities over the past century have led to elevated levels of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions pall et al 2011 satterthwaite 2008 2009 all these factors have contributed to climate change and the ensuing intensification of hydrologic and meteorologic processes ipcc 2013 with new records of climate extremes being witnessed almost every year it is now apparent that the traditional approaches that assume stationarity are no longer valid at least for projecting predicting climate extremes into the future in this context detecting nonstationary trends and modelling nonstationarity in hydroclimatic extremes has become a hot topic and has received a great deal of attention in recent years a few examples include those relating to precipitation extremes alexander et al 2006 donat et al 2013 groisman et al 2005 min et al 2011 o gorman and schneider 2009 wentz et al 2007 westra et al 2013 droughts dai 2013 dai 2011 naumann et al 2018 trenberth et al 2014 zarch et al 2015 and flood magnitudes blöschl et al 2017 do et al 2017 hall et al 2014 ishak et al 2013 knox 1993 mccabe and wolock 2002 mirza 2002 the detection and adoption of nonstationary trends in hydroclimatic data has raised questions on the use of conventional stationary ffa approaches and shifted attention to alternatives that model nonstationarity in ffa nffa echoing the proclamation by milly et al 2008 that stationary is dead and should no longer serve as a central default assumption in water resource risk management and planning a wide variety of literature and myriad approaches have emerged under the umbrella of nffa techniques these approaches follow different assumptions and sophisticated statistical rationales including but not limited to the adoption of projections from atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms gilroy and mccuen 2012 hirabayashi et al 2013 li et al 2019 considering time varying covariate moments for distributions aghakouchak et al 2012 el adlouni et al 2007 menéndez and woodworth 2010 salas and obeysekera 2014 applying bayesian based frameworks bracken et al 2018 kwon et al 2008 ouarda and el adlouni 2011 as well as their combinations and related methods cunderlik and ouarda 2006 o brien and burn 2014 serago and vogel 2018 the fundamental principles state of art techniques and the history of evolution of nffa development are well summarized in several outstanding review articles for example bayazit 2015 hall et al 2014 khaliq et al 2006 salas et al 2018 interestingly on the other hand opposition to the statement that stationary is dead has gained attention as well exemplified by a series of publications for instance stationarity wanted dead or alive lins and cohn 2011 comment on the announced death of stationarity matalas 2012 stationarity is immortal montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 and stationarity is undead uncertainty dominates the distribution of extremes serinaldi and kilsby 2015 among others the reason behind this disagreement could be the elusive evidence and considerable uncertainty associated with our current knowledge and ability in detecting attributing and modelling observed flood trends due to limited data availability archfield et al 2016 blöschl et al 2017 do et al 2017 hall et al 2014 mccabe and wolock 2002 sharma et al 2018 and the fact that such uncertainty would undoubtedly be amplified when projecting into the future hirabayashi et al 2013 madsen et al 2014 for example petrow and merz 2009 analysed recent studies on flood trends in observational streamflow records and concluded that opposite flood magnitude trends could be observed even within a same region a phenomenon that could be more confusing when record length is short koutsoyiannis 2011 advocated that the current detected changes in hydroclimatic processes are not synonymous with nonstationarity and such changes whether large or small can be described satisfactorily by a stochastic approach assuming stationarity while there is no consensus on whether nffa is necessary it is worth mentioning that precipitation extremes exhibit a clearer pattern of nonstationarity in line with the clausius clapeyron relationship trenberth 2011 trenberth et al 2003 this pattern is replicated also in aogcm simulations of the future it is interesting to note that such a pattern however is not reflected universally in flood extremes as catchments are subject to increased rates of drying which counter the increase in precipitation depending on the extremeness of the event being modelled plus the complex land use changes which is affected by both agricultural practice and climate variability and changes in a recent study titled if precipitation extremes are increasing why aren t floods sharma et al 2018 the authors argued that the rate of increase in precipitation extremes should not and does not match that of flood extremes not all extreme precipitation events eventually result in extreme discharge ivancic and shaw 2015 and different flood percentiles present different conceptualized sensitivity to changes in temperature wasko and sharma 2017 this forms the motivation of the present study wherein we propose an empirical alternative in regional flood frequency analysis rffa within a nonlinear dynamical system framework that recognises the differing pattern of changes one expects in frequent versus rare flood quantiles while the empirical nature of rffa enables a clearer reflection of the observed patterns of changes in the flood peaks an added advantage is the use of available regional flood information which increases the data availability that allows formulating a more complex nonstationary flood model the long records of annual maximum flood time series from australia are used to test the efficacy of the nonstationary rffa approach proposed the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief review of existing nffa approaches this is followed by our proposed methodology the flood dataset used and key results obtained section 4 presents the estimates of changes in flood quantiles in year 2100 finally discussion and conclusion are presented in section 5 2 existing alternatives for nffa due to the growing evidence of the impacts of the warming climate on hydroclimatic extremes e g heavy precipitation droughts and floods the importance of nonstationary design frameworks for modern risk assessment has been highlighted by many prominent hydrologists worldwide the inclination towards nffa though controversial cannot be ignored nevertheless there is no consensus on selecting the most appropriate model for nffa under changing climatic conditions in this section we review the two most widely adopted nffa approaches and highlight the limitations associated while fitting the conventional extreme value distributions at present a common approach to estimate flood quantiles under a future climate is to consider aogcm or downscaling model outputs dsms examples of such applications can be found in dankers and feyen 2008 gilroy and mccuen 2012 hirabayashi et al 2008 hirabayashi et al 2013 lehner et al 2006 and milly et al 2002 the core concept behind this method relies on first calibrating the parameters of hydrologic models e g rainfall runoff and river routing model using historical observations and thereafter running them using the downscaled projections from aogcms or dsms in this way the river discharges for future periods can be simulated for different aogsms representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios and a probabilistic approach i e fitting extreme distribution function applied to carry out flood frequency analysis even though this nffa approach exhibits superiority in simplicity and efficiency as well as its flexibility in local regional continental and global scales the major concern associated with it is the inconsistency between different aogcms hirabayashi et al 2013 according to hirabayashi et al 2013 the use of single aogcm to predict future flood frequency could lead to a great source of uncertainty and a region may represent opposite trend of floods under a future climate by considering different aogcm projections although a possible alleviation is the use of multiple aogcms it comes at the cost of the simplicity and efficiency to the approach in addition it brings additional uncertainties that are embodied in different aogcms such as different assumptions calibration procedures and downscaling techniques etc another way to consider nonstationarity in conventional ffa models is to adjust their parameters based on climatic covariates normally this nffa technique comprises fitting appropriate extreme value distribution functions and modifying the corresponding parameters as function of one or several explanatory variables in most of the applications to capture the nonstationarity of observed datasets these explanatory variables are selected to be related to drivers of nonstationary behaviour usually the considered explanatory variables are time temperature visser et al 2020 atmospheric moisture roderick et al 2019 2020 and climate oscillation indices such as the southern oscillation index soi pacific decadal oscillation pdo atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and mediterranean oscillation index moi among others leclerc and ouarda 2007 o brien and burn 2014 pui et al 2011 pui et al 2012 serago and vogel 2018 strupczewski et al 2001 villarini et al 2009 this nffa concept has received extensive attention among the hydrological research community due to its flexibility in the selection of explanatory variables and the adoption of covariates that make physical sense change with time and are related to the drivers of nonstationary to some extent it is noteworthy that the essential step associated with aforementioned approaches is to fit a predefined probability density function pdf to the extracted extreme values i e ams as the tail behaviour of the distribution is of interest to flood design generally a three parameter pdf defined by location scale and shape parameters is fitted to the observed flood data under the nffa framework explanatory variables are used to modify the pdf parameters to allow capturing the trend of changes in the future flood quantiles while there exist a wide set of candidate pdfs to describe the behaviour of flood data the selection of a pdf becomes secondary in nffa as the main challenge resides in characterising the nonstationarity in the parameters of the selected pdf in a typical nffa method the selected pdf type and shape parameter generally remain constant while the location and scale parameters in some cases only location parameters vary with covariates however a recent study by ouarda and charron 2019 advocated that more efforts should be devoted to finding out the necessity of changing distributions and shape parameter in nonstationary analyses the results of a typical nffa method can be classified into four different trend categories fig 1 in case of a synthetic generalized extreme value gev distribution these can be summarized as 1 type i both frequent and rare flood magnitudes are increasing under warming climate 2 type ii both frequent and rare flood magnitudes are decreasing under warming climate 3 type iii frequent flood magnitudes are decreasing while rare flood magnitudes are increasing under warming climate 4 type iv frequent flood magnitudes are increasing while rare flood magnitudes are decreasing under warming climate it is important to highlight that the flood regime under a future warmer climate mainly depends on how rare the extreme event is the rate at which precipitation increases and projected antecedent wetness conditions e g the antecedent wetness of catchment before precipitation extremes wasko et al 2020 wasko et al 2019 westra et al 2013 he et al 2022 according to the mechanism discussed by sharma et al 2018 precipitation extremes do not always translate to flooding events as a fraction of precipitation contributes to increasing soil moisture storage or evapotranspiration loss with only the remaining fraction eventually contributing to the formulation of streamflow theoretically frequent floods e g floods with return periods of 2 and 5 years are more likely to be dominated by both catchment antecedent wetness condition and precipitation intensity however the extreme precipitation intensity is more likely to lead to the saturated condition in a catchment regardless of the catchment antecedent wetness condition less time for precipitation to infiltrate into the ground with the subsequent precipitation contributing to rarer floods e g with return periods exceeding 50 years sharma et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017 wasko et al 2019 under a future warming climate with the rising temperature the interaction of increasing precipitation extremes under drier catchment conditions due to increased evaporation will result in dissimilar catchment response to the floods of different return periods therefore with temperature increase the rarest flood events are expected to increase due to the increase in precipitation extremes while less extreme flood events particularly for large catchments are likely to decrease overall due to the increase in dryness do et al 2017 knox 2000 milly et al 2002 wasko and sharma 2017 in the context of fig 1 this equates to type iii being the most likely scenario for flood magnitudes in the future however if the nffa approach only considers the location parameters to be varying and keeps the scale and shape parameters unchanged only the uniform increasing decreasing trends i e type i and type ii can be achieved for the flood events of differing magnitude frequencies under future climate conditions the fact that flood events with different rarity i e different return periods may have inconsistent sensitivity to climate change type iii and type iv is therefore neglected by the fitting of such a nonstationary model for example let us consider a typical example of nffa using the gev distribution where the location parameter µ varies linearly with time t such as μ t μ 0 a t where a is a constant calibrated using the observed data sets while the shape parameter ξ and scale parameter σ are kept fixed then the quantile function for the nonstationary gev distribution can be explicitly expressed by the following equation 1 q p μ t σ ξ μ t σ l o g l o g p f o r ξ 0 a n d p 0 1 μ t σ ξ l o g p ξ 1 f o r ξ 0 a n d p 0 1 o r ξ 0 a n d p 0 1 as can be seen projections of flood quantiles under this nonstationary model are monotonic and the trends of quantiles are uniform regardless of different return periods i e 1 p therefore as the statistical properties i e mean and standard deviation of observed ams data are coupled the simple assumption of a constant scale parameter for nonstationary gev distribution may not hold true salas et al 2018 in fact most of existing nffa approaches only focus on changes to rare flood events e g flood with return period of 50 or 100 years and pay less attention to frequent flood events e g flood with return period of 2 or 5 years as these are of a lower concern from a design perspective in these approaches the initial analysis is based on the identification of observed runoff trends therefore the location and scale parameters of selected pdf are elaborately calibrated by explanatory variables to model the defined future flood trends i e either increasing or decreasing type i or type ii most importantly to explicitly determine the flood trend so that the varying parameters can be trained to develop the nffa approach like any other statistical approach the key prerequisite is the availability of long records of at site runoff which has been a long concerned limitation in the analysis of both ffa and even more so for nffa to mitigate the aforesaid issue a flood quantile regression model rooted in the framework of regional flood frequency analysis rffa has been adopted in the present study rffa is one of the most important and commonly utilized tools to estimate design floods in an ungauged catchment at the core of which is the idea of transferring available flood information from hydrologically similar gauged catchments to the target catchment thereby alleviating the limitation of insufficient no data availability at the target catchment rffa comprises of two major steps i e the delineation of homogeneous neighbours and the development of a regional flood estimation model burn 1990 haddad and rahman 2012 hosking and wallis 1993 micevski and kuczera 2009 ouarda 2016 under the rffa framework that is based on quantile regression models e g perez et al 2019 individual flood quantiles are estimated by respective regression models thus assuring the ability to capture all potential flood trend categories i e type i ii iii and iv including the differing patterns of changes in different flood quantiles more specifically the flexibility of formulating varying regression model structures and selecting appropriate explanatory variables for different flood quantiles offered by the approach creates the basis of the novel approach proposed here 3 proposed method and a case study 3 1 data and study area as mentioned in the previous section accurate flood quantile estimation requires long records of streamflow compared with other hydrologic variables such as precipitation the streamflow datasets are of shorter length and poorer quality both spatially and temporally this insufficient data length can result in large estimation errors especially for the estimation of rarer flood events in ffa due to the large uncertainties associated with the tail behaviour of fitted pdfs based on this consideration australian catchments with data length more than 50 years are considered in this study a data set of 105 catchments across the states of queensland qld new south wales nsw and victoria vic in australia is selected fig 2 shows the locations of these 105 catchments these catchments are unregulated and comparatively smaller in size with areas ranging from 101 to 1 002 km2 and averaged at 405 km2 the daily streamflow measurements are sourced from the australian government bureau of meteorology bom the corresponding ams series of these 105 catchments is extracted gap filled checked for outliers and impacts of rating curve error on the flood quantiles following the procedure of haddad et al 2010 the missing data in filling procedure involves comparison of the monthly instantaneous maximum im data with monthly maximum mean daily mmd data at the same station for years with data gaps and using a simple linear regression of the annual mmd flow series against the annual im series of the same stations the detail method description can be found at haddad et al 2010 in order to consider similar climate conditions in time across all catchments the temporal coverage is kept fixed at 50 years from 1969 to 2018 in the analysis a summary of a few important catchment physiographic and hydrometeorologic characteristics such as catchment area latitude and longitude slope of mainstream annual average rainfall annual average potential evapotranspiration stream density are presented in table 1 the potential evapotranspiration and rainfall data used to derive catchment annual average potential evapotranspiration annual average rainfall and rainfall intensities was obtained from bom website 3 2 at site flood quantile trends at site flood quantiles are estimated to test the viability of our proposed nffa approach conventionally the estimation of upper quantiles of ams and the assessment of the trend depends on the selection of an appropriate probability model however even under the stationary conditions the choice of the best fitted probability model is uncertain and can even become worse given the nonstationarity exhibited by the ams data as our aim is to calculate the flood quantiles in a future climate following our earlier discussions fitting a pdf offers reduced flexibility in modelling differing changes in the trends of flood quantiles for different return periods following this we apply the routinely adopted plotting position cunnane 1978 instead the 50 years of ams series is divided into two parts to estimate the changes in the flood quantiles with time the first 25 years i e from 1969 to 1993 and the remaining 25 years i e from 1994 to 2018 owing to data length limitations and the fact that we estimate quantiles empirically we restrict our analysis to flood quantiles with return periods up to 20 years we focus on two return periods with 2 years q2 representing frequent and 20 years q20 representing rarer flood evens the cunnane plotting position cunnane 1978 is then applied to estimate at site flood quantiles 2 pp r 0 4 n 0 2 where pp represents the empirical exceedance probability or plotting position r is the rank of individual observations of ams series arranged in an ascending order and n is the sample size which is 25 years in our analysis the procedure is repeated for all catchments and both time periods based on these estimated at site flood quantiles trends percent differences between first and second halves of the data quantiles are estimated and are categorized into three groups namely a rising trend where flood quantiles increase by over five percent a decreasing trend where flood quantiles decrease by over five percent with remaining catchments falling under a no trend category it may be noted that there is uncertainty in the quantile estimation procedure as the data length is limited however given that the analysis is performed over many catchments and the information is pooled together the results can be considered as reliable and representative fig 3 summarizes all trends for at site flood quantiles these have been ascertained by empirically estimating the q2 and q20 for the first and second half of the 50 year observed ams record and the differences quantified some interesting patterns are noted as can be seen the trends for q2 and q20 show clear regionalised differences in space for q2 almost all catchments in northern queensland have a rising trend red colour symbols while most catchments in victoria show a decreasing trend blue colour symbols in the eastern coastal region and in the southern part of queensland most catchments reveal a decreasing trend with only a few of them showing the rising trend in terms of q20 many catchments reveal the strong opposite trends compared with q2 catchments located in northern queensland southeast queensland southern new south wales northeast new south wales and middle victoria are good examples of this phenomenon as results of fig 3 are based on actual at site observations these can be considered as the ideal benchmark to validate the limitations of current nffa alternatives limited in their representation of varying exceedance extremes and the benefit of our proposed novel nrffa approach uses regional information to mitigate the limitation of at site data length and considers trends of individual flood quantiles in a future setting in isolation 3 3 proposed nonstationary regional flood frequency analysis nrffa framework our novel nrffa approach is based on quantile regression for each flood quantile of interest the major difference between our method and the conventional nffa logic is that we make no assumption about the probability distribution of observed ams and equally importantly reduce the impact of data length limitation by pooling regional information for this purpose we borrow the logic from the classical rffa framework as presented below identification of homogeneous neighbours for the target catchment forms an essential step in rffa it is now widely accepted that a proper delineation of homogeneous neighbours for a target basin can significantly improve the accuracy of estimated flood quantiles ouarda 2016 ouarda et al 2001 we adopt the network based delineation of homogeneous region method developed by han et al 2020 due to its simplicity effectiveness and accuracy based on the constructed network for each catchment the existence of a link between two catchments is determined by their hydrologic similarity all catchments that have a significant link with the target catchment are considered as the homogeneous neighbours the reader is referred to han et al 2020 for further details after the determination of homogeneous neighbours for each catchment the next step is to develop relationships between flood quantiles and catchment characteristics for every return period to accurately represent the flood mechanism and to consider the climate conditions for different flood quantiles in a future climate the selection of exogenous variables representing catchment physiographic and climatic conditions must be performed carefully haddad and rahman 2012 through an extensive and careful selection process stepwise regression approach identified and considered four exogenous variables in their regionalised rffa approach these include catchment area mean annual rainfall mar mean annual potential evapotranspiration mpet and rainfall intensity with a duration of 24 h for the return period being estimated ii the rainfall intensity is achieved based on fitting a gev distribution to the annual maximum daily rainfall time series the subscript i represents the return period which means for more frequent flood quantiles e g with return period of 2 years rainfall intensity with a duration of 24 h and return period of 2 years i e i2 would be considered however for more rare flood quantiles e g with return period of 20 years in this study only rainfall intensity representing more rare rainfall events which is with a duration of 24 h and return period of 20 years i e i20 would be included in equation 3 the adoption of mar and mpet represents the average input and output hydrologic information that influences runoff volume and wetness within the catchment the extreme rainfall information i e rainfall intensity ii modulates flood magnitudes and is likely to change in the changed climatic conditions milly et al 2002 wasko and sharma 2017 the catchment area directly influences the flood magnitude and remains unchanged in the future the adopted flood quantile regression model is described below 3 l o g q i t β 0 β 1 l o g a r e a β 2 l o g mar t β 3 l o g mpet t β 4 l o g i i t where the subscript i represents the considered return periods i e 2 and 20 years for the results presented later and t stands for the observed or future time periods considered it should be noted that like any model the regression model used here provides an estimate of the so called true value therefore the the estimate quantile is likely to contain an error in equation 3 mar mpet and ii represent time varying variables and all are directly impacted by climate change generally in most evidenced cases rising temperature will lead to higher mpet and a changed mar for a catchment wasko et al 2018 wasko et al 2019 similarly the extreme rainfall is expected to increase according to the clausius clapeyron relationship trenberth 2011 trenberth et al 2003 once the regression models for the flood quantiles of individual return periods are calibrated using observed data use of future climate variables provides the pathway to derive future flood quantiles this form of the regression model offers the flexibility to calculate flood quantiles in a future climate conditional on the climate covariates without assuming a pdf and modifying associated parameters as is followed in a usual at site nffa approach in the results presented next first the rffa model is applied to both 25 year segments of data separately in a leave one out cross validation setting and thereafter the nrffa model is specified using the first 25 years of the ams series and is applied on the next 25 year record using the climate information of the later period to ascertain q2 and q20 similar to the at site results presented earlier in fig 3 fig 4 shows the rffa results excluding the ams data at the site of interest a so called leave one out cross validation estimate the trend reported in fig 4 are thus based on the difference in the respective quantile q2 or q20 estimated using rffa for each 25 year block in a leave one out cross validation setting notwithstanding a few minor differences between fig 3 and fig 4 there are broad similarities between them including the opposite trend for q2 compared to q20 such similarity would not have been possible to achieve using a traditional nffa alternative as our nrffa method is based on transferring gauged flood information to the target catchment via quantile regression the appropriate flood trends that should be considered for validation are the simulations by leave one out rffa estimation that are rooted in the same regression principle rather than the at site trends that were reported in fig 3 therefore results of fig 4 are subsequently considered as the benchmark i e real trends to validate our proposed nrffa method in the present study 3 4 flood quantile changes using the proposed nrffa approach like any other model the underlying logic behind the proposed nrffa approach is to use the observed data to train regression model parameters i e β0 β1 β2 β3 and β4 and then use the developed model and projected predictors to estimate different flood quantiles for the future in the present study the parameter estimation procedure for equation 3 is followed by a bayesian generalised least square bgls approach as suggested by haddad and rahman 2012 which is currently considered to be the most reliable parameterization approach for australian catchments kuczera and franks 2016 on this basis the variation in the magnitude of selected predictors with time should be reflected in the changes in estimated flood quantiles table 2 describes the trends and variations for these time varying predictors i e mar mpet and ii according to table 2 90 of the 105 catchments show a deceasing trend in mar and 100 of the catchments have a higher mpet value for the later 25 years besides the variation in the magnitude of mar is greater than that for mpet with the average reduction being around 10 for mar while the average increase for mpet is around 3 on the other hand the trend and variation of rainfall intensity estimated empirically based on the plotting positions in equation 2 using long time series of point observed rainfall given the limitations in fitted probability distributions noted before are more dramatic and noisier compared with mar and mpet almost half of the catchments have either increasing or decreasing trends for both rainfall intensities i2 and i20 respectively the magnitude of variation of rainfall intensities is also much larger than mar and mpet as shown in table 2 the regression models for q2 o and q20 o are calibrated separately using the initial 25 years ams data and two sets of model parameters are obtained here subscript o stands for observed data by using the calibrated model and the later 25 years catchment characteristics flood quantiles of q2 t and q20 t together with their trends i e increasing if qt qo with increase more than five percent and decreasing otherwise are simulated a snapshot of the change in flood quantiles using the nrffa framework above is presented in figs 5 and 6 these figures present the increasing top row and decreasing bottom row signs of trends for observed first column and proposed nrffa last column approaches for q2 and q20 respectively plots in fig 5 suggest that the proposed nrffa last column efficiently captures the increasing decreasing trends of the 2 year flood quantile as depicted by the observations first column this figure also includes a contingency table at the bottom about 62 9 i e 66 catchments of the simulated flood quantile trends are aligned with the actual trends while only 10 catchments show opposite trends by the proposed approach similarly fig 6 presents the trends in 20 year flood quantile by both the approaches the proposed approach last column captures the increasing and decreasing trends of observations quite effectively the contingency table at the bottom suggests that around 51 4 of catchments i e 54 catchments predict correct trend and 11 catchments have the opposite trends overall the spatial distribution of increasing decreasing trends is also interesting for example the proposed approach accurately simulates the rising trend of q2 for the catchments located at northern queensland as well as the decreasing trend for the catchments at eastern coastal area and southern new south wales for q20 the rising trend for several clusters of catchments in northern queensland southeast queensland and southern new south wales as well as the decreasing trends at eastern coastal region and southern new south wales can be accurately captured finally fig 7 presents the cases where in comparison to the trend of observations opposite trends are simulated by the proposed nrffa approach in this figure first column presents the results for q2 while last column for q20 with top row showing results for underestimation and bottom for overestimation as we can see only a limited number of catchments show the opposite trend in flood quantiles for both q2 and q20 and there is no spatial clustering noticeable suggesting the outcomes could be a result of sampling variability more so for the extreme quantiles with 25 years of data the 20 year quantile could have larger uncertainty which is also reflected in the results presented here 4 changes in flood extremes in the year 2100 once the proposed approach is validated it is possible to use the complete data length of 50 years to calibrate model parameters and estimate the future flood quantile trends for longer recurrence intervals by adopting the future projected hydrological variables i e mar mpet and ii from climate model simulations the future projections of these variables are available for a wide range of aogcms and a simplified approach is presented here the projections of future precipitation temperature and radiation are derived from the cmip6 access esm1 5 gcm runs ziehn et al 2019 and pet are estimated according to hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1982 the percentage changes in mar and mpet with respect to current climate projections from the same model run is used to estimate the future mar and mpet values among a variety of different shared socioeconomic pathway representative concentration pathway ssp rcp scenarios which represent the index that describe different levels of socioeconomic factors and greenhouse gases emissions that might occur in the future we consider the future emission scenario ssp370 which represents an increasing global warming environment under a moderate increase of co2 emission riahi et al 2017 due to the uncertain and unstable projections of extreme rainfall intensity in the aogcm outputs kim et al 2020a kim et al 2020b we adopt scaling estimates of future rainfall intensities for gauges located within or in vicinity to each of the catchments considered based on evidenced precipitation temperature sensitivities reported in earlier studies visser et al 2020 wasko et al 2018 therefore following the clausius clapeyron relationship the site specific sensitivity along with changes in temperature from the access esm1 5 gcm runs detailed above were used to ascertain future rainfall intensity for both return periods i e 2 and 20 years alexander et al 2019 hettiarachchi et al 2019 using this information and our proposed approach percentage changes in flood quantile estimates for the year 2100 with respect to the observed record are obtained are presented in fig 8 results indicate differences in the trend between frequent q2 and rare floods q20 at the end of the century under a warming climate summarized in table 3 a clearer understanding of the full extent of change in future flood quantiles can be inferred from fig 9 which presents historical plotting positions fitted rffa flood quantiles representing the observed record and the projected future flood quantiles at two representative locations in australia an opposite pattern of changes of q2 and q20 at the two locations is noted it is clear that the pattern of changes reported would have been improperly projected had the classical nffa procedures been used 5 discussion and conclusion the study highlights the non uniform behaviour of flood quantiles of different return periods under a warming climate i e nonstationary conditions the existing nffa approaches assume same directional changes of the flood quantiles of different return periods we recognise and highlight this limitation using synthetic and real datasets and present an alternative based on a nonstationary rffa or nrffa framework that provides an alternative solution to model the differential pattern of flood peaks with different extremes additionally as our approach pools the information from the nearby locations it also helps to address the concern of limited data length the study has highlighted several findings and concerns that are of general interest to the hydrology scientific community we believe that the proposed method though nascent has significant potential and can be further improved by addressing the limitations and concerns the study validates the approach based on split samples of historical observations as such the more extreme flood events such as q50 and q100 are difficult to estimate and validate due to the limitation of available data length although once approach is validated it is possible to use the complete data length to calibrate model parameters and estimate the future flood quantile trends for longer recurrence intervals by adopting the future projected hydrological variables i e mar mpet and ii from climate model simulations the regression model structure adopted in the present study is quite common and accepted in the rffa literature however the comparison of different model structures and the stepwise selection of explanatory predictors can help further refine the model structure adopted a log linear regression model is considered due to its wide acceptance and effectiveness within the framework of rffa nevertheless the impact of climate change on hydrologic process is complex including the direct influences on precipitation and evapotranspiration indirect influences such as groundwater and soil moisture and the complicated interactions between these variables which contribute to a vague understanding and poor estimation ability of future floods in a nonstationary setting we believe a more detailed analysis of the regression model residuals could provide additional valuable information on the model structure such as a non linear model and in achieving better results during the past few decades with better understanding of atmospheric and oceanic mechanisms our knowledge of the large scale climate drivers has also improved significantly an appropriate incorporation of these climate drivers into the nrffa model structure may help improving the results further besides the growing population along with a series of impacts due to the subsequent anthropogenic activities on significant changes and stresses to land use environment and water quality are also major factors affecting flood quantiles in the future therefore the approach may also consider these factors as additional explanatory variables or predictors in the regression model as the approach is based on the concept of regionalisation a few additional considerations are highlighted the approach relies on the identification of homogeneous neighbours to develop the regression model therefore the quantity and quality of identified homogeneous neighbours ultimately determine how much information could be transferred to the target catchment in this present study the availability of a large group of gauged catchments with streamflow observations over 50 years is representative of a comparatively rare situation however in many other countries and regions the gauging streamflow network may be limited by low density and short record length it could influence the accurate application of the approach proposed another consideration is about the homogeneity of the catchments into the future the homogeneity between catchments is determined by both physiographic and hydrologic characteristics we assume that the catchment physiographic attributes such as area slope and others are not likely to change significantly with the warming climate while the hydrological attributes such as mar mpet and others are more sensitive to temperature and climate change however with the developmental activities human interferences and population growth these attributes may evolve and the homogeneity may also change leading to different homogeneous neighbours the number of identified homogeneous neighbours is a key to determine regression model parameters and the flood quantile estimates ignoring this aspect is likely to bring in some uncertainty in the flood quantile estimates finally there is an ongoing debate in the literature whether the design flood is best estimated using the ams or using partial duration series or other alternatives that require continuous flow data while there is considerable merit in each of the alternatives in place the intent of this paper is to present a way of incorporating nonstationarity in regional flood frequency procedures arising from a warming climate we believe the essence of the logic proposed here is extendable to all such alternatives in conclusion we must reiterate that there exists no universally agreed approach for projecting design floods into future the idea of calibrating the statistics of floods based on climate covariates and thereby simulating the future flood attributes by adopting the future climate projections is sensible and appealing however the assumption that future flood attributes obey the same trend as observations or stationarity of the nrffa model proposed poses a big question mark theoretically under the nonstationary condition every single sample we measure could come from a different distribution due to the changing population distribution over time thus fitting a pdf to the observed data could raise issues we believe that while further work needs to focus on formulating better alternatives for nonstationary flood frequency analysis that can simulate the type of changes we have illustrated here the approach proposed here is useable under the assumption that the flood model in equation 3 does not change with time the last and most important concern is about the uncertainties associated with nffa and nrffa there are a wide range of different sources of uncertainties that need to be taken into consideration when estimating future and regional flood quantiles including but not limited to insufficient data length uncertainty of observed streamflow records accuracy the method used to delineate homogeneous neighbours the determination of model parameters the considered prediction intervals to describe the precision of predictions and many other factors that have been discussed elsewhere in the literature the method proposed here is a step forward in creating a better understanding of the flood quantiles behaviour under a future climate credit authorship contribution statement xudong han

2992,this study aims at evaluating the hydrological balance of large watersheds of the canadian shield in the james bay area in northwestern quebec canada the focus is set on six rivers of the canadian shield altogether draining more than 185 000 km2 of the boreal shield taiga shield and hudson plains ecozones of canada river discharge measurements geochemical data δ 2h δ 18o and electrical conductivity ec of water remote sensing and gis models are used jointly to calculate water balances the approach allows for partitioning the influence of rainwater snowmelt surface runoff evaporation transpiration and groundwater discharge to the hydrological balances of watersheds on an annual basis the results suggest that runoff from rainwater 30 61 of total precipitation and snowmelt 18 40 of total precipitation are the main contributions to river discharge while the contribution of groundwater discharge to rivers represents 12 of the total precipitation over the study area this contribution represents 2 5 km3 of water the stable isotope mass balances allow for estimating watershed scale evaporation over inflow ratios ranging between 2 and 10 and suggest that transpiration has an isotopic composition close to summer rainwater the hydrological balances further suggest that the total pool of water stored in the active portion of watersheds represents 10 20 of the total annual precipitation while the exports of groundwater beyond the limits of surface watersheds are negligible the seasonal trends in the hydrological balances of monitored watersheds were further documented to provide insights into the sensitivity of watersheds as they face climate change the observations are used to propose recommendations for monitoring of rivers in the canadian shield and to identify future research needs keywords hydrological mass balances groundwater river discharge stable isotope boreal shield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a quantitative evaluation of the hydrological balance of watersheds is needed to better understand the impacts of climate change and human activities on water resources kingston et al 2020 obtaining this knowledge is especially challenging in vast and remote areas where data acquisition is complex and costly to overcome this challenge remote sensing data and spatial precipitation models are increasingly used for estimating components of the terrestrial water budget such as change in water storage precipitation evapotranspiration and surface water discharge in watersheds sahoo et al 2011 pan et al 2012 yao et al 2014 however groundwater storage and fluxes often remain poorly documented in large scale hydrological balances ward 2016 although the changes in the water storage in watersheds can be estimated from grace satellites the approach does not allow for distinguishing between shallow groundwater and surface water storage and the coarse spatial resolution of the data makes them more suitable for continental or global scale analyses than for regional groundwater flow systems mccabe et al 2017 amanambu et al 2020 the water storage within the active portion of watersheds i e the portion of a watershed where hydrological fluxes have a significant impact on the annual hydrological balance of the watershed as a whole is rarely measured partly because the volume of aquifers is often not well known nevertheless it is recognized that groundwater represents the largest freshwater reservoir at the global scale oki and kanae 2006 gleeson et al 2016 and the estimated contribution of groundwater to global river discharge reaches 10 oki and kanae 2006 in some watersheds of the canadian shield groundwater fluxes and their interactions with surface waters are expected to be limited gleeson et al 2009 despite this fact without a broader and improved evaluation of the role of groundwater in the water balance of watersheds the development of measures to protect the water resources and associated biodiversity could be compromised this lack of knowledge imposes major limitations for land management kløve et al 2014a kløve et al 2014b sophocleous 2002 and results in an increased vulnerability of ecosystems alley et al 2002 hayashi and rosenberry 2002 bertrand et al 2012 kløve et al 2014a and local communities that depend on groundwater since the direct evaluation of groundwater fluxes is complex groundwater surface waters interactions are most often studied based on observations on surface waters river monitoring is particularly relevant to the evaluation of hydrological and geochemical processes taking place at the watershed scale the geochemical balances based on the fluxes exported by large rivers allowed for quantifying chemical weathering processes at the global scale gaillardet et al 1999 dupré et al 2003 in addition several studies revealed the potential of geochemical tracers and more specifically stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o and electrical conductivity ec for partitioning the sources contribution of streamflow klaus and mcdonnell 2013 luhmann et al 2012 such approaches were proven efficient in different environments including watersheds set in cold and humid climates st amour et al 2005 kalbus et al 2006 gleeson et al 2009 barthold et al 2010 dahlke et al 2014 orlova and branfireun 2014 penna et al 2014 tetzlaff et al 2015 gibson et al 2016 penna et al 2016 penna et al 2017 rosa et al 2016 bansah and ali 2017 ala aho et al 2018 cano paoli et al 2019 zuecco et al 2019 brown et al 2020 james et al 2020 the stable isotopes of water are also extensively used to quantify evaporation processes at various scales craig and gordon 1965 gibson et al 1993 gibson and edwards 2002 skrzypek et al 2015 rosa et al 2016 rey et al 2018 however river monitoring during the ice on season is challenging and rarely performed due to 1 safety issues during sampling on ice especially at the beginning and at the end of the season 2 difficulties related to discharge measurements under the ice 3 water sampling constraints due to quick freezing in sampling tubes and bottles when the air temperature is significantly below zero and 4 constraints associated with ice formation on probes used for in situ physicochemical measurements a potential solution to the challenges raised above could be the use of isotope profiles in ice formed on surface waters during the freeze up period gibson and prowse 1999 2002 nevertheless few studies have exploited this approach and to date the understanding of hydrological processes during freezing periods remains fragmentary due to the gaps quantification of the components of the watershed water balance is undervalued especially in vast and remote areas fitting in the pre established context the general objective of this study is to contribute to the development of methods for evaluating hydrological balances in vast and remote watersheds the specific objectives are to contribute to the improvement of methods for 1 evaluating groundwater fluxes and storage 2 quantifying transpiration fluxes and 3 documenting hydrological fluxes during the frozen period the approach focuses on the use of large scale datasets remote sensing and spatial models coupled with river discharge and geochemical monitoring δ 2h δ 18o and ec the focus is set on watersheds of the canadian shield on the east coast of james bay northwestern quebec canada ultimately broader recommendations are proposed to improve methodological approaches to assessing watershed water balance 2 study area the study area covers 185 000 km2 of the canadian shield in the anischnabe south and cree north first nations territories on the east coast of james bay northwestern quebec canada fig 1 a it includes the watersheds of the harricana nottaway rupert broadback pontax and eastmain rivers of the james bay basin within the boreal shield taiga shield and hudson plains ecozones marshall et al 1999 under natural conditions the rivers of the area generally present a bimodal hydrograph with lowest discharge at the end of the freezing period winter baseflow highest discharge during the spring snowmelt followed by summer baseflow and slightly increased discharge in the fall season the northern part of the study area is characterized by extensive hydroelectric installations which have significantly altered the natural pattern of streamflow woo et al 2008 woo and thorne 2009 nevertheless southern rivers are among the last naturally flowing non fragmented large boreal rivers of the james bay area dynesius and nilsson 1994 nilsson et al 2005 grill et al 2019 the region is part of the superior geological province a component of the canadian shield fig 1b surficial deposits inherited from the last glaciation deglaciation cycle cover most of the lowlands and bedrock depressions hardy 1977 the extent and architecture of these surficial deposits and the characteristics of associated granular aquifers are described in nadeau et al 2021 watersheds of the study area are part of the hudson james and ungava bays basin where measurable changes in discharge are observed owing to recent climate change and human activities déry et al 2005 woo et al 2008 as previously stated by nadeau et al 2021 the area is increasingly coveted for its natural resources mainly forestry and mining its hydroelectric potential and the presence of vast unconfined granular aquifers recognized for groundwater quantity and quality cloutier et al 2016 nadeau et al 2015 nadeau et al 2018 nadeau et al 2021 human pressures on the northern part of the study area are forecasted to increase significantly in the coming years particularly in the context of the plan nord an initiative of the government of quebec which targets increased economic development in this territory 3 method 3 1 theoretical and conceptual models 3 1 1 conceptual model of the hydrological balance of watersheds the hydrological balance of watersheds can be expressed with four major components 1 δ s i q riv e t where all terms are expressed as fluxes l 3 t and δ s is the change in water storage within the entire watershed i is the total atmospheric inflow to the watershed as rain r and snow s such as i r s q riv is the total river discharge at the outlet of the watershed and et is the evapotranspiration such as et q e q t where q e is the evaporation q t is the transpiration the surface runoff from rain q r and snowmelt q s and the discharge of shallow groundwater q sgw in springs streams lakes rivers and in inland discharge areas that reach the hydrographic network will partly be evaporated q e within connected lakes and exported out of the watershed as river discharge q riv here it is assumed that transpiration occurs within watersheds before waters reach the interconnected lakes and rivers of the hydrographic network whereas evaporation occurs within the interconnected lakes and rivers of the hydrographic network based on these assumptions transpiration occurs within watersheds but the q riv term represents a balance between q r q s q sgw and q e 2 q riv q s q r q sgw q e the terms can be shown in a conceptual model representing the main components of the hydrological balance fig 2 a the q dgw refers to the deep groundwater flux exported from the watershed without reaching the hydrographic network either through coastal groundwater discharge or inter basin hydrological exchanges previous work by luijendijk et al 2020 suggest that the groundwater discharge towards james bay from the coastal watersheds of study area is negligible the shallower groundwater flow systems found in unconfined aquifers are more dynamic than the deeper groundwater flow systems found in confined aquifers where the average residence time was estimated to reach thousands of years in in a region proximal to the study area boucher et al 2015 while most geochemical results reveal that groundwater found in the unconfined aquifers of the study area show low dissolved solids contents suggesting short water residence times cloutier et al 2016 the equation 2 does not directly involve the transpiration and storage difference terms thus the β term is introduced to represent the amount of water lost by watersheds due to transpiration q t and the change in water storage within the watershed δ s equation 3 this water never reaches the hydrographic network but is involved in processes occurring within watersheds upstream of water courses the β term corresponds to the imbalance between the total annual precipitation reaching watersheds and the fluxes from runoff q r q s and shallow groundwater q sgw reaching water courses before evaporation occurs 3 β q t δ s r s q s q r q sgw 3 1 2 stable isotopic mass balance of hydrological balance the detailed hydrological balance equation 3 can further be coupled with the isotopic composition δ of water 4 β δ β q t δ wcp δ s δ δ s r δ r s δ s q s δ s q r δ r q sgw δ sgw where δ is the isotopic composition of water either δ 2 h or δ 18 o expressed in against vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow with subscripts corresponding to the terms defined in equation 1 to 3 fig 2a the δ wcp refers to the water potentially consumed by plants transpiration is expected to cause isotope fractionation at the leaf atmosphere interface benettin et al 2021 while water uptake by roots is assumed as a simplification to cause negligible fractionation despite some evidences from the scientific literature poca et al 2019 the stable isotope compositions of atmospheric inflows δ i including rain δ r and snow δ s can be interpolated over vast regions based on quantitative models bowen and revenaugh 2003 terzer et al 2013 under the conditions prevailing in the study area it is assumed that the δ sgw and δ δ s is similar to δ i consistent with previous observations conducted in the abitibi témiscamingue region south of the study area castelli 2012 rey et al 2018 and with assumptions used in previous studies st amour et al 2005 gibson et al 2016 in this context δ wcp can be isolated from equation 4 5 δ wcp β δ β δ s δ i et q e here it is assumed that the uptake of water by plants does not significantly influence the δ 2 h δ 18 o and ec of the remaining soil water 3 1 3 annual cycle of the sources of river discharge the isotopic composition δ riv and electrical conductivity ec of water in boreal rivers is expected to follow an annual cycle mainly controlled by the components identified in equation 2 q r q s q e and q sgw e g see st amour et al 2005 during winter baseflow the proportional contribution of groundwater reaches a maximum it is thus expected that the highest ec riv will be measured during this period while δ riv is expected to be close to the average annual isotopic composition of precipitation during snowmelt both ec riv and δ riv are expected to decrease due to dilution by melting snow during the warm period both ec riv and δ riv are expected to increase gradually due to evaporation the loop illustrated in fig 3 extends beyond the triangle defined by the three inflows q r q s and q sgw in the ec vs δ plots during the late summer and fall because of evaporation which causes heavy isotope enrichment and a slight increase in ec in surface waters the δ riv and ec riv at a given point along a river will represent an integrated composition inherited from hydrogeochemical processes that occurred at the scale of the watershed located upstream of the sampling site an end members mixing analysis emma with four unknown can thus be used to partitioning streamflow components and documenting processes occurring in watersheds 6 q riv q s q r q sgw q e 1 the geochemical tracers δ and ec can further be used 7 δ riv q s δ s q r δ r q s g w δ s g w q e δ e w i t h δ 2 h a n d δ 18 o 8 e c riv q s e c s q r e c r q s g w ec s g w q e e c e 3 1 4 riverine process during the ice on period after the high waters of the fall period river discharge is expected to present a gradual decrease during the ice on period until reaching winter baseflow conditions fig 2b under ice on conditions terms used by gibson and prowse 1999 2002 which refer to the period when river is covered by ice the contribution from runoff decreases and large rivers mainly drain large lakes and groundwater during this period the water in rivers freezes and the isotopic evolution of river water over time can potentially be deduced from ice cores if the effective ice water isotopic separation ε eff representing the difference between the isotopic composition of the basal ice δ basalice and that of the sub ice water δ sub i c e w a t e r is known 9 ε eff δ basalice δ sub i c e w a t e r if ε eff can be estimated ice cores collected at the end of the ice on period could provide key insights on the isotopic composition of river water during the winter period a time at which river monitoring and water samples collection is difficult gibson and prowse 1999 2002 3 2 hydrological measurements and data sources 3 2 1 atmospheric fluxes from remote sensing and models precipitation r and s and evapotranspiration et can be estimated based on remote sensing datasets and spatial models details of the data used are provided in table 1 these datasets are aggregated to obtain mean and range of the cumulative values of monthly water inflows and outflows for each of the studied watersheds the precipitation fluxes from the beginning of november to the end of march are used for estimating the flux weighted value of s and fluxes from april to october are use for estimating the flux weighted value of r fig 2b 3 2 2 discharge measurements in situ river discharges were measured using a sontek riversurveyor m9 acoustic doppler current profiler adcp specific details of the method used to measure the flow are provided in appendix 1 overall 53 stream flows were measured according to 236 profiles realized at 22 sites in 2018 2019 fig 1a supplementary material 1 in addition three hydrometric stations operated by the government of quebec melcc 2020 are located in the study area ha bm wm fig 1a a total of 27 adcp profiles were carried out near these hydrometric stations to allow for comparisons discharge measurements were scheduled to collect data during the spring freshet the summer baseflow and the autumn high waters the baseflow at the end of winter ice on period is assumed to be proportional to the watershed area according to 10 q bf 4 5 10 9 m s a where q bf is the river baseflow m3 s and a is the catchment area m2 this empirical relation is based on a compilation of historical baseflow measurements from 10 hydrometric stations located in study area melcc 2020 3 3 geochemical measurements and data sources 3 3 1 precipitation during this study 61 samples of monthly precipitation were collected at three monitoring stations fig 1a from may 2018 to october 2019 in addition five composite samples were also collected to estimate the average δ 2 h δ 18 o and ec of the snowpack fig 1a samples were collected at the end of the ice on period just before snowmelt to obtain composite samples of the snow accumulated during the entire winter specific details about the sampling methods are provided in appendix 2 the δ 2 h and δ 18 o of precipitation including rain and snow can further be interpolated over vast regions based on quantitative models bowen and revenaugh 2003 here the measured isotopic compositions of precipitation are used for comparisons with the regionalized cluster based water isotope prediction model rcwip terzer et al 2013 3 3 2 river water sampling river waters were collected downstream of rapids or near the center of the main channel of rivers to obtain well mixed samples specific details of this sampling method are provided in appendix 3 overall 222 samples were collected within 21 sub watersheds fig 1a sampling frequency depended on the sites accessibility and was mainly synchronized with discharge measurements the harricana river sampled in the city of amos site ha in fig 1a is used as the main reference station because it was monitored at a greater frequency daily monitoring during spring freshet for a total of 75 samples collected over 18 months the number of samples collected at each site is provided in supplementary material 2 3 3 3 river ice sampling river ice cores were collected at 11 sites fig 1a at the end of winter in 2018 and 2019 using a kovacs mark ii corer this corer allows for retrieving 9 cm diameter ice cores in 1 m long sections specific details about the ice coring method and ice samples preparation are provided in appendix 4 3 3 4 stable isotope analyses δ2h and δ18o all samples were analyzed

isotope analyses are provided in appendix 5 results are given in delta units δ in vs vsmow overall 491 samples containing waters from rivers rain snow snowpack and ice cores were analyzed for δ 2h and δ 18o 3 4 the end members mixing analysis emma the emma based on equations 6 to 8 is solved using matrix calculations the values that must be attributed to endmembers can represent different periods of time depending on the water residence time in the catchment a single flux weighted average value can be used for δ s because the spring freshet generally consists of one major event in the hydrograph of large boreal rivers the δ r term can be more variable and cause uncertainties in calculations due to the unknown residence time of water in the watersheds nevertheless in large watersheds the transit time and distance of water flow must likely result in a mixing process that buffers the seasonal variability inherited from rainfall as observed in other northern watersheds ala aho et al 2018 a single flux weighted average δ r value is thus used to solve equation 7 the δ sgw are assumed to be invariant over time the δ r δ s and δ sgw are estimated for each watershed based on flux weighted data from the rcwip terzer et al 2013 minimal and maximal values of atmospheric inflows are used to estimate uncertainties on the emma the ec r and ec s are estimated based on field data and assumed to be homogeneous in space and time the ec sgw term is not known a priori and must be estimated based on assumptions related to the hydrogeological context of watersheds tóth 1999 here it is estimated based on the data pertaining to the ec of groundwater in the main types of aquifers of the canadian shield in abitibi témiscamingue these aquifers include unconfined granular aquifers uga unconfined bedrock aquifers uba and confined aquifers ca with respective approximated σ values of 150 μs cm 400 μs cm and 500 μs cm based on results from cloutier et al 2016 rey et al 2018 for each watershed the proportion of each type of aquifer in terms of coverage in the xy plane are estimated based on the groundwater flow conditions for calculating these proportions only the shallowest aquifer is considered in every point of the territory fig 1a for example the bedrock aquifers are only considered if no sediment is found above the value assigned for ec sgw corresponds to the composite ec of groundwater in unconfined aquifers this seems realistic as groundwater surface water hydrological exchanges are likely to occur preferentially in shallow unconfined aquifer areas although it is not feasible to precisely constrain the ec sgw value three scenarios of ec sgw are tested for solving emma table 2 these scenarios allowed for quantifying the sensitivity of calculations the evaporating vapour δ e will be depleted in heavy isotopes as the residual liquid water surface water undergoes a gradual heavy isotopes enrichment during the evaporation process and tends to define local evaporation lines lel basal plane in fig 3 evaporation also contributes to increase ec riv as dissolved solids tend to remain in the liquid phase during evaporation while the evaporated moisture has few dissolved solids ec e 0 the δ e term can be estimated using a simplified version of the craig and cordon 1965 model gibson et al 1993 7 δ e δ riv h δ a ε 1 h where δ riv is the flux weighted isotopic composition of river h the relative humidity δ a is the moisture composition of ambient air assumed to be in equilibrium with the flux weighted average isotopic composition of local precipitation and ε is the total isotope fractionation gibson et al 1993 gibson and edwards 2002 skrzypek et al 2015 the δ 2 h and δ 18 o of atmospheric moisture δ a during the ice off period can be estimated based on the assumption that it is in equilibrium with δ i and using an average air temperature 15 c representing the prevailing conditions during the ice off season the liquid vapour isotopic fractionation factor α v l can be estimated based on the horita and wesolowski 1994 equations 4 results 4 1 hydrological results the average annual atmospheric inflows i for entire region ranged between 880 11 m yr in 2018 and 849 10 mm yr in 2019 the precipitation patterns depict the effects of a marked seasonality fig 4 and a significant decrease of inflows with increasing latitude 50 and 70 mm φ in 2018 and 2019 respectively the precipitation reached approximately 1000 mm yr in the southern watersheds and approximately 700 mm yr in the northern watersheds late summer and early autumn periods are characterized by the highest humidity with precipitation reaching an average of 150 mm month in september and october 2018 during the ice on period conditions are dryer with average precipitation mainly snow 50 mm month the winter precipitation represented 29 and 32 of total water inflow in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 5 the month of april marks a transition with both liquid and solid precipitation and measurable et in some areas the et decreases with increasing latitudes 35 and 20 mm φ in 2018 and 2019 respectively from north to south the et reached 230 to 390 mm yr and 275 to 370 mm yr in 2018 and 2019 respectively with an average of 305 17 mm yr and 321 28 mm yr for the entire study area in spring and early summer the et flux was equal to rainfall in 2018 and 2019 maximum et rates are observed in late spring and early summer reaching approximately 100 mm month the et fluxes decrease from august to november the i values calculated from the imerg dataset are 20 lower than that calculated from the capa model the models available for estimating the et term also show discrepancies as the modis dataset yields estimates of et that are 29 lower than those of the ssebop dataset the results obtained from discharge measurements are shown in fig 6 and provided in supplementary material 1 the reproducibility obtained for repeated adcp profiles at each site ranged between 0 4 and 50 1 for a median value of 3 9 greater errors were observed when profiles were collected under low flow conditions especially under windy conditions eight adcp flow measurements were conducted close to governmental hydrometric stations comparisons made between field results and data from hydrometric stations revealed differences within 4 for six out of the eight flow measurements while the two other sites showed differences of 9 and 15 the calculated discharge values range between 5 and 8 m3 s in the head waters of the harricana bell and chibougamau rivers sites hv bs cc fig 1a and 2300 m3 s during the spring flood near the outlet of the nottaway river site nbj fig 1a the monitored rivers depict bimodal hydrographs with highest discharge during snowmelt may june decreasing discharge during the summer period july september increased flow during the fall period october november and a return to baseflow conditions during the ice on period november april the results suggest that peak discharge over winter baseflow ratios range between 3 7 and 16 5 overall the estimated δs values range between 208 mm yr and 131 mm yr these values correspond to proportions of 20 to 15 of the average i fig 5 4 2 geochemical results the complete geochemical dataset δ 2 h δ 18 o ec t do ph orp from this study is provided in supplementary material 2 to 5 while table 3 and fig 7 provide a summary of available results the measured isotopic compositions of precipitation monthly composite samples of r and s and accumulated snowpack samples range from 200 4 in january to 50 3 in july for δ 2 h and 27 1 in january to 6 9 in june for δ 18 o the data allow for estimating the slope and intercept of the observed lmwl δ 2 h 7 82 δ 18 o 6 75 fig 8 a b this regression is close to the lmwl calculated from rcwip model δ 2 h 7 82 δ 18 o 8 35 based on average isotopic data for each sub watershed locally the measured isotopic compositions of precipitation present average absolute differences of 16 3 and 2 0 with the rcwip for δ 2 h and δ 18 o respectively rainfall samples from april to october 2018 yielded an average ec of 19 5 μs cm with a standard deviation of 21 μs cm while samples from the snowpack yielded ec values ranging between 4 4 μs cm and 13 5 μs cm for an average of 6 8 μs cm the δ 2 h and δ 18 o results obtained for river waters ranged from 128 3 to 75 7 and 17 7 to 9 9 respectively fig 8b c the lowest and highest δ 2 h and δ 18 o values were recorded during spring snowmelt and summer baseflow respectively the δ 2 h and δ 18 o of winter baseflow range from 107 8 to 85 2 and 14 5 to 11 62 respectively the ec measured in rivers suggest values ranging from 10 4 μs cm to 159 8 μs cm with an average of 47 5 μs cm table 3 the ec values increased slightly during winter and reached a maximum at the end of the ice on period followed by a marked decrease during spring flood within the study region the rcwip data suggest 5 2 φ and 0 63 φ gradients in the δ 2 h and δ 18 o of precipitation respectively based on annual flux weighted values of watershed a similar gradient is also observed in the flux weighted isotopic composition of rivers with 5 4 φ and 0 67 φ for δ 2 h and δ 18 o respectively the river water samples revealed that q riv tend to plot below the lmwl in δ 2 h vs δ 18 o cross plots fig 8a the flux weighted average river discharge is enriched by approximately 1 to 9 and 0 7 to 2 0 for δ 2 h and δ 18 o respectively compared to the modelled flux weighted average isotopic composition of precipitation these observations likely reflect the heavy isotope enrichment inherited from evaporation processes the annual flux weighted river composition at site cc presents the greatest heavy isotope enrichment with respect to others monitored sites 15 and 3 0 for δ 2 h and δ 18 o respectively but the peak discharge associated with snowmelt was likely missed at this site 4 3 river ice logging the δ 2 h and δ 18 o results obtained from 192 river ice samples allowed for constructing 20 vertical profiles of river ice the complete dataset is provided in supplementary material 5 overall the length of the ice cores ranged between approximately 0 3 m and 1 0 m and δ 2 h and δ 18 o of the ice samples ranged from 66 4 to 213 1 and 8 6 to 29 0 respectively while congelation ice which result from freezing of river water was observed in most ice cores 13 out of 20 only four of the cores had sufficient thicknesses to allow for reconstructing a profile based on 5 cm samples in these four ice cores the results revealed constant δ 2 h and δ 18 o values suggesting an invariant isotopic composition of river water during the ice on period the results did not show a progressive depletion in δ 2 h and δ 18 o in congelation ice and rayleigh type conditions are thus unlikely in the studied watersheds gibson and prowse 1999 the isotopic composition of sub ice waters was compared to δ 2 h and δ 18 o of the basal congelation ice this comparison allowed the calculation of the effective ice water isotopic separation ε eff with values of 2 66 0 5 and 17 59 2 29 for δ 18o and δ 2h respectively these results are similar to the εeff of 2 84 0 34 and 17 9 3 9 found by gibson and prowse 2002 in northwestern canada 4 4 deciphering the sources of river discharge the extent of the calculations depends on the availability of data for each sub watershed see fig 1 detailed calculations are proposed for rivers that have been subject to intensive monitoring while qualitative interpretations are proposed for the sub basins where the data are fragmentary the estimated values of reference for ec sgw range between 289 and 393 μs cm fig 7 the range of results obtained from emma for each sub basin are shown in fig 5 it suggests that the runoff from rain reaching rivers represents 30 to 61 of i and that the runoff of the melting of snow reaching rivers represents 18 to 40 of i the shallow groundwater flux reaching rivers is estimated to range between 0 and 12 of i it is further estimated that 2 to 10 of i is returned to the atmosphere by evaporation the calculations from the ec sgw scenarios suggest that the values used for partitioning streamflow components strongly influence the results site ha is used to discuss the sensitivity of calculations to the ec sgw values at this site the calculated annual contribution of groundwater to river discharge ranges between 8 and 25 of i for the lowest and highest ec sgw endmember values respectively for large scale watersheds a composite value integrating multiple aquifer water sources is more likely to represent regional flow pattern in that sense for the monitored watersheds the river discharge from groundwater is constrained between 1 7 and 4 9 km3 yr this regional contribution represents 3 of i 5 discussion 5 1 the hydrological budget of watersheds the imerg and capa models both suggest dryer conditions for the northernmost watersheds in comparison to the southernmost watersheds this pattern is consistent with previously reported climate data that suggests colder and dryer conditions in more northern areas within the study region phillips 1990 berteaux et al 2018 the modis and ssebop data further suggest that the et fluxes decrease northwards likely due to a shorter ice off period characterized by lower temperatures the i and et gradients section 5 1 do not completely balance each other and as a result the watershed area normalized river discharges expressed in mm yr km2 show a gradient of 25 mm φ this finding implies that the area normalized hydrological fluxes from the study area decrease northwards in the past decades a positive trend was observed in the river discharge of the james bay area déry et al 2016 and it is expected that global warming will increase hydrological fluxes by mid century hennigs and bleau 2017 macdonald et al 2018 stadnyk and déry 2021 these changes could entail changes in gradients and generate proportionally more significant impacts in the northeast portion of the study area where current climatic conditions are dryer and colder one key feature of the hydrological balance of watershed is that annual δs are smaller where hydrometric stations provide daily measurements of river discharge in these cases the annual δs are 7 of i overall the most precise and reliable discharge data suggest that i e t q riv in this context the cumulative discharge from the studied watersheds can be estimated from river discharge with values reaching 109 km3 in 2018 and 100 km3 in 2019 the mean streamflow of these rivers between 1964 and 2013 was comparatively lower 90 6 km3 déry et al 2016 overall the q riv fluxes correspond to 65 and 62 of the i for 2018 and 2019 the remaining fraction is attributed to et based on the calculations it is estimated that the contribution of groundwater ranges between 0 and 12 depending on the catchment area these observations tend to confirm previous observations suggesting limited groundwater fluxes within the canadian shield aquifers gleeson et al 2009 nevertheless southern watersheds presented higher contributions of groundwater that could be attributed to a greater thickness of granular sediments in areas with lower sediments thickness nadeau et al 2021 flows are rather defined by the bedrock topography the groundwater contribution to baseflow was also more significant for catchments in located in the southern part of study area the data suggest a decrease in groundwater contribution to river discharge watersheds of the james bay lowlands where clay deposits are widespread and unconfined granular aquifers are sparse nadeau et al 2021 in the james bay lowlands the hydrological regime is likely more dependent on discharge from wetlands orlova and branfireun 2014 the role of groundwater fluxes in the hydrological balance of the studied watersheds is consistent with the hypothesis that groundwater flows from recharge areas to rivers mainly through shallow groundwater flow systems sykes et al 2009 under such conditions water transit within aquifers could act as a buffer to hydrological variations in rivers without modifying the total annual discharge of rivers it is expected that the hydrological response of rivers will be more dynamic in watersheds where the runoff recharge ratio is greater and dampened in watersheds where the runoff recharge ratio is smaller 5 2 the seasonality of river water sources the data and calculations allow for quantifying the seasonal cycle in the sources of river waters fig 9 a the cycle is illustrated conceptually in fig 9b where the ice on baseflow conditions are characterized by the highest groundwater contributions fig 9b 1 following the ice on baseflow the relative contribution of snowmelts can reach up to 80 of the discharge during the early spring freshet fig 9b 2 3 this significant contribution lead to surface water depletion which is not systematically observed in northern watershed ala aho et al 2018 the peak of heavy isotope depletion in water is observed early in the spring freshet a time at which field sampling conditions are particularly difficult during the ice off season the discharge gradually decreases to reach summer baseflow conditions during this period the relative contribution of the rain endmember gradually increases and a slight increase in the shallow groundwater contribution is also observed fig 9b 4 the onset of the fall highwaters following the ice off baseflow conditions then reveals a period during which the contribution from rainwaters can reach 80 fig 9b 5 the sources of water discharge at site ha estimated from the emma fig 9c reveals that the temporal variations in the groundwater contribution to river discharge is significantly smaller than that of the rain and snow endmembers the contribution from runoff originating from snowmelt is observed through the entire ice off period while that of runoff originating from rainwater is bimodal with an increased relative contribution in the fall period the evaporation flux is observed through the entire ice off period and reaches a maximum value in the fall when waters that have undergone summer evaporation are drained by rivers while the δs term is likely to be close to zero on an annual basis significant changes are observed on monthly timescales here the data suggest that the water storage in watersheds reaches maximum values from autumn to the end of the ice on period due to humid conditions at the end of the ice off period followed by low river discharge and snow accumulation during the ice on period the water storage in watersheds reaches minimum values during the early summer period due to high discharge during freshet and increased et during the early ice off period at the watershed scale the data suggest an active storage of water representing about 10 to 20 of the annual i this transient storage presents a cycle with an amplitude of 10 to 18 based on this observation it can be postulated that the reduction of the duration of ice on period due to global warming will reduce the maximum storage in watersheds in response to a decrease in snow accumulation and an earlier peak in et at the onset of the ice off period 5 3 understanding riverine processes during the ice on period the collected ice cores tend to present two main types of ice consistent with observations from previous studies ferrick et al 2002 gibson and prowse 1999 2002 a significant layer of snow ice which is a mixture of precipitation and surface water generally overlies the congelation ice which is formed by the freezing of streamflow water the isotopic patterns measured in zones with congelation ice are considered to represent the conditions illustrated on the left side of the conceptual model fig 10 the stable conditions observed during the ice on period are attributed to the constant supply of water from large lakes and groundwater in these zones river water freezing must exceed ice erosion seven of the 20 ice cores samples did not show clean congelation ice the comparison between the isotopic composition of sub ice water and that of ice reveals negative ε eff values these values are most likely caused by the presence of a basal ice that is depleted in heavy isotopes due to snow ice mixing as illustrated in the central part of fig 10 gibson and prowse 2002 suggested that the proximity of rapids and the presence of layers of slush or liquid water are non ideal conditions for congelation ice formation another plausible explanation is that ice erosion exceeds ice formation such conditions were observed in areas where the river section is reduced i e shallower or narrower causing higher flowrates under the ice it was also observed that some ice cores presented a heterogeneous structure with variable δ 2 h and δ 18 o compositions right side of fig 10 in these zones the ice cover consists of an accumulation of ice debris in zones where the morphology of the riverbed entails conditions that are prone to ice jam overall the ice cores from rivers should be collected in areas where rivers are narrow and deep left side of fig 10 if the research objective is to document the isotopic composition of river water during the ice on period the zones where the rivers are wide should be avoided as there might be a channel of active flow and zones of stagnant water below the ice the zones corresponding to the patterns depicted on the right side of the conceptual model should also be avoided in the harricana river in amos site ha the presence of rapids significantly increases the streamflow velocity leaving the water surface free of ice all year long it was therefore possible to monitor the isotopic composition of water at this site during the ice on period the results shown a progressive depletion in heavy isotopes in river water during the ice on period nevertheless it revealed that river water during the ice on baseflow is enriched in heavy isotopes compared to groundwater suggesting a non negligible contribution from the rain endmember throughout the winter moreover the increasing value of the d xs observed during winter at this site suggests that with ice cover evaporated water at the surface of lakes is mixed with underlying water or freeze in small tributary river and further released into the spring freshet 5 4 insights on water consumed by plants the isotopic composition of the water potentially consumed by plants δ wcp equation 5 range from 107 7 to 55 1 for δ 2 h and from 14 81 to 8 14 for δ 18 o fig 11 these values are generally enriched in heavy isotopes compared to the flux weighted average isotopic composition of precipitation δ i although major uncertainties remain about reliability of δ wcp estimates beyer and penna 2021 the δ wcp estimated here suggest that plants mainly consume water from summer rains while this might seem obvious it raises an important question on groundwater recharge processes if plants preferentially removes water from summer rains why is the groundwater isotopic composition very similar to the flux weighted average isotopic composition of precipitation δ i one plausible explanation is that the infiltration process could be less efficient during the snowmelt period due to frozen soils therefore limiting the recharge of waters that are significantly depleted in heavy isotopes and balancing the effect of transpiration which limits the recharge of waters that are significantly enriched in heavy isotopes this explanation would imply that within the study area groundwater recharge mainly occurs shortly after the snowmelt period when transpiration by plants is still limited and towards the end of the ice off season when colder conditions and less daylight reduce vegetation growth 5 5 uncertainties and perspectives the monitoring approach used in this study allows for documenting hydrological processes and seasonal changes occurring within watersheds the results suggest that the isotopic compositions of precipitation from rcwip provide reliable values that could be used for future large scale studies being able to use rcwip is an advantage because monthly monitoring of precipitation can be challenging in remote areas one shortcoming pertaining to precipitation is that in the present study the potential effect of sublimation on the snowpack was not considered while previous studies suggested that the loss of snow by sublimation can reach 40 in boreal regions pomeroy et al 1998 in addition the effects of isotopic fractionation during snowmelt were not considered here although such processes are known to occur taylor et al 2001 this could lead to uncertainties in the evaluation of rivers water balance future research focusing on river monitoring would benefit from evaluating these processes through a monitoring of the snowpack during the ice on period and during snowmelt another shortcoming of the present study is that ec sgw remains poorly documented this lack of knowledge increases the uncertainty associated with the quantification of groundwater discharge to rivers while a comprehensive assessment of groundwater quality in the northern part of the canadian shield is not yet feasible mainly due to the lack of groundwater wells one plausible solution would be to monitor groundwater electrical conductivity in groundwater springs with automated probes finally a better knowledge of the residence time of runoff water over large watersheds and the hysteresis observed between q riv and ec riv cana paoli et al 2019 especially during early spring freshet would be needed to improve water budgets despite the shortcomings outlined above comparisons made between hydrological and isotopic data suggest that the use of the emma with a four end member system to quantify the water balance of watershed showed is a promising approach firstly the evaporation over inflow ratio qe i calculated from the hydrological balance is similar to the e i estimated based on the craig and gordon 1965 model fig 5 in addition the results allowed for highlighting future monitoring needs in studied watershed the results suggest that hydrogeochemical monitoring should focus on three main periods the end of the ice on period samples collected during this period are critical to evaluate the maximum groundwater contribution theses samples can further provide information on the ec sgw term which is needed for emma since temporal changes are unlikely to occur during winter baseflow only a limited number of samples is required for this period the spring freshet the sampling frequency must be increased during this period to calculate the sources of river waters during the peak discharge event however water sampling during the spring flood is difficult due to safety issues during this period unstable ice conditions are often observed along rivers shorelines which limits access for sampling in addition large blocks of ice are transported in the rivers during snowmelt which limits the possibility of using small boats for sampling further research aimed at developing safe and efficient protocols for the collection of river samples during snowmelt are therefore much needed the end of the ice off period samples collected at the end of the ice off season provide key information on evaporation processes as the results suggest that the greatest heavy isotope enrichments are observed during this period sampling this period is also important to capture the contribution of rainwater runoff during the high discharge event observed before the onset of the ice on period these recommendations are mainly suited to river monitoring in vast and remote areas characterized by cold and humid climates monitoring programs implemented on rivers in such areas can be costly and logistically complex in addition sampling during the snowmelt period is especially complex the snowmelt can be diachronous due to differences in latitude and altitude among other aspects the spring freshet can be very short if weather conditions such as warm temperatures and heavy rains contribute to snowmelt such events however can only be predicted on short notice therefore it is challenging for a research team to conduct intense monitoring during snowmelt one promising approach would be to develop research partnerships with local communities such partnerships would encourage knowledge sharing focusing on sites located near discharge monitoring stations would help reduce the required field procedures which would also facilitate collaborations with local communities 6 conclusions this study provided new knowledge on the hydrological balance of large watersheds of the canadian shield in the james bay area in northwestern quebec canada such knowledge is critically needed in vast and remote areas such as the northern part of the canadian shield where significant impacts of climate change are expected and where human impacts are continuously increasing the data collected in this study could allow for better predicting the potential impacts of changes in the hydrologic balance on local communities and groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes in addition there is currently a critical lack of knowledge about groundwater resources in northern canada which is partially explained by the lack of groundwater wells and infrastructures that can be used for studying aquifers in this vast and remote area the approach used in this study made it possible to combine remote sensing field monitoring and spatial model data the study provided novel insights on the role of groundwater in the hydrological budgets of watersheds the data suggest that the groundwater fluxes account for 20 of the rivers discharge on an annual basis 12 annual precipitation the calculations also suggest that the total amount of water stored in the active layer of watersheds is equivalent to 10 to 20 of the total precipitation reaching the watersheds moreover the results allowed for documenting atmospheric fluxes from watersheds evaporation estimates from remote sensing data and isotopic mass balances are in agreement both suggest evaporation over inflow ratios in the range of 2 to 10 the calculated isotopic composition of water potentially consumed by plants suggests that summer rains are preferentially transpired by plants and that the pool of soil water from the infiltration that occurred during snowmelt is not the main source of water for plants ice cores collected at the end of the ice on period and containing a sufficient thickness of congelation ice revealed that the isotopic composition of river water is invariant during the ice formation period this suggests that the frequency of river monitoring during winter could be reduced overall the data lead to the conclusion that river monitoring is critically important during three main periods 1 at the end of the ice on period to capture the groundwater contribution during winter baseflow 2 during the spring flood to capture the peak discharge and 3 at the end of the ice off period to estimate evaporation over inflow ratios and capture the high waters of the fall overall the approaches developed and applied here could be transferred to other areas of the canadian shield to improve land management by allowing a better consideration of the water resources and associated ecosystems the development of long term river monitoring networks could provide key insights on the sensitivity of watersheds to climate change and human impacts the development of such monitoring programs through collaborations between governmental agencies universities and local communities could also promote knowledge sharing future work that develops innovative approaches to sampling rivers during snowmelt and estimating the isotopic composition and electrical conductivity of groundwater in vast remote areas seem much needed credit authorship contribution statement s nadeau conceptualization methodology formal analysis

anonymous reviewers for constructive comments that improve this manuscript appendices specific details of the methods 1 discharge measurement from sontek riversurveyor m9 acoustic doppler current profiler adcp the system uses ultrasonic pulses to measure the velocity of suspended sediments transported in water based on the frequency difference between the emitted and received signal simpson 2001 this velocity is interpreted as an analog of the water velocity the profiler further simultaneously calculates the depth of the riverbed and its own speed using a bottom tracking technology le coz et al 2007 the adcp profiler thus allows for measuring the total discharge within a river section when data are collected from one shoreline to the other here the adcp was attached to a boat zodiac canoe or trimaran and displacement was ensured using a small motor paddles or ropes depending on field conditions a hitch was designed to attach the adcp device to the boats to ensure the stability of the profiler and to keep the sensors underwater while conducting measurements profiles were repeated along the same sections with the objective of obtaining a reproducibility within 5 between four measurements when this reproducibility target was not met more measurements were collected the locations of transects were selected according to safety criteria flow conditions and to avoid human infrastructures that could significantly alter measurements 2 precipitation sampling method rain and snow were collected using narrow mouth 1 l hdpe bottles with 4 8 cm funnels equipped with plastic screens at their base to block debris and insects paraffin oil was added to the bottles to prevent evaporation local collaborators were responsible for collecting precipitation and sending the tightly sealed bottles by mail to the laboratory each month snow samples were collected in 10 1 cm inside diameter all weather p 2000 standard rain gauges without cap by the local collaborators snow samples were left to melt overnight and subsequently stored in 1 l hdpe bottles with paraffin oil to prevent evaporation daily samples were mixed to obtain monthly composite samples all composite precipitation samples were subsequently subsampled in 60 ml hdpe bottles and kept at 4 c until stable isotope analysis the five composite samples from the snowpack were collected using 1 m hdpe tubes samples were left to melt at room temperature the melted snowpack samples were then immediately used to measure the electrical conductivity σ and subsampled in 60 ml hdpe bottles that were kept at 4 c until further δ 2 h δ 18 o analyses 3 river water sampling method river water samples were collected either using a small boat or directly from the bank depending on field conditions a rigid pole was used to collect samples approximatively 1 m below the water surface directly into hdpe bottles sampling bottles were rinsed three times with river water before sampling the in situ parameters ph dissolved oxygen conductivity redox potential and temperature were systematically measured using a ysi 556 mps multi parameter probe 4 river ice coring method the snow cover on the ice surface was removed before coring once extracted the ice cores were removed from the ice corer and tightly wrapped in clean plastic bags using annotations to identify the depth and polarity of samples during transport ice cores were kept at temperatures below zero and then stored in a freezer until further subsampling procedures after cleaning ice debris from the hole in the ice river water under the ice cover was collected using a specially designed pole to ensure that only water from the river located approximately 1 m under the ice was collected the pole design allows for submerging the hdpe bottle with its mouth facing downwards until the desired sampling depth is reached and then reversing the polarity of the bottle to allow it to fill with river water this precaution is conducted to avoid potential contamination of the river water sample by ice crystals from the coring procedure the samples were taken directly from 60 ml hdpe bottles the samples were stored in a refrigerator maintained at 4 c until stable isotope analyses the samples were collected to allow for a comparison with the corresponding bottom ice samples to evaluate the water ice fractionation factor these subsampling steps required for the ice cores to be conducted under freezing temperatures to avoid melting either in a freezing room of the uqat or outside when the air temperature was significantly below the freezing point the ice cores were systematically cut in half lengthwise with a band saw and sub sampled into 5 cm long half cylinders these half cylinders were cut in layers to allow the collection of one subsample at each 5 cm interval the external part of the subsamples was then removed using a band saw these procedures were performed to allow for collecting small subsamples from the center of the core while the external part of the core potentially contaminated by under ice water flowing into the corer during the field sampling procedure was discarded the extra half of the core cut lengthwise was kept in a freezer as a backup the ice subsamples were stored in clean tightly sealed bags and left to melt at 4 c in a refrigerator as soon as the ice melted completely the water was transferred to 30 ml hdpe bottles tightly sealed and kept at 4 c until stable isotope analyses 5 stable isotope analysis each water sample was injected 1 microliter and measured 10 times the first two injections of each sample were rejected to limit memory effects qu et al 2020 three internal reference waters δ 18o 0 23 0 06 13 74 0 07 20 35 0 10 δ 2h 1 28 0 27 98 89 1 12 155 66 0 69 were

2992,this study aims at evaluating the hydrological balance of large watersheds of the canadian shield in the james bay area in northwestern quebec canada the focus is set on six rivers of the canadian shield altogether draining more than 185 000 km2 of the boreal shield taiga shield and hudson plains ecozones of canada river discharge measurements geochemical data δ 2h δ 18o and electrical conductivity ec of water remote sensing and gis models are used jointly to calculate water balances the approach allows for partitioning the influence of rainwater snowmelt surface runoff evaporation transpiration and groundwater discharge to the hydrological balances of watersheds on an annual basis the results suggest that runoff from rainwater 30 61 of total precipitation and snowmelt 18 40 of total precipitation are the main contributions to river discharge while the contribution of groundwater discharge to rivers represents 12 of the total precipitation over the study area this contribution represents 2 5 km3 of water the stable isotope mass balances allow for estimating watershed scale evaporation over inflow ratios ranging between 2 and 10 and suggest that transpiration has an isotopic composition close to summer rainwater the hydrological balances further suggest that the total pool of water stored in the active portion of watersheds represents 10 20 of the total annual precipitation while the exports of groundwater beyond the limits of surface watersheds are negligible the seasonal trends in the hydrological balances of monitored watersheds were further documented to provide insights into the sensitivity of watersheds as they face climate change the observations are used to propose recommendations for monitoring of rivers in the canadian shield and to identify future research needs keywords hydrological mass balances groundwater river discharge stable isotope boreal shield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a quantitative evaluation of the hydrological balance of watersheds is needed to better understand the impacts of climate change and human activities on water resources kingston et al 2020 obtaining this knowledge is especially challenging in vast and remote areas where data acquisition is complex and costly to overcome this challenge remote sensing data and spatial precipitation models are increasingly used for estimating components of the terrestrial water budget such as change in water storage precipitation evapotranspiration and surface water discharge in watersheds sahoo et al 2011 pan et al 2012 yao et al 2014 however groundwater storage and fluxes often remain poorly documented in large scale hydrological balances ward 2016 although the changes in the water storage in watersheds can be estimated from grace satellites the approach does not allow for distinguishing between shallow groundwater and surface water storage and the coarse spatial resolution of the data makes them more suitable for continental or global scale analyses than for regional groundwater flow systems mccabe et al 2017 amanambu et al 2020 the water storage within the active portion of watersheds i e the portion of a watershed where hydrological fluxes have a significant impact on the annual hydrological balance of the watershed as a whole is rarely measured partly because the volume of aquifers is often not well known nevertheless it is recognized that groundwater represents the largest freshwater reservoir at the global scale oki and kanae 2006 gleeson et al 2016 and the estimated contribution of groundwater to global river discharge reaches 10 oki and kanae 2006 in some watersheds of the canadian shield groundwater fluxes and their interactions with surface waters are expected to be limited gleeson et al 2009 despite this fact without a broader and improved evaluation of the role of groundwater in the water balance of watersheds the development of measures to protect the water resources and associated biodiversity could be compromised this lack of knowledge imposes major limitations for land management kløve et al 2014a kløve et al 2014b sophocleous 2002 and results in an increased vulnerability of ecosystems alley et al 2002 hayashi and rosenberry 2002 bertrand et al 2012 kløve et al 2014a and local communities that depend on groundwater since the direct evaluation of groundwater fluxes is complex groundwater surface waters interactions are most often studied based on observations on surface waters river monitoring is particularly relevant to the evaluation of hydrological and geochemical processes taking place at the watershed scale the geochemical balances based on the fluxes exported by large rivers allowed for quantifying chemical weathering processes at the global scale gaillardet et al 1999 dupré et al 2003 in addition several studies revealed the potential of geochemical tracers and more specifically stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o and electrical conductivity ec for partitioning the sources contribution of streamflow klaus and mcdonnell 2013 luhmann et al 2012 such approaches were proven efficient in different environments

2016 rey et al 2018 however river monitoring during the ice on season is challenging and rarely performed due to 1 safety issues during sampling on ice especially at the beginning and at the end of the season 2 difficulties related to discharge measurements under the ice 3 water sampling constraints due to quick freezing in sampling tubes and bottles when the air temperature is significantly below zero and 4 constraints associated with ice formation on probes used for in situ physicochemical measurements a potential solution to the challenges raised above could be the use of isotope profiles in ice formed on surface waters during the freeze up period gibson and prowse 1999 2002 nevertheless few studies have exploited this approach and to date the understanding of hydrological processes during freezing periods remains fragmentary due to the gaps quantification of the components of the watershed water balance is undervalued especially in vast and remote areas fitting in the pre established context the general objective of this study is to contribute to the development of methods for evaluating hydrological balances in vast and remote watersheds the specific objectives are to contribute to the improvement of methods for 1 evaluating groundwater fluxes and storage 2 quantifying transpiration fluxes and 3 documenting hydrological fluxes during the frozen period the approach focuses on the use of large scale datasets remote sensing and spatial models coupled with river discharge and geochemical monitoring δ 2h δ 18o and ec the focus is set on watersheds of the canadian shield on the east coast of james bay northwestern quebec canada ultimately broader recommendations are proposed to improve methodological approaches to assessing watershed water balance 2 study area the study area covers 185 000 km2 of the canadian shield in the anischnabe south and cree north first nations territories on the east coast of james bay northwestern quebec canada fig 1 a it includes the watersheds of the harricana nottaway rupert broadback pontax and eastmain rivers of the james bay basin within the boreal shield taiga shield and hudson plains ecozones marshall et al 1999 under natural conditions the rivers of the area generally present a bimodal hydrograph with lowest discharge at the end of the freezing period winter baseflow highest discharge during the spring snowmelt followed by summer baseflow and slightly increased discharge in the fall season the northern part of the study area is characterized by extensive hydroelectric installations which have significantly altered the natural pattern of streamflow woo et al 2008 woo and thorne 2009 nevertheless southern rivers are among the last naturally flowing non fragmented large boreal rivers of the james bay area dynesius and nilsson 1994 nilsson et al 2005 grill et al 2019 the region is part of the superior geological province a component of the canadian shield fig 1b surficial deposits inherited from the last glaciation deglaciation cycle cover most of the lowlands and bedrock depressions hardy 1977 the extent and architecture of these surficial deposits and the characteristics of associated granular aquifers are described in nadeau et al 2021 watersheds of the study area are part of the hudson james and ungava bays basin where measurable changes in discharge are observed owing to recent climate change and human activities déry et al 2005 woo et al 2008 as previously stated by nadeau et al 2021 the area is increasingly coveted for its natural resources mainly forestry and mining its hydroelectric potential and the presence of vast unconfined granular aquifers recognized for groundwater quantity and quality cloutier et al 2016 nadeau et al 2015 nadeau et al 2018 nadeau et al 2021 human pressures on the northern part of the study area are forecasted to increase significantly in the coming years particularly in the context of the plan nord an initiative of the government of quebec which targets increased economic development in this territory 3 method 3 1 theoretical and conceptual models 3 1 1 conceptual model of the hydrological balance of watersheds the hydrological balance of watersheds can be expressed with four major components 1 δ s i q riv e t where all terms are expressed as fluxes l 3 t and δ s is the change in water storage within the entire watershed i is the total atmospheric inflow to the watershed as rain r and snow s such as i r s q riv is the total river discharge at the outlet of the watershed and et is the evapotranspiration such as et q e q t where q e is the evaporation q t is the transpiration the surface runoff from rain q r and snowmelt q s and the discharge of shallow groundwater q sgw in springs streams lakes rivers and in inland discharge areas that reach the hydrographic network will partly be evaporated q e within connected lakes and exported out of the watershed as river discharge q riv here it is assumed that transpiration occurs within watersheds before waters reach the interconnected lakes and rivers of the hydrographic network whereas evaporation occurs within the interconnected lakes and rivers of the hydrographic network based on these assumptions transpiration occurs within watersheds but the q riv term represents a balance between q r q s q sgw and q e 2 q riv q s q r q sgw q e the terms can be shown in a conceptual model representing the main components of the hydrological balance fig 2 a the q dgw refers to the deep groundwater flux exported from the watershed without reaching the hydrographic network either through coastal groundwater discharge or inter basin hydrological exchanges previous work by luijendijk et al 2020 suggest that the groundwater discharge towards james bay from the coastal watersheds of study area is negligible the shallower groundwater flow systems found in unconfined aquifers are more dynamic than the deeper groundwater flow systems found in confined aquifers where the average residence time was estimated to reach thousands of years in in a region proximal to the study area boucher et al 2015 while most geochemical results reveal that groundwater found in the unconfined aquifers of the study area show low dissolved solids contents suggesting short water residence times cloutier et al 2016 the equation 2 does not directly involve the transpiration and storage difference terms thus the β term is introduced to represent the amount of water lost by watersheds due to transpiration q t and the change in water storage within the watershed δ s equation 3 this water never reaches the hydrographic network but is involved in processes occurring within watersheds upstream of water courses the β term corresponds to the imbalance between the total annual precipitation reaching watersheds and the fluxes from runoff q r q s and shallow groundwater q sgw reaching water courses before evaporation occurs 3 β q t δ s r s q s q r q sgw 3 1 2 stable isotopic mass balance of hydrological balance the detailed hydrological balance equation 3 can further be coupled with the isotopic composition δ of water 4 β δ β q t δ wcp δ s δ δ s r δ r s δ s q s δ s q r δ r q sgw δ sgw where δ is the isotopic composition of water either δ 2 h or δ 18 o expressed in against vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow with subscripts corresponding to the terms defined in equation 1 to 3 fig 2a the δ wcp refers to the water potentially consumed by plants transpiration is expected to cause isotope fractionation at the leaf atmosphere interface benettin et al 2021 while water uptake by roots is assumed as a simplification to cause negligible fractionation despite some evidences from the scientific literature poca et al 2019 the stable isotope compositions of atmospheric inflows δ i including rain δ r and snow δ s can be interpolated over vast regions based on quantitative models bowen and revenaugh 2003 terzer et al 2013 under the conditions prevailing in the study area it is assumed that the δ sgw and δ δ s is similar to δ i consistent with previous observations conducted in the abitibi témiscamingue region south of the study area castelli 2012 rey et al 2018 and with assumptions used in previous studies st amour et al 2005 gibson et al 2016 in this context δ wcp can be isolated from equation 4 5 δ wcp β δ β δ s δ i et q e here it is assumed that the uptake of water by plants does not significantly influence the δ 2 h δ 18 o and ec of the remaining soil water 3 1 3 annual cycle of the sources of river discharge the isotopic composition δ riv and electrical conductivity ec of water in boreal rivers is expected to follow an annual cycle mainly controlled by the components identified in equation 2 q r q s q e and q sgw e g see st amour et al 2005 during winter baseflow the proportional contribution of groundwater reaches a maximum it is thus expected that the highest ec riv will be measured during this period while δ riv is expected to be close to the average annual isotopic composition of precipitation during snowmelt both ec riv and δ riv are expected to decrease due to dilution by melting snow during the warm period both ec riv and δ riv are expected to increase gradually due to evaporation the loop illustrated in fig 3 extends beyond the triangle defined by the three inflows q r q s and q sgw in the ec vs δ plots during the late summer and fall because of evaporation which causes heavy isotope enrichment and a slight increase in ec in surface waters the δ riv and ec riv at a given point along a river will represent an integrated composition inherited from hydrogeochemical processes that occurred at the scale of the watershed located upstream of the sampling site an end members mixing analysis emma with four unknown can thus be used to partitioning streamflow components and documenting processes occurring in watersheds 6 q riv q s q r q sgw q e 1 the geochemical tracers δ and ec can further be used 7 δ riv q s δ s q r δ r q s g w δ s g w q e δ e w i t h δ 2 h a n d δ 18 o 8 e c riv q s e c s q r e c r q s g w ec s g w q e e c e 3 1 4 riverine process during the ice on period after the high waters of the fall period river discharge is expected to present a gradual decrease during the ice on period until reaching winter baseflow conditions fig 2b under ice on conditions terms used by gibson and prowse 1999 2002 which refer to the period when river is covered by ice the contribution from runoff decreases and large rivers mainly drain large lakes and groundwater during this period the water in rivers freezes and the isotopic evolution of river water over time can potentially be deduced from ice cores if the effective ice water isotopic separation ε eff representing the difference between the isotopic composition of the basal ice δ basalice and that of the sub ice water δ sub i c e w a t e r is known 9 ε eff δ basalice δ sub i c e w a t e r if ε eff can be estimated ice cores collected at the end of the ice on period could provide key insights on the isotopic composition of river water during the winter period a time at which river monitoring and water samples collection is difficult gibson and prowse 1999 2002 3 2 hydrological measurements and data sources 3 2 1 atmospheric fluxes from remote sensing and models precipitation r and s and evapotranspiration et can be estimated based on remote sensing datasets and spatial models details of the data used are provided in table 1 these datasets are aggregated to obtain mean and range of the cumulative values of monthly water inflows and outflows for each of the studied watersheds the precipitation fluxes from the beginning of november to the end of march are used for estimating the flux weighted value of s and fluxes from april to october are use for estimating the flux weighted value of r fig 2b 3 2 2 discharge measurements in situ river discharges were measured using a sontek riversurveyor m9 acoustic doppler current profiler adcp specific details of the method used to measure the flow are provided in appendix 1 overall 53 stream flows were measured according to 236 profiles realized at 22 sites in 2018 2019 fig 1a supplementary material 1 in addition three hydrometric stations operated by the government of quebec melcc 2020 are located in the study area ha bm wm fig 1a a total of 27 adcp profiles were carried out near these hydrometric stations to allow for comparisons discharge measurements were scheduled to collect data during the spring freshet the summer baseflow and the autumn high waters the baseflow at the end of winter ice on period is assumed to be proportional to the watershed area according to 10 q bf 4 5 10 9 m s a where q bf is the river baseflow m3 s and a is the catchment area m2 this empirical relation is based on a compilation of historical baseflow measurements from 10 hydrometric stations located in study area melcc 2020 3 3 geochemical measurements and data sources 3 3 1 precipitation during this study 61 samples of monthly precipitation were collected at three monitoring stations fig 1a from may 2018 to october 2019 in addition five composite samples were also collected to estimate the average δ 2 h δ 18 o and ec of the snowpack fig 1a samples were collected at the end of the ice on period just before snowmelt to obtain composite samples of the snow accumulated during the entire winter specific details about the sampling methods are provided in appendix 2 the δ 2 h and δ 18 o of precipitation including rain and snow can further be interpolated over vast regions based on quantitative models bowen and revenaugh 2003 here the measured isotopic compositions of precipitation are used for comparisons with the regionalized cluster based water isotope prediction model rcwip terzer et al 2013 3 3 2 river water sampling river waters were collected downstream of rapids or near the center of the main channel of rivers to obtain well mixed samples specific details of this sampling method are provided in appendix 3 overall 222 samples were collected within 21 sub watersheds fig 1a sampling frequency depended on the sites accessibility and was mainly synchronized with discharge measurements the harricana river sampled in the city of amos site ha in fig 1a is used as the main reference station because it was monitored at a greater frequency daily monitoring during spring freshet for a total of 75 samples collected over 18 months the number of samples collected at each site is provided in supplementary material 2 3 3 3 river ice sampling river ice cores were collected at 11 sites fig 1a at the end of winter in 2018 and 2019 using a kovacs mark ii corer this corer allows for retrieving 9 cm diameter ice cores in 1 m long sections specific details about the ice coring method and ice samples preparation are provided in appendix 4 3 3 4 stable isotope analyses δ2h and δ18o all samples were analyzed at the geotop laboratory université du québec in montréal with a lgr los gatos research model t lwia 45 ep off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy oa icos device specific details of stable isotope analyses are provided in appendix 5 results are given in delta units δ in vs vsmow overall 491 samples containing waters from rivers rain snow snowpack and ice cores were analyzed for δ 2h and δ 18o 3 4 the end members mixing analysis emma the emma based on equations 6 to 8 is solved using matrix calculations the values that must be attributed to endmembers can represent different periods of time depending on the water residence time in the catchment a single flux weighted average value can be used for δ s because the spring freshet generally consists of one major event in the hydrograph of large boreal rivers the δ r term can be more variable and cause uncertainties in calculations due to the unknown residence time of water in the watersheds nevertheless in large watersheds the transit time and distance of water flow must likely result in a mixing process that buffers the seasonal variability inherited from rainfall as observed in other northern watersheds ala aho et al 2018 a single flux weighted average δ r value is thus used to solve equation 7 the δ sgw are assumed to be invariant over time the δ r δ s and δ sgw are estimated for each watershed based on flux weighted data from the rcwip terzer et al 2013 minimal and maximal values of atmospheric inflows are used to estimate uncertainties on the emma the ec r and ec s are estimated based on field data and assumed to be homogeneous in space and time the ec sgw term is not known a priori and must be estimated based on assumptions related to the hydrogeological context of watersheds tóth 1999 here it is estimated based on the data pertaining to the ec of groundwater in the main types of aquifers of the canadian shield in abitibi témiscamingue these aquifers include unconfined granular aquifers uga unconfined bedrock aquifers uba and confined aquifers ca with respective approximated σ values of 150 μs cm 400 μs cm and 500 μs cm based on results from cloutier et al 2016 rey et al 2018 for each watershed the proportion of each type of aquifer in terms of coverage in the xy plane are estimated based on the groundwater flow conditions for calculating these proportions only the shallowest aquifer is considered in every point of the territory fig 1a for example the bedrock aquifers are only considered if no sediment is found above the value assigned for ec sgw corresponds to the composite ec of groundwater in unconfined aquifers this seems realistic as groundwater surface water hydrological exchanges are likely to occur preferentially in shallow unconfined aquifer areas although it is not feasible to precisely constrain the ec sgw value three scenarios of ec sgw are tested for solving emma table 2 these scenarios allowed for quantifying the sensitivity of calculations the evaporating vapour δ e will be depleted in heavy isotopes as the residual liquid water surface water undergoes a gradual heavy isotopes enrichment during the evaporation process and tends to define local evaporation lines lel basal plane in fig 3 evaporation also contributes to increase ec riv as dissolved solids tend to remain in the liquid phase during evaporation while the evaporated moisture has few dissolved solids ec e 0 the δ e term can be estimated using a simplified version of the craig and cordon 1965 model gibson et al 1993 7 δ e δ riv h δ a ε 1 h where δ riv is the flux weighted isotopic composition of river h the relative humidity δ a is the moisture composition of ambient air assumed to be in equilibrium with the flux weighted average isotopic composition of local precipitation and ε is the total isotope fractionation gibson et al 1993 gibson and edwards 2002 skrzypek et al 2015 the δ 2 h and δ 18 o of atmospheric moisture δ a during the ice off period can be estimated based on the assumption that it is in equilibrium with δ i and using an average air temperature 15 c representing the prevailing conditions during the ice off season the liquid vapour isotopic fractionation factor α v l can be estimated based on the horita and wesolowski 1994 equations 4 results 4 1 hydrological results the average annual atmospheric inflows i for entire region ranged between 880 11 m yr in 2018 and 849 10 mm yr in 2019 the precipitation patterns depict the effects of a marked seasonality fig 4 and a significant decrease of inflows with increasing latitude 50 and 70 mm φ in 2018 and 2019 respectively the precipitation reached approximately 1000 mm yr in the southern watersheds and approximately 700 mm yr in the northern watersheds late summer and early autumn periods are characterized by the highest humidity with precipitation reaching an average of 150 mm month in september and october 2018 during the ice on period conditions are dryer with average precipitation mainly snow 50 mm month the winter precipitation represented 29 and 32 of total water inflow in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 5 the month of april marks a transition with both liquid and solid precipitation and measurable et in some areas the et decreases with increasing latitudes 35 and 20 mm φ in 2018 and 2019 respectively from north to south the et reached 230 to 390 mm yr and 275 to 370 mm yr in 2018 and 2019 respectively with an average of 305 17 mm yr and 321 28 mm yr for the entire study area in spring and early summer the et flux was equal to rainfall in 2018 and 2019 maximum et rates are observed in late spring and early summer reaching approximately 100 mm month the et fluxes decrease from august to november the i values calculated from the imerg dataset are 20 lower than that calculated from the capa model the models available for estimating the et term also show discrepancies as the modis dataset yields estimates of et that are 29 lower than those of the ssebop dataset the results obtained from discharge measurements are shown in fig 6 and provided in supplementary material 1 the reproducibility obtained for repeated adcp profiles at each site ranged between 0 4 and 50 1 for a median value of 3 9 greater errors were observed when profiles were collected under low flow conditions especially under windy conditions eight adcp flow measurements were conducted close to governmental hydrometric stations comparisons made between field results and data from hydrometric stations revealed differences within 4 for six out of the eight flow measurements while the two other sites showed differences of 9 and 15 the calculated discharge values range between 5 and 8 m3 s in the head waters of the harricana bell and chibougamau rivers sites hv bs cc fig 1a and 2300 m3 s during the spring flood near the outlet of the nottaway river site nbj fig 1a the monitored rivers depict bimodal hydrographs with highest discharge during snowmelt may june decreasing discharge during the summer period july september increased flow during the fall period october november and a return to baseflow conditions during the ice on period november april the results suggest that peak discharge over winter baseflow ratios range between 3 7 and 16 5 overall the estimated δs values range between 208 mm yr and 131 mm yr these values correspond to proportions of 20 to 15 of the average i fig 5 4 2 geochemical results the complete geochemical dataset δ 2 h δ 18 o ec t do ph orp from this study is provided in supplementary material 2 to 5 while table 3 and fig 7 provide a summary of available results the measured isotopic compositions of precipitation monthly composite samples of r and s and accumulated snowpack samples range from 200 4 in january to 50 3 in july for δ 2 h and 27 1 in january to 6 9 in june for δ 18 o the data allow for estimating the slope and intercept of the observed lmwl δ 2 h 7 82 δ 18 o 6 75 fig 8 a b this regression is close to the lmwl calculated from rcwip model δ 2 h 7 82 δ 18 o 8 35 based on average isotopic data for each sub watershed locally the measured isotopic compositions of precipitation present average absolute differences of 16 3 and 2 0 with the rcwip for δ 2 h and δ 18 o respectively rainfall samples from april to october 2018 yielded an average ec of 19 5 μs cm with a standard deviation of 21 μs cm while samples from the snowpack yielded ec values ranging between 4 4 μs cm and 13 5 μs cm for an average of 6 8 μs cm the δ 2 h and δ 18 o results obtained for river waters ranged from 128 3 to 75 7 and 17 7 to 9 9 respectively fig 8b c the lowest and highest δ 2 h and δ 18 o values were recorded during spring snowmelt and summer baseflow respectively the δ 2 h and δ 18 o of winter baseflow range from 107 8 to 85 2 and 14 5 to 11 62 respectively the ec measured in rivers suggest values ranging from 10 4 μs cm to 159 8 μs cm with an average of 47 5 μs cm table 3 the ec values increased slightly during winter and reached a maximum at the end of the ice on period followed by a marked decrease during spring flood within the study region the rcwip data suggest 5 2 φ and 0 63 φ gradients in the δ 2 h and δ 18 o of precipitation respectively based on annual flux weighted values of watershed a similar gradient is also observed in the flux weighted isotopic composition of rivers with 5 4 φ and 0 67 φ for δ 2 h and δ 18 o respectively the river water samples revealed that q riv tend to plot below the lmwl in δ 2 h vs δ 18 o cross plots fig 8a the flux weighted average river discharge is enriched by approximately 1 to 9 and 0 7 to 2 0 for δ 2 h and δ 18 o respectively compared to the modelled flux weighted average isotopic composition of precipitation these observations likely reflect the heavy isotope enrichment inherited from evaporation processes the annual flux weighted river composition at site cc presents the greatest heavy isotope enrichment with respect to others monitored sites 15 and 3 0 for δ 2 h and δ 18 o respectively but the peak discharge associated with snowmelt was likely missed at this site 4 3 river ice logging the δ 2 h and δ 18 o results obtained from 192 river ice samples allowed for constructing 20 vertical profiles of river ice the complete dataset is provided in supplementary material 5 overall the length of the ice cores ranged between approximately 0 3 m and 1 0 m and δ 2 h and δ 18 o of the ice samples ranged from 66 4 to 213 1 and 8 6 to 29 0 respectively while congelation ice which result from freezing of river water was observed in most ice cores 13 out of 20 only four of the cores had sufficient thicknesses to allow for reconstructing a profile based on 5 cm samples in these four ice cores the results revealed constant δ 2 h and δ 18 o values suggesting an invariant isotopic composition of river water during the ice on period the results did not show a progressive depletion in δ 2 h and δ 18 o in congelation ice and rayleigh type conditions are thus unlikely in the studied watersheds gibson and prowse 1999 the isotopic composition of sub ice waters was compared to δ 2 h and δ 18 o of the basal congelation ice this comparison allowed the calculation of the effective ice water isotopic separation ε eff with values of 2 66 0 5 and 17 59 2 29 for δ 18o and δ 2h respectively these results are similar to the εeff of 2 84 0 34 and 17 9 3 9 found by gibson and prowse 2002 in northwestern canada 4 4 deciphering the sources of river discharge the extent of the calculations depends on the availability of data for each sub watershed see fig 1 detailed calculations are proposed for rivers that have been subject to intensive monitoring while qualitative interpretations are proposed for the sub basins where the data are fragmentary the estimated values of reference for ec sgw range between 289 and 393 μs cm fig 7 the range of results obtained from emma for each sub basin are shown in fig 5 it suggests that the runoff from rain reaching rivers represents 30 to 61 of i and that the runoff of the melting of snow reaching rivers represents 18 to 40 of i the shallow groundwater flux reaching rivers is estimated to range between 0 and 12 of i it is further estimated that 2 to 10 of i is returned to the atmosphere by evaporation the calculations from the ec sgw scenarios suggest that the values used for partitioning streamflow components strongly influence the results site ha is used to discuss the sensitivity of calculations to the ec sgw values at this site the calculated annual contribution of groundwater to river discharge ranges between 8 and 25 of i for the lowest and highest ec sgw endmember values respectively for large scale watersheds a composite value integrating multiple aquifer water sources is more likely to represent regional flow pattern in that sense for the monitored watersheds the river discharge from groundwater is constrained between 1 7 and 4 9 km3 yr this regional contribution represents 3 of i 5 discussion 5 1 the hydrological budget of watersheds the imerg and capa models both suggest dryer conditions for the northernmost watersheds in comparison to the southernmost watersheds this pattern is consistent with previously reported climate data that suggests colder and dryer conditions in more northern areas within the study region phillips 1990 berteaux et al 2018 the modis and ssebop data further suggest that the et fluxes decrease northwards likely due to a shorter ice off period characterized by lower temperatures the i and et gradients section 5 1 do not completely balance each other and as a result the watershed area normalized river discharges expressed in mm yr km2 show a gradient of 25 mm φ this finding implies that the area normalized hydrological fluxes from the study area decrease northwards in the past decades a positive trend was observed in the river discharge of the james bay area déry et al 2016 and it is expected that global warming will increase hydrological fluxes by mid century hennigs and bleau 2017 macdonald et al 2018 stadnyk and déry 2021 these changes could entail changes in gradients and generate proportionally more significant impacts in the northeast portion of the study area where current climatic conditions are dryer and colder one key feature of the hydrological balance of watershed is that annual δs are smaller where hydrometric stations provide daily measurements of river discharge in these cases the annual δs are 7 of i overall the most precise and reliable discharge data suggest that i e t q riv in this context the cumulative discharge from the studied watersheds can be estimated from river discharge with values reaching 109 km3 in 2018 and 100 km3 in 2019 the mean streamflow of these rivers between 1964 and 2013 was comparatively lower 90 6 km3 déry et al 2016 overall the q riv fluxes correspond to 65 and 62 of the i for 2018 and 2019 the remaining fraction is attributed to et based on the calculations it is estimated that the contribution of groundwater ranges between 0 and 12 depending on the catchment area these observations tend to confirm previous observations suggesting limited groundwater fluxes within the canadian shield aquifers gleeson et al 2009 nevertheless southern watersheds presented higher contributions of groundwater that could be attributed to a greater thickness of granular sediments in areas with lower sediments thickness nadeau et al 2021 flows are rather defined by the bedrock topography the groundwater contribution to baseflow was also more significant for catchments in located in the southern part of study area the data suggest a decrease in groundwater contribution to river discharge watersheds of the james bay lowlands where clay deposits are widespread and unconfined granular aquifers are sparse nadeau et al 2021 in the james bay lowlands the hydrological regime is likely more dependent on discharge from wetlands orlova and branfireun 2014 the role of groundwater fluxes in the hydrological balance of the studied watersheds is consistent with the hypothesis that groundwater flows from recharge areas to rivers mainly through shallow groundwater flow systems sykes et al 2009 under such conditions water transit within aquifers could act as a buffer to hydrological variations in rivers without modifying the total annual discharge of rivers it is expected that the hydrological response of rivers will be more dynamic in watersheds where the runoff recharge ratio is greater and dampened in watersheds where the runoff recharge ratio is smaller 5 2 the seasonality of river water sources the data and calculations allow for quantifying the seasonal cycle in the sources of river waters fig 9 a the cycle is illustrated conceptually in fig 9b where the ice on baseflow conditions are characterized by the highest groundwater contributions fig 9b 1 following the ice on baseflow the relative contribution of snowmelts can reach up to 80 of the discharge during the early spring freshet fig 9b 2 3 this significant contribution lead to surface water depletion which is not systematically observed in northern watershed ala aho et al 2018 the peak of heavy isotope depletion in water is observed early in the spring freshet a time at which field sampling conditions are particularly difficult during the ice off season the discharge gradually decreases to reach summer baseflow conditions during this period the relative contribution of the rain endmember gradually increases and a slight increase in the shallow groundwater contribution is also observed fig 9b 4 the onset of the fall highwaters following the ice off baseflow conditions then reveals a period during which the contribution from rainwaters can reach 80 fig 9b 5 the sources of water discharge at site ha estimated from the emma fig 9c reveals that the temporal variations in the groundwater contribution to river discharge is significantly smaller than that of the rain and snow endmembers the contribution from runoff originating from snowmelt is observed through the entire ice off period while that of runoff originating from rainwater is bimodal with an increased relative contribution in the fall period the evaporation flux is observed through the entire ice off period and reaches a maximum value in the fall when waters that have undergone summer evaporation are drained by rivers while the δs term is likely to be close to zero on an annual basis significant changes are observed on monthly timescales here the data suggest that the water storage in watersheds reaches maximum values from autumn to the end of the ice on period due to humid conditions at the end of the ice off period followed by low river discharge and snow accumulation during the ice on period the water storage in watersheds reaches minimum values during the early summer period due to high discharge during freshet and increased et during the early ice off period at the watershed scale the data suggest an active storage of water representing about 10 to 20 of the annual i this transient storage presents a cycle with an amplitude of 10 to 18 based on this observation it can be postulated that the reduction of the duration of ice on period due to global warming will reduce the maximum storage in watersheds in response to a decrease in snow accumulation and an earlier peak in et at the onset of the ice off period 5 3 understanding riverine processes during the ice on period the collected ice cores tend to present two main types of ice consistent with observations from previous studies ferrick et al 2002 gibson and prowse 1999 2002 a significant layer of snow ice which is a mixture of precipitation and surface water generally overlies the congelation ice which is formed by the freezing of streamflow water the isotopic patterns measured in zones with congelation ice are considered to represent the conditions illustrated on the left side of the conceptual model fig 10 the stable conditions observed during the ice on period are attributed to the constant supply of water from large lakes and groundwater in these zones river water freezing must exceed ice erosion seven of the 20 ice cores samples did not show clean congelation ice the comparison between the isotopic composition of sub ice water and that of ice reveals negative ε eff values these values are most likely caused by the presence of a basal ice that is depleted in heavy isotopes due to snow ice mixing as illustrated in the central part of fig 10 gibson and prowse 2002 suggested that the proximity of rapids and the presence of layers of slush or liquid water are non ideal conditions for congelation ice formation another plausible explanation is that ice erosion exceeds ice formation such conditions were observed in areas where the river section is reduced i e shallower or narrower causing higher flowrates under the ice it was also observed that some ice cores presented a heterogeneous structure with variable δ 2 h and δ 18 o compositions right side of fig 10 in these zones the ice cover consists of an accumulation of ice debris in zones where the morphology of the riverbed entails conditions that are prone to ice jam overall the ice cores from rivers should be collected in areas where rivers are narrow and deep left side of fig 10 if the research objective is to document the isotopic composition of river water during the ice on period the zones where the rivers are wide should be avoided as there might be a channel of active flow and zones of stagnant water below the ice the zones corresponding to the patterns depicted on the right side of the conceptual model should also be avoided in the harricana river in amos site ha the presence of rapids significantly increases the streamflow velocity leaving the water surface free of ice all year long it was therefore possible to monitor the isotopic composition of water at this site during the ice on period the results shown a progressive depletion in heavy isotopes in river water during the ice on period nevertheless it revealed that river water during the ice on baseflow is enriched in heavy isotopes compared to groundwater suggesting a non negligible contribution from the rain endmember throughout the winter moreover the increasing value of the d xs observed during winter at this site suggests that with ice cover evaporated water at the surface of lakes is mixed with underlying water or freeze in small tributary river and further released into the spring freshet 5 4 insights on water consumed by plants the isotopic composition of the water potentially consumed by plants δ wcp equation 5 range from 107 7 to 55 1 for δ 2 h and from 14 81 to 8 14 for δ 18 o fig 11 these values are generally enriched in heavy isotopes compared to the flux weighted average isotopic composition of precipitation δ i although major uncertainties remain about reliability of δ wcp estimates beyer and penna 2021 the δ wcp estimated here suggest that plants mainly consume water from summer rains while this might seem obvious it raises an important question on groundwater recharge processes if plants preferentially removes water from summer rains why is the groundwater isotopic composition very similar to the flux weighted average isotopic composition of precipitation δ i one plausible explanation is that the infiltration process could be less efficient during the snowmelt period due to frozen soils therefore limiting the recharge of waters that are significantly depleted in heavy isotopes and balancing the effect of transpiration which limits the recharge of waters that are significantly enriched in heavy isotopes this explanation would imply that within the study area groundwater recharge mainly occurs shortly after the snowmelt period when transpiration by plants is still limited and towards the end of the ice off season when colder conditions and less daylight reduce vegetation growth 5 5 uncertainties and perspectives the monitoring approach used in this study allows for documenting hydrological processes and seasonal changes occurring within watersheds the results suggest that the isotopic compositions of precipitation from rcwip provide reliable values that could be used for future large scale studies being able to use rcwip is an advantage because monthly monitoring of precipitation can be challenging in remote areas one shortcoming pertaining to precipitation is that in the present study the potential effect of sublimation on the snowpack was not considered while previous studies suggested that the loss of snow by sublimation can reach 40 in boreal regions pomeroy et al 1998 in addition the effects of isotopic fractionation during snowmelt were not considered here although such processes are known to occur taylor et al 2001 this could lead to uncertainties in the evaluation of rivers water balance future research focusing on river monitoring would benefit from evaluating these processes through a monitoring of the snowpack during the ice on period and during snowmelt another shortcoming of the present study is that ec sgw remains poorly documented this lack of knowledge increases the uncertainty associated with the quantification of groundwater discharge to rivers while a comprehensive assessment of groundwater quality in the northern part of the canadian shield is not yet feasible mainly due to the lack of groundwater wells one plausible solution would be to monitor groundwater electrical conductivity in groundwater springs with automated probes finally a better knowledge of the residence time of runoff water over large watersheds and the hysteresis observed between q riv and ec riv cana paoli et al 2019 especially during early spring freshet would be needed to improve water budgets despite the shortcomings outlined above comparisons made between hydrological and isotopic data suggest that the use of the emma with a four end member system to quantify the water balance of watershed showed is a promising approach firstly the evaporation over inflow ratio qe i calculated from the hydrological balance is similar to the e i estimated based on the craig and gordon 1965 model fig 5 in addition the results allowed for highlighting future monitoring needs in studied watershed the results suggest that hydrogeochemical monitoring should focus on three main periods the end of the ice on period samples collected during this period are critical to evaluate the maximum groundwater contribution theses samples can further provide information on the ec sgw term which is needed for emma since temporal changes are unlikely to occur during winter baseflow only a limited number of samples is required for this period the spring freshet the sampling frequency must be increased during this period to calculate the sources of river waters during the peak discharge event however water sampling during the spring flood is difficult due to safety issues during this period unstable ice conditions are often observed along rivers shorelines which limits access for sampling in addition large blocks of ice are transported in the rivers during snowmelt which limits the possibility of using small boats for sampling further research aimed at developing safe and efficient protocols for the collection of river samples during snowmelt are therefore much needed the end of the ice off period samples collected at the end of the ice off season provide key information on evaporation processes as the results suggest that the greatest heavy isotope enrichments are observed during this period sampling this period is also important to capture the contribution of rainwater runoff during the high discharge event observed before the onset of the ice on period these recommendations are mainly suited to river monitoring in vast and remote areas characterized by cold and humid climates monitoring programs implemented on rivers in such areas can be costly and logistically complex in addition sampling during the snowmelt period is especially complex the snowmelt can be diachronous due to differences in latitude and altitude among other aspects the spring freshet can be very short if weather conditions such as warm temperatures and heavy rains contribute to snowmelt such events however can only be predicted on short notice therefore it is challenging for a research team to conduct intense monitoring during snowmelt one promising approach would be to develop research partnerships with local communities such partnerships would encourage knowledge sharing focusing on sites located near discharge monitoring stations would help reduce the required field procedures which would also facilitate collaborations with local communities 6 conclusions this study provided new knowledge on the hydrological balance of large watersheds of the canadian shield in the james bay area in northwestern quebec canada such knowledge is critically needed in vast and remote areas such as the northern part of the canadian shield where significant impacts of climate change are expected and where human impacts are continuously increasing the data collected in this study could allow for better predicting the potential impacts of changes in the hydrologic balance on local communities and groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes in addition there is currently a critical lack of knowledge about groundwater resources in northern canada which is partially explained by the lack of groundwater wells and infrastructures that can be used for studying aquifers in this vast and remote area the approach used in this study made it possible to combine remote sensing field monitoring and spatial model data the study provided novel insights on the role of groundwater in the hydrological budgets of watersheds the data suggest that the groundwater fluxes account for 20 of the rivers discharge on an annual basis 12 annual precipitation the calculations also suggest that the total amount of water stored in the active layer of watersheds is equivalent to 10 to 20 of the total precipitation reaching the watersheds moreover the results allowed for documenting atmospheric fluxes from watersheds evaporation estimates from remote sensing data and isotopic mass balances are in agreement both suggest evaporation over inflow ratios in the range of 2 to 10 the calculated isotopic composition of water potentially consumed by plants suggests that summer rains are preferentially transpired by plants and that the pool of soil water from the infiltration that occurred during snowmelt is not the main source of water for plants ice cores collected at the end of the ice on period and containing a sufficient thickness of congelation ice revealed that the isotopic composition of river water is invariant during the ice formation period this suggests that the frequency of river monitoring during winter could be reduced overall the data lead to the conclusion that river monitoring is critically important during three main periods 1 at the end of the ice on period to capture the groundwater contribution during winter baseflow 2 during the spring flood to capture the peak discharge and 3 at the end of the ice off period to estimate evaporation over inflow ratios and capture the high waters of the fall overall the approaches developed and applied here could be transferred to other areas of the canadian shield to improve land management by allowing a better consideration of the water resources and associated ecosystems the development of long term river monitoring networks could provide key insights on the sensitivity of watersheds to climate change and human impacts the development of such monitoring programs through collaborations between governmental agencies universities and local communities could also promote knowledge sharing future work that develops innovative approaches to sampling rivers during snowmelt and estimating the isotopic composition and electrical conductivity of groundwater in vast remote areas seem much needed credit authorship contribution statement s nadeau conceptualization methodology formal analysis

anonymous reviewers for constructive comments that improve this manuscript appendices specific details of the methods 1 discharge measurement from sontek riversurveyor m9 acoustic doppler current profiler adcp the system uses ultrasonic pulses to measure the velocity of suspended sediments transported in water based on the frequency difference between the emitted and received signal simpson 2001 this velocity is interpreted as an analog of the water velocity the profiler further simultaneously calculates the depth of the riverbed and its own speed using a bottom tracking technology le coz et al 2007 the adcp profiler thus allows for measuring the total discharge within a river section when data are collected from one shoreline to the other here the adcp was attached to a boat zodiac canoe or trimaran and displacement was ensured using a small motor paddles or ropes depending on field conditions a hitch was designed to attach the adcp device to the boats to ensure the stability of the profiler and to keep the sensors underwater while conducting measurements profiles were repeated along the same sections with the objective of obtaining a reproducibility within 5 between four measurements when this reproducibility target was not met more measurements were collected the locations of transects were selected according to safety criteria flow conditions and to avoid human infrastructures that could significantly alter measurements 2 precipitation sampling method rain and snow were collected using narrow mouth 1 l hdpe bottles with 4 8 cm funnels equipped with plastic screens at their base to block debris and insects paraffin oil was added to the bottles to prevent evaporation local collaborators were responsible for collecting precipitation and sending the tightly sealed bottles by mail to the laboratory each month snow samples were collected in 10 1 cm inside diameter all weather p 2000 standard rain gauges without cap by the local collaborators snow samples were left to melt overnight and subsequently stored in 1 l hdpe bottles with paraffin oil to prevent evaporation daily samples were mixed to obtain monthly composite samples all composite precipitation samples were subsequently subsampled in 60 ml hdpe bottles and kept at 4 c until stable isotope analysis the five composite samples from the snowpack were collected using 1 m hdpe tubes samples were left to melt at room temperature the melted snowpack samples were then immediately used to measure the electrical conductivity σ and subsampled in 60 ml hdpe bottles that were kept at 4 c until further δ 2 h δ 18 o analyses 3 river water sampling method river water samples were collected either using a small boat or directly from the bank depending on field conditions a rigid pole was used to collect samples approximatively 1 m below the water surface directly into hdpe bottles sampling bottles were rinsed three times with river water before sampling the in situ parameters ph dissolved oxygen conductivity redox potential and temperature were systematically measured using a ysi 556 mps multi parameter probe 4 river ice coring method the snow cover on the ice surface was removed before coring once extracted the ice cores were removed from the ice corer and tightly wrapped in clean plastic bags using annotations to identify the depth and polarity of samples during transport ice cores were kept at temperatures below zero and then stored in a freezer until further subsampling procedures after cleaning ice debris from the hole in the ice river water under the ice cover was collected using a specially designed pole to ensure that only water from the river located approximately 1 m under the ice was collected the pole design allows for submerging the hdpe bottle with its mouth facing downwards until the desired sampling depth is reached and then reversing the polarity of the bottle to allow it to fill with river water this precaution is conducted to avoid potential contamination of the river water sample by ice crystals from the coring procedure the samples were taken directly from 60 ml hdpe bottles the samples were stored in a refrigerator maintained at 4 c until stable isotope analyses the samples were collected to allow for a comparison with the corresponding bottom ice samples to evaluate the water ice fractionation factor these subsampling steps required for the ice cores to be conducted under freezing temperatures to avoid melting either in a freezing room of the uqat or outside when the air temperature was significantly below the freezing point the ice cores were systematically cut in half lengthwise with a band saw and sub sampled into 5 cm long half cylinders these half cylinders were cut in layers to allow the collection of one subsample at each 5 cm interval the external part of the subsamples was then removed using a band saw these procedures were performed to allow for collecting small subsamples from the center of the core while the external part of the core potentially contaminated by under ice water flowing into the corer during the field sampling procedure was discarded the extra half of the core cut lengthwise was kept in a freezer as a backup the ice subsamples were stored in clean tightly sealed bags and left to melt at 4 c in a refrigerator as soon as the ice melted completely the water was transferred to 30 ml hdpe bottles tightly sealed and kept at 4 c until stable isotope analyses 5 stable isotope analysis each water sample was injected 1 microliter and measured 10 times the first two injections of each sample were rejected to limit memory effects qu et al 2020 three internal reference waters δ 18o 0 23 0 06 13 74 0 07 20 35 0 10 δ 2h 1 28 0 27 98 89 1 12 155 66 0 69 were

2993,while the effect of small scale skin has been extensively investigated numerical models incorporating the effect require expensive computational cost due to fine spatial discretization of the skin and have not been widely available this study develops a new model for slug tests at a partially penetrating well in a two zone confined aquifer of skin and formation zones a new basic formulation defines transient flow in the skin with an additional skin factor reflecting the skin storage effect the formulation assumes horizontal flow in the skin with excluding the vertical skin hydraulic conductivity the analytical solution and finite element solution of the model are developed the analytical expression relating the skin factor to the skin specific storage is derived results suggest the formulation is a useful alternative to conventional flow equation for the skin in achieving coarse spatial discretization and low computational cost the present solution agrees well with the field head data obtained from butler 2019 to conclude this study presents theoretical advance and efficient simulation in modeling of well hydraulics keywords skin factor small scale skin zone transient flow slug test analytical solution low computational cost data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction over the last few decades there has been a dramatic increase in the number of publications on the effect of small scale skin zone hereinafter called skin on slug tests the test is one of commonly used aquifer tests in which a small quantity of water is instantaneously extracted from or injected into a well and the response of water level is measured in the slugged well or nearby observation wells the advantages of slug tests include low cost simple procedure and little or even no water treatment the skin produced during the well installation process containing drilling construction and annular fill may extend from millimeters to several meters novakowski 1989 and has different hydraulic properties from the adjacent formation zone hereinafter called formation a positive skin stands for its permeability lower than formation s one but a negative skin for higher permeability yeh and chang 2013 provided a comprehensive review on two kinds of skin treatments for incorporating the skin effect into well hydraulic modeling one kind assumes an infinitesimal width skin and treats the skin as a boundary condition bc depending on a skin factor reflecting the skin permeability effect a variety of skin factors were proposed in the groundwater field e g hawkins 1956 moench and hsieh 1985 moench 1997 and petroleum field e g van everdingen 1953 brons and marting 1961 hong 1975 it however lacks a skin factor reflecting the skin storage effect the other kind treats a finite width skin as an annulus with its own flow equation reflecting both effects of the skin permeability and storage in nature a variety of analytical models were proposed for slug tests with no skin e g cooper et al 1967 butler and zhan 2004 sun 2016 the infinitesimal width skin e g dougherty and babu 1984 kipp 1985 cassiani and kabala 1998 and finite

when analytical solutions for the slug test problems are not trackable sophisticated finite element difference schemes should be applied researchers have developed numerical solutions accounting for various issues such as aquifer heterogeneity and anisotropy e g butler et al 1994 seo and choe 2001 paradis et al 2015 liu et al 2020 inertial effect in wells e g liu et al 2020 reverse water level response in wells e g slack et al 2013 and multi layer effect e g louwyck et al 2012 yang et al 2015 however existing numerical solutions require expensive computational cost due to fine skin discretization in fig 1 for obtaining accurate predictions e g yang et al 2015 paradis et al 2015 2016 sakata et al 2015 and thus have not been widely available simulation based on coarse spatial discretization for example took about 1 of computing time of conducting fine discretization simulation for the problem of surface water groundwater interaction wang et al 2018 xiong et al 2021 therefore the core of all the questions is how to simulate coupled transient flows in skin and formation by numerical solutions based on coarse spatial discretization solving the question meets the practical need of coarse discretization simulation for reducing computational cost e g werner et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 huang et al 2020 gerber et al 2020 this study develops a new model for slug tests at a partially penetrating well ppw in a two zone confined aquifer of skin and formation transient flow in the skin is defined as a new basic formulation including an additional skin factor reflecting the skin storage effect the formulation assumes horizontal flow in the skin with excluding the vertical skin hydraulic conductivity the analytical solution and finite element solution fes of the model are presented with the present solution the analytical expression relating the additional skin factor to the skin specific storage is obtained computational cost of the fes is discussed sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore correlation between hydraulic parameters the application of the present solution to the field slug test of butler 2019 is conducted results of this article conclude with implications for theory research and practice of slug tests 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical models fig 1 illustrates a slug test at a ppw in a two zone confined aquifer the radial distance from the ppw is denoted as r and elevation from the aquifer bottom as z the aquifer has thickness l and infinitely extends in the radial direction the ppw has outer radius r w inner radius r c and screen between z z 1 and z z 2 the flow equations for the formation and skin can be expressed respectively as 1a k r 2 h r 2 1 r h r k z 2 h z 2 s s h t f o r r r w w 1b k r 2 h r 2 1 r h r k z

vertical formation hydraulic conductivities respectively the apostrophe represents the skin a new formulation regarded as an alternative to eq 1b for reducing computational cost is derived as follows eq 1b reduces to eq 2 by assuming horizontal flow in the skin with removing the term k z 2 h z 2 and by integrating the product of 2 π r and each term of the result from r r w to r r w w 2 2 π r w w k

w and an additional skin factor s k reflecting the skin storage effect expressed as 4 2 π r w s k h t r w r w w 2 π r s s h t d r based on eqs 3 4 and the finite difference flux the new formulation for the skin treatment subject to the slug test consists of eqs 5a 5b with extra eq 5c in which the head in the skin is approximated as a linear distribution on the logarithmic polar axis fig 1c such an approximation is valid with minor errors when the radius of influence exceeds the skin formation interface eq 5a assumes both the h and flux are piecewise uniform with the steep continuities near the bottom and top of the screen the h at the middle elevation of the screen is used to approach the head in the ppw the formulation neglects the effects of pipe friction and inertia inside the ppw 5a

present solution is applied to parameter determination based on the field slug test of butler 2019 3 1 the present formulation reflecting skin effect the first point to be discussed is to examine the applicability of the present formulation by comparing predictions of solution 1 and solution 2 the semi analytical solution of dougherty and babu 1984 developed based on eq 16a is also considered the accuracy of solution 1 mainly depends on the skin width represented by w and vertical skin hydraulic conductivity by α for a ppw the extreme value of w exceeds 20 for the typical well radius of r w 0 05 m fig 2 displays the spatiotemporal heads predicted by these three solutions for the negative skin δ 10 2 k r 10 4 m s k z 10 5 m s and positive skin δ 10 k r 10 7 m s k z 10 8 m s with w 1 0 05 m 5 10 and s k δ ln 1 w the head distribution for no skin effect is plotted by solution 2 with δ 1 and γ 1 reflecting aquifer homogeneity define e 1 as the largest relative error in temporal head distributions h predicted by solution 1 and solution 2 the figure shows both solution 1 and solution 2 agree well to the temporal head predictions with e 1 1 the head contours are close fig 2a 2b because solution 1 assumes a linear head distribution in the skin on the logarithmic polar axis by eq 5c the e 1 is below 5 for w 60 fig 2c indicating the present formulation is applicable when the skin width is less than 3 m for the typical radius of r w 0 05 m the variation in α contained only in solution 2 causes minor change in e 1 fig 2d indicating the vertical skin hydraulic conductivity is an insensitive parameter solution 1 with another skin factor s k δ 1 ln 1 w gives almost the same predictions in fig 2 for the positive skin scenarios the other skin factor s k δ w yields e 1 5 only for very thin skins i e w 0 36 it must be noticed that the temporal head curves plotted by the dougherty and babu solution for the negative skin scenarios converge indicating their solution is inapplicable to negative skins because neglecting the skin storage effect their solution agrees well with the other solutions to the predicted head with minor difference for the positive skin scenarios this indicates the skin storage effect is ignorable for the positive skins the difference results from the fact that their solution applies the depth averaged head eq 16c at the well screen but the other solutions consider depth dependent head eq 5a therefore these results lead to the conclusion that the present formulation with s k δ ln 1 w can reflect both the skin permeability and storage effects and predict spatiotemporal head within minor errors for most skins temporal normalized sensitivity coefficients s i for the dimensionless head at the ppw predicted by solution 1 and solution 2 are displayed in fig 3 for the positive skin with k r 10 4 m s and k z 10 5 m s and in fig 4 for the negative skin with k r 10 7 m s and k z 10 8 m s when w 6 0 3 m the observation point is at r 1 0 05 m for the slugged well and r 20 for the observation well for the positive skin scenario the s i curves plotted by both solutions for each parameter are similar in shape for t 1 s solution 1 is therefore applicable in the practical point of view the s i for s s or k z approaches zero which again indicates they are insensitive parameters for the positive skin the negative skin scenario indicates k z is also an insensitive parameter and the s i curves by both solutions are generally similar the predicted heads at the slugged well are almost the same although the discrepancies between the s i curves appear during the early period t 10 s 3 2 fes s accuracy and efficiency improved by the present formulation it is worthwhile examining the influence of grid resolution on fes s accuracy and efficiency consider the balance between the total recharge water in a slugged well and the total release water from the skin and formation storages expressed as the dimensional form 0 t f 0 l 2 π

fine discretization near the slugged well with the present formulation solution 3 obtains ai 0 999 for scenario 1 of the coarse formation discretization with the least nodal points np 1 354 the magnitude of ai predicted by solution 4 however remains unstable until scenario 2 of the fine skin discretization leading to much more points np 13 507 and more computing time ei 120 for the negative skin and 200 for the positive skin the example makes it clear that the present formulation significantly improves fes s accuracy and efficiency in comparison with conventional flow eq 1b 3 3 application of the present formulation to field slug test a few remarks should be made on hydraulic parameters estimated by the present solution mcelwee et al 1995 revealed high correlation between the formation transmissivity t k r l and storage coefficient s s s l in head predictions at a slugged well but no correlation for observation wells they found the curves of the temporal normalized sensitivity coefficient s i to t and s were similar in shape except the magnitudes of s i for the slugged well but not for the observation wells one observation well was therefore required for determining reliable values of hydraulic parameters these conclusions based on a fully penetrating well are applicable to the sensitivity analysis for a ppw in fig 3 and fig 4 for t 1 s therefore this study considers the head data butler 2019 tables 5 2 10 2 which are the only available data from both the slugged well and observation well the field slug test was conducted by the kansas geological survey at the dakota aquifer sandstone aquifer lincoln county the slugged well fully penetrated the aquifer the outer and inner radiuses of the well were 0 102 m and 0 051 m respectively the distance between the wells was 6 46 m one can refer to butler 2019 for the detailed description of the test the reliable values of the parameters in fig 6 are determined by solution 1 and the cooper 1967 solution developed based on a homogeneous confined aquifer when the solutions are coupled with the head data and levenberg marquardt algorithm available in the mathematica function findfit the same values of t and s are because the skin effect at the observation well is insignificant for the large distance between the wells the value of the skin storage coefficient s s s l is set to that of s for s being an insensitive parameter due to the small skin width of 3 4 cm it is worth noting that the estimated w t and s by solution 1 are substituted into solution 2 because correlation between w and t appears in fig 6b for the slugged well this correlation disappears in fig 4 for a ppw fig 6 displays the measured and predicted dimensionless heads by the three solutions with the standard error of estimate defined as s e e 1 166 v i 1 166 h i m h i p 2 with 166 being the number of the data measured dimensionless head h i m predicted dimensionless head h i p and the number of the estimated parameters being v 2 for the cooper solution and v 5 for solution 1 and solution 2 solution 1 gives the best fit to the data with the smallest see the contour of s e e 3 25 10 3 plotted by solution 1 falls in the small area in fig 6c the smallest see is about 2 82 10 3 for the optimal estimates of w 3 4 cm and t 1 68 10 4 m2 s indicating the estimates are reliable solution 2 however predicts the much larger area in which the see is all about 4 375 10 3 with minor discrepancies in fig 6d this indicates that solution 2 cannot reliably estimate w and t to conclude solution 1 is applicable to field slug tests in confined aquifers and serves as a useful alternative to solution 2 for avoiding correlation between the skin parameters 4 concluding remarks this study develops a new model for slug tests at a ppw in a two zone confined aquifer of skin and formation transient flow in the skin is described by a new formulation containing an additional skin factor reflecting the skin storage effect the formulation assumes horizontal flow in the skin with excluding the vertical skin hydraulic conductivity the analytical solution of the model i e solution 1 is derived the semi analytical solution of yeh et al 2008 to a two zone model developed based on flow equations for skin and formation is inverted to time domain solution 2 the fess to the present model i e solution 3 and two zone model i e solution 4 are built sensitivity analysis is implemented for exploring correlation between hydraulic parameters several slug test implications can be drawn below the analytical expression relating the additional skin factor to the skin specific storage can be defined as eq 15 both solution 1 and solution 2 give close spatiotemporal heads within minor relative errors when the skin width is less than 3 m for the typical well radius of 0 05 m indicating the present formulation is applicable to most skins the sensitivity analysis reveals the vertical skin hydraulic conductivity k z is an insensitive parameter this lends support to the fact that the present formulation excludes k z existing bcs such as eq 16a neglecting the skin storage effect are inapplicable to negative skins in the fes simulation the present formulation serves as a useful alternative to flow eq 1b for the skin in achieving coarse spatial discretization and low computational cost solution 3 relying on the present formulation takes about 1 120 of the computing time of obtaining solution 4 for the negative skin and 1 200 for the positive skin in the field slug test solution 1 gives the best fit to the head data the present formulation leads to no correlation between the skin width w and transmissivity t in predicting the head at the slugged well solution 1 is therefore applicable in obtaining reliable estimates for w and t when coupled with the levenberg marquardt algorithm and head data from the slugged well the w and t are however correlated in the head prediction of solution 2 for the fully penetrating slugged well but not for partial well penetration these results enhance the finding of mcelwee et al 1995 by exploring correlation between the skin parameters for a ppw therefore the findings of this study have important implications for theory research and practice of slug tests subject to the skin effects future research is warranted in investigating whether the present

1 2 3 it has the property that a4 f c d 2 h d z 2 1 n d h d z z 1 d h d z z 0 ω n 2 h where d h d z 0 due to the impermeable confining beds the formula for the inverse transform can be expressed as a5 h h 0 2 n 1 h n cos ω n z where h n represents h relying on n h 0 is h n with n 0 applying the laplace transform and finite fourier cosine transform to the present model eqs 9a 9d with the initial condition and bcs leads to the following ordinary differential equation and two bcs a6a d 2 h d 2 r 1 r d h d r λ n 2 h f o r r 1 w a6b h h s k β p h f n at z 1 z z 2 0 elsewhere a t r 1 w a6c h h s k

obtain eqs 11a 11b the semi analytical solution can be obtained by applying the formula eq a5 to eq 11a written as a7 h h 0 2 n 1 h cos ω n z where h is defined as eq 11a h 0 equals h with n 0 note that both eq a7 and solution 1 i e eq 12a predict close dimensionless heads with insignificant errors when the stehfest 1970 algorithm is used to numerically invert eq a7 to the time domain with h being a multiple value function of p a general formula for the inverse laplace transform to h p with a branch cut in the complex plane can be expressed as huang et al 2019 a8 f n 1 2 π i 0 h p e p t h p e p t d a where i 1 is the imaginary unit f n is the time domain result for h p p 0 α ω n 2 is the location of the branch point p p 0 a 2 cos π i sin π and p p 0 a 2 cos π i sin π account for integral paths respectively right above and below the branch cut located at the real axis from p p 0 to p note that the relations p p and p p lead to the same result of p α ω n 2 a 2 but different expressions of λ n i a for p p and λ n i a for p p based on λ n α ω n 2 p with these equalities the integrand in eq a8 equals two times imaginary part of a complex number obtained by h p e p t eq a8 therefore reduces to eq 12b substituting h f n into eq a7 leads to the analytical solution i e solution 1 expressed as eqs 12a 12b the following presents similar derivation of taking the inverse laplace transform to the yeh et al 2008 semi analytical solution their solution is defined in our notation as a9a h h 0 2 n 1 h cos ω n z a9b h h 0 2 n 1 h cos ω n z where h and h are defined as eqs 13a and 13b respectively h 0 is h with n 0 h 0 is h with n 0 the functions h and h are multiple value functions of p written as h p h p with a branch cut from the branch point at p 0 α γ ω n 2 for γ 1 or p 0 α ω n 2 for γ 1 the inverse laplace transform to h p and h p can be derived by applying the formula eq a8 written as a10a g n 1 2 π i 0 h p e p t h p e p t d a a10b g n 1 2 π i 0 h p e p t h p e p t d a where g n and g n are time domain results for h p and h p respectively with substituting p p 0 a 2 cos π i sin π and p p 0 a 2 cos π i sin π into eqs a10a and a10b the integrand in eq a10a equals two times imaginary part of a complex number obtained by h p e p t with the equations including λ n i a λ n i ξ p 0 α γ ω n 2 for γ 1 λ n i ξ λ n i a p 0 α ω n 2 for γ 1 and ξ 2 a 2 ω n 2 α α γ similarly the integrand in eq a10b also equals two times imaginary part of a complex number acquired by h p e p t with the same equations eqs a10a and a10b thus become eqs 14c and 14d respectively substituting h g n into eq a9a and h g n into eq a9b results in the analytical solution i e solution 2 defined as eqs 14a 14d appendix b derivation of eq 15 the analytical expression for s k can be derived by solving eq 4 with solution 1 and solution 2 integrating eq 4 over time and elevation for obtaining the total volumetric water released from the skin storage yields the dimensional form 0 l

d z l i m ω 0 r p h eq b2 then reduces to b3 s k ε l i m p 0 ω 0 p h r 1 w 1 γ lim p 0 ω 0 1 1 w r p h d r where h r 1 w is defined in eq 11a with r 1 w and h in eq 13a rearranging eq b3 leads to b4 s

2993,while the effect of small scale skin has been extensively investigated numerical models incorporating the effect require expensive computational cost due to fine spatial discretization of the skin and have not been widely available this study develops a new model for slug tests at a partially penetrating well in a two zone confined aquifer of skin and formation zones a new basic formulation defines transient flow in the skin with an additional skin factor reflecting the skin storage effect the formulation assumes horizontal flow in the skin with excluding the vertical skin hydraulic conductivity the analytical solution and finite element solution of the model are developed the analytical expression relating the skin factor to the skin specific storage is derived results suggest the formulation is a useful alternative to conventional flow equation for the skin in achieving coarse spatial discretization and low computational cost the present solution agrees well with the field head data obtained from butler 2019 to conclude this study presents theoretical advance and efficient simulation in modeling of well hydraulics keywords skin factor small scale skin zone transient flow slug test analytical solution low computational cost data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction over the last few decades there has been a dramatic increase in the number of publications on the effect of small scale skin zone hereinafter called skin on slug tests the test is one of commonly used aquifer tests in which a small quantity of water is instantaneously extracted from or injected into a well and the response of water level is measured in the slugged well or nearby observation wells the advantages of slug tests include low cost simple procedure and little or even no water treatment the skin produced during the well installation process containing drilling construction and annular fill may extend from millimeters to several meters novakowski 1989 and has different hydraulic properties from the adjacent formation zone hereinafter called formation a positive skin stands for its permeability lower than formation s one but a negative skin for higher permeability yeh and chang 2013 provided a comprehensive review on two kinds of skin treatments for incorporating the skin effect into well hydraulic modeling one kind assumes an infinitesimal width skin and treats the skin as a boundary condition bc depending on a skin factor reflecting the skin permeability effect a variety of skin factors were proposed in the groundwater field e g hawkins 1956 moench and hsieh 1985 moench 1997 and petroleum field e g van everdingen 1953 brons and marting 1961 hong 1975 it however lacks a skin factor reflecting the skin storage effect the other kind treats a finite width skin as an annulus with its own flow equation reflecting both effects of the skin permeability and storage in nature a variety of analytical models were proposed for slug tests with no skin e g cooper et al 1967 butler and zhan 2004 sun 2016 the infinitesimal width skin e g dougherty and babu 1984 kipp 1985 cassiani and kabala 1998 and finite

when analytical solutions for the slug test problems are not trackable sophisticated finite element difference schemes should be applied researchers have developed numerical solutions accounting for various issues such as aquifer heterogeneity and anisotropy e g butler et al 1994 seo and choe 2001 paradis et al 2015 liu et al 2020 inertial effect in wells e g liu et al 2020 reverse water level response in wells e g slack et al 2013 and multi layer effect e g louwyck et al 2012 yang et al 2015 however existing numerical solutions require expensive computational cost due to fine skin discretization in fig 1 for obtaining accurate predictions e g yang et al 2015 paradis et al 2015 2016 sakata et al 2015 and thus have not been widely available simulation based on coarse spatial discretization for example took about 1 of computing time of conducting fine discretization simulation for the problem of surface water groundwater interaction wang et al 2018 xiong et al 2021 therefore the core of all the questions is how to simulate coupled transient flows in skin and formation by numerical solutions based on coarse spatial discretization solving the question meets the practical need of coarse discretization simulation for reducing computational cost e g werner et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 huang et al 2020 gerber et al 2020 this study develops a new model for slug tests at a partially penetrating well ppw in a two zone confined aquifer of skin and formation transient flow in the skin is defined as a new basic formulation including an additional skin factor reflecting the skin storage effect the formulation assumes horizontal flow in the skin with excluding the vertical skin hydraulic conductivity the analytical solution and finite element solution fes of the model are presented with the present solution the analytical expression relating the additional skin factor to the skin specific storage is obtained computational cost of the fes is discussed sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore correlation between hydraulic parameters the application of the present solution to the field slug test of butler 2019 is conducted results of this article conclude with implications for theory research and practice of slug tests 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical models fig 1 illustrates a slug test at a ppw in a two zone confined aquifer the radial distance from the ppw is denoted as r and elevation from the aquifer bottom as z the aquifer has thickness l and infinitely extends in the radial direction the ppw has outer radius r w inner radius r c and screen between z z 1 and z z 2 the flow equations for the formation and skin can be expressed respectively as 1a k r 2 h r 2 1 r h r k z 2 h z 2 s s h t f o r r r w w 1b k r 2 h r 2 1 r h r k z 2 h z 2 s s h t f o r r w r r w w where h is change in the hydraulic head hereinafter called head t is time w is the skin width s s is the formation specific storage k r and k z are the radial and vertical formation hydraulic conductivities respectively the apostrophe represents the skin a new formulation regarded as an alternative to eq 1b for reducing computational cost is derived as follows eq 1b reduces to eq 2 by assuming horizontal flow in the skin with removing the term k z 2 h z 2 and by integrating the product of 2 π r and each term of the result from r r w to r r w w 2 2 π r w w k

w and an additional skin factor s k reflecting the skin storage effect expressed as 4 2 π r w s k h t r w r w w 2 π r s s h t d r based on eqs 3 4 and the finite difference flux the new formulation for the skin treatment subject to the slug test consists of eqs 5a 5b with extra eq 5c in which the head in the skin is approximated as a linear distribution on the logarithmic polar axis fig 1c such an approximation is valid with minor errors when the radius of influence exceeds the skin formation interface eq 5a assumes both the h and flux are piecewise uniform with the steep continuities near the bottom and top of the screen the h at the middle elevation of the screen is used to approach the head in the ppw the formulation neglects the effects of pipe friction and inertia inside the ppw 5a

are specified at the well rim based on the assumption that skin width is infinitesimal 2 4 finite element solutions the fess are developed by applying the mathematica function ndsolve to solve the

solution 3 for the present model and solution 4 for the other solution 3 allows coarse spatial discretization but solution 4 requires fine skin discretization for obtaining accurate prediction as discussed in section 3 2 2 5 sensitivity analysis the normalized sensitivity coefficient s i that evaluates the head responses to variations in hydraulic parameters can be expressed as s i p i h p i with p i being the i th parameter the finite difference approach is defined as s i p i h p i δ p i h p i δ p i with a small increment δ p i 10 2 p i 3 results and discussion this study demonstrates

present solution is applied to parameter determination based on the field slug test of butler 2019 3 1 the present formulation reflecting skin effect the first point to be discussed is to examine the applicability of the present formulation by comparing predictions of solution 1 and solution 2 the semi analytical solution of dougherty and babu 1984 developed based on eq 16a is also considered the accuracy of solution 1 mainly depends on the skin width represented by w and vertical skin hydraulic conductivity by α for a ppw the extreme value of w exceeds 20 for the typical well radius of r w 0 05 m fig 2 displays the spatiotemporal heads predicted by these three solutions for the negative skin δ 10 2 k r 10 4 m s k z 10 5 m s and positive skin δ 10 k r 10 7 m s k z 10 8 m s with w 1 0 05 m 5 10 and s k δ ln 1 w the head distribution for no skin effect is plotted by solution 2 with δ 1 and γ 1 reflecting aquifer homogeneity define e 1 as the largest relative error in temporal head distributions h predicted by solution 1 and solution 2 the figure shows both solution 1 and solution 2 agree well to the temporal head predictions with e 1 1 the head contours are close fig 2a 2b because solution 1 assumes a linear head distribution in the skin on the logarithmic polar axis by eq 5c the e 1 is below 5 for w 60 fig 2c indicating the present formulation is applicable when the skin width is less than 3 m for the typical radius of r w 0 05 m the variation in α contained only in solution 2 causes minor change in e 1 fig 2d indicating the vertical skin hydraulic conductivity is an insensitive parameter solution 1 with another skin factor s k δ 1 ln 1 w gives almost the same predictions in fig 2 for the positive skin scenarios the other skin factor s k δ w yields e 1 5 only for very thin skins i e w 0 36 it must be noticed that the temporal head curves plotted by the dougherty and babu solution for the negative skin scenarios converge indicating their solution is inapplicable to negative skins because neglecting the skin storage effect their solution agrees well with the other solutions to the predicted head with minor difference for the positive skin scenarios this indicates the skin storage effect is ignorable for the positive skins the difference results from the fact that their solution applies the depth averaged head eq 16c at the well screen but the other solutions consider depth dependent head eq 5a therefore these results lead to the conclusion that the present formulation with s k δ ln 1 w can reflect both the skin permeability and storage effects and predict spatiotemporal head within minor errors for most skins temporal normalized sensitivity coefficients s i for the dimensionless head at the ppw predicted by solution 1 and solution 2 are displayed in fig 3 for the positive skin with k r 10 4 m s and k z 10 5 m s and in fig 4 for the negative skin with k r 10 7 m s and k z 10 8 m s when w 6 0 3 m the observation point is at r 1 0 05 m for the slugged well and r 20 for the observation well for the positive skin scenario the s i curves plotted by both solutions for each parameter are similar in shape for t 1 s solution 1 is therefore applicable in the practical point of view the s i for s s or k z approaches zero which again indicates they are insensitive parameters for the positive skin the negative skin scenario indicates k z is also an insensitive parameter and the s i curves by both solutions are generally similar the predicted heads at the slugged well are almost the same although the discrepancies between the s i curves appear during the early period t 10 s 3 2 fes s accuracy and efficiency improved by the present formulation it is worthwhile examining the influence of grid resolution on fes s accuracy and efficiency consider the balance between the total recharge water in a slugged well and the total release water from the skin and formation storages expressed as the dimensional form 0 t f 0 l 2 π r w s k h t r r w w d z d t 0 t f 0 l r w w r 2 π r s s h t d r d z d t π r c 2 h 0 for solution 3 or the dimensionless form 17 1 ε β l 0 t f 0 1 s k h t r 1 w d z d t 1 β l 0 t f 0 1 1 w r r h t d r d z d t 1 where t f d r t f r w 2 t f is simulation period the terms on the left hand side of eq 17 regarded as accuracy indicator ai should equal unity for obtaining accurate predictions similarly ai for solution 4 also equals unity written as 18 1 β l 0 t f 0 1 1 1 w r γ h t d r d z d t 1 β l 0 t f 0 1 1 w r r h t d r d z d t 1 which results from the dimensional form 0 t f 0 l r w r w w 2 π r s s

solution 3 takes to obtain ai 0 999 fig 5 displays the varying ai and ei against the increasing number of nodal points i e np plotted by solution 3 and solution 4 with s k δ ln 1 w l 3 m r 10 0 5 m w 0 1 0 5 c m t f 10 5 2500 s z 1 0 5 1 5 m z 2 1 3 m l 0 5 1 5 m α α 2 8 10 5 β 2 1 10 4 δ 0 1 for negative skin and δ 10 k r 10 7 m s k z 10 8 m s for positive skin the increase in np results from fine discretization near the slugged well with the present formulation solution 3 obtains ai 0 999 for scenario 1 of the coarse formation discretization with the least nodal points np 1 354 the magnitude of ai predicted by solution 4 however remains unstable until scenario 2 of the fine skin discretization leading to much more points np 13 507 and more computing time ei 120 for the negative skin and 200 for the positive skin the example makes it clear that the present formulation significantly improves fes s accuracy and efficiency in comparison with conventional flow eq 1b 3 3 application of the present formulation to field slug test a few remarks should be made on hydraulic parameters estimated by the present solution mcelwee et al 1995 revealed high correlation between the formation transmissivity t k r l and storage coefficient s s s l in head predictions at a slugged well but no correlation for observation wells they found the curves of the temporal normalized sensitivity coefficient s i to t and s were similar in shape except the magnitudes of s i for the slugged well but not for the observation wells one observation well was therefore required for determining reliable values of hydraulic parameters these conclusions based on a fully penetrating well are applicable to the sensitivity analysis for a ppw in fig 3 and fig 4 for t 1 s therefore this study considers the head data butler 2019 tables 5 2 10 2 which are the only available data from both the slugged well and observation well the field slug test was conducted by the kansas geological survey at the dakota aquifer sandstone aquifer lincoln county the slugged well fully penetrated the aquifer the outer and inner radiuses of the well were 0 102 m and 0 051 m respectively the distance between the wells was 6 46 m one can refer to butler 2019 for the detailed description of the test the reliable values of the parameters in fig 6 are determined by solution 1 and the cooper 1967 solution developed based on a homogeneous confined aquifer when the solutions are coupled with the head data and levenberg marquardt algorithm available in the mathematica function findfit the same values of t and s are because the skin effect at the observation well is insignificant for the large distance between the wells the value of the skin storage coefficient s s s l is set to that of s for s being an insensitive parameter due to the small skin width of 3 4 cm it is worth noting that the estimated w t and s by solution 1 are substituted into solution 2 because correlation between w and t appears in fig 6b for the slugged well this correlation disappears in fig 4 for a ppw fig 6 displays the measured and predicted dimensionless heads by the three solutions with the standard error of estimate defined as s e e 1 166 v i 1 166 h i m h i p 2 with 166 being the number of the data measured dimensionless head h i m predicted dimensionless head h i p and the number of the estimated parameters being v 2 for the cooper solution and v 5 for solution 1 and solution 2 solution 1 gives the best fit to the data with the smallest see the contour of s e e 3 25 10 3 plotted by solution 1 falls in the small area in fig 6c the smallest see is about 2 82 10 3 for the optimal estimates of w 3 4 cm and t 1 68 10 4 m2 s indicating the estimates are reliable solution 2 however predicts the much larger area in which the see is all about 4 375 10 3 with minor discrepancies in fig 6d this indicates that solution 2 cannot reliably estimate w and t to conclude solution 1 is applicable to field slug tests in confined aquifers and serves as a useful alternative to solution 2 for avoiding correlation between the skin parameters 4 concluding remarks this study develops a new model for slug tests at a ppw in a two zone confined aquifer of skin and formation transient flow in the skin is described by a new formulation containing an additional skin factor reflecting the skin storage effect the formulation assumes horizontal flow in the skin with excluding the vertical skin hydraulic conductivity the analytical solution of the model i e solution 1 is derived the semi analytical solution of yeh et al 2008 to a two zone model developed based on flow equations for skin and formation is inverted to time domain solution 2 the fess to the present model i e solution 3 and two zone model i e solution 4 are built sensitivity analysis is implemented for exploring correlation between hydraulic parameters several slug test implications can be drawn below the analytical expression relating the additional skin factor to the skin specific storage can be defined as eq 15 both solution 1 and solution 2 give close spatiotemporal heads within minor relative errors when the skin width is less than 3 m for the typical well radius of 0 05 m indicating the present formulation is applicable to most skins the sensitivity analysis reveals the vertical skin hydraulic conductivity k z is an insensitive parameter this lends support to the fact that the present formulation excludes k z existing bcs such as eq 16a neglecting the skin storage effect are inapplicable to negative skins in the fes simulation the present formulation serves as a useful alternative to flow eq 1b for the skin in achieving coarse spatial discretization and low computational cost solution 3 relying on the present formulation takes about 1 120 of the computing time of obtaining solution 4 for the negative skin and 1 200 for the positive skin in the field slug test solution 1 gives the best fit to the head data the present formulation leads to no correlation between the skin width w and transmissivity t in predicting the head at the slugged well solution 1 is therefore applicable in obtaining reliable estimates for w and t when coupled with the levenberg marquardt algorithm and head data from the slugged well the w and t are however correlated in the head prediction of solution 2 for the fully penetrating slugged well but not for partial well penetration these results enhance the finding of mcelwee et al 1995 by exploring correlation between the skin parameters for a ppw therefore the findings of this study have important implications for theory research and practice of slug tests subject to the skin effects future research is warranted in investigating whether the present formulation can be extended to other kinds of aquifer tests such as constant rate test and constant head test the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

1 2 3 it has the property that a4 f c d 2 h d z 2 1 n d h d z z 1 d h d z z 0 ω n 2 h where d h d z 0 due to the impermeable confining beds the formula for the inverse transform can be expressed as a5 h h 0 2 n 1 h n cos ω n z where h n represents h relying on n h 0 is h n with n 0 applying the laplace transform and finite fourier cosine transform to the present model eqs 9a 9d with the initial condition and bcs leads to the following ordinary differential equation and two bcs a6a d 2 h d 2 r 1 r d h d r λ n 2 h f o r r 1 w a6b h h s k β p h f n at z 1 z z 2 0 elsewhere a t r 1 w a6c h h s k

obtain eqs 11a 11b the semi analytical solution can be obtained by applying the formula eq a5 to eq 11a written as a7 h h 0 2 n 1 h cos ω n z where h is defined as eq 11a h 0 equals h with n 0 note that both eq a7 and solution 1 i e eq 12a predict close dimensionless heads with insignificant errors when the stehfest 1970 algorithm is used to numerically invert eq a7 to the time domain with h being a multiple value function of p a general formula for the inverse laplace transform to h p with a branch cut in the complex plane can be expressed as huang et al 2019 a8 f n 1 2 π i 0 h p e p t h p e p t d a where i 1 is the imaginary unit f n is the time domain result for h p p 0 α ω n 2 is the location of the branch point p p 0 a 2 cos π i sin π and p p 0 a 2 cos π i sin π account for integral paths respectively right above and below the branch cut located at the real axis from p p 0 to p note that the relations p p and p p lead to the same result of p α ω n 2 a 2 but different expressions of λ n i a for p p and λ n i a for p p based on λ n α ω n 2 p with these equalities the integrand in eq a8 equals two times imaginary part of a complex number obtained by h p e p t eq a8 therefore reduces to eq 12b substituting h f n into eq a7 leads to the analytical solution i e solution 1 expressed as eqs 12a 12b the following presents similar derivation of taking the inverse laplace transform to the yeh et al 2008 semi analytical solution their solution is defined in our notation as a9a h h 0 2 n 1 h cos ω n z a9b h h 0 2 n 1 h cos ω n z where h and h are defined as eqs 13a and 13b respectively h 0 is h with n 0 h 0 is h with n 0 the functions h and h are multiple value functions of p written as h p h p with a branch cut from the branch point at p 0 α γ ω n 2 for γ 1 or p 0 α ω n 2 for γ 1 the inverse laplace transform to h p and h p can be derived by applying the formula eq a8 written as a10a g n 1 2 π i 0 h p e p t h p e p t d a a10b g n 1 2 π i 0 h p e p t h p e p t d a where g n and g n are time domain results for h p and h p respectively with substituting p p 0 a 2 cos π i sin π and p p 0 a 2 cos π i sin π into eqs a10a and a10b the integrand in eq a10a equals two times imaginary part of a complex number obtained by h p e p t with the equations including λ n i a λ n i ξ p 0 α γ ω n 2 for γ 1 λ n i ξ λ n i a p 0 α ω n 2 for γ 1 and ξ 2 a 2 ω n 2 α α γ similarly the integrand in eq a10b also equals two times imaginary part of a complex number acquired by h p e p t with the same equations eqs a10a and a10b thus become eqs 14c and 14d respectively substituting h g n into eq a9a and h g n into eq a9b results in the analytical solution i e solution 2 defined as eqs 14a 14d appendix b derivation of eq 15 the analytical expression for s k can be derived by solving eq 4 with solution 1 and solution 2 integrating eq 4 over time and elevation for obtaining the total volumetric water released from the skin storage yields the dimensional form 0 l

d z l i m ω 0 r p h eq b2 then reduces to b3 s k ε l i m p 0 ω 0 p h r 1 w 1 γ lim p 0 ω 0 1 1 w r p h d r where h r 1 w is defined in eq 11a with r 1 w and h in eq 13a rearranging eq b3 leads to b4 s

2994,flood is one of the most common natural disasters worldwide and has caused serious harm to humans socio economy and the environment identification and classification of flood hazard areas is therefore essential for flood management and risk decision making which attempt to combat this challenge this study selected eleven flood hazard conditioning factors as evaluation criteria integrated geographic information system gis with three multi criteria analysis mca techniques viz the analytical hierarchy process ahp technique ordered preference by similarity to the ideal solution topsis and ordered weighted averaging owa to form a gis mca framework for analyzing the spatial distribution of flood prone areas its application in the dadu river basin china derived a total of eleven flood hazard maps across the basin and their analysis and comparison results demonstrated the spatial distributions of flood prone areas based on various gis mca approaches and their overlap situations and indicated that hazard class distribution patterns of the ahp topsis and owa α 1 maps are similar and luding yuexi and their nearby areas are the highest hazard zones where should be concerned on firstly under the condition of limited resources to validate the three mca methods the ahp topsis and owa α 1 maps were compared with the historical flood disaster ranges the verification results exhibited that the largest proportion of historical flood disaster ranges fell into the high and highest hazard levels in the three maps and shown the resultant flood hazard maps are scientific rational and consistent with the actual situation the gis mca approach is a powerful and feasible guidance tool for conducting flood disaster management studies and a reference for future more efficient flood management and risk decision making in the basin keywords flood hazard mapping geographic information system gis multi criteria analysis mca analytical hierarchy process ahp technique ordered preference by similarity to the ideal solution topsis ordered weighted averaging owa 1 introduction floods is one of the most frequent destructive and widespread natural disaster worldwide generally induced by the composed situation of heavy rainfall and unfavorable geographical environment and has caused serious life loss and economic damage over the past decades gaume et al 2009 to prevent and alleviate future flood disaster loss and damage flood risk assessment and management researches came into being and developing the primary step of formulating effective studies is to conduct a flood hazard assessment which considers the combined influence of disaster inducing factors and disaster forming environment mainly studies the hazard of a certain area that may be hit by floods and can reflect the spatial distribution of flood hazardous degree via visualized flood hazard maps flood hazard map depicts areas that may be at various level flood hazard can serve as spatial decision making and planning guidance greiving et al 2005 early risk identification assistance and public awareness enhancement channel de moel et al 2009 and therefore has been an important flood risk communication tool and scientific basis for flood disaster management and widely applied to various fields such as floodplain management flood insurance and disaster warning systems wang et al 2015 accordingly developing an effective flood hazard assessment method with visualized flood hazard maps as outputs is urgently necessary recently numerous methods and models have been proposed and used for flood hazard zoning wherein satellite images and geographic information system gis have gradually taken precedence with the advancement of satellite technology asare kyei et al 2015 gis can provide a common framework and spatial state for the data representing flood causal factors obtained from various sources to generate new derivative maps interpret the assessment results intuitionistic due to its visualization capacity and be used as a decision support system kourgialas and karatzas 2011 nyimbili et al 2018 diverse approaches have been applied to integrate flood factors in a gis environment toosi et al 2019 multi criteria analysis mca is one of the most widely used decision analysis techniques in the gis environment malczewski et al 2003 particularly in natural hazard studies jozaghi et al 2018 nefeslioglu et al 2013 sinha et al 2008 gis based mca can be regarded as a set of techniques and procedures that transform and combine geographical data and the decision maker s preferences to obtain decision making information kourgialas and karatzas 2011 nyimbili et al 2018 the integration of mca with gis for analyzing flood hazard zones depends on the geographical distribution of the alternatives and the value judgments incorporated in the process of decision making nyimbili et al 2018 and provides base maps for planning and formulating more flexible and accurate risk decisions based on the synergetic capabilities of gis and mca the benefits of promoting the theoretical and applied research of gis mcda have been prominently protruded

and lu 2006 toosi et al 2019 it can be concluded from these researches that the selection of the mca approach is very important since it has a considerable effect on the outcome according to a survey of the current state of the art taken by de brito and evers 2016 it can be obtained that the analytical hierarchy process ahp was the most popular method followed by technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis ahp is the most common used mca method in the flood risk management field and has been proven to be efficient for developing automated methods to quantify the spatial variability of flood hazards and the associated problems dahri and abida 2017 de brito and evers 2016 stefanidis and stathis 2013 coupled the analytical hierarchy process ahp and gis to assess the flood hazard based on natural and anthropogenic factors kazakis et al 2015 superimposed seven parameters to an index and utilized the index and ahp model to map the regional scaled flood hazard in greece the ability of the presented method was shown by comparing resulted maps with historical flood data dahri and abida 2017 applied ahp and gis to delineate and characterize flood hazard areas in gabes catchment southeastern tunisia based on the geological map digital elevation model land use and rainfall data in the study of luu et al 2018 ahp was used to assess the criteria and sub criteria of the flood hazard this assessment was integrated with gis to produce a flood hazard map topsis has been increasingly applied in flood risk management because of its ability to deal with multiple attributes de brito and evers 2016 ghanbarpour et al 2013 used topsis to optimize flood control by comparing flood mitigation alternatives based on various criteria topsis was combined with a non parameter resampling bootstrap technique by mojtahedi and oo 2016 to analyze and rank the flood risk of australian states and territories luu et al 2019 proposed a new assessment tool multiple linear regression topsis to analyze the flood disaster data of vietnam s regions and provinces which provides accessible information for decision makers and planners to classify the most at risk areas in recent years the ordered weighted averaging owa method has also been gradually effectively applied in flood hazard researches xiao et al 2017 developed an mca framework incorporating gis fuzzy ahp and owa method based on selecting geographical hydrological and other factors as criteria and taken the lower han river region as the study area to implement flood hazard assessment with analyzing different risk attitudes of decision makers gilandeh et al 2020 employed the gis owa model to extract flood potential maps of meshkinshahr city iran which can be seen as a useful tool for determining and classifying flood prone areas in meshkinshahr city and its surrounding drainage basin to concern the uncertainty related to criteria weights spatial heterogeneity of preferences and the risk attitude of the analyst tang et al 2018 used monte carlo simulation to integrate owa and probabilistic methods to delineate the potential flood susceptible areas vanolya and niaraki 2021 adopted the gis owa model to generate flood hazard maps of the mazandaran province of iran according to pessimistic or optimistic strategies of which subjective and subjective objective weights were assigned by ahp and entropy ahp methods respectively to highlight the decision maker s risk preference and ensure the operability comparability and applicability of the research ahp topsis and owa are utilized this study is centered on developing a framework for mapping the basin scale flood hazard by integrating gis and ahp topsis and owa and comparing the three gis mca methods resulted flood hazard maps for identifying and analyzing the flood at hazard areas and consequently to determine the applicability of these techniques in flood risk management 2 study area the dadu river flows from the easterntibetan plateauinto thesichuan basinwhere it joins with themin river atributaryof theyangtze river china and is 1 062 km in length with a catchment area of 77 400 km2 it is actually longer than

methodology 3 1 data collection the primary challenge of generating flood hazard zoning maps is to identify the flood disaster inducing factors and disaster forming environment factors based on the actual conditions of the study area and regional flood characteristics and to prepare corresponding thematic layers in geospatial format according to previous literature on flood hazard alaghmand et

data is described as follows and the derived gis layers are shown in fig 2 to perform algebraic and logical operations all thematic layers were resampled as raster data with 30 m spatial resolution shao et al 2015 rainfall intensity based on the collected monthly precipitation data at the observational stations in and out of the dadu river basin during the time period 1960 2013 the modified

soil texture map 3 2 multi criteria analysis mca 3 2 1 analytical hierarchy process ahp ahp method is the most implemented mca method that constructs the complex decision problem into a hierarchical framework estimates the criteria weights using pairwise comparison with numerical importance scales saaty 2008 and provides a systematic approach for assessing and integrating the impacts of various factors in flood risk management field which makes complex risk management decision problem easy to analyze and handle with stefanidis and stathis 2013 xiao et al 2017 for each level of the decision criteria hierarchy framework there is a control process of pairwise comparisons between the criteria which is made through saaty s comparative scale table 1 dahri and abida 2017 these assigned weights were normalized by the eigenvector technique and finally tested for consistency by computing a consistency ratio cr which must be less than 0 1 so as to be accepted toosi et al 2019 stefanidis and stathis 2013 otherwise value judgments have to be recalculated the final step is the integration of the weights associated with attribute map layers derived by ahp and the attribute map layers in the gis environment 3 2 2 technique ordered preference by similarity to the ideal solution topsis topsis proposed by hwang and yoon 1981 can integrate seamlessly with gis and can be implemented according to the following steps kaliszewski and podkopaev 2016 milani et al 2005 step 1 construct the normalized decision matrix r rij 4 r ij d ij i d ij 2 i 1 m j 1 n where dij is the value of the ith alternative ai i 1 m with respect to the jth attribute xj j 1 n step 2 weigh the normalized decision matrix v vij 5 v ij w j r ij i 1 m j 1 n where wj is the weight of the jth attribute step 3 ascertain positive ideal solution pis and negative ideal solution nis a j and a j j 1 n 6 a j v 1 v 2 v j v n max n v ij j j 1 min n v ij j j 2 i 1 m 7 a j v 1 v 2 v j v n min n v ij j j 1 max n v ij j j 2 i 1 m where j 1 and j 2 are a group of benefit attributes and cost attributes respectively step 4 measure the distances of each alternative from pis and nis s i and s i i 1 m 8 s i j 1 n v ij a j 2 i 1 m 9 s i j 1 n v ij a j 2 i 1 m step 5 calculate the relative closeness of alternatives to the ideal solution ci 10 c i s i s i s i i 1 m 0 c i 1 3 2 3 ordered weighted averaging owa the owa operator proposed by yager 1988 provides a parameterized multi criteria aggregation method kiavarz and jelokhani niaraki 2017 it involves both criterion weights and order weights the criterion weights are assigned to evaluation criteria or attributes in a study area to indicate their relative importance according to the decision maker s preferences ahmed 2015 order weights are assigned to the rank order position of factor values for a given location the calculation procedure is as follows given a set of standardized attribute values xi1 xi2 xin 0 xij 1 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n the owa operator can be defined as in i that has an associated set of order weights v1 v2 vn 0 v j 1 j 1 n v j 1 j 1 2 n and calculated as 11 owa j v j z ij where zi1 zi2 zin is the sequence obtained by reordering the attribute values xi1 xi2 xin in descending order vj is associated with the attribute values on a location by location basis and assigned to the ith location s attribute values in decreasing order without consideration of with which attribute they are associated the first ordered weight v1 is assigned to the highest attribute value for the ith location and similarly vn is assigned to the lowest attribute value apparently a particular value of aij is not associated with a particular weight vj but rather a weight is assigned to a particular ordered position of xij kiavarz and jelokhani niaraki 2017 malczewski et al 2003 for each criterion xij the jth attribute associated with the ith location raster specify benefit and cost types based on the direct inverse relationships between criteria and flood hazard eqs 12 and 13 can respectively be used to convert the attribute values into standardized values 12 x ij y ij y j min y j max y j min 13 x ij y j max y ij y j max y j min where yij is the jth attribute value for the ith location y j min and y j max represent the minimum and maximum values for the jth attribute respectively kiavarz and jelokhani niaraki 2017 factually the gis based decision making problems require a set of different weights to be assigned to attributes criteria which is ignored for the owa operator denoted by eq 11 in response an attribute weight modification approach was proposed to generate the order weights based on the inclusion of the attribute weights into the owa operator as follows kiavarz and jelokhani niaraki 2017 14 v j k 1 j u k k 1 n u k α k 1 j 1 u k k 1 n u k α where α is the operator parameter corresponding to different linguistic quantifiers and as α varies different sets of order weights are obtained uj is the reordered jth attribute weight wj according to the reordered attribute value zij wj is the attribute weight assigned to jth attribute for all locations indicates the relative importance of the attribute according to the decision maker s preferences and is determined by the ahp method in this study in the gis based mca procedures the attribute weights typically have the following property j 1 n w j 1 accordingly j 1 n u j 1 and eq 14 can be written as follows 15 v j j 1 n u j α j 1 n 1 u j α and the owa operator can be defined as 16 ow a i j 1 n u j v j z ij j 1 n u j v j eq 16 can be recognized as the conventional weighted linear combination with modified criterion weights the weights are obtained by multiplying the criterion weights by the order weights malczewski et al 2003 by adjusting the level of risk for the decision problem the owa algorithm can transfer between logical operations and and or at well to obtain different evaluation results the choice of operator parameter α supports for the decision makers can control the magnitude of decision risk along the continuum ranging from the pessimistic to optimistic decision strategies kiavarz and jelokhani niaraki 2017 17 orness 1 α 1 α 0 the degree of orness indicates the position of the owa on a continuum between the and or or combination rules it is calculated as 18 orness 1 n 1 j 1 n n j v j 0 o r n e s s 1 the measure of orness ranges from 0 to 1 with different sets of owa order weights calculated based on various orness or α values it can be generated that a variety of gis based map combination strategies ranging from a minimum type logical and combination through all intermediate types including the conventional wlc to a maximum type logical or combination see table 2 the and and or operators represent the extreme cases of owa kiavarz and jelokhani niaraki 2017 higher values of α mean decision makers tend to be more risk taking while its lower values represent that the risk aversion tendency is dominant shorabeh et al 2019 4 results and comparative analysis 4 1 ahp topsis and owa maps after careful analysis of the set of evaluation criteria attributes importance judgment to attributes is derived from ahp mfi is regarded as the most important criterion attribute with the largest weight value of 0 1924 followed by dtr with the weight value of 0 1670 elevation and ndvi are respectively considered as the third and fourth most important criteria and their weight values are 0 1374 and 0 1162 respectively subsequently the weights of spi soil lulc and slope are 0 1087 0 0909 0 0705 and 0 0563 respectively the twi curvature and aspect are the less important indicators and their weights are 0 0313 0 0148 and 0 0148 respectively via the weighted sum analysis process the flood hazard map was implemented shown in fig 3 a which was reclassified into five levels i e lowest low moderate high and highest hazard by using the natural break method this technique of flood hazard zoning was implemented for the rest two methods topsis and owa the main calculation procedures of topsis were as outlined in sec 3 2 and the generated flood hazard map is shown in fig 3 b a visual comparison between the ahp based and topsis based flood hazard maps revealed similar spatial distribution patterns for various flood hazard levels both maps show that luding yuexi and their nearby areas were at the most hazard as shown in red those at high hazard level in orange were areas around the midstream of the basin with the topsis map covering relatively more of these areas than the ahp map and of a wider distribution towards the southern part of the region in the topsis map the low and lowest hazard areas in light and dark green covered almost the entire northern region and eastern part of upstream while in the ahp map the northern region of the basin was mainly at the moderate hazard in light yellow the derived criteria weights from ahp has been discussed in section 4 1 and the owa order weights were calculated using different α values in light of eq 15 and shown in table 3 where the value of αcan be selected in the range from 0 to according to decision makers risk preferences owa based flood hazard maps are shown in fig 4 fig 4 illustrated that the results are highly sensitive to the change of α and the overall hazard situation is exacerbated with the increase of α the maximum trade off was achieved when α 1 which made the hazard assessment implemented by neutral attitude i e with no risk preference the high and very high hazard area was significantly increased when the value of α increased from 1 to more high hazard areas are presented and need to be noticed and more corresponding mitigation measures will be put forward to avoid the potential hazard and reduce the potential loss xiao et al 2017 while when the value of α decreased from 1 to 0 the high and very high hazard area was significantly decreased some potential hazard zone may not be exposed and suffer from flood damage 4 2 comparative analysis figs 3 4 illustrate that flood hazard level distribution patterns of ahp topsis and owa α 1 maps are similar which also can be confirmed by the statistical analysis results there are strong correlations between the owa α 1 and ahp maps the topsis and ahp maps and the owa α 1 and topsis maps with corresponding correlation coefficients of 0 9891 0 9049 and 0 9034 respectively the detailed spatial distribution similarities and differences of the flood hazard maps were discussed by implementing the cross tabulation analysis and the results are shown in fig 5 and tables 4 6 the percentages of each flood hazard level area derived from ahp topsis and owa methods were demonstrated in fig 6 in fig 5 ahp topsis ahp owa α 1 and topsis owa α 1 combinations distinguished by various color bar hazard level overlap identifiers reveal the spatial coincidence for each set of maps by comparing hazard level values on the same grid in every two maps by using the image cross tabulation method the flood hazard levels of two maps are compared and a tabulation is obtained of the rate of crossed classified cells in each combination for instance 1 1 in dark green in fig 5 a expresses the overlap portion of zones with the lowest hazard level in both the ahp and owa α 1 maps whose area accounts for 2 16 of the total area which can be red from the second row of table 4 similarly 5 5 in red in fig 5 b implies the overlap portion of zones with the highest hazard level in both the ahp and topsis maps the area of crossed grids accounts for 1 99 of the total area which can be checked from the sixth row of table 5 for all topsis owa α 1 combinations with the topsis map hazard level values 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the strongest overlap distributes in the lowest hazard area level value 1 low hazard area level value 2 low hazard area level value 2 moderate hazard area level value 3 and highest hazard area level value 5 in the owa α 1 map while in terms of the comparison of the ahp map and owa α 1 map for all the combinations with the ahp map hazard level values 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the largest overlap intersperses among the lowest low moderate high and highest hazard areas respectively in the owa α 1 map in contrast the ahp map and owa α 1 map are more compatible with higher similarity of spatial distribution for flood hazard level in tables 4 6 the correlation coefficient cramer s v ranges from 0 to 1 was utilized to illustrate the correlation degree between two flood hazard maps the higher the cramer s v value the more perfect the cross correlation between the compared two maps the kappa index of agreement kia value was derived from the cross correlation analysis as well and regarded as an evidence of describing the similarity between the two flood hazard maps both the cramer s v and overall kia values in tables 4 6 expresses a favorable similarity between the compared flood hazard maps as shown in fig 6 b the histogram of owa α 1 map exhibits a near normal distribution following by the histogram of ahp map whereas that of topsis map is positively skewed showing that low and lowest hazard levels constitute more areas in the topsis map than ahp or owa α 1 map it may be caused by the theoretical natures of the applied mca approaches the ahp method weighting each criterion based on the pair wise comparison matrix with the subjectivity more or less dependent on the effects of one or several flood conditioning factors however the owa algorithm using two step weighting criterion and order weights mode can effectively weaken the effect of subjective evaluation fluctuation value on the accuracy of weights correct some shortcomings of traditional ahp and make the calculation results more adaptable to different flood hazard levels while the positive and negative ideal solutions to be defined in the core step of the topsis algorithm are often difficult to determine and can only be ascertained according to the best and worst parts of each evaluated indicator which is often imprecise and cumbersomely processed each mca method can generate various flood hazard maps via assigning criteria or order weights according to its own way thereby it is hard to declare which method is optimal researchers and decision makers can select the suitable one based on the research object and the actual situation of the study area 4 3 validation of the results to demonstrate the reliability of the flood hazard assessment results the resultant flood hazard maps were validated using the statistical ranges of historical flood disasters in the basin in 1973 and 2008 respectively for this purpose the ahp topsis and owa α 1 maps were separately overlaid with the 1973 s and the 2008 s flood disaster range maps extracted from the government publications chinese academy of meteorological sciences 1981 shared platform data production group 2006 xiao 2009 and the percentages of flood disaster zones in all flood hazard levels for three maps can be derived correspondingly the spatial relationship between historical flood disaster ranges and flood hazard levels of the ahp topsis and owa α 1 maps were derived using the frequency ratio fr model in this model the ratio is the rate of the area of historical flood disaster to the total area and 1 is taken as the average value if the ratio is more than 1 it indicates a higher correlation whereas the ratio is less than 1 refers to a lower correlation akgun et al 2007 the verification results are exhibited in figs 7 8 in terms of the distribution of flood areas in 1973 the high and highest hazard zones distributed the largest flood disaster areas reaching more than 90 of the total flood areas the percentage of flooded areas distributed in the low and lowest hazard zones is close to each other ranging from 0 to 1 wherein the flood disaster area is the least in the lowest hazard zones while the percentage of flood disaster areas falling into the moderate hazard level is higher in 2008 compared to in 1973 and more than 78 of the flooded area is distributed in the moderate high and highest hazard zones the results of the fr model show that the highest hazard level areas has the largest ratio followed by the high hazard level areas both of which are greater than 1 indicating that flooding is more likely to occur in the high and highest hazard level areas the ratios of the regions with low and lowest hazard levels are the smallest both less than 1 indicating that flooding is less likely to occur in the low and lowest level areas it is clear from the analysis that the flood hazard assessment results are scientific rational and consistent with the actual situation of the basin 5 discussion this study integrated gis with three mca approaches ahp topsis and owa respectively to generate flood hazard maps of the dadu river basin in china and implemented comparative analysis for the resulting maps of which results can support decision makers and planners to select appropriate gis mca method for research needs identify the level of flood hazard areas and develop appropriate flood management strategies the unique suitability for each of these techniques is as follows as an effective tool for system analysis ahp solves decision problems by reducing complex decisions to a series of pairwise comparisons arabameri et al 2019 by hierarchically formulating issues using pairwise comparison and expert knowledge to determine the criteria weights for flood hazard mapping ahp makes the assessment of the contribution of each factor easier and overcomes problems such as overlapping and interrelation between factors stefanidis and stathis 2013 moreover ahp can effectively check the consistency and robustness of the decision maker s evaluation thereby decreasing the bias in the decision making process and increasing the reliability of the resultant ahp topsis and owa hazard map outputs there are more analysis steps and additional works on the criteria involved in the topsis method as compared to ahp requiring a comparatively longer processing time for hazard map generation nyimbili et al 2018 topsis method had rarely been utilized in flood hazard mapping its main advantage is that it does not need flood inventory maps and is very useful and efficient in areas where data about flood events in the past are not available topsis technique is intuitive and easy to implement dispenses with a few difficulties connected with interdependency among attributes and is able to change the input data and analysis the system response to these changes hence its extension and application are suitable for this study for the owa model its main advantages include 1 specifying risk preferences of decision makers by integrating the owa operator with linguistic quantifiers to obtain various sets of order weight other than by using numbers and equations moradi et al 2015 and 2 introducing the operator parameter α as a key factor into the decision process based on which decision makers can control the magnitude of decision risk along the continuum ranging from the pessimistic to optimistic decision strategies hence nine distinct decision strategies for flood hazard mapping in the dadu river basin between two extreme cases of optimistic and pessimistic can be derived the flood hazard maps generated from ahp topsis and owa methods are comparable which illustrates their usability of being basic maps by decision makers to provide effective information for flood risk assessment and disaster mitigation planning in the study area however the reliability of outputs may be limited by considering the availability accuracy and up to datedness of the input data in the future for more targeted studies the discussed gis mca framework can be upgraded and improved by incorporating more data layers describing the factors with spatiotemporal attribute parameters 6 conclusion in the face of the current frequent and severe flood hazard events it is imperative to increase the scientific foundation for disaster risk management identification and zonation of watershed floods can be effective in flood management via supporting controlling floods and thus reducing disaster damages this leads to the increasing need for the development and integration of scientific approaches a range of methods has been used for simulating disaster effects via visualization for easier interpretation of outputs in the form of hazard maps flood hazard maps are widely used in flood management studies the study describes the integration application of gis and three mca techniques ahp topsis and owa for mapping the flood hazard in the dadu river basin total eleven flood hazard maps with a hazard rating level scale from lowest to highest were generated compared and analyzed in terms of the distribution pattern of the areas at hazard across the river basin this is the first application of topsis and owa to flood hazard mapping of the dadu river basin the resultant hazard maps are similar to that derived from the ahp method which can consolidate the mca techniques in flood risk management shows significant potential in the future due to its numerous advantages especially the applicability for areas where there is a shortage of flood inventory data and can be easily extended and applied to other watersheds the generated flood hazard zone maps provide accessible hazard level information for decision makers to classify the most at hazard areas and make optimal flood management strategies with

2994,flood is one of the most common natural disasters worldwide and has caused serious harm to humans socio economy and the environment identification and classification of flood hazard areas is therefore essential for flood management and risk decision making which attempt to combat this challenge this study selected eleven flood hazard conditioning factors as evaluation criteria integrated geographic information system gis with three multi criteria analysis mca techniques viz the analytical hierarchy process ahp technique ordered preference by similarity to the ideal solution topsis and ordered weighted averaging owa to form a gis mca framework for analyzing the spatial distribution of flood prone areas its application in the dadu river basin china derived a total of eleven flood hazard maps across the basin and their analysis and comparison results demonstrated the spatial distributions of flood prone areas based on various gis mca approaches and their overlap situations and indicated that hazard class distribution patterns of the ahp topsis and owa α 1 maps are similar and luding yuexi and their nearby areas are the highest hazard zones where should be concerned on firstly under the condition of limited resources to validate the three mca methods the ahp topsis and owa α 1 maps were compared with the historical flood disaster ranges the verification results exhibited that the largest proportion of historical flood disaster ranges fell into the high and highest hazard levels in the three maps and shown the resultant flood hazard maps are scientific rational and consistent with the actual situation the gis mca approach is a powerful and feasible guidance tool for conducting flood disaster management studies and a reference for future more efficient flood management and risk decision making in the basin keywords flood hazard mapping geographic information system gis multi criteria analysis mca analytical hierarchy process ahp technique ordered preference by similarity to the ideal solution topsis ordered weighted averaging owa 1 introduction floods is one of the most frequent destructive and widespread natural disaster worldwide generally induced by the composed situation of heavy rainfall and unfavorable geographical environment and has caused serious life loss and economic damage over the past decades gaume et al 2009 to prevent and alleviate future flood disaster loss and damage flood risk assessment and management researches came into being and developing the primary step of formulating effective studies is to conduct a flood hazard assessment which considers the combined influence of disaster inducing factors and disaster forming environment mainly studies the hazard of a certain area that may be hit by floods and can reflect the spatial distribution of flood hazardous degree via visualized flood hazard maps flood hazard map depicts areas that may be at various level flood hazard can serve as spatial decision making and planning guidance greiving et al 2005 early risk identification assistance and public awareness enhancement channel de moel et al 2009 and therefore has been an important flood risk communication tool and scientific basis for flood disaster management and widely applied to various fields such as floodplain management flood insurance and disaster warning systems wang et al 2015 accordingly developing an effective flood hazard assessment method with visualized flood hazard maps as outputs is urgently necessary recently numerous methods and models have been proposed and used for flood hazard zoning wherein satellite images and geographic information system gis have gradually taken precedence with the advancement of satellite technology asare kyei et al 2015 gis can provide a common framework and spatial state for the data representing flood causal factors obtained from various sources to generate new derivative maps interpret the assessment results intuitionistic due to its visualization capacity and be used as a decision support system kourgialas and karatzas 2011 nyimbili et al 2018 diverse approaches have been applied to integrate flood factors in a gis environment toosi et al 2019 multi criteria analysis mca is one of the most widely used decision analysis techniques in the gis environment malczewski et al 2003 particularly in natural hazard studies jozaghi et al 2018 nefeslioglu et al 2013 sinha et al 2008 gis based mca can be regarded as a set of techniques and procedures that transform and combine geographical data and the decision maker s preferences to obtain decision making information kourgialas and karatzas 2011 nyimbili et al 2018 the integration of mca with gis for analyzing flood hazard zones depends on the geographical distribution of the alternatives and the value judgments incorporated in the process of decision making nyimbili et al 2018 and provides base maps for planning and formulating more flexible and accurate risk decisions based on the synergetic capabilities of gis and mca the benefits of promoting the theoretical and applied research of gis mcda have been prominently protruded malczewski 2006 there have been a large number of studies that focus on the use of gis mca for flood hazard assessment chen et al 2015 fernández and lutz 2010 kourgialas and karatzas 2017 2016 sanyal and lu 2006 toosi et al 2019 it can be concluded from these researches that the selection of the mca approach is very important since it has a considerable effect on the outcome according to a survey of the current state of the art taken by de brito and evers 2016 it can be obtained that the analytical hierarchy process ahp was the most popular method followed by technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis ahp is the most common used mca method in the flood risk management field and has been proven to be efficient for developing automated methods to quantify the spatial variability of flood hazards and the associated problems dahri and abida 2017 de brito and evers 2016 stefanidis and stathis 2013 coupled the analytical hierarchy process ahp and gis to assess the flood hazard based on natural and anthropogenic factors kazakis et al 2015 superimposed seven parameters to an index and utilized the index and ahp model to map the regional scaled flood hazard in greece the ability of the presented method was shown by comparing resulted maps with historical flood data dahri and abida 2017 applied ahp and gis to delineate and characterize flood hazard areas in gabes catchment southeastern tunisia based on the geological map digital elevation model land use and rainfall data in the study of luu et al 2018 ahp was used to assess the criteria and sub criteria of the flood hazard this assessment was integrated with gis to produce a flood hazard map topsis has been increasingly applied in flood risk management because of its ability to deal with multiple attributes de brito and evers 2016 ghanbarpour et al 2013 used topsis to optimize flood control by comparing flood mitigation alternatives based on various criteria topsis was combined with a non parameter resampling bootstrap technique by mojtahedi and oo 2016 to analyze and rank the flood risk of australian states and territories luu et al 2019 proposed a new assessment tool multiple linear regression topsis to analyze the flood disaster data of vietnam s regions and provinces which provides accessible information for decision makers and planners to classify the most at risk areas in recent years the ordered weighted averaging owa method has also been gradually effectively applied in flood hazard researches xiao et al 2017 developed an mca framework incorporating gis fuzzy ahp and owa method based on selecting geographical hydrological and other factors as criteria and taken the lower han river region as the study area to implement flood hazard assessment with analyzing different risk attitudes of decision makers gilandeh et al 2020 employed the gis owa model to extract flood potential maps of meshkinshahr city iran which can be seen as a useful tool for determining and classifying flood prone areas in meshkinshahr city and its surrounding drainage basin to concern the uncertainty related to criteria weights spatial heterogeneity of preferences and the risk attitude of the analyst tang et al 2018 used monte carlo simulation to integrate owa and probabilistic methods to delineate the potential flood susceptible areas vanolya and niaraki 2021 adopted the gis owa model to generate flood hazard maps of the mazandaran province of iran according to pessimistic or optimistic strategies of which subjective and subjective objective weights were assigned by ahp and entropy ahp methods respectively to highlight the decision maker s risk preference and ensure the operability comparability and applicability of the research ahp topsis and owa are utilized this study is centered on developing a framework for mapping the basin scale flood hazard by integrating gis and ahp topsis and owa and comparing the three gis mca methods resulted flood hazard maps for identifying and analyzing the flood at hazard areas and consequently to determine the applicability of these techniques in flood risk management 2 study area the dadu river flows from the easterntibetan plateauinto thesichuan basinwhere it joins with themin river atributaryof theyangtze river china and is 1 062 km in length with a catchment area of 77 400 km2 it is actually longer than

methodology 3 1 data collection the primary challenge of generating flood hazard zoning maps is to identify the flood disaster inducing factors and disaster forming environment factors based on the actual conditions of the study area and regional flood characteristics and to prepare corresponding thematic layers in geospatial format according to previous literature on flood hazard alaghmand et al 2010 kourgialas and karatzas 2017 toosi et al 2019 wang et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 eleven flood hazard conditioning parameters for the present work are derived the thorough procedure of collecting data is described as follows and the derived gis layers are shown in fig 2 to perform algebraic and logical operations all thematic layers were resampled as raster data with 30 m spatial resolution shao et al 2015 rainfall intensity based on the collected monthly precipitation data at the observational stations in and out of the dadu river basin during the time period 1960 2013 the modified fournier index mfi is applied to create the rainfall intensity map toosi et al 2019 1 mfi 1 12 p 2 p where mfi is the modified fournier index expresses the sum of the average monthly rainfall

weight idw interpolation technology elevation elevation plays a vital role in the hydrological response of different regions in the study area the areas with low elevation downstream areas are supposed to be more susceptible to floods and vice versa sepehri et al 2019 talukdar et al 2020 digital elevation model dem is a principal source of extracting topographic condition of the study area

decline in the slope the water infiltration rate and the water velocity increase and reduce respectively and therefore the chances of flooding increase aspect it governs evapotranspiration soil moisture retention and vegetation development thereby determining the flow direction and infiltration to runoff ratio sahana and patel 2019 curvature curvature reflects the morphology of the

soil texture map 3 2 multi criteria analysis mca 3 2 1 analytical hierarchy process ahp ahp method is the most implemented mca method that constructs the complex decision problem into a hierarchical framework estimates the criteria weights using pairwise comparison with numerical importance scales saaty 2008 and provides a systematic approach for assessing and integrating the impacts of various factors in flood risk management field which makes complex risk management decision problem easy to analyze and handle with stefanidis and stathis 2013 xiao et al 2017 for each level of the decision criteria hierarchy framework there is a control process of pairwise comparisons between the criteria which is made through saaty s comparative scale table 1 dahri and abida 2017 these assigned weights were normalized by the eigenvector technique and finally tested for consistency by computing a consistency ratio cr which must be less than 0 1 so as to be accepted toosi et al 2019 stefanidis and stathis 2013 otherwise value judgments have to be recalculated the final step is the integration of the weights associated with attribute map layers derived by ahp and the attribute map layers in the gis environment 3 2 2 technique ordered preference by similarity to the ideal solution topsis topsis proposed by hwang and yoon 1981 can integrate seamlessly with gis and can be implemented according to the following steps kaliszewski and podkopaev 2016 milani et al 2005 step 1 construct the normalized decision matrix r rij 4 r ij d ij i d ij 2 i 1 m j 1 n where dij is the value of the ith alternative ai i 1 m with respect to the jth attribute xj j 1 n step 2 weigh the normalized decision matrix v vij 5 v ij w j r ij i 1 m j 1 n where wj is the weight of the jth attribute step 3 ascertain positive ideal solution pis and negative ideal solution nis a j and a j j 1 n 6 a j v 1 v 2 v j v n max n v ij j j 1 min n v ij j j 2 i 1 m 7 a j v 1 v 2 v j v n min n v ij j j 1 max n v ij j j 2 i 1 m where j 1 and j 2 are a group of benefit attributes and cost attributes respectively step 4 measure the distances of each alternative from pis and nis s i and s i i 1 m 8 s i j 1 n v ij a j 2 i 1 m 9 s i j 1 n v ij a j 2 i 1 m step 5 calculate the relative closeness of alternatives to the ideal solution ci 10 c i s i s i s i i 1 m 0 c i 1 3 2 3 ordered weighted averaging owa the owa operator proposed by yager 1988 provides a parameterized multi criteria aggregation method kiavarz and jelokhani niaraki 2017 it involves both criterion weights and order weights the criterion weights are assigned to evaluation criteria or attributes in a study area to indicate their relative importance according to the decision maker s preferences ahmed 2015 order weights are assigned to the rank order position of factor values for a given location the calculation procedure is as follows given a set of standardized attribute values xi1 xi2 xin 0 xij 1 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n the owa operator can be defined as in i that has an associated set of order weights v1 v2 vn 0 v j 1 j 1 n v j 1 j 1 2 n and calculated as 11 owa j v j z ij where zi1 zi2 zin is the sequence obtained by reordering the attribute values xi1 xi2 xin in descending order vj is associated with the attribute values on a location by location basis and assigned to the ith location s attribute values in decreasing order without consideration of with which attribute they are associated the first ordered weight v1 is assigned to the highest attribute value for the ith location and similarly vn is assigned to the lowest attribute value apparently a particular value of aij is not associated with a particular weight vj but rather a weight is assigned to a particular ordered position of xij kiavarz and jelokhani niaraki 2017 malczewski et al 2003 for each criterion xij the jth attribute associated with the ith location raster specify benefit and cost types based on the direct inverse relationships between criteria and flood hazard eqs 12 and 13 can respectively be used to convert the attribute values into standardized values 12 x ij y ij y j min y j max y j min 13 x ij y j max y ij y j max y j min where yij is the jth attribute value for the ith location y j min and y j max represent the minimum and maximum values for the jth attribute respectively kiavarz and jelokhani niaraki 2017 factually the gis based decision making problems require a set of different weights to be assigned to attributes criteria which is ignored for the owa operator denoted by eq 11 in response an attribute weight modification approach was proposed to generate the order weights based on the inclusion of the attribute weights into the owa operator as follows kiavarz and jelokhani niaraki 2017 14 v j k 1 j u k k 1 n u k α k 1 j 1 u k k 1 n u k α where α is the operator parameter corresponding to different linguistic quantifiers and as α varies different sets of order weights are obtained uj is the reordered jth attribute weight wj according to the reordered attribute value zij wj is the attribute weight assigned to jth attribute for all locations indicates the relative importance of the attribute according to the decision maker s preferences and is determined by the ahp method in this study in the gis based mca procedures the attribute weights typically have the following property j 1 n w j 1 accordingly j 1 n u j 1 and eq 14 can be written as follows 15 v j j 1 n u j α j 1 n 1 u j α and the owa operator can be defined as 16 ow a i j 1 n u j v j z ij j 1 n u j v j eq 16 can be recognized as the conventional weighted linear combination with modified criterion weights the weights are obtained by multiplying the criterion weights by the order weights malczewski et al 2003 by adjusting the level of risk for the decision problem the owa algorithm can transfer between logical operations and and or at well to obtain different evaluation results the choice of operator parameter α supports for the decision makers can control the magnitude of decision risk along the continuum ranging from the pessimistic to optimistic decision strategies kiavarz and jelokhani niaraki 2017 17 orness 1 α 1 α 0 the degree of orness indicates the position of the owa on a continuum between the and or or combination rules it is calculated as 18 orness 1 n 1 j 1 n n j v j 0 o r n e s s 1 the measure of orness ranges from 0 to 1 with different sets of owa order weights calculated based on various orness or α values it can be generated that a variety of gis based map combination strategies ranging from a minimum type logical and combination through all intermediate types including the conventional wlc to a maximum type logical or combination see table 2 the and and or operators represent the extreme cases of owa kiavarz and jelokhani niaraki 2017 higher values of α mean decision makers tend to be more risk taking while its lower values represent that the risk aversion tendency is dominant shorabeh et al 2019 4 results and comparative analysis 4 1 ahp topsis and owa maps after careful analysis of the set of evaluation criteria attributes importance judgment to attributes is derived from ahp mfi is regarded as the most important criterion attribute with the largest weight value of 0 1924 followed by dtr with the weight value of 0 1670 elevation and ndvi are respectively considered as the third and fourth most important criteria and their weight values are 0 1374 and 0 1162 respectively subsequently the weights of spi soil lulc and slope are 0 1087 0 0909 0 0705 and 0 0563 respectively the twi curvature and aspect are the less important indicators and their weights are 0 0313 0 0148 and 0 0148 respectively via the weighted sum analysis process the flood hazard map was implemented shown in fig 3 a which was reclassified into five levels i e lowest low moderate high and highest hazard by using the natural break method this technique of flood hazard zoning was implemented for the rest two methods topsis and owa the main calculation procedures of topsis were as outlined in sec 3 2 and the generated flood hazard map is shown in fig 3 b a visual comparison between the ahp based and topsis based flood hazard maps revealed similar spatial distribution patterns for various flood hazard levels both maps show that luding yuexi and their nearby areas were at the most hazard as shown in red those at high hazard level in orange were areas around the midstream of the basin with the topsis map covering relatively more of these areas than the ahp map and of a wider distribution towards the southern part of the region in the topsis map the low and lowest hazard areas in light and dark green covered almost the entire northern region and eastern part of upstream while in the ahp map the northern region of the basin was mainly at the moderate hazard in light yellow the derived criteria weights from ahp has been discussed in section 4 1 and the owa order weights were calculated using different α values in light of eq 15 and shown in table 3 where the value of αcan be selected in the range from 0 to according to decision makers risk preferences owa based flood hazard maps are shown in fig 4 fig 4 illustrated that the results are highly sensitive to the change of α and the overall hazard situation is exacerbated with the increase of α the maximum trade off was achieved when α 1 which made the hazard assessment implemented by neutral attitude i e with no risk preference the high and very high hazard area was significantly increased when the value of α increased from 1 to more high hazard areas are presented and need to be noticed and more corresponding mitigation measures will be put forward to avoid the potential hazard and reduce the potential loss xiao et al 2017 while when the value of α decreased from 1 to 0 the high and very high hazard area was significantly decreased some potential hazard zone may not be exposed and suffer from flood damage 4 2 comparative analysis figs 3 4 illustrate that flood hazard level distribution patterns of ahp topsis and owa α 1 maps are similar which also can be confirmed by the statistical analysis results there are strong correlations between the owa α 1 and ahp maps the topsis and ahp maps and the owa α 1 and topsis maps with corresponding correlation coefficients of 0 9891 0 9049 and 0 9034 respectively the detailed spatial distribution similarities and differences of the flood hazard maps were discussed by implementing the cross tabulation analysis and the results are shown in fig 5 and tables 4 6 the percentages of each flood hazard level area derived from ahp topsis and owa methods were demonstrated in fig 6 in fig 5 ahp topsis ahp owa α 1 and topsis owa α 1 combinations distinguished by various color bar hazard level overlap identifiers reveal the spatial coincidence for each set of maps by comparing hazard level values on the same grid in every two maps by using the image cross tabulation method the flood hazard levels of two maps are compared and a tabulation is obtained of the rate of crossed classified cells in each combination for instance 1 1 in dark green in fig 5 a expresses the overlap portion of zones with the lowest hazard level in both the ahp and owa α 1 maps whose area accounts for 2 16 of the total area which can be red from the second row of table 4 similarly 5 5 in red in fig 5 b implies the overlap portion of zones with the highest hazard level in both the ahp and topsis maps the area of crossed grids accounts for 1 99 of the total area which can be checked from the sixth row of table 5 for all topsis owa α 1 combinations with the topsis map hazard level values 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the strongest overlap distributes in the lowest hazard area level value 1 low hazard area level value 2 low hazard area level value 2 moderate hazard area level value 3 and highest hazard area level value 5 in the owa α 1 map while in terms of the comparison of the ahp map and owa α 1 map for all the combinations with the ahp map hazard level values 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the largest overlap intersperses among the lowest low moderate high and highest hazard areas respectively in the owa α 1 map in contrast the ahp map and owa α 1 map are more compatible with higher similarity of spatial distribution for flood hazard level in tables 4 6 the correlation coefficient cramer s v ranges from 0 to 1 was utilized to illustrate the correlation degree between two flood hazard maps the higher the cramer s v value the more perfect the cross correlation between the compared two maps the kappa index of agreement kia value was derived from the cross correlation analysis as well and regarded as an evidence of describing the similarity between the two flood hazard maps both the cramer s v and overall kia values in tables 4 6 expresses a favorable similarity between the compared flood hazard maps as shown in fig 6 b the histogram of owa α 1 map exhibits a near normal distribution following by the histogram of ahp map whereas that of topsis map is positively skewed showing that low and lowest hazard levels constitute more areas in the topsis map than ahp or owa α 1 map it may be caused by the theoretical natures of the applied mca approaches the ahp method weighting each criterion based on the pair wise comparison matrix with the subjectivity more or less dependent on the effects of one or several flood conditioning factors however the owa algorithm using two step weighting criterion and order weights mode can effectively weaken the effect of subjective evaluation fluctuation value on the accuracy of weights correct some shortcomings of traditional ahp and make the calculation results more adaptable to different flood hazard levels while the positive and negative ideal solutions to be defined in the core step of the topsis algorithm are often difficult to determine and can only be ascertained according to the best and worst parts of each evaluated indicator which is often imprecise and cumbersomely processed each mca method can generate various flood hazard maps via assigning criteria or order weights according to its own way thereby it is hard to declare which method is optimal researchers and decision makers can select the suitable one based on the research object and the actual situation of the study area 4 3 validation of the results to demonstrate the reliability of the flood hazard assessment results the resultant flood hazard maps were validated using the statistical ranges of historical flood disasters in the basin in 1973 and 2008 respectively for this purpose the ahp topsis and owa α 1 maps were separately overlaid with the 1973 s and the 2008 s flood disaster range maps extracted from the government publications chinese academy of meteorological sciences 1981 shared platform data production group 2006 xiao 2009 and the percentages of flood disaster zones in all flood hazard levels for three maps can be derived correspondingly the spatial relationship between historical flood disaster ranges and flood hazard levels of the ahp topsis and owa α 1 maps were derived using the frequency ratio fr model in this model the ratio is the rate of the area of historical flood disaster to the total area and 1 is taken as the average value if the ratio is more than 1 it indicates a higher correlation whereas the ratio is less than 1 refers to a lower correlation akgun et al 2007 the verification results are exhibited in figs 7 8 in terms of the distribution of flood areas in 1973 the high and highest hazard zones distributed the largest flood disaster areas reaching more than 90 of the total flood areas the percentage of flooded areas distributed in the low and lowest hazard zones is close to each other ranging from 0 to 1 wherein the flood disaster area is the least in the lowest hazard zones while the percentage of flood disaster areas falling into the moderate hazard level is higher in 2008 compared to in 1973 and more than 78 of the flooded area is distributed in the moderate high and highest hazard zones the results of the fr model show that the highest hazard level areas has the largest ratio followed by the high hazard level areas both of which are greater than 1 indicating that flooding is more likely to occur in the high and highest hazard level areas the ratios of the regions with low and lowest hazard levels are the smallest both less than 1 indicating that flooding is less likely to occur in the low and lowest level areas it is clear from the analysis that the flood hazard assessment results are scientific rational and consistent with the actual situation of the basin 5 discussion this study integrated gis with three mca approaches ahp topsis and owa respectively to generate flood hazard maps of the dadu river basin in china and implemented comparative analysis for the resulting maps of which results can support decision makers and planners to select appropriate gis mca method for research needs identify the level of flood hazard areas and develop appropriate flood management strategies the unique suitability for each of these techniques is as follows as an effective tool for system analysis ahp solves decision problems by reducing complex decisions to a series of pairwise comparisons arabameri et al 2019 by hierarchically formulating issues using pairwise comparison and expert knowledge to determine the criteria weights for flood hazard mapping ahp makes the assessment of the contribution of each factor easier and overcomes problems such as overlapping and interrelation between factors stefanidis and stathis 2013 moreover ahp can effectively check the consistency and robustness of the decision maker s evaluation thereby decreasing the bias in the decision making process and increasing the reliability of the resultant ahp topsis and owa hazard map outputs there are more analysis steps and additional works on the criteria involved in the topsis method as compared to ahp requiring a comparatively longer processing time for hazard map generation nyimbili et al 2018 topsis method had rarely been utilized in flood hazard mapping its main advantage is that it does not need flood inventory maps and is very useful and efficient in areas where data about flood events in the past are not available topsis technique is intuitive and easy to implement dispenses with a few difficulties connected with interdependency among attributes and is able to change the input data and analysis the system response to these changes hence its extension and application are suitable for this study for the owa model its main advantages include 1 specifying risk preferences of decision makers by integrating the owa operator with linguistic quantifiers to obtain various sets of order weight other than by using numbers and equations moradi et al 2015 and 2 introducing the operator parameter α as a key factor into the decision process based on which decision makers can control the magnitude of decision risk along the continuum ranging from the pessimistic to optimistic decision strategies hence nine distinct decision strategies for flood hazard mapping in the dadu river basin between two extreme cases of optimistic and pessimistic can be derived the flood hazard maps generated from ahp topsis and owa methods are comparable which illustrates their usability of being basic maps by decision makers to provide effective information for flood risk assessment and disaster mitigation planning in the study area however the reliability of outputs may be limited by considering the availability accuracy and up to datedness of the input data in the future for more targeted studies the discussed gis mca framework can be upgraded and improved by incorporating more data layers describing the factors with spatiotemporal attribute parameters 6 conclusion in the face of the current frequent and severe flood hazard events it is imperative to increase the scientific foundation for disaster risk management identification and zonation of watershed floods can be effective in flood management via supporting controlling floods and thus reducing disaster damages this leads to the increasing need for the development and integration of scientific approaches a range of methods has been used for simulating disaster effects via visualization for easier interpretation of outputs in the form of hazard maps flood hazard maps are widely used in flood management studies the study describes the integration application of gis and three mca techniques ahp topsis and owa for mapping the flood hazard in the dadu river basin total eleven flood hazard maps with a hazard rating level scale from lowest to highest were generated compared and analyzed in terms of the distribution pattern of the areas at hazard across the river basin this is the first application of topsis and owa to flood hazard mapping of the dadu river basin the resultant hazard maps are similar to that derived from the ahp method which can consolidate the mca techniques in flood risk management shows significant potential in the future due to its numerous advantages especially the applicability for areas where there is a shortage of flood inventory data and can be easily extended and applied to other watersheds the generated flood hazard zone maps provide accessible hazard level information for decision makers to classify the most at hazard areas and make optimal flood management strategies with
