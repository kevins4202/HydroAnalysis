22120,to increase the horizontal and uplift resistances of piles in offshore structures pile reinforcements such as anchored piles batter piles and micro piles have been generally applied in this study the emphasis was on quantifying the reinforcement effect of an anchored pile on the horizontal and uplift resistances of a submerged breakwater a framework for determining the seabed soil spring constants p y curve and t z curve is proposed from an analytical method and numerical analysis based on the results a new hyperbolic load transfer curve is proposed to design anchored piles by considering the reinforcement effect which considers the reinforcement coefficients of horizontal and uplift loads obtained from the load transfer curves the proposed load transfer curves are compared against the results from the full modeling analysis and show good agreement through comparisons with case studies it is found that the effects of the shear force bending moment and displacement are more significant for anchored piles than for unreinforced piles thus the proposed curves appropriately represent the reinforcement effect of anchored piles in offshore structures keywords submerged breakwater anchored pile load transfer curves reinforcement coefficient reinforcement effect numerical analysis 1 introduction recently coastal erosion has increased globally due to the sea level rise caused by climate change according to the rcp representative concentration pathways 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios ipcc 2013 sea level rises of 0 26 0 55 m and 0 45 0 82 m respectively are expected to occur around the world in the late 21st century 2081 2100 coastal erosion is expected to accelerate due to the sea level rise and various structures have been installed in coastal areas to prevent coastal erosion the prevention measures for coastal erosion can be divided into 1 soft defense techniques and 2 hard defense techniques prasetya 2006 hsu et al 2008 yang et al 2010 soft defense techniques are methods that indirectly prevent coastal erosion they are easy to install and dismantle and are economical and environmentally friendly methods however the effect of preventing coastal erosion using a soft defense technique is weaker than that using a hard defense technique because it cannot directly prevent coastal erosion soft defense techniques typically include geotubes sand nets planting methods floating breakwaters and beach nourishment hard defense techniques are the methods of installing coastal structures to prevent coastal erosion they can maximize the effect of preventing coastal erosion because coastal structures can directly block waves and currents which are the cause of coastal erosion however coastal structures may cause environmental damage due to secondary erosion and deposition after installation because they are difficult to install and dismantle hard defense techniques generally include groins offshore breakwaters and submerged breakwaters in particular submerged breakwaters have advantages such as 1 preserving coastal scenery 2 securing view rights and 3 minimizing changes in the coastal environment therefore submerged breakwaters have recently been applied in the east sea where coastal erosion is serious in south korea the submerged breakwater is chosen as a representative offshore structure in this study this structure is a low breakwater that is typically installed in a direction parallel to the coast as shown in fig 1 a submerged breakwaters can prevent coastal erosion by decreasing the wave transmission and wave steepness however the horizontal and uplift loads acting on the submerged breakwater are expected to increase because of the increase in the wave power due to sea level rise various techniques have been used to increase the resistance of pile foundations these include geosynthetic reinforcement and installation of helical piles bian et al 2008 prasad and rao 1996 in addition the anchored pile was recently developed in south korea to increase the resistance of pile foundations for offshore structures here the anchored piles supporting the submerged breakwater have the anchors in the upper pile to resist the horizontal and uplift loads as shown in fig 1 a anchored piles are designed to fold the anchors during pile installation so that they do not interrupt the pile penetration additionally the anchors are unfolded after pile installation to increase the resistance of the piles subjected to horizontal and uplift loads sim et al 2011 the anchors are horizontally unfolded to increase the uplift horizontal and vertical resistances in the case of installation the pile penetration can be performed quickly and easily by using a high pressure water pump fig 1 b illustrates the schematic illustration of anchored piles however the reinforcement effect in terms of the number of anchors soil conditions and loading conditions is poorly understood because the magnitude of the reinforcement owing to the anchored piles has not yet been quantified the overall objective of this study is to understand the behavior of anchored piles subjected to horizontal and uplift loads and quantify the reinforcement effect of anchored piles in terms of the number of anchors soil conditions and loading conditions three dimensional finite element analyses are carried out using the plaxis 3d commercial program brinkgreve et al 2007 based on the numerical results the load transfer curves p y curve and t z curve are analyzed by increasing the horizontal and uplift resistances and the reinforcement effect of anchored piles is quantified thus the load transfer curves considering the reinforcement effect are proposed in addition the behavior of the typical submerged breakwater is analyzed using the proposed load transfer curve and the applicability of anchored piles is examined 2 load transfer method various works have been performed by many researchers to study the behavior of piles many empirical and numerical methods have been proposed for analyzing the load deformation behavior of piles subjected to horizontal or uplift loads they can typically be classified into three groups 1 empirical methods brinch hansen 1961 broms 1964 2 load transfer curve methods matlock 1970 reese and wright 1977 o neill and gazioughlu 1984 jeong et al 2004 kim et al 2011 and 3 finite element methods brown and shie 1991 jeremic and yang 2002 kim et al 2013 reported that load transfer curve methods and finite element methods are suitable for analyzing pile behavior because they can consider the nonlinearity and continuity of soils additionally jeong and seo 2004 described that load transfer curve methods are intermediate methods between empirical methods and finite element methods therefore the reinforcement effect by anchored piles was analyzed based on the load transfer curve method in this study in load transfer methods the soil resistance is idealized as the elasto plastic spring and the stress strain behavior of each spring is defined by the load transfer curves coyle and reese 1966 as shown in fig 2 the horizontal shear and end bearing load transfer curve methods are typically referred to as the p y curve t z curve and q w curve respectively several different methods such as bilinear hyperbolic and exponential functions have been used to express the load transfer curves and many researchers have studied the load transfer curves for pile soil interaction using a hyperbolic function in particular liang et al 2007 kim et al 2011 to characterize the stress strain behavior of the soil nonlinear properties of the soil resistance can be expressed as a hyperbolic function as follows kondner 1963 1 f w t 1 k w t f m a x where f is the soil resistance w t is the relative displacement between the pile and soil k is the initial tangent slope of the hyperbolic function and f max is the ultimate soil resistance in this study the typical shapes of p y curves and t z curves for anchored piles are represented by hyperbolic functions in this study the horizontal and uplift loads are assumed to act in the x and z directions respectively based on the results from three dimensional finite element analysis the p y curve and t z curve can be obtained for the t z curves the shear resistance t is obtained from integrating the friction resistance between the pile element and soil element and the relative displacement z is the vertical difference between the vertical coordinates z direction of the pile element and soil element for the p y curves the soil resistance p is calculated by integrating the stresses in the soil element around the perimeter of the pile fan and long 2005 kim et al 2011 here the stresses in the soil elements at the gauss points closest to the pile are defined as the soil resistance p between the pile and soil the x component stress in a soil element at each arbitrary depth can be represented by the traction vector t x as follows 2 t x σ x x n x σ x y n y σ x z n z where t x is the traction vector σ xx σ xy and σ xz are the effective stresses in the xx xy and xz directions respectively and n x n y and n z are the components of the unit normal vectors along the x y and z directions respectively at the gauss point based on the traction vector t x obtained from equation 2 the total soil resistance per unit length p x along the pile can be estimated by integrating the stresses in the x direction acting on the soil element around the pile as follows 3 p x t x d l where p x is the total soil resistance per unit length along the pile and l is the perimeter of the closest gauss points in the soil elements around the pile the p y curves at a given depth can be finally determined by the relation between the soil resistance p obtained from the abovementioned method and the corresponding horizontal displacement y of the pile as described above the load transfer curves are defined by the stress strain behavior of the soil considering the soil pile interactions the anchored piles increase the load transfer curve due to the reinforcement effect of the anchors therefore the resistance of anchored piles is larger than that of original piles fig 3 shows the concepts of the reinforcement effect of the load transfer curve by anchored piles 3 three dimensional finite element analysis 3 1 fe modeling parametric studies were carried out using the three dimensional finite element method to analyze the behavior of anchored piles in terms of soil conditions loading conditions and the number of anchors the plaxis 3d commercial program brinkgreve et al 2007 was used for the numerical analyses table 1 shows the parameters and analysis cases for the parametric studies the displacements occur within the depths of 5d where d is the pile diameter below the ground surface in particular the maximum bending moment of piles under horizontal loads generally occurs at the upper part of piles kim et al 2014b in addition there is a depth close to the ground surface where the shear force in the pile is zero this depth of zero shear was obtained for the test piles at 7d the pile diameter according to briaud s results briaud 1997 based on this the behavior of piles in the deep layer 7d are of little importance because the deflection of a horizontally loaded pile is considerably small or almost zero at great depth below the ground surface in addition in order to select the optimized location of the anchor pre analysis was performed with varying the locations of anchors in piles based on the pre analysis it was found that the uplift resistance of anchored piles with anchors in the upper part was larger thus the application of the anchored piles with anchors in the upper part can be more reasonable in regards of structural serviceability for these reasons the anchors are assumed to be located at the upper part of the pile to maximize the increases in the horizontal and uplift resistances the behavior of the soil was characterized by the elasto perfectly plastic material according to the mohr coulomb model the soil conditions for the analysis were assumed to be a homogeneous sandy soil layer loose sand dense sand in the coastal area based on previous studies bowels 1996 ulker 2012 verhaeghe et al 2013 das 2015 kim et al 2014a the typical properties of the sandy soil in the coastal area are summarized in table 2 fig 4 illustrates the geometries of the anchored piles and typical modeling for the parametric studies an anchored pile with a diameter of 500 mm and a length of 10 m was considered in the parametric study in addition the length and diameter of the anchor were 1 m and 500 mm respectively both the anchored piles and the anchors were modeled by a linear elastic model the behavior of the interface was applied using the contact element in the plaxis 3d program the interface element was characterized by the bilinear mohr coulomb model to simulate the behaviors of the soil pile interfaces such as the slip behavior and gap behavior generally the deformation in the interface element can be divided into 1 elastic behavior at small displacements and 2 plastic behavior in slip behavior the deformation behaves like an element that has the properties of the nearby soil elements before slip occurs after slip occurred the interface element was characterized by a decreased shear modulus the decrease in strength for the interface element was referred to as a strength reduction factor r inter in plaxis 3d the interface properties can be determined by the strength reduction factor r inter as follows 4 c inter r inter c soil 5 tanφ inter r inter tanφ soil where c inter is the cohesion of the interface c soil is the cohesion of the soil φ inter is the friction angle of the interface and φ soil is the friction angle of the soil an r inter of 1 0 means that the interface element has the same material as the adjacent soil element whereas an r inter of 0 0 means that it behaves as a frictionless interface the strength reduction factor r inter of 0 7 was chosen in this analysis following the plaxis 3d manual the overall dimensions of the model comprise the domains in the x and y directions of 20d from the pile center and a height z direction of 3l p where l p is the pile length to minimize the possible boundary effect on the numerical results zero horizontal displacements were predefined at the four side boundaries and full fixities were set at the bottom boundary the input parameters for parametric studies are summarized in table 3 3 2 validation validation of the numerical model used in this study was based on the uplift test on a steel pipe pile conducted by reese and cox 1976 the numerical modeling was carried out to simulate the uplift test and analyze the behavior of a pile under uplift loading the test site is located in corpus christi bay near port aransas texas a borehole standard penetration test was conducted in the test site and properties of each soil layers from the spt n value and the soil type are presented in table 4 typical properties of clayey and sands presented by bowles 1996 were used to determine the properties for numerical modeling there were 5 soil layers in the test site and the steel pipe pile was penetrated into the dense silty sand layer the diameter of the steel pipe pile was 0 6 m with the length of 21 m and has a pile thickness of 0 01 m the uplift test condition is described in fig 5 based on the soil layer profile and the pile specifications the result of the numerical analysis was compared with a load displacement curve from the uplift test in the site reese and cox 1976 and the comparison of the load displacement curve is described in fig 6 there was a difference of displacement at small loads but similar results after yielding based on the results of the validation it is concluded that the general trend observed by the field load test is similar to the prediction made by fe analysis therefore the numerical model employed in this study is reasonable enough to conduct a parametric study 3 3 results and discussion 3 3 1 failure mechanism to investigate the effect of the anchors on the behavior of pile and soil series of numerical analysis was carried out fig 7 shows the displacement contours for horizontal and uplift loads for uplift loading condition the applied load was 600 kn as the number of anchors increases the displacement due to uplift resistance of the pile has decreased displacements of pile head were 29 73 mm 17 13 mm and 14 13 mm for 0 2 and 4 anchors respectively the decrease in pile displacement was observed not only on the pile head but also along the full length of the pile for the unreinforced pile the displacement of the lower 1 5d part of the pile was within 50 of the pile head displacement where the rest showed similar displacement with the pile head the anchored pile with 2 anchors showed less displacement where the displacement of the pile head to the lower 1 5d showed about 15 of unreinforced pile head displacement and the mid part up to 6d showed 50 of unreinforced pile head displacement the rest of the pile displacement was within 60 70 of the unreinforced pile head displacement the anchored pile with 4 anchors showed overall about 30 40 of the unreinforced pile head displacement for horizontal loading condition the applied load was 300 kn a similar tendency was observed under the horizontal loading condition as the number of anchors increases the horizontal displacement due to horizontal resistance of the pile has decreased displacements of pile head were 53 21 mm 32 14 mm and 31 31 mm for 0 2 and 4 anchors respectively notable decrease in horizontal displacement on the pile head was observed between the unreinforced and anchored piles in addition the influence region due to horizontal loading decreased as the number of anchors increases by setting the reference horizontal displacement to the allowable horizontal displacement 1 5 in 38 mm of the unreinforced pile head displacement the influence region due to horizontal loading for unreinforced 2 anchors and 4 anchors pile was approximately 3 5d vertical 1 7d horizontal 2 6d 1 2d and 2 4d 1 1d respectively as a result in case of the uplift loading condition the displacement transfers under the working load level which is related to the soil reaction occurring in the soil due to uplift force was limited in the upper soil therefore the anchor in the upper part of the pile can mobilize greater uplift resistance compared to other parts of the pile in case of the horizontal loading condition it was clear that the reinforcement effect of the anchor in the upper part of the pile under horizontal loading was greater 3 3 2 reinforcement effect based on the results of three dimensional finite element analyses the reinforcement effects in terms of various conditions were directly investigated through the load displacement curves fig 8 shows the horizontal load displacement curves of loose sand and dense sand in south korea the allowable horizontal displacement of the pile is specified to be at least 15 mm in the design korea rail network authority 2004 korean geotechnical society 2009 in the case of the united states and japan the allowable horizontal displacement is generally specified as 1 5 in 38 mm for the loose sand the horizontal loads in the cases of 2 anchors and 4 anchors are larger than that of no anchor by approximately 3 and 8 respectively at a horizontal displacement of 15 mm in addition the horizontal loads for 2 anchors and 4 anchors are larger than that for no anchor by 6 and 10 respectively at a horizontal displacement of 38 mm additionally for the dense sand the horizontal loads in the cases of 2 anchors and 4 anchors are larger than that of no anchor by approximately 6 and 11 respectively in the cases of 2 anchors and 4 anchors since the horizontal displacement obtained from the numerical analyses did not occur up to 38 mm the horizontal load at 38 mm was assumed as the horizontal load at the last loading step as a result the horizontal loads for both 2 and 4 anchors are larger than that for no anchor by 14 the horizontal loads at the allowable horizontal displacements of 15 mm and 38 mm are summarized in table 5 fig 9 illustrates the uplift load displacement curves for loose sand and dense sand as shown in fig 9 the reinforcement effect of the anchored pile starts to appear after 5 mm for the loose sand case and 2 mm for the dense sand case gaaver 2013 conducted experimental model tests to investigate the behavior of a single pile and pile groups subjected to uplift loads he stated that the uplift displacements corresponding to the ultimate uplift loads are generally approximately 1 4 2 5 times the pile diameter d therefore in this study it was assumed that the uplift displacement corresponding to the ultimate uplift loads is 10 mm which is 2 of the pile diameter d in cases of loose sand the uplift loads for 2 anchors and 4 anchors are larger than that for no anchor by approximately 5 and 7 respectively at the ultimate uplift displacement of 10 mm additionally for the dense sand the uplift loads for 2 anchors and 4 anchors have increments of 13 and 17 respectively caused by the reinforcement effect due to the anchors the uplift loads at the ultimate uplift displacements of 10 mm are summarized in table 6 both the horizontal and the uplift displacements of anchored piles are smaller than those of unreinforced piles and the reinforcement effects of 4 anchored piles are surely larger than those of 2 anchored piles in addition the reinforcement effects of dense sand are larger than those of loose sand indicating that the anchors embedded in the dense sand could generate more resistance to the surrounding soil due to the stiffer soil for anchored piles subjected to the horizontal load the reinforcement effects are from 3 to 14 compared with those for the unreinforced piles and increase with increasing allowable horizontal displacement for anchored piles subjected to the uplift load the reinforcement effects of the anchored pile vary from 5 to 17 which are larger than those of the anchored pile subjected to the horizontal load 3 3 3 quantification of the reinforcement effect by analyzing the load transfer curve to quantify the reinforcement effect of anchored piles the load transfer curves for horizontal and uplift loads were analyzed figs 10 and 11 show the results of calculating the load transfer curves p y and t z curves according to the depth the number of anchors and the soil conditions fig 10 a illustrates the p y curves for loose sand and the ultimate horizontal soil resistances for 2 anchors and 4 anchors are larger than that for no anchor by approximately 8 24 and 10 35 respectively in addition fig 10 b shows the p y curves for dense sand it shows that the ultimate horizontal soil resistances for 2 anchors and 4 anchors are increased up to 20 68 and 25 95 respectively fig 11 a shows the t z curves for loose sand under uplift loading and it indicates that the ultimate shear resistances under uplift loading for 2 anchors and 4 anchors are larger than that for no anchor by approximately 19 25 and 26 40 respectively fig 11 b illustrates the t z curves for dense sand and shows that the ultimate shear resistances under uplift loading for 2 anchors and 4 anchors are increased up to 4 26 and 7 38 respectively these results directly indicate the reinforcement effect of anchored piles and are used to quantify the reinforcement effect the reinforcement effect of anchored piles decreases with increasing soil depth and there is little reinforcement effect at depths below 2 m for horizontal loads and below 3 m for uplift loads in this study this tendency is clear because the upper pile was reinforced to maximize the reinforcement effect on the horizontal and uplift loads therefore the load transfer curve increases due to the reinforcement effect of anchored piles fig 12 is a conceptual diagram showing that the increase in the load transfer curve due to the reinforcement effect appears as an increase in the maximum resistance a framework for determining the seabed soil spring constants p y curve and t z curve is proposed from an analytical method and numerical analysis based on the results a new hyperbolic load transfer curve is proposed to design anchored piles by considering the reinforcement effect which considers the reinforcement coefficients of the horizontal and uplift loads obtained from the load transfer curves the reinforcement effect of the proposed load transfer curve was represented by the maximum convergence value that is the maximum resistance it was shown that there is no remarkable difference in the initial slopes which is probably because the effect of the anchor is not large at small displacements generally the group effect in pile groups appears when the pile spacing is in the range of 3d 6d where d is the pile diameter brown et al 1987 1988 rollins et al 2006a rollins et al 2006b in particular jeong et al 2004 proposed that the group effect is negligible when the pile spacing is larger than 7d based on a study on stabilizing piles in slopes where lateral movement is dominant thus in the case of a submerged breakwater which typically has a pile spacing of 10d or more it is reasonable to assume that the group effect does not affect the structural behavior for this reason the proposal of the load transfer curve for submerged breakwaters is based on the results of a single pile analysis as shown in fig 12 the maximum resistances of the unreinforced pile and anchored pile are p 0 and p n respectively for the horizontal load and t 0 and t n respectively for the uplift load the reinforcement coefficient is defined as the ratio of the maximum resistance of the unreinforced pile to that of the anchored pile as follows 6 c p p 2 o r p 4 p 0 7 c t t 2 o r t 4 t 0 where c p is the reinforcement coefficient for an anchored pile under a horizontal load and c t is the reinforcement coefficient for an anchored pile under an uplift load tables 7 and 8 show the results of estimating the reinforcement coefficient in terms of the number of anchors soil conditions and loading conditions in the case of 4 anchored piles subjected to the horizontal load the maximum resistance increases up to 41 in loose sand and 95 in dense sand due to the reinforcement effect additionally for 4 anchored piles under uplift load the maximum resistance increases up to 34 in loose sand and 53 in dense sand in addition it is shown that the reinforcement effect at greater depth is smaller than that at shallower depth 4 proposed transfer curve considering the reinforcement effect in this section load transfer curves that can be used to analyze the behavior of anchored piles were proposed by applying the proposed reinforcement coefficients we compared the proposed load transfer curves with the load transfer curves from the 3d finite element analysis the load transfer behaviors of anchored piles analyzed by both the 3d finite element method and the load transfer analysis using the proposed load transfer curves were described finally the applicability of the proposed load transfer curves to the analysis of the submerged breakwater was confirmed by the load transfer analysis by applying the proposed load transfer curves 4 1 proposed load transfer curve for anchored piles load transfer curves that consider the reinforcement effect by substituting the load transfer curves derived from the 3d finite element analysis into the hyperbolic function were proposed the characteristics of the hyperbolic function are represented by the initial slope and the maximum convergence value the reinforcement effect of the proposed load transfer curve was represented by the maximum convergence value that is the maximum resistance it was shown that there is no remarkable difference in the initial slopes which is probably because the effect of the anchor is not large at small displacements based on this as shown in equations 8 and 9 the load transfer functions considering the reinforcement effect were proposed by multiplying the limiting resistances p u and t max by the reinforcement coefficients c p and c t respectively as follows 8 p y t 1 k y t c p p u 9 t z t 1 k z t c t t m a x where c p is the horizontal reinforcement coefficient y t is the relative horizontal displacement between the pile and soil k is the initial slope p u is the ultimate horizontal resistance c t is the uplift reinforcement coefficient y t is the relative uplift displacement between the pile and soil and t max is the ultimate shaft friction resistance the reinforcement coefficients act as a fitting parameter that changes the load transfer curve if the reinforcement coefficient is larger than 1 0 the ultimate resistance of the load transfer curve increases and the hyperbola moves upward which means upward movement of the load transfer curve due to the reinforcement effect 4 2 analysis of the proposed load transfer curve the proposed load transfer curves applying the reinforcement coefficients were compared with the load transfer curves estimated by 3d finite element analysis fig 13 shows the p y curves and t z curves at 1 m depth and the proposed curves and the results of the 3d finite element analysis are in good agreement with each other in terms of the maximum resistance and initial gradient the horizontal and uplift displacements of a single pile head from the analysis by applying the proposed load transfer functions were compared with those from the 3d finite element analysis the comparison described in fig 14 shows that the pile head displacements have similar behavior when the load is closer to the ultimate load 4 3 application of the proposed load transfer curve a load transfer analysis of anchored piles with the modeling of the submerged breakwater shown in fig 15 was conducted as a field application simulation table 3 shows the soil properties and pile specifications the dense sand in table 3 was adopted to maximize the reinforcement effect as the soil condition for analysis the analysis was performed under the load condition in which the horizontal load acts on the bottom of the structure head of the pile by applying the breaking force formula as follows hiroi 1920 10 f 1 5 w 0 h h where f is the total wave force w 0 is the width of the structure h is the height of the structure and h is the height of the wave the shear force bending moment horizontal displacement and soil reaction of the pile with 4 anchors anchored pile and no anchor unreinforced pile are shown in fig 16 the horizontal displacement of the head of the pile with 4 anchors is smaller than that of the unreinforced pile the shear force and bending moment of the unreinforced pile are smaller than those of the pile with 4 anchors and they are prominent at the heads of the piles these results indicate that stress concentrates in the upper part of the pile with anchors and is grossly affected by the upper anchors the soil reactions of the unreinforced pile are higher than those of the pile with 4 anchors while the soil reactions are also concentrated in the upper part of the pile based on these results it is indicated that the reinforcement effect accelerates the transmission of the load acting on the pile head to the soil 5 summary and conclusions in this study to analyze the reinforcement effect of anchored piles on a submerged breakwater the load transfer curves for horizontal and uplift loads are analyzed a framework for determining the seabed soil spring constants p y curve and t z curve is proposed from an analytical method and numerical analysis based on the results a new hyperbolic load transfer curve is proposed to design anchored piles by considering the reinforcement effect which considers the reinforcement coefficients of the horizontal and uplift loads obtained from the load transfer curves the reinforcement effect of the proposed load transfer curve was represented by the maximum convergence value that is the maximum resistance it was shown that there is no remarkable difference in the initial slopes in addition the proposal of the load transfer curve for the submerged breakwater is based on the results of the analysis of a single pile finally the proposed load transfer curves were compared against the results from the full modeling analysis and show good agreement the proposed curves are more appropriate and realistic for the reinforcement effect of anchored piles than existing methods the following conclusions were drawn from the parametric study 1 both the horizontal and the uplift displacements of anchored piles are smaller than those of unreinforced piles and the reinforcement effects of 4 anchored piles are surely larger than those of 2 anchored piles in addition the reinforcement effects in dense sand are larger than those in loose sand indicating that the anchors embedded in dense sand could generate more resistance to the surrounding soil due to the stiffer soil for anchored piles subjected to the horizontal load the reinforcement effects are from 3 to 14 compared with those for the unreinforced piles and increase with increasing allowable horizontal displacement for anchored piles subjected to the uplift load the reinforcement effects of the anchored pile vary from 5 to 17 at the ultimate uplift displacement and they are larger than those for anchored piles subjected to the horizontal load 2 in the case of 4 anchored piles subjected to the horizontal load the maximum resistance increases up to 41 in loose sand and 95 in dense sand due to the reinforcement effect additionally for 4 anchored piles under the uplift load the maximum resistance increases up to 34 in loose sand and 53 in dense sand the reinforcement effect at greater depth is smaller than that at shallower depth 3 the horizontal displacement of the head of the pile with 4 anchors is smaller than that of the unreinforced pile the shear force and bending moment of the unreinforced pile are smaller than those of the pile with 4 anchors and they are prominent at the heads of the piles these results indicate that stress concentrates in the upper part of the pile with anchors and is grossly affected by the upper anchors the soil reactions of the unreinforced pile are higher than those of the pile with 4 anchors while the soil reactions are also concentrated in the upper part of the pile based on these results it is indicated that the reinforcement effect accelerates the transmission of the load acting on the pile head to the soil 4 based on the failure mechanism the displacement transfers under the working load level which is related to the soil reaction occurring in the soil due to uplift force was limited in the upper soil therefore the anchor in the upper part of the pile can mobilize greater uplift resistance compared to other parts of the pile in case of horizontal loading condition it was clear that the reinforcement effect of the anchor in the upper part of the pile under horizontal loading was greater author contribution statement sanseom jeong conceptualization supervision writing review editing moonhyun hong writing review editing software formal analysis investigation dohyun kim

against the results from the full modeling analysis and show good agreement through comparisons with case studies it is found that the effects of the shear force bending moment and displacement are more significant for anchored piles than for unreinforced piles thus the proposed curves appropriately represent the reinforcement effect of anchored piles in offshore structures keywords submerged breakwater anchored pile load transfer curves reinforcement coefficient reinforcement effect numerical analysis 1 introduction recently coastal erosion has increased globally due to the sea level rise caused by climate change according to the rcp representative concentration pathways 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios ipcc 2013 sea level rises of 0 26 0 55 m and 0 45 0 82 m respectively are expected to occur around the world in the late 21st century 2081 2100 coastal erosion is expected to accelerate due to the sea level rise and various structures have been installed in coastal areas to prevent coastal erosion the prevention measures for coastal erosion can be divided into 1 soft defense techniques and 2 hard defense techniques prasetya 2006 hsu et al 2008 yang et al 2010 soft defense techniques are methods that indirectly prevent coastal erosion they are easy to install and dismantle and are economical and environmentally friendly methods however the effect of preventing coastal erosion using a soft defense technique is weaker than that using a hard defense technique because it cannot directly prevent coastal erosion soft defense techniques typically include geotubes sand nets planting methods floating breakwaters and beach nourishment hard defense techniques are the methods of installing coastal structures to prevent coastal erosion they can maximize the effect of preventing coastal erosion because coastal structures can directly block waves and currents which are the cause of coastal erosion however coastal structures may cause environmental damage due to secondary erosion and deposition after installation because they are difficult to install and dismantle hard defense techniques generally include groins offshore breakwaters and submerged breakwaters in particular submerged breakwaters have advantages such as 1 preserving coastal scenery 2 securing view rights and 3 minimizing changes in the coastal environment therefore submerged breakwaters have recently been applied in the east sea where coastal erosion is serious in south korea the submerged breakwater is chosen as a representative offshore structure in this study this structure is a low breakwater that is typically installed in a direction parallel to the coast as shown in fig 1 a submerged breakwaters can prevent coastal erosion by decreasing the wave transmission and wave steepness however the horizontal and uplift loads acting on the submerged breakwater are expected to increase because of the increase in the wave power due to sea level rise various techniques have been used to increase the resistance of pile foundations these include geosynthetic reinforcement and installation of helical piles bian et al 2008 prasad and rao 1996 in addition the anchored pile was recently developed in south korea to increase the resistance of pile foundations for offshore structures here the anchored piles supporting the submerged breakwater have the anchors in the upper pile to resist the horizontal and uplift loads as shown in fig 1 a anchored piles are designed to fold the anchors during pile installation so that they do not interrupt the pile penetration additionally the anchors are unfolded after pile installation to increase the resistance of the piles subjected to horizontal and uplift loads sim et al 2011 the anchors are horizontally unfolded to increase the uplift horizontal and vertical resistances in the case of installation the pile penetration can be performed quickly and easily by using a high pressure water pump fig 1 b illustrates the schematic illustration of anchored piles however the reinforcement effect in terms of the number of anchors soil conditions and loading conditions is poorly understood because the magnitude of the reinforcement owing to the anchored piles has not yet been quantified the overall objective of this study is to understand the behavior of anchored piles subjected to horizontal and uplift loads and quantify the reinforcement effect of anchored piles in terms of the number of anchors soil conditions and loading conditions three dimensional finite element analyses are carried out using the plaxis 3d commercial program brinkgreve et al 2007 based on the numerical results the load transfer curves p y curve and t z curve are analyzed by increasing the horizontal and uplift resistances and the reinforcement effect of anchored piles is quantified thus the load transfer curves considering the reinforcement effect are proposed in addition the behavior of the typical submerged breakwater is analyzed using the proposed load transfer curve and the applicability of anchored piles is examined 2 load transfer method various works have been performed by many researchers to study the behavior of piles many empirical and numerical methods have been proposed for analyzing the load deformation behavior of piles subjected to horizontal or uplift loads they can typically be classified into three groups 1 empirical methods brinch hansen 1961 broms 1964 2 load transfer curve methods matlock 1970 reese and wright 1977 o neill and gazioughlu 1984 jeong et al 2004 kim et al 2011 and 3 finite element methods brown and shie 1991 jeremic and yang 2002 kim et al 2013 reported that load transfer curve methods and finite element methods are suitable for analyzing pile behavior because they can consider the nonlinearity and continuity of soils additionally jeong and seo 2004 described that load transfer curve methods are intermediate methods between empirical methods and finite element methods therefore the reinforcement effect by anchored piles was analyzed based on the load transfer curve method in this study in load transfer methods the soil resistance is idealized as the elasto plastic spring and the stress strain behavior of each spring is defined by the load transfer curves coyle and reese 1966 as shown in fig 2 the horizontal shear and end bearing load transfer curve methods are typically referred to as the p y curve t z curve and q w curve respectively several different methods such as bilinear hyperbolic and exponential functions have been used to express the load transfer curves and many researchers have studied the load transfer curves for pile soil interaction using a hyperbolic function in particular liang et al 2007 kim et al 2011 to characterize the stress strain behavior of the soil nonlinear properties of the soil resistance can be expressed as a hyperbolic function as follows kondner 1963 1 f w t 1 k w t f m a x where f is the soil resistance w t is the relative displacement between the pile and soil k is the initial tangent slope of the hyperbolic function and f max is the ultimate soil resistance in this study the typical shapes of p y curves and t z curves for anchored piles are represented by hyperbolic functions in this study the horizontal and uplift loads are assumed to act in the x and z directions respectively based on the results from three dimensional finite element analysis the p y curve and t z curve can be obtained for the t z curves the shear resistance t is obtained from integrating the friction resistance between the pile element and soil element and the relative displacement z is the vertical difference between the vertical coordinates z direction of the pile element and soil element for the p y curves the soil resistance p is calculated by integrating the stresses in the soil element around the perimeter of the pile fan and long 2005 kim et al 2011 here the stresses in the soil elements at the gauss points closest to the pile are defined as the soil resistance p between the pile and soil the x component stress in a soil element at each arbitrary depth can be represented by the traction vector t x as follows 2 t x σ x x n x σ x y n y σ x z n z where t x is the traction vector σ xx σ xy and σ xz are the effective stresses in the xx xy and xz directions respectively and n x n y and n z are the components of the unit normal vectors along the x y and z directions respectively at the gauss point based on the traction vector t x obtained from equation 2 the total soil resistance per unit length p x along the pile can be estimated by integrating the stresses in the x direction acting on the soil element around the pile as follows 3 p x t x d l where p x is the total soil resistance per unit length along the pile and l is the perimeter of the closest gauss points in the soil elements around the pile the p y curves at a given depth can be finally determined by the relation between the soil resistance p obtained from the abovementioned method and the corresponding horizontal displacement y of the pile as described above the load transfer curves are defined by the stress strain behavior of the soil considering the soil pile interactions the anchored piles increase the load transfer curve due to the reinforcement effect of the anchors therefore the resistance of anchored piles is larger than that of original piles fig 3 shows the concepts of the reinforcement effect of the load transfer curve by anchored piles 3 three dimensional finite element analysis 3 1 fe modeling parametric studies were carried out using the three dimensional finite element method to analyze the behavior of anchored piles in terms of soil conditions loading conditions and the number of anchors the plaxis 3d commercial program brinkgreve et al 2007 was used for the numerical analyses table 1 shows the parameters and analysis cases for the parametric studies the displacements occur within the depths of 5d where d is the pile diameter below the ground surface in particular the maximum bending moment of piles under horizontal loads generally occurs at the upper part of piles kim et al 2014b in addition there is a depth close to the ground surface where the shear force in the pile is zero this depth of zero shear was obtained for the test piles at 7d the pile diameter according to briaud s results briaud 1997 based on this the behavior of piles in the deep layer 7d are of little importance because the deflection of a horizontally loaded pile is considerably small or almost zero at great depth below the ground surface in addition in order to select the optimized location of the anchor pre analysis was performed with varying the locations of anchors in piles based on the pre analysis it was found that the uplift resistance of anchored piles with anchors in the upper part was larger thus the application of the anchored piles with anchors in the upper part can be more reasonable in regards of structural serviceability for these reasons the anchors are assumed to be located at the upper part of the pile to maximize the increases in the horizontal and uplift resistances the behavior of the soil was characterized by the elasto perfectly plastic material according to the mohr coulomb model the soil conditions for the analysis were assumed to be a homogeneous sandy soil layer loose sand dense sand in the coastal area based on previous studies bowels 1996 ulker 2012 verhaeghe et al 2013 das 2015 kim et al 2014a the typical properties of the sandy soil in the coastal area are summarized in table 2 fig 4 illustrates the geometries of the anchored piles and typical modeling for the parametric studies an anchored pile with a diameter of 500 mm and a length of 10 m was considered in the parametric study in addition the length and diameter of the anchor were 1 m and 500 mm respectively both the anchored piles and the anchors were modeled by a linear elastic model the behavior of the interface was applied using the contact element in the plaxis 3d program the interface element was characterized by the bilinear mohr coulomb model to simulate the behaviors of the soil pile interfaces such as the slip behavior and gap behavior generally the deformation in the interface element can be divided into 1 elastic behavior at small displacements and 2 plastic behavior in slip behavior the deformation behaves like an element that has the properties of the nearby soil elements before slip occurs after slip occurred the interface element was characterized by a decreased shear modulus the decrease in strength for the interface element was referred to as a strength reduction factor r inter in plaxis 3d the interface properties can be determined by the strength reduction factor r inter as follows 4 c inter r inter c soil 5 tanφ inter r inter tanφ soil where c inter is the cohesion of the interface c soil is the cohesion of the soil φ inter is the friction angle of the interface and φ soil is the friction angle of the soil an r inter of 1 0 means that the interface element has the same material as the adjacent soil element whereas an r inter of 0 0 means that it behaves as a frictionless interface the strength reduction factor r inter of 0 7 was chosen in this analysis following the plaxis 3d manual the overall dimensions of the model comprise the domains in the x and y directions of 20d from the pile center and a height z direction of 3l p where l p is the pile length to minimize the possible boundary effect on the numerical results zero horizontal displacements were predefined at the four side boundaries and full fixities were set at the bottom boundary the input parameters for parametric studies are summarized in table 3 3 2 validation validation of the numerical model used in this study was based on the uplift test on a steel pipe pile conducted by reese and cox 1976 the numerical modeling was carried out to simulate the uplift test and analyze the behavior of a pile under uplift loading the test site is located in corpus christi bay near port aransas texas a borehole standard penetration test was conducted in the test site and properties of each soil layers from the spt n value and the soil type are presented in table 4 typical properties of clayey and sands presented by bowles 1996 were used to determine the properties for numerical modeling there were 5 soil layers in the test site and the steel pipe pile was penetrated into the dense silty sand layer the diameter of the steel pipe pile was 0 6 m with the length of 21 m and has a pile thickness of 0 01 m the uplift test condition is described in fig 5 based on the soil layer profile and the pile specifications the result of the numerical analysis was compared with a load displacement curve from the uplift test in the site reese and cox 1976 and the comparison of the load displacement curve is described in fig 6 there was a difference of displacement at small loads but similar results after yielding based on the results of the validation it is concluded that the general trend observed by the field load test is similar to the prediction made by fe analysis therefore the numerical model employed in this study is reasonable enough to conduct a parametric study 3 3 results and discussion 3 3 1 failure mechanism to investigate the effect of the anchors on the behavior of pile and soil series of numerical analysis was carried out fig 7 shows the displacement contours for horizontal and uplift loads for uplift loading condition the applied load was 600 kn as the number of anchors increases the displacement due to uplift resistance of the pile has decreased displacements of pile head were 29 73 mm 17 13 mm and 14 13 mm for 0 2 and 4 anchors respectively the decrease in pile displacement was observed not only on the pile head but also along the full length of the pile for the unreinforced pile the displacement of the lower 1 5d part of the pile was within 50 of the pile head displacement where the rest showed similar displacement with the pile head the anchored pile with 2 anchors showed less displacement where the displacement of the pile head to the lower 1 5d showed about 15 of unreinforced pile head displacement and the mid part up to 6d showed 50 of unreinforced pile head displacement the rest of the pile displacement was within 60 70 of the unreinforced pile head displacement the anchored pile with 4 anchors showed overall about 30 40 of the unreinforced pile head displacement for horizontal loading condition the applied load was 300 kn a similar tendency was observed under the horizontal loading condition as the number of anchors increases the horizontal displacement due to horizontal resistance of the pile has decreased displacements of pile head were 53 21 mm 32 14 mm and 31 31 mm for 0 2 and 4 anchors respectively notable decrease in horizontal displacement on the pile head was observed between the unreinforced and anchored piles in addition the influence region due to horizontal loading decreased as the number of anchors increases by setting the reference horizontal displacement to the allowable horizontal displacement 1 5 in 38 mm of the unreinforced pile head displacement the influence region due to horizontal loading for unreinforced 2 anchors and 4 anchors pile was approximately 3 5d vertical 1 7d horizontal 2 6d 1 2d and 2 4d 1 1d respectively as a result in case of the uplift loading condition the displacement transfers under the working load level which is related to the soil reaction occurring in the soil due to uplift force was limited in the upper soil therefore the anchor in the upper part of the pile can mobilize greater uplift resistance compared to other parts of the pile in case of the horizontal loading condition it was clear that the reinforcement effect of the anchor in the upper part of the pile under horizontal loading was greater 3 3 2 reinforcement effect based on the results of three dimensional finite element analyses the reinforcement effects in terms of various conditions were directly investigated through the load displacement curves fig 8 shows the horizontal load displacement curves of loose sand and dense sand in south korea the allowable horizontal displacement of the pile is specified to be at least 15 mm in the design korea rail network authority 2004 korean geotechnical society 2009 in the case of the united states and japan the allowable horizontal displacement is generally specified as 1 5 in 38 mm for the loose sand the horizontal loads in the cases of 2 anchors and 4 anchors are larger than that of no anchor by approximately 3 and 8 respectively at a horizontal displacement of 15 mm in addition the horizontal loads for 2 anchors and 4 anchors are larger than that for no anchor by 6 and 10 respectively at a horizontal displacement of 38 mm additionally for the dense sand the horizontal loads in the cases of 2 anchors and 4 anchors are larger than that of no anchor by approximately 6 and 11 respectively in the cases of 2 anchors and 4 anchors since the horizontal displacement obtained from the numerical analyses did not occur up to 38 mm the horizontal load at 38 mm was assumed as the horizontal load at the last loading step as a result the horizontal loads for both 2 and 4 anchors are larger than that for no anchor by 14 the horizontal loads at the allowable horizontal displacements of 15 mm and 38 mm are summarized in table 5 fig 9 illustrates the uplift load displacement curves for loose sand and dense sand as shown in fig 9 the reinforcement effect of the anchored pile starts to appear after 5 mm for the loose sand case and 2 mm for the dense sand case gaaver 2013 conducted experimental model tests to investigate the behavior of a single pile and pile groups subjected to uplift loads he stated that the uplift displacements corresponding to the ultimate uplift loads are generally approximately 1 4 2 5 times the pile diameter d therefore in this study it was assumed that the uplift displacement corresponding to the ultimate uplift loads is 10 mm which is 2 of the pile diameter d in cases of loose sand the uplift loads for 2 anchors and 4 anchors are larger than that for no anchor by approximately 5 and 7 respectively at the ultimate uplift displacement of 10 mm additionally for the dense sand the uplift loads for 2 anchors and 4 anchors have increments of 13 and 17 respectively caused by the reinforcement effect due to the anchors the uplift loads at the ultimate uplift displacements of 10 mm are summarized in table 6 both the horizontal and the uplift displacements of anchored piles are smaller than those of unreinforced piles and the reinforcement effects of 4 anchored piles are surely larger than those of 2 anchored piles in addition the reinforcement effects of dense sand are larger than those of loose sand indicating that the anchors embedded in the dense sand could generate more resistance to the surrounding soil due to the stiffer soil for anchored piles subjected to the horizontal load the reinforcement effects are from 3 to 14 compared with those for the unreinforced piles and increase with increasing allowable horizontal displacement for anchored piles subjected to the uplift load the reinforcement effects of the anchored pile vary from 5 to 17 which are larger than those of the anchored pile subjected to the horizontal load 3 3 3 quantification of the reinforcement effect by analyzing the load transfer curve to quantify the reinforcement effect of anchored piles the load transfer curves for horizontal and uplift loads were analyzed figs 10 and 11 show the results of calculating the load transfer curves p y and t z curves according to the depth the number of anchors and the soil conditions fig 10 a illustrates the p y curves for loose sand and the ultimate horizontal soil resistances for 2 anchors and 4 anchors are larger than that for no anchor by approximately 8 24 and 10 35 respectively in addition fig 10 b shows the p y curves for dense sand it shows that the ultimate horizontal soil resistances for 2 anchors and 4 anchors are increased up to 20 68 and 25 95 respectively fig 11 a shows the t z curves for loose sand under uplift loading and it indicates that the ultimate shear resistances under uplift loading for 2 anchors and 4 anchors are larger than that for no anchor by approximately 19 25 and 26 40 respectively fig 11 b illustrates the t z curves for dense sand and shows that the ultimate shear resistances under uplift loading for 2 anchors and 4 anchors are increased up to 4 26 and 7 38 respectively these results directly indicate the reinforcement effect of anchored piles and are used to quantify the reinforcement effect the reinforcement effect of anchored piles decreases with increasing soil depth and there is little reinforcement effect at depths below 2 m for horizontal loads and below 3 m for uplift loads in this study this tendency is clear because the upper pile was reinforced to maximize the reinforcement effect on the horizontal and uplift loads therefore the load transfer curve increases due to the reinforcement effect of anchored piles fig 12 is a conceptual diagram showing that the increase in the load transfer curve due to the reinforcement effect appears as an increase in the maximum resistance a framework for determining the seabed soil spring constants p y curve and t z curve is proposed from an analytical method and numerical analysis based on the results a new hyperbolic load transfer curve is proposed to design anchored piles by considering the reinforcement effect which considers the reinforcement coefficients of the horizontal and uplift loads obtained from the load transfer curves the reinforcement effect of the proposed load transfer curve was represented by the maximum convergence value that is the maximum resistance it was shown that there is no remarkable difference in the initial slopes which is probably because the effect of the anchor is not large at small displacements generally the group effect in pile groups appears when the pile spacing is in the range of 3d 6d where d is the pile diameter brown et al 1987 1988 rollins et al 2006a rollins et al 2006b in particular jeong et al 2004 proposed that the group effect is negligible when the pile spacing is larger than 7d based on a study on stabilizing piles in slopes where lateral movement is dominant thus in the case of a submerged breakwater which typically has a pile spacing of 10d or more it is reasonable to assume that the group effect does not affect the structural behavior for this reason the proposal of the load transfer curve for submerged breakwaters is based on the results of a single pile analysis as shown in fig 12 the maximum resistances of the unreinforced pile and anchored pile are p 0 and p n respectively for the horizontal load and t 0 and t n respectively for the uplift load the reinforcement coefficient is defined as the ratio of the maximum resistance of the unreinforced pile to that of the anchored pile as follows 6 c p p 2 o r p 4 p 0 7 c t t 2 o r t 4 t 0 where c p is the reinforcement coefficient for an anchored pile under a horizontal load and c t is the reinforcement coefficient for an anchored pile under an uplift load tables 7 and 8 show the results of estimating the reinforcement coefficient in terms of the number of anchors soil conditions and loading conditions in the case of 4 anchored piles subjected to the horizontal load the maximum resistance increases up to 41 in loose sand and 95 in dense sand due to the reinforcement effect additionally for 4 anchored piles under uplift load the maximum resistance increases up to 34 in loose sand and 53 in dense sand in addition it is shown that the reinforcement effect at greater depth is smaller than that at shallower depth 4 proposed transfer curve considering the reinforcement effect in this section load transfer curves that can be used to analyze the behavior of anchored piles were proposed by applying the proposed reinforcement coefficients we compared the proposed load transfer curves with the load transfer curves from the 3d finite element analysis the load transfer behaviors of anchored piles analyzed by both the 3d finite element method and the load transfer analysis using the proposed load transfer curves were described finally the applicability of the proposed load transfer curves to the analysis of the submerged breakwater was confirmed by the load transfer analysis by applying the proposed load transfer curves 4 1 proposed load transfer curve for anchored piles load transfer curves that consider the reinforcement effect by substituting the load transfer curves derived from the 3d finite element analysis into the hyperbolic function were proposed the characteristics of the hyperbolic function are represented by the initial slope and the maximum convergence value the reinforcement effect of the proposed load transfer curve was represented by the maximum convergence value that is the maximum resistance it was shown that there is no remarkable difference in the initial slopes which is probably because the effect of the anchor is not large at small displacements based on this as shown in equations 8 and 9 the load transfer functions considering the reinforcement effect were proposed by multiplying the limiting resistances p u and t max by the reinforcement coefficients c p and c t respectively as follows 8 p y t 1 k y t c p p u 9 t z t 1 k z t c t t m a x where c p is the horizontal reinforcement coefficient y t is the relative horizontal displacement between the pile and soil k is the initial slope p u is the ultimate horizontal resistance c t is the uplift reinforcement coefficient y t is the relative uplift displacement between the pile and soil and t max is the ultimate shaft friction resistance the reinforcement coefficients act as a fitting parameter that changes the load transfer curve if the reinforcement coefficient is larger than 1 0 the ultimate resistance of the load transfer curve increases and the hyperbola moves upward which means upward movement of the load transfer curve due to the reinforcement effect 4 2 analysis of the proposed load transfer curve the proposed load transfer curves applying the reinforcement coefficients were compared with the load transfer curves estimated by 3d finite element analysis fig 13 shows the p y curves and t z curves at 1 m depth and the proposed curves and the results of the 3d finite element analysis are in good agreement with each other in terms of the maximum resistance and initial gradient the horizontal and uplift displacements of a single pile head from the analysis by applying the proposed load transfer functions were compared with those from the 3d finite element analysis the comparison described in fig 14 shows that the pile head displacements have similar behavior when the load is closer to the ultimate load 4 3 application of the proposed load transfer curve a load transfer analysis of anchored piles with the modeling of the submerged breakwater shown in fig 15 was conducted as a field application simulation table 3 shows the soil properties and pile specifications the dense sand in table 3 was adopted to maximize the reinforcement effect as the soil condition for analysis the analysis was performed under the load condition in which the horizontal load acts on the bottom of the structure head of the pile by applying the breaking force formula as follows hiroi 1920 10 f 1 5 w 0 h h where f is the total wave force w 0 is the width of the structure h is the height of the structure and h is the height of the wave the shear force bending moment horizontal displacement and soil reaction of the pile with 4 anchors anchored pile and no anchor unreinforced pile are shown in fig 16 the horizontal displacement of the head of the pile with 4 anchors is smaller than that of the unreinforced pile the shear force and bending moment of the unreinforced pile are smaller than those of the pile with 4 anchors and they are prominent at the heads of the piles these results indicate that stress concentrates in the upper part of the pile with anchors and is grossly affected by the upper anchors the soil reactions of the unreinforced pile are higher than those of the pile with 4 anchors while the soil reactions are also concentrated in the upper part of the pile based on these results it is indicated that the reinforcement effect accelerates the transmission of the load acting on the pile head to the soil 5 summary and conclusions in this study to analyze the reinforcement effect of anchored piles on a submerged breakwater the load transfer curves for horizontal and uplift loads are analyzed a framework for determining the seabed soil spring constants p y curve and t z curve is proposed from an analytical method and numerical analysis based on the results a new hyperbolic load transfer curve is proposed to design anchored piles by considering the reinforcement effect which considers the reinforcement coefficients of the horizontal and uplift loads obtained from the load transfer curves the reinforcement effect of the proposed load transfer curve was represented by the maximum convergence value that is the maximum resistance it was shown that there is no remarkable difference in the initial slopes in addition the proposal of the load transfer curve for the submerged breakwater is based on the results of the analysis of a single pile finally the proposed load transfer curves were compared against the results from the full modeling analysis and show good agreement the proposed curves are more appropriate and realistic for the reinforcement effect of anchored piles than existing methods the following conclusions were drawn from the parametric study 1 both the horizontal and the uplift displacements of anchored piles are smaller than those of unreinforced piles and the reinforcement effects of 4 anchored piles are surely larger than those of 2 anchored piles in addition the reinforcement effects in dense sand are larger than those in loose sand indicating that the anchors embedded in dense sand could generate more resistance to the surrounding soil due to the stiffer soil for anchored piles subjected to the horizontal load the reinforcement effects are from 3 to 14 compared with those for the unreinforced piles and increase with increasing allowable horizontal displacement for anchored piles subjected to the uplift load the reinforcement effects of the anchored pile vary from 5 to 17 at the ultimate uplift displacement and they are larger than those for anchored piles subjected to the horizontal load 2 in the case of 4 anchored piles subjected to the horizontal load the maximum resistance increases up to 41 in loose sand and 95 in dense sand due to the reinforcement effect additionally for 4 anchored piles under the uplift load the maximum resistance increases up to 34 in loose sand and 53 in dense sand the reinforcement effect at greater depth is smaller than that at shallower depth 3 the horizontal displacement of the head of the pile with 4 anchors is smaller than that of the unreinforced pile the shear force and bending moment of the unreinforced pile are smaller than those of the pile with 4 anchors and they are prominent at the heads of the piles these results indicate that stress concentrates in the upper part of the pile with anchors and is grossly affected by the upper anchors the soil reactions of the unreinforced pile are higher than those of the pile with 4 anchors while the soil reactions are also concentrated in the upper part of the pile based on these results it is indicated that the reinforcement effect accelerates the transmission of the load acting on the pile head to the soil 4 based on the failure mechanism the displacement transfers under the working load level which is related to the soil reaction occurring in the soil due to uplift force was limited in the upper soil therefore the anchor in the upper part of the pile can mobilize greater uplift resistance compared to other parts of the pile in case of horizontal loading condition it was clear that the reinforcement effect of the anchor in the upper part of the pile under horizontal loading was greater author contribution statement sanseom jeong conceptualization supervision writing review editing moonhyun hong writing review editing software formal analysis investigation dohyun kim

meshless numerical technique based on the interpolating element free galerkin iefg method is proposed in abbaszadeh et al 2020 for solving the groundwater equation gwe a combination of proper orthogonal decomposition discrete empirical interpolation method pod deim and meshless local rbf dq approach for prevention of groundwater contamination is presented in dehghan and abbaszadeh 2018b 1 4 a brief review for rbf dq approach in the current paper we develop an improvement of the local rbf dq approach the rbf dq procedure is a meshless method that it is presented for the first time by shu et al shu et al 2003 shu 2012 to solve some models in the fluid dynamics the proposed method combines the advantages of the conventional dq method and the rbfs the local rbfs dq is developed in shu et al 2003 to solve two dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations as the proposed method is validated by its application to the simulation of natural convection in a square cavity the local rbf dq has been explained in details for solving partial differential equations in shu et al 2004 the system of second order boundary value problems has been solved in dehghan and nikpour 2013a by using the local rbf dq collocation method also the local rbf dq technique has been employed to simulate the coupled klein gordon zakharov equations in dehghan and nikpour 2013b the moving least squares differential quadrature mlsdq method based on rbfs is employed tornabene et al 2016 for solving doubly curved shells made of composite materials the local rbf dq procedure has been used in kutanaei et al 2012 to get a numerical approximation for solving stokes flow problem in a circular cavity as an irregular geometry furthermore the natural convection in concentric annuli has been simulated in wu and shu 2002 by the local rbf dq technique an upwind local rbf dq scheme is developed in shu et al 2005a for simulation of inviscid compressible flows with shock wave such that the upwind method is employed to evaluate the flux at the mid point between the reference knot and its supporting knots a new upwind technique for local radial basis function differential quadrature lrbf dq method is developed in chan et al 2014 to solve the convection dominated flow problems 1 5 the main aim of this paper the differential quadrature method was first introduced by richard bellman et al bellman et al 1972 the polynomial functions have been selected as the test function shu 2012 for the first time authors of shu et al 2003 proposed the meshless rbf dq method by using the rbfs recently the meshless numerical techniques have been noticed to simulate various physical models because these are related to arbitrary scatters points as a set of collocation nodes in the computational domain the applications of meshless techniques are introduced developed and improved as essential numerical procedures based on no mesh generation the implementation of these methods is simple and there is not any special complexity except in one case we must consider enough distributed nodes in the computational region to get the accurate and robust numerical approximations but by increasing the number of collocation points the size of the final coefficient matrix and its condition number will be increased that this issue makes the results be inaccurate on other hand increasing the number of collocation points yields a large full linear system of equations the strong form of the meshless techniques is based on two cases the global collocation method and the local method the global collocation meshless method is suitable for solving the pdes with smooth solution whereas it is not suitable to simulate the pdes with non smooth solution specially for solving the advection problem with non smooth initial conditions in the current paper to increase the accuracy of the local rbf dq method we apply the upwind idea furthermore the local upwind rbf dq method is combined with the space splitting technique in other words the main model will split into a set of sub equations where each sub equation can be solved separately with the upwing local rbf dq procedure moreover not only the use of operator splitting can increase the number of collocation points but also it may reduce memory requirements solving some one dimensional problems instead of a two dimensional problem is an important advantage of the mentioned combination 1 6 the organization of the current paper in this paper we apply the new numerical technique for solving the introduced models the outline of this paper is as follows in section 2 we explain the local rbf dq technique in section 3 we express the space splitting method an exponential time differencing etd scheme has been employed to solve the final system of odes in section 5 we investigate the discrete conservation of integral invariants in section 6 we employ several test problems such as buckley leverett groundwater model and shallow water equations for showing the ability of the new technique in the current investigation finally a conclusion is given in section 7 2 local rbf dq technique at first we describe some basic information for the radial basis functions definition 2 1 fasshauer 2007 wendland 2005 a real valued continuous function φ r d c is positive definite if for all sets x x 1 x n r d of distinct points and all vectors λ r d 10 λ t φ λ i 1 n j 1 n λ i λ j φ x i x j 0 also the function φ is called strictly positive definite on r d if the quadratic form 10 is zero only for λ 0 we interpolate a continuous function f r d r on a set x x 1 x n with choosing the radial basis function for φ r d r that is radial in the sense that φ x ψ x where is the usual euclidean norm on r d as we will explain it in the next section now we assume φ to be strictly positive definite then the interpolation function has the following form fasshauer 2007 wendland 2005 11 i f x i 1 n λ i φ x x i the basic problem is to find n unknown coefficients λ i in which n interpolation conditions are to the following form fasshauer 2007 wendland 2005 12 i f x i f i i 1 n it has been proved that the interpolation matrix based on strictly positive definite functions is nonsingular fasshauer 2007 wendland 2005 in the following we mention some strictly positive functions 1 gaussian 13 φ r exp c r 2 2 linear generalized imq 14 φ r 2 c r 2 1 c r 2 4 3 linear laguerre gaussian 15 φ r exp c r 2 2 c r 2 4 quadratic laguerre gaussian 16 φ r exp c r 2 3 3 c r 2 1 2 c r 4 in the current paper we employ the gaussian shape function that its interpolation matrix is non singular a combination of local rbfs technique and dq approach results the lrbfs dq numerical procedure in this technique the unknown function is approximated by the rbfs in which m th derivative of unknown function is estimated by the dq procedure we consider ω r 2 with scattered data x i y i ω in computational domain ω and its boundary e g ω let the influence domain of every reference point x i y i ω consists of n i nodes such as x 1 i y 1 i x 2 i y 2 i x n i i y n i i that is illustrated in fig 1 in the lrbfs dq technique we want to approximate the m th derivative at a center node by using a weighted linear summation of function values at all nodes in the influence domain of this center node according to the above explanations we have 17 m v x y x m x y x i y i j 0 n i ϖ i j m x v x j i y j i i 0 1 2 n in the lrbfs dq approach the rbfs have been used as the base functions so for i j 0 1 2 n i and i j we have 18 m φ j x y x m x y x i y i k 0 n i ϖ i k m x φ j x k i y k i 19 m φ j x y y m x y x i y i k 0 n i ϖ i k m y φ j x k i y k i where φ j is a rbf by collocating all nodes in the local domain of center point x i y i in eqs 18 and 19 the following matrix equations have been resulted 20 m φ 0 x i y i x m m φ 1 x i y i x m m φ n i x i y i x m m φ x i y i x m φ 0 x 0 i y 0 i φ 0 x 1 i y 1 i φ 0 x n i i y n i i φ 1 x 0 i

the proposed algorithm in sarra 2012 has been employed image 1 1 a is the interpolation matrix 2 σ m a x and σ m i n are biggest and smallest singular values of svd decomposition respectively 3 c i 1 n 4 κ min 1 e 2 and κ max 1 e 4 2 1 the upwind lrbfs dq approach shu and his co workers shu et al 2005b have developed a new version of lrbfs dq technique based on the upwind approach we consider a general model as follows 24 u t h u u x j u u y k at first we employ nodes between the center point and its support that are depicted in fig 2 also we call these points as the mid points applying the lrbfs dq technique to discrete the space variable arrives at 25 d u d t i k 0 n i ϖ i k x h u i k ϖ i k y j u i k n k i n where shu et al 2005b u i k denotes the conservative variables at the mid points ϖ i k x and ϖ i k y are weight coefficients based on the first order derivatives in the x and y directions respectively n i denotes the total number of supporting points for the reference point i from eq 25 we can derive a new flux according to the mid point and a unit vector α ϖ μ i k η i k thus we have 26 s i k μ i k h u i k η i k j u i k in which shu et al 2005b 27 μ i k ϖ i k x ϖ i k x 2 ϖ i k y 2 η i k ϖ i k y ϖ i k x 2 ϖ i k y 2 by assuming 28 θ i k ϖ i k x 2 ϖ i k y 2 eq 25 can be rewritten as follows 29 d u d t i k 0 n 1 θ i k s i k k i 3 space splitting idea the finite volume method has been combined in holden et al 2010 with the space splitting idea the interested readers can get more information for splitting idea in arraras and portero 2015 christlieb et al 2015 dehghan 2007 dehghan and taleei 2010 lee et al 2015 lee and lee 2015 seydaoglu et al 2016 seydaoglu and blanes 2014 taleei and dehghan 2014 the stiff matrices of meshless procedures are bad conditioned as the shape parameter and the distributed nodes have direct effect also by increasing the number of scattered data especially in the two dimensional cases the condition number of coefficient matrix will be increased on the other hand considering more distributed nodes is one of the advantages of the meshless methods in the space splitting method we want to solve a set of 1d problems instead of a 2d problem with large coefficient matrix because we can achieve a well posed coefficient matrix the combination of space splitting approach with the meshless techniques has the above advantages as is mentioned in holden et al 2010 in a more concrete setting and prior to trotter 1959 and kato 1974 douglas peaceman and rachford douglas and rachford 1956 peaceman and rachford 1955 introduced a method called the alternating direction implicit adi scheme where multi dimensional problems were successfully reduced to repeated one dimensional problems after that the adi method was applied to some important problems with real world application such as petroleum reservoir simulation in the late 1960s increased computer power made other methods viable for reservoir simulations starting in the late 1950s and early 60s there were extensive developments in the soviet union using what was coined splitting methods or the fractional steps method as a general method to study a large variety of problems in mathematical physics and several other applications key advances were made by yanenko samarskii marchuk and others it is impossible here to survey the results obtained rather we refer to yanenko s monograph yanenko 1971 and the comprehensive survey by marchuk 1990 another idea which can be related to these methods is the method of locally one dimensional lod which transfers the original problem to a sense of one dimensional problems via the dimension splitting procedure for a general survey of splitting methods we refer to hundsdorfer and verwer 2003 for matrix related methods we refer to moler and loan 2003 we can observe that one often finds the same method denoted by different names and the same name used for different methods to describe this method we consider the following 2d shallow water 30 u t u h x v h y 0 u h t u 2 h 0 5 g h 2 x u v h y 0 v h t v 2 h 0 5 g h 2 y u v h x 0 eq 30 is reformulated as 31 u t f 1 u x f 2 u y 0 in which 32 u h u h v h f 1 u u h u 2 h 0 5 g h 2 u v h f 2 u v h u v h v 2 h 0 5 g h 2 the space splitting operator is as follows holden et al 2010 33 d x t u t f 1 u x 0 u x y 0 u 0 d y t u t f 2 u y 0 v x y 0 v 0 as the use of splitting algorithm of the ordered subsets os yields 34 u x y t d y d t d x d t n u 0 x hence we have 35 d u d t i k 0 n i ϖ i k x f 1 u i k n and 36 d v d t i k 0 n i ϖ i k y f 2 u i k n thus we obtain a nonlinear system of odes that will be solved by a finite difference scheme 3 1 c property of the proposed numerical technique furthermore we can prove that the proposed method has the important c property let the shallow water equation be as follows 37 h x t t u h x t x g x z x t in which 38 h x t h x t u h x t 39 u z x t p x t p 2 x t h x t 1 2 g h 2 x t 40 f x z x t 0 g h x t b x x in the above formulations h x t is the total height above the bottom of the channel u x t is the fluid velocity b x is a given function a numerical scheme for eq 37 has the c property if the condition 41 h n b x c constant u n 0 holds for stationary flows at rest the treatment of source terms in the main model is reconstructed such that condition 41 is preserved at the discretized level according to conditions 41 eq 37 can be rewritten as follows 42 t h x t 0 x 0 1 2 g h 2 x t 0 g h x t b x x applying implicit euler difference method for 37 results 43 h n 1 h n τ d x u h n u h n 1 u h n τ d x u 2 h n τ g 2 d x h 2 n τ g h n b x in which d x is the first order derivative matrix now using condition 41 on system of equation 43 yields 44 h n 1 h n u h n 1 u h n τ g 2 d x h 2 n τ g h

b x d x thus we can approximate it as 46 b x d x b x also from condition 41 we obtain 47 d x h n d x b x plugging eq 47 in 45 concludes 48 τ g h n d x h n τ g 2 d x h 2 n τ g h n d x h n thus the proposed method satisfies the c property 4 an exponential time differencing etd scheme in the next we obtain the nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations 49 a d x d t b x t f x t which should be solved using an efficient algorithm we use the etd scheme asante asamani et al 2016 for solving eq 49 by considering the initial boundary value problem ivp 50 u t a u f t u i n ω t 0 t u 0 u

et al 2016 53 u t n 1 e a k u t n k 0 1 e a k 1 τ f t n τ k u t n τ k d τ the above result is crucial in etd schemes finally the etd scheme is asante asamani et al 2016 54 u n 1 i 1 3 a k 1 9 u n 2 k

three models of conservation laws equations the local rbfs dq method is an efficient method for solving conservation laws equations by the new combination at first we could consider more collocation nodes in the computational domain in comparison with the classical local rbfs dq method and second we only need to build the one dimensional derivative matrix thus in the proposed procedure we solved limited number of one dimensional problems instead of a large two dimensional problem to check the accuracy and efficiency of the developed technique we studied the buckley leverett equation and shallow water model the computational results confirm the capability of the new scheme proposed in the current investigation acknowledgment the authors are grateful to three reviewers for carefully

4 a brief review for rbf dq approach in the current paper we develop an improvement of the local rbf dq approach the rbf dq procedure is a meshless method that it is presented for the first time by shu et al shu et al 2003 shu 2012 to solve some models in the fluid dynamics the proposed method combines the advantages of the conventional dq method and the rbfs the local rbfs dq is developed in shu et al 2003 to solve two dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations as the proposed method is validated by its application to the simulation of natural convection in a square cavity the local rbf dq has been explained in details for solving partial differential equations in shu et al 2004 the system of second order boundary value problems has been solved in dehghan and nikpour 2013a by using the local rbf dq collocation method also the local rbf dq technique has been employed to simulate the coupled klein gordon zakharov equations in dehghan and nikpour 2013b the moving least squares differential quadrature mlsdq method based on rbfs is employed tornabene et al 2016 for solving doubly curved shells made of composite materials the local rbf dq procedure has been used in

upwind method is employed to evaluate the flux at the mid point between the reference knot and its supporting knots a new upwind technique for local radial basis function differential quadrature lrbf dq method is developed in chan et al 2014 to solve the convection dominated flow problems 1 5 the main aim of this paper the differential quadrature method was first introduced by richard bellman et al bellman et al 1972 the polynomial functions have been selected as the test function shu 2012 for the first time authors of shu et al 2003 proposed the meshless rbf dq method by using the rbfs recently the meshless numerical techniques have been noticed to simulate various physical models because these are related to arbitrary scatters points as a set of collocation nodes in the computational domain the applications of meshless techniques are introduced developed and improved as essential numerical procedures based on no mesh generation the implementation of these methods is simple and there is not any special complexity except in one case we must consider enough distributed nodes in the computational region to get the accurate and robust numerical approximations but by increasing the number of collocation points the size of the final coefficient matrix and its condition number will be increased that this issue makes the results be inaccurate on other hand increasing the number of collocation points yields a large full linear system of equations the strong form of the meshless techniques is based on two cases the global collocation method and the local method the global collocation meshless method is suitable for solving the pdes with smooth solution whereas it is not suitable to simulate the pdes with non smooth solution specially for solving the advection problem with non smooth initial conditions in the current paper to increase the accuracy of the local rbf dq method we apply the upwind idea furthermore the local upwind rbf dq method is combined with the space splitting technique in other words the main model will split into a set of sub equations where each sub equation can be solved separately with the upwing local rbf dq procedure moreover not only the use of operator splitting can increase the number of collocation points but also it may reduce memory requirements solving some one dimensional problems instead of a two dimensional problem is an important advantage of the mentioned combination 1 6 the organization of the current paper in this paper we apply the new numerical technique for solving the introduced models the outline of this paper is as follows in section 2 we explain the local rbf dq technique in section 3 we express the space splitting method an exponential time differencing etd scheme has been employed to solve the final system of odes in section 5 we investigate the discrete conservation of integral invariants in section 6 we employ several test problems such as buckley leverett groundwater model and shallow water equations for showing the ability of the new technique in the current investigation finally a conclusion is given in section 7 2 local rbf dq technique at first we describe some basic information for the radial basis functions definition 2 1 fasshauer 2007 wendland 2005 a real valued continuous function φ r d c is positive definite if for all sets x x 1 x n r d of distinct points and all vectors λ r d 10 λ t φ λ i 1 n j 1 n λ i λ j φ x i x j 0 also the function φ is called strictly positive definite on r d if the quadratic form 10 is zero only for λ 0 we interpolate a continuous function f r d r on a set x x 1 x n with choosing the radial basis function for φ r d r that is radial in the sense that φ x ψ x where is the usual euclidean norm on r d as we will explain it in the next section now we assume φ to be strictly positive definite then the interpolation function has the following form fasshauer 2007 wendland 2005 11 i f x i 1 n λ i φ x x i the basic problem is to find n unknown coefficients λ i in which n interpolation conditions are to the following form fasshauer 2007 wendland 2005 12 i f x i f i i 1 n it has been proved that the interpolation matrix based on strictly positive definite functions is nonsingular fasshauer 2007 wendland 2005 in the following we mention some strictly positive functions 1 gaussian 13 φ r exp c r 2 2 linear generalized

function that its interpolation matrix is non singular a combination of local rbfs technique and dq approach results the lrbfs dq numerical procedure in this technique the unknown function is approximated by the rbfs in which m th derivative of unknown function is estimated by the dq procedure we consider ω r 2 with scattered data x i y i ω in computational domain ω and its boundary e g ω let the influence domain of every reference point x i y i ω consists of n i nodes such as x 1 i y 1 i x 2 i y 2 i x n i i y n i i that is illustrated in fig 1 in the lrbfs dq technique we want to approximate the m th derivative at a center node by using a weighted linear summation of function values at all nodes in the influence domain of this center node according to the above explanations we have 17 m v x y x m x y x i y i j 0 n i ϖ i j m x v x j i y j i i 0 1 2 n in the lrbfs dq approach the rbfs have been used as the base functions so for i j 0 1 2 n i and i j we have 18 m φ j x y x m x

the proposed algorithm in sarra 2012 has been employed image 1 1 a is the interpolation matrix 2 σ m a x and σ m i n are biggest and smallest singular values of svd decomposition respectively 3 c i 1 n 4 κ min 1 e 2 and κ max 1 e 4 2 1 the upwind lrbfs dq approach shu and his co workers shu et al 2005b have developed a new version of lrbfs dq technique based on the upwind approach we consider a general model as follows 24 u t h u u x j u u y k at first we employ nodes between the center point and its support that are depicted in fig 2 also we call these points as the mid points applying the lrbfs dq technique to discrete the space variable arrives at 25 d u d t i k 0 n i ϖ i k x h u i k ϖ i k y j u i k n k i n where shu et al 2005b u i k denotes the conservative variables at the mid points ϖ i k x and ϖ i k y are weight coefficients based on the first order derivatives in the x and y directions respectively n i denotes the total number of supporting points for the reference point i from eq 25 we can derive a new flux according to the mid point and a unit vector α ϖ μ i k η i k thus we have 26 s i k μ i k h u i k η i k j u i k in which shu et al 2005b 27 μ i k ϖ i k x ϖ i k x 2 ϖ i k y 2 η i k ϖ i k y ϖ i k x 2 ϖ i k y 2 by assuming 28 θ i k ϖ i k x 2 ϖ i k y 2 eq 25 can be rewritten as follows 29 d u d t i k 0 n 1 θ i k s i k k i 3 space splitting idea the finite volume method has been combined in holden et al 2010 with the space splitting idea the interested readers can get more information for splitting idea in arraras and portero 2015 christlieb et al 2015 dehghan 2007 dehghan and taleei 2010 lee et al 2015 lee and lee 2015 seydaoglu et al 2016 seydaoglu and blanes 2014 taleei and dehghan 2014 the stiff matrices of meshless procedures are bad conditioned as the shape parameter and the distributed nodes have direct effect also by increasing the number of scattered data especially in the two dimensional cases the condition number of coefficient matrix will be increased on the other hand considering more distributed nodes is one of the advantages of the meshless methods in the space splitting method we want to solve a set of 1d problems instead of a 2d problem with large coefficient matrix because we can achieve a well posed coefficient matrix the combination of space splitting approach with the meshless techniques has the above advantages as is mentioned in holden et al 2010 in a more concrete setting and prior to trotter 1959 and kato 1974 douglas peaceman and rachford douglas and rachford 1956 peaceman and rachford 1955 introduced a method called the alternating direction implicit adi scheme where multi dimensional problems were successfully reduced to repeated one dimensional problems after that the adi method was applied to some important problems with real world application such as petroleum reservoir simulation in the late 1960s increased computer power made other methods viable for reservoir simulations starting in the late 1950s and early 60s there were extensive developments in the soviet union using what was coined splitting methods or the fractional steps method as a general method to study a large variety of problems in mathematical physics and several other applications key advances were made by yanenko samarskii marchuk and others it is impossible here to survey the results obtained rather we refer to yanenko s monograph yanenko 1971 and the comprehensive survey by marchuk 1990 another idea which can be related to these methods is the method of locally one dimensional lod which transfers the original problem to a sense of one dimensional problems via the dimension splitting procedure for a general survey of splitting methods we refer to hundsdorfer and verwer 2003 for matrix related methods we refer to moler and loan 2003 we can observe that one often finds the same method denoted by different names and the same name used for different methods to describe this method we consider the following 2d shallow water 30 u t u h x v h y 0 u h t u 2 h 0 5 g h 2 x u v h y 0 v h t v 2 h 0 5 g h 2 y u v h x 0 eq 30 is reformulated as 31 u t f 1 u x f 2 u y 0 in which 32 u h u h v h f 1 u

splitting algorithm of the ordered subsets os yields 34 u x y t d y d t d x d t n u 0 x hence we have 35 d u d t i k 0 n i ϖ i k x f 1 u i k n and 36 d v d t i k 0 n i ϖ i k y f 2 u i k n thus we obtain a nonlinear system of odes that will be solved by a finite difference scheme 3 1 c property of the proposed numerical technique furthermore we can prove that the proposed method has the important c property let the shallow water equation be as follows 37 h x t t u h x t x g x z x t in which 38 h x t h x t u h x t 39 u z x t p x t p 2 x t h x t 1 2 g h 2 x t 40 f x z x t 0 g h x t b x

condition 41 h n b x c constant u n 0 holds for stationary flows at rest the treatment of source terms in the main model is reconstructed such that condition 41 is preserved at the discretized level according to conditions 41 eq 37 can be rewritten as follows 42 t h x t 0 x 0 1 2 g h 2 x t 0 g h x t b x x applying implicit euler difference method for 37 results 43 h n 1 h n τ d x u h n u h n 1 u

with computational results of benkhaldoun et al 2015 the main aim of the current example is to efficiently use the new proposed method to simulate the non hyperbolic systems of conservation laws it should be noted that there are a few numerical techniques to solve this problem without the hyperviscosity term diffusion term however the model studied in this work includes the hyperviscosity term thus it is much more difficult to get acceptable results for its solution it should be noted that the new method proposed here can give suitable results in table 5 we have compared our numerical results with the proposed method in benkhaldoun et al 2015 based on an improved finite volume method for example 7 6 9 test problem 8 remediation of contaminated groundwater the aquifer conditions can be simulated and predicted by groundwater models the groundwater models may be used to predict the effects of hydrological changes like groundwater abstraction or irrigation developments on the behavior of the aquifer and are often named groundwater simulation models with the microbiological technology a mathematical model for prevention and control of groundwater contaminant can be considered as a coupled nonlinear advection diffusion reaction system a schematic representation of hydrologic processes is displayed in fig 20 for example 8 the two dimensional groundwater equation

is a hydrodynamic diffusion function w p is the total concentration of active microorganism and w w p r m in the current example we assume d 10 4 and μ x 1 1 the current example aims to solve a groundwater model by using the proposed numerical technique fig 21 displays numerical solutions for different final times with grid size 80 and time step τ 10 4 for example 8 according to fig 21 we can observe that groundwater contaminant is eliminating during the time 7 conclusion in this paper we applied the space splitting approach in the upwind local rbfs dq numerical procedure for solving three models of conservation laws equations the local rbfs dq method is an efficient method for solving conservation laws equations by the new combination at first we could consider more collocation nodes in the computational domain in comparison with the classical local rbfs dq method and second we only need to build the one dimensional derivative matrix thus in the proposed procedure we solved limited number of one dimensional problems instead of a large two dimensional problem to check the accuracy and efficiency of the developed technique we studied the buckley leverett equation and shallow water model the computational results confirm the capability of the new scheme proposed in the current investigation acknowledgment the authors are grateful to three reviewers for carefully

recently got the attention due to several reasons such as stringent eedi regulations and associated minimum power guidelines optimization of ship design with respect to the real operating conditions assessment of safety performance in extreme weather conditions etc in this paper a modular simulation model for manoeuvring in adverse weather conditions is proposed the effects of propeller and rudder emergences on ship behaviour and propulsion engine s dynamics are also taken into account by integrating the first order 6dof ship motions into the manoeuvring model the engine s load limits are also explicitly considered using the fuel limiter inside the governor various manoeuvring simulations are investigated by using the different initial conditions propulsion engines and environmental conditions the difference in the initial forward speeds of time domain simulations is found to have the significant effects on ship trajectories although the final equilibrium ship speeds are the same the choice of engine s smcr with higher light running margin lrm is found to have the substantial advantageous over ship speed and safety in adverse weather conditions but with

maximum continuous rating 1 introduction with the gradually tightened eedi regulations imo 2014 the new ships may be equipped with the smaller propulsion plants man energy solutions 2018a just to comply with the regulation since design ship speed or power reduction is the easiest way to decrease the eedi value compared to the other methods takasaki 2015 with the decreased installed propulsion power these ships will be vulnerable to navigational accidents such as collision grounding contact etc when they encounter the severe weather conditions typical examples include grounding accidents of a panamax bulk carrier named pasha bulker and a capesize bulk carrier named ocean victory off newcastle port in australia and kashima port in japan respectively australian transport safety bureau 2008 marine accident investigation section 2006 in both cases the ships failed to go ahead because of severe head wind and waves and then lost their manoeuvrability and finally grounded although they were built before the eedi requirement these kinds of accidents are more likely to occur if the ship designers decided to reduce the propulsion power therefore eedi regulation also requires that the installed propulsion power needs to be greater than the required propulsion power as defined in imo minimum power guidelines to maintain operability of ship under adverse weather conditions imo 2017 2013 to improve the minimum power guideline and to access the navigational safety of the ships in severe sea conditions within the eedi minimum power requirements it is necessary to systematically investigate the effects of several parameters in model experiment or numerical simulation in case of model experiment modelling a diesel engine and uniform wind field in a model basin are not so easy in model scale thus numerical methods for full scale manoeuvring simulations in wind and waves become important numerical prediction models for calm water manoeuvring simulations have been used for a long time and they are also mature enough in terms of accuracy and robustness ittc manoeuvring committee 2017 manoeuvring simulations in more realistic sea conditions i e in wind and waves have recently got the attention due to several reasons such as tightening eedi regulations optimization of ship design with respect to the real operating conditions assessment of the safety performance in extreme weather conditions with limited propulsion power etc numerical methods for precise modelling of wave drift forces wind forces and manoeuvring forces have been developed and researchers are also improving the accuracy and robustness of these methods imo 2016 ittc seakeeping committee 2017 seo et al 2013 shigunov et al 2018 in the work of shigunov 2018 the definition of the required criteria measures and standards for norming manoeuvrability of ships in adverse conditions are discussed some case studies for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions have been done by shigunov et al 2019 yasukawa and sakuno 2019 applied the mmg method for the prediction of steady sailing condition and course stability under external disturbance in that study zero speed 3d panel method 3dpm for steady lateral force and yaw moment and strip theory based kochin function method skfm for added resistance were used however the engine torque and rpm are assumed constant and engine load limits are not explicitly considered the proposed methods are based on the steady state equilibrium calculation which are more suitable for the direct application in the regulations however the behaviour of the ship in adverse conditions is more intuitively observable in time domain simulations compared to the steady state calculations the ship s trajectories may significantly differ from the original desired ones depending on the initial conditions such as forward speed heading etc even though the final steady state conditions may be the same to observe the dynamics of the propulsion system in waves simulations of a two stroke propulsion engine are done using 1 dof propulsion dynamics with 0d semi physical approximate engine model associated control systems and fuel limiters in the work of yum et al 2017 in the work of myo and umeda 2018 mean value engine model mvem is integrated into the 4dof manoeuvring model and manoeuvring simulations in various adverse weather conditions are done to access the safe navigational limits of a bulk carrier during the severe conditions in very high waves the ship motions become very large and the propeller and rudder may come out of water in such situations the thrust induced by the propeller manoeuvring forces and moments produced by the rudder will be reduced and consequently the steering ability of the ship will be decreased which might lead to the accidents moreover when the propeller racing occurs the torque load on the engine will be lost suddenly which could lead to the engine over speeding and consequential engine damage or voluntary engine speed reduction by the ship master as a result it will lead to more dangerous situations such as collision grounding etc to get more realistic results the effect of propeller and rudder emergence should be included in the simulation model in this paper the authors propose a simulation model for manoeuvring in adverse weather conditions which also considers the effect of propeller and rudder emergence and subsequent effects on the engine propeller dynamics in time domain then various manoeuvring simulations in adverse weather conditions which are based on the real accident scenario are executed to compare the effects of changing different physical parameters such as beaufort no bf initial forward speed engine smcr etc 2 simulation method 2 1 targets of simulation setup the goals and approach for developing the simulation system are as follow modular and flexible each of the physical components should be able to model independent of each other so that different methods experimental numerical or empirical can be used they should also be flexible to update or replace when more accurate and better approaches become available or when the physical components such as propeller engine controller are changed simple fast and robust the program setup should be simple and the simulation duration should be fast enough so that many different cases can be examined in a short time for those components which can be precomputed will be stored in the databases and used them later in simulations as look up tables under quasi static assumption these databases can be easily updated when more accurate and better methods become available this approach also eliminates certain numerical stability problems during time domain simulation and different computer programs can be used to create databases of different components at the same time some necessary assumptions will be made to simplify the method wide range of simulation scenarios in most manoeuvring simulations the control input parameters such as engine power or propeller rpm for propulsion are usually kept constant to broaden the simulation scenarios or to mimic the real operating conditions the guidance navigation and control gnc system for ship trajectory and the propulsion control system should be integrated into the simulation model with the development of remote controlled and autonomous ships or digital twin in future more advanced and sophisticated control systems could be developed for the complex manoeuvring scenarios the diagram of the proposed simulation setup is shown in fig 1 the simulation model can be divided into various parts each part containing different subsystems manoeuvring propulsion seakeeping control etc manoeuvring part includes the calm water hull reaction forces model rudder model with the heading control system and propeller engine model with the speed control system the seakeeping part contains the wind force and wave models the wave model can be divided into two parts first order oscillatory motions in 6 dof and second order wave drift forces in 4 dof the reaction and exciting forces from each component are combined and fed into the 4 dof equations of motions to obtain the manoeuvring motions for the defined input conditions and then first order wave motions are added to obtain the total ship motions in time domain an alternative approach is to use the first order force raos with the 6dof motion equations instead of motion raos the modelling of each of the components are explained in the subsequent sections in detail 2 2 equations of motions and coordinate systems for the manoeuvring model a surge sway roll yaw coupled 4 dof mmg model is used ohiwa and umeda 2016 this approach models low frequency motions only and uses high frequency motions such as harmonic motions due to incident waves only as the input for calculating the second order wave forces and moments this approach can be justified by a multiple time scale perturbation analysis by nonaka 1990 as shown in fig 2 the coordinate system o xyz represents a space fixed system while the coordinate system o xyz does a body fixed system at the c g of the ship the wind is assumed to blow in the negative direction of o x axis here the ship heading measured from o x axis is indicated by ψ and the angle between wind and wave directions is represented by χ the ship is assumed to run at forward speed of u with the drift angle β the heel angle ϕ is against o z axis then the 4 dof equations of motions are represented as follow ohiwa and umeda 2016 1 m m x u m m y v r x h x p x r x a x w 2 m m y v m m x u r m y l y p y h y r y a y w 3 i x j x p m y l y v m x l x u r 2 d 1 ϕ d 2 ϕ ϕ m g g m ϕ k h k r k a k w 4 i z j z r n h n r n a n w 2 3 manoeuvring propulsion and control 2 3 1 hull reaction forces and moments the hydrodynamic reaction forces and moments acting on the hull x h y h k h and n h are calculated using the unified mathematical model for ship manoeuvring in ocean and harbour area proposed by yoshimura et al 2009 this model can deal with the very large drift angle and very low speed manoeuvring which may encounter in the severe seas due to extreme wind and waves the correction factor of crossflow drag coefficients used in this model were obtained from the captive model experiments 2 3 2 rudder autopilot and guidance the rudder induced forces and moment x r y r k r and n r are calculated using a standard mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 for the ship heading control a proportional differential pd type autopilot controller is used fossen 2011 5 δ k p δ ψ t ψ d k d δ r t for more complicated simulation scenarios like waypoints tracking where desired heading angle is not always constant throughout the simulation a line of sight los guidance for path following can be complemented to the pd autopilot fossen 2011 when first order motions are considered the yaw angle feedback into the autopilot contains the harmonic motions which are not desirable for heading control although it is possible to directly feed back the yaw angle before combining with the first order yaw motion a kalman filter based on the 1st order nomoto model fossen 2011 is used for wave filtering to get more realistic behaviour the steering gear from the fig 1 limits the rudder angles and rudder turning rate within their limit ranges 2 3 3 propeller engine governor and fuel limiter the propeller or engine revolution is obtained by solving the following equilibrium equation of shaft dynamics hirano and takashina 2010 6 ω e q e q p q f j t o t a l the torque loss due to friction q f from equation 6 is assumed to be neglectable 2 3 3 1 propeller the propeller generated thrust x p and torque demand q p are calculated from the open water propeller characteristic data 2 3 3 2 engine the engine generated torque q e is obtained from the following simplified engine model assuming that the engine torque is linearly proportional to the amount of fuel supplied into the cylinders 7 q e c e n g u f u e l where u fuel is the fuel index position ranging from 0 to 1 controlled by the engine speed rpm controller the governor the coefficient c eng from eq 7 literally means the maximum torque that can be produced by the engine when fuel index position is one it also corresponds to the maximum mean effective pressure in the engine s cylinders since engine load limits are dominated and explicitly taken into account inside the governor this simplified assumption of torque fuel

accumulation of integral error when the actuator is saturated karlsen 2012 9 u f u e l k p f n d n e t k i f t 0 t n d n e τ d τ in order to safeguard the engine from mechanical and thermal loads the fuel limiter needs to be incorporated into the governor so that the operating point which is a combination of engine speed and power is always within the design load diagram or engine s limit envelope

2018c from fig 3 points l1 l2 l3 and l4 define the engine layout diagram which is fixed for the same base engine model within the layout area there is full freedom to select the engine s smcr specified maximum continuous rating which is optimal for the ship and the operating profile the choice of smcr also depends on the lrm light running margin which is the ratio between the rpm value on the light propeller curve and the rpm value on the nominal propeller curve light running propeller curve can be defined once the hull resistance and propeller design are fixed starting from may 2015

oil consumptions of the engine is higher when the chosen smcr point is near to the l1 l3 line and lower when near to l2 l4 line in a same engine layout man energy solutions 2018c the load diagram defines the power and speed limits of the engine these limits can be defined once the smcr of the engine has been selected from fig 3 line ① represents the maximum speed limit and it is defined such

air is present in the combustion chamber and maximum heat loads bearing loads mechanical stresses are not exceeded the allowable limits lines and are the power limits for the overload running it is permitted only 1 h for every 12 h to operate the engine between continuous running limits and overload running limits to avoid the engine damage therefore overload limits should not be used for the safety assessment of the ship in adverse weather conditions imo 2016 shigunov 2018 among the continuous running limit lines line ④ torque speed limit line plays the most important role when operating

broaden or enlarge the engine limit envelope by using the different turbocharging technologies can be found in klein 2002 kouroutzis and visser 2016 although advanced turbocharging technologies e g two stage turbocharging could theoretically enlarge the engine limit envelope by increasing the pressure inside the engine cylinders the thermal loading of the hot components in the combustion chamber are still bottleneck in most practical cases according to man b w its engine load diagram limits have stayed unchanged for years and the basic designs of engine components with regards to stresses temperatures emissions etc have been made up to these limits leaving no room for a general increase of these limits man diesel and turbo 2015 2 4 seakeeping 2 4 1 sea condition definition environmental conditions are defined by the beaufort numbers bf no which in turn relate to the wind speeds and significant wave height as shown in the table 1 wmo 2011 the mean wave period t0 is chosen as the most critical one based on the largest of 2nd order wave forces and moments around the head sea and bow quartering directions this value may not give the largest 1st order motions but to be consistent the same mean wave period is used for both 2nd order wave forces and 1st order wave motions 2 4 2 wind forces the wind forces and moments xa ya ka and na are estimated with the fujiwara s empirical method fujiwara et al 2001 1998 this estimation method which is based on the linear multiple regression model was obtained by using the experimental results of various kinds of ships with the modification for the effect of wind velocity profiles in experimental conditions 2 4 3 2nd order wave forces and moments the added wave resistance for different ship speeds and headings x w are estimated by maruo s theory maruo 1963 with the kochin function calculated by ogilive tuck s slender body theory ogilvie and tuck 1969 the wave induced steady sway force y w and yaw moment n w are calculated by a linear 3d panel method using the green function for zero forward speed with the first order ship motions taken into account yasukawa et al 2019 these wave induced steady forces and moments in irregular waves are calculated with the jonswap wave spectrum by assuming they are proportional to the square of wave height this is because these force and moment are the second order force with respect of wave steepness when the wave steepness increases the first order ship motion could include higher order effect so that the effect of nonlinear ship motions should be regarded as the third order or higher thus the effect of nonlinear ship motions on the second order wave forces and moments is ignored throughout this paper as higher order contribution since the added wave resistances in the long crested wave are found to be larger than those in the short crested wave the long crested added wave resistance data are used as a conservative estimation experimental validations of the calculation method for these second order wave forces and moments were done by yasukawa et al 2019 to reduce the simulation time these second order wave drift forces and moment are pre calculated and stored in a database as a function of ship speeds encounter headings significant wave heights and mean wave periods then they are used as a look up table during the simulation under quasi static assumption 2 4 4 1st order wave motions the severity and effects of propeller and rudder emergence can be realized if the first order harmonic motions especially heave roll and pitch can be obtained in time domain motion raos for various ship speeds and headings can be easily obtained by the potential flow methods with sufficient accuracy these motions raos which are in the frequency domain can be transformed into the time domain using the appropriate wave spectrum to obtain the first order ship motions in irregular waves firstly using the jonswap wave spectrum a number of wave amplitudes a k wave numbers k k and random phases ε k for a range of regular wave components ω e k are generated then first order motions η w in time domain for each mode of motion are obtained using the linear superposition of the motions caused by the regular waves of different frequency components as follow fossen 2011 10 η w t k 1 n η w k a k cos ω e k t η w k ε k p h a s e p o s where η w k and η w k are motion amplitudes and phase differences for each mode of motions from the motion raos the position phase phase pos is used to correct the wave motions from the origin of coordinate system to the location of the ship s c g in the horizontal plane as follow 11 p h a s e p o s k k x c g cos ψ y c g sin ψ then these first order motions are combined with the manoeuvring motions to obtain the total ship motions at the cg in time domain 2 5 assessment of propeller and rudder emergence to assess the propeller and rudder emergence the instantaneous positions of propeller and rudder with respect to the wave surface elevation are needed the positions of propeller and rudder in time domain can be obtained by correcting the total ship motions which are calculated in cg of the ship to the propeller and rudder locations using the 3d rotation matrix wave surface elevation at these locations ζ p r can be obtained using the same wave components generated to calculate the first order motions as follow fossen 2011 12 ζ p r t k 1 n a k cos ω k t ε k p h a s e p r the phases of the regular wave components need to be corrected to the propeller and rudder using the position phase phase p r similar to the 1st order wave motion calculation in eq 11 using the instantaneous positions of propeller and rudder and wave surface elevation at their positions the areas of propeller and rudder above the water can be determined when they are not fully submerged then the factors for thrust loss torque loss and rudder forces losses are obtained and fed back into the respective components deformation of the wave surface by the presence of ship hull is assumed to be small and therefore only incident wave surface elevation is considered here since the propeller thrust and rudder force are not necessarily related to waves the effect of the first order ship motions on the propeller thrust and the rudder force could be regarded as the first and second orders thus this effect should be included from a perturbation principle with respect to wave steepness 2 6 verification and validation of numerical modelling for verifying the numerical model used here comparative computations using different time step sizes in time domain simulation for a particular case were executed as shown in fig 4 it indicates that the time step size used in this paper i e 0 001 s throughout this paper is sufficiently small enough experimental validations of the numerical model were already reported by ohiwa and umeda 2016 for a bulk carrier in wind and waves and by umeda et al 2016 for a car carrier in wind and waves 3 numerical simulations result and discussion 3 1 subject ship and engine the subject ship used in this study is a handymax bulk carrier its hull form is originated from the kvlcc2 which is modified to have the block coefficient of 0 84 yasukawa et al 2019 2015 principal particulars of the ship propeller rudder and engine are shown in the table 2 3 2 scenario discription turn to head sea the simulation scenario is inspired by the grounding accident of the pasha bulker on the nobbys beach of newcastle australia while it was waiting for its cargo at anchorage 2 4 miles off the coast australian transport safety bureau 2008 according to the investigation report the master tried to depart from the anchorage and sail into open sea since it started to drag the anchor as the weather becomes severe the ship started to manoeuvre nearly in beam sea and failed to keep the head sea condition for weather vanning and ended grounding on the beach in this scenario the ship is initially assumed to be at the beam sea with a certain initial speed and then it will try to turn to the head sea condition using the pd autopilot the manoeuvring simulations for this scenario are separated into four different sections in the first section the effects of propeller and rudder emergences on the ship trajectory speed engine rpm and response of governor are investigated and then manoeuvring simulations in different beaufort conditions are executed in the second section in the third section the effects of the initial forward speed on the ship trajectory are examined finally the effect of changing engine or smcr on the ship speed and trajectory are studied in the fourth section in all cases the wind and waves are assumed coming from the same direction of zero degrees 3 3 effects of propeller and rudder emergence to investigate the effects of propeller and rudder emergence on the ship behaviour a comparative simulation in bf 10 is done with and without emergence effects using the initial forward speed of 2 knots the first graph in fig 5 shows the instantaneous position of the upper tip of the propeller relative to the wave surface elevation although some propeller emergences can be seen in the time history the frequency and severity of emergence in this particular case are not too high this explains the reason why there is only a slight difference between two situations in the time history of ship forward speeds as shown in the second plot of the fig 7 it should be remembered that the severity of emergence depends not only on the significant wave height but also on the mean wave period of the chosen wave spectrum in the case of rudder the emergence frequency and severity are significantly higher than that of the propeller as the upper tip of the rudder is higher than that of propeller the effect can also be seen in the difference between two situations in the ship trajectories and time history of rudder angles fig 6 and fig 7 the difference in rudder command may also be contributed by the imperfection in the filtering of harmonic yaw motion feedbacked into the autopilot the time history of engine propeller rpm power developed and fuel index command by the governor are shown in fig 8 when the propeller emergence occurs there are sudden jumps in the engine rpm as shown in the first graph of the fig 8 but these jumps do not exceed the engine speed limit threshold since the emergence duration is too short and the governor is fast enough to react to those sudden engine speed jumps moreover the engine rpm is already in a significantly lower condition than the threshold value due to heavy loading on the propeller caused by severe wind and waves in real situations the delays in governor fuel pump and engine torque generation may also contribute over speeding of the engine leading to the complete engine shutdown 3 4 comparison of different bf conditions to investigate the navigational safety of the ship in different severities of weather conditions manoeuvring simulations in several different bf nos are compared using the initial forward speed of 2 knots the subject ship can manoeuvre and keep the head sea up to bf 10 condition using the installed engine power however the trajectory and final steady speed of bf 10 condition are significantly less safe compared to the lower bf no as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 the time history of the engine propeller rpm and power developed and governor fuel index position are shown in the fig 11 hereafter the spikes due to emergence effect in these timeseries plots are removed for clarity of comparison 3 5 effects of initial forward speed to examine the effects of different initial speeds in time domain simulations the simulations for two severe bf conditions bf 10 and bf 11 are executed by systematically changing the initial forward speed fig 12 shows the trajectory plots of the ship in bf 10 using initial speeds of 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 knots respectively the trajectories in bf 11 are shown in the fig 13 with the initial speeds of 0 5 10 and 15 knots respectively although there are no differences in the final steady equilibrium conditions the differences in the initial forward speeds of the time domain simulation have the significant effects on the trajectory of the ship these differences in trajectories are mainly contributed by the differences in rudder effects caused by the initial speed of the ship equilibrium calculations do not reveal these differences and they are only able to see in the time domain simulations these may decide whether the accident happens or not if the operating area is restricted 3 6 effects of changing engine or smcr to investigate the performance of ship adverse weather with different engines or smcr three new smcr points which are based on the same engine base model or layout are proposed as listed in table 3 the smcr points of four different engines and their associated load limit diagrams are shown in fig 14 generally when the different engine smcr is considered the propeller design should also be changed in that case the propeller curve would be shifted to lower or higher rpm affecting the lrm however here the propeller data are kept constant to simplify the comparison of different engines the smcr point of engl1 is chosen as the highest available point of the given layout diagram of the base engine model since this point has the larger power than original engine engori the calm water ship design speed shall be higher on the other hand the eedi value shall be the highest among the others since both pmcr and sfoc are higher moreover the improvement of the engine limit lines in the heavy loading conditions low rpm is slight as can be seen in fig 14 the smcr of englow is chosen as 20 reduction in power and 10 reduction in rpm of the original engine this engine has the advantages in term of eedi value and sfoc with the compromise of design ship speed but the lower engine power can cause troubles in the heavy weather conditions finally the smcr point of englrm is chosen as the same pmcr as the original engine but lower nmcr to maximize the lrm within the given engine layout since lrm and engine limits are highest this engine could give the largest ship speed in adverse weather man diesel and turbo 2015 but there would be compromises in calm water ship speed and sfoc and eedi value the required eedi values for subject ship and attained eedi values with four different engines are shown in table 4 and table 5 respectively attained eedi calculations are based on the example calculations from 2018 guidelines on the method of calculation of attained eedi for new ships annex 5 of mepc 308 73 imo 2018 with necessary assumptions the simulation results for four different engines in bf 10 with the initial forward speed of 2 knots are shown in fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 respectively in each case of simulation nmcr value of the respective engines is used as the set point rpm to the governor as shown in the fig 16 even though the smcr of engl1 is significantly higher than original engine the improvement in final ship speed is quite small 0 7 knots with engori and 0 76 knots with engl1 since the difference in engine limits in high load condition is just a minor on the other hand some improvement in ship trajectory still can be found in the case of englow the ship completely failed to manoeuvre in bf 10 condition among the four engines englrm gave the highest final speed 1 1 knots and safest trajectory this is explained by the higher engine limits in heavy loading conditions affected by choosing larger lrm although it has the same power as the original engine from the time history of rpm and fuel index position for englrm it can be seen that the governor s fuel index command is lower than one while it is keeping the set point rpm this means it is not using the full potential of the engine and still can be improved by using the larger set point rpm than nmcr 4 conclusions a modular simulation model for manoeuvring in adverse weather conditions which also considers the effects of propeller and rudder emergences was proposed the proposed setup is quite flexible in changing the physical components and environmental conditions the time taken for each simulation is also very short and it is in order of seconds various manoeuvring simulations are shown by using the different physical parameters and environmental conditions in the comparison of simulation results with and without emergence effects the ship speed is not significantly affected by emergences since propeller emergences are not frequent and the duration of emergences are quite short some noticeable effects can be seen in the ship trajectories since rudder emergences are more severe compared to the propeller emergences engine over speeding didn t occur in the sample case shown bf 10 since the pi governor was fast enough to compensate for the sudden engine speed jumps engine over speeding is more likely to occur in the directions other than head sea and bow quartering waves since the average equilibrium engine speed in these conditions are higher due to less heavy loading on the propeller since the simulations are based on the ideal conditions with simplified models it is difficult to take account all the possible effects and the behaviour in real situations would be contributed by other unaccounted factors in simulations simulations under different bf conditions show that the subject ship can manoeuvre to head sea up to bf 10 conditions but with very small final steady speed in bf 10 in practical situations where rudder angle is controlled by the human in discrete form and the exact directions of wind and waves are not easily accessible especially when the wind and wave directions are not aligned the control would be less efficient than simulations and the results could be quite different using different initial forward speeds in time domain simulations is found to have the significant effects on the ship trajectories although the final steady state equilibrium conditions are the same obviously different initial ship headings shall also give more or less significantly different trajectories when accessing the safety of the ship in adverse conditions not only the equilibrium ship speed but also the ship s trajectories are important if the ship is operating in the restricted areas such as coastal areas port areas etc in the evaluation of the different engine smcrs choosing smcr with higher lrm has the substantial advantageous over ship speed and safety in adverse weather conditions but there should be some compromises in calm water ship speed sfoc and eedi values declaration of competing

assessment of safety performance in extreme weather conditions etc in this paper a modular simulation model for manoeuvring in adverse weather conditions is proposed the effects of propeller and rudder emergences on ship behaviour and propulsion engine s dynamics are also taken into account by integrating the first order 6dof ship motions into the manoeuvring model the engine s load limits are also explicitly considered using the fuel limiter inside the governor various manoeuvring simulations are investigated by using the different initial conditions propulsion engines and

comply with the regulation since design ship speed or power reduction is the easiest way to decrease the eedi value compared to the other methods takasaki 2015 with the decreased installed propulsion power these ships will be vulnerable to navigational accidents such as collision grounding contact etc when they encounter the severe weather conditions typical examples include grounding accidents of a panamax bulk carrier named pasha bulker and a capesize bulk carrier named ocean victory off newcastle port in australia and kashima port in japan respectively australian transport safety bureau 2008 marine accident investigation section 2006 in both cases the ships failed to go ahead because of severe head wind and waves and then lost their manoeuvrability and finally grounded although they were built before the eedi requirement these kinds of accidents are more likely to occur if the ship designers decided to reduce the propulsion power therefore eedi regulation also requires that the installed propulsion power needs to be greater than the required propulsion power as defined in imo minimum power guidelines to maintain operability of ship under adverse weather conditions imo 2017 2013 to improve the minimum power guideline and to access the navigational safety of the ships in severe sea conditions within the eedi minimum power requirements it is necessary to systematically investigate the effects of several parameters in model experiment or numerical simulation in case of model experiment modelling a diesel engine and uniform wind field in a model basin are not so easy in model scale thus numerical methods for full scale manoeuvring simulations in wind and waves become important numerical prediction models for calm water manoeuvring simulations have been used for a long time and they are also mature enough in terms of accuracy and robustness ittc manoeuvring committee 2017 manoeuvring simulations in more realistic sea conditions i e in wind and waves have recently got the attention due to several reasons such as tightening eedi regulations optimization of ship design with respect to the real operating conditions assessment of the safety performance in extreme weather conditions with limited propulsion power etc numerical methods for precise modelling of wave drift forces wind forces and manoeuvring forces have been developed and researchers are also improving the accuracy and robustness of these methods imo 2016 ittc seakeeping committee 2017 seo et al 2013 shigunov et al 2018 in the work of shigunov 2018 the definition of the required criteria measures and standards for norming manoeuvrability of ships in adverse conditions are discussed some case studies for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions have been done by shigunov et al 2019 yasukawa and sakuno 2019 applied the mmg method for the prediction of steady sailing condition and course stability under external disturbance in that study zero speed 3d panel method 3dpm for steady lateral force and yaw moment and strip theory based kochin function method skfm for added resistance were used however the engine torque and rpm are assumed constant and engine load limits are not explicitly considered the proposed methods are based on the steady state equilibrium calculation which are more suitable for the direct application in the regulations however the behaviour of the ship in adverse conditions is more intuitively observable in time domain simulations compared to the steady state calculations the ship s trajectories may significantly differ from the original desired ones depending on the initial conditions such as forward speed heading etc even though the final steady state conditions may be the same to observe the dynamics of the propulsion system in waves simulations of a two stroke propulsion engine are done using 1 dof propulsion dynamics with 0d semi physical approximate engine model associated control systems and fuel limiters in the work of yum et al 2017 in the work of myo and umeda 2018 mean value engine model mvem is integrated into the 4dof manoeuvring model and manoeuvring simulations in various adverse weather conditions are done to access the safe navigational limits of a bulk carrier during the severe conditions in very high waves the ship motions become very large and the propeller and rudder may come out of water in such situations the thrust induced by the propeller manoeuvring forces and moments produced by the rudder will be reduced and consequently the steering ability of the ship will be decreased which might lead to the accidents moreover when the propeller racing occurs the torque load on the engine will be lost suddenly which could lead to the engine over speeding and consequential engine damage or voluntary engine speed reduction by the ship master as a result it will lead to more dangerous situations such as collision grounding etc to get more realistic results the effect of propeller and rudder emergence should be included in the simulation model in this paper the authors propose a simulation model for manoeuvring in adverse weather conditions which also considers the effect of propeller and rudder emergence and subsequent effects on the engine propeller dynamics in time domain then various manoeuvring simulations in adverse weather conditions which are based on the real accident scenario are executed to compare the effects of changing different physical parameters such as beaufort no bf initial forward speed engine smcr etc 2 simulation method 2 1 targets of simulation setup the goals and approach for developing the simulation system are as follow modular and flexible each of the physical components should be able to model independent of each other so that different methods experimental numerical or empirical can be used they should also be flexible to update or replace when more accurate and better approaches become available or when the physical components such as propeller engine controller are changed simple fast and robust the program setup should be simple and the simulation duration should be fast enough so that many different cases can be examined in a short time for those components which can be precomputed will be stored in the databases and used them later in simulations as look up tables under quasi static assumption these databases can be easily updated when more accurate and better methods become available this approach also eliminates certain numerical stability problems during time domain simulation and different computer programs can be used to create databases of different components at the same time some necessary assumptions will be made to simplify the method wide range of simulation scenarios in most manoeuvring simulations the control input parameters such as engine power or propeller rpm for propulsion are usually kept constant to broaden the simulation scenarios or to mimic the real operating conditions the guidance navigation and control gnc system for ship trajectory and the propulsion control system should be integrated into the simulation model with the development of remote controlled and autonomous ships or digital twin in future more advanced and sophisticated control systems could be developed for the complex manoeuvring scenarios the diagram of the proposed simulation setup is shown in fig 1 the simulation model can be divided into various parts each part containing different subsystems manoeuvring propulsion seakeeping control etc manoeuvring part includes the calm water hull reaction forces model rudder model with the heading control system and propeller engine model with the speed control system the seakeeping part contains the wind force and wave models the wave model can be divided into two parts first order oscillatory motions in 6 dof and second order wave drift forces in 4 dof the reaction and exciting forces from each component are combined and fed into the 4 dof equations of motions to obtain the manoeuvring motions for the defined input conditions and then first order wave motions are added to obtain the total ship motions in time domain an alternative approach is to use the first order force raos with the 6dof motion equations instead of motion raos the modelling of each of the components are explained in the subsequent sections in detail 2 2 equations of motions and coordinate systems for the manoeuvring model a surge sway roll yaw coupled 4 dof mmg model is used ohiwa and umeda 2016 this approach models low frequency motions only and uses high frequency motions such as harmonic motions due to incident waves only as the input for calculating the second order wave forces and moments this approach can be justified by a multiple time scale perturbation analysis by nonaka 1990 as shown in fig 2 the coordinate system o xyz represents a space fixed system while the coordinate system o xyz does a body fixed system at the c g of the ship the wind is assumed to blow in the negative direction of o x axis here the ship heading measured from o x axis is indicated by ψ and the angle between wind and wave directions is represented by χ the ship is assumed to run at forward speed of u with the drift angle β the heel angle ϕ is against o z axis then the 4 dof equations of motions are represented as follow ohiwa and umeda 2016 1 m m x u m m y v r x h x p x r x a x w 2 m m y v m m x u r m y l y p y h y r y a y w 3 i x j x p m y l y v m x l x u r 2 d 1 ϕ d 2 ϕ ϕ m g g m ϕ k h k r k a k w 4 i z j z r n h n r n a n w 2 3 manoeuvring propulsion and control 2 3 1 hull reaction forces and moments the hydrodynamic reaction forces and moments acting on the hull x h y h k h and n h are calculated using the unified mathematical model for ship manoeuvring in ocean and harbour area proposed by yoshimura et al 2009 this model can deal with the very large drift angle and very low speed manoeuvring which may encounter in the severe seas due to extreme wind and waves the correction factor of crossflow drag coefficients used in this model were obtained from the captive model experiments 2 3 2 rudder autopilot and guidance the rudder induced forces and moment x r y r k r and n r are calculated using a standard mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 for the ship heading control a proportional differential pd type autopilot controller is used fossen 2011 5 δ k p δ ψ t ψ d k d δ r t for more complicated simulation scenarios like waypoints tracking where desired heading angle is not always constant throughout the simulation a line of sight los guidance for path following can be complemented to the pd autopilot fossen 2011 when first order motions are considered the yaw angle feedback into the autopilot contains the harmonic motions which are not desirable for heading control although it is possible to directly feed back the yaw angle before combining with the first order yaw motion a kalman filter based on the 1st order nomoto model fossen 2011 is used for wave filtering to get more realistic behaviour the steering gear from the fig 1 limits the rudder angles and rudder

demand q p are calculated from the open water propeller characteristic data 2 3 3 2 engine the engine generated torque q e is obtained from the following simplified engine model assuming that the engine torque is linearly proportional to the amount of fuel supplied into the cylinders 7 q e c e n g u f u e l where u fuel is the fuel index position ranging from 0 to 1 controlled by the engine speed rpm controller the governor the coefficient c eng from eq 7 literally means the maximum torque that can be produced by the engine when fuel index position is one it also corresponds to the maximum mean effective pressure in the engine s cylinders since engine load limits are dominated and explicitly taken into account inside the governor this simplified assumption of torque fuel relation is reasonable for this particular study c eng can easily be obtained from the chosen smcr or engine s physical parameters as follow 8 c e n g p m c r n m c r 2 π 60 or z c v d p i m a x 2 π 2 3 3 3 governor and load limits for the engine speed control a proportional integral pi type governor is used as in eq 9 moreover integral anti windup action is added to the pi controller to avoid the accumulation of integral error when the actuator is saturated karlsen 2012 9 u f u e l k p f n d n e t k i f t 0 t n d n e τ d τ in order to safeguard the engine from mechanical and thermal loads the fuel limiter needs to be incorporated into the governor so that the operating point which is a combination of engine speed and power is always within the design load diagram or engine s limit envelope

2018c from fig 3 points l1 l2 l3 and l4 define the engine layout diagram which is fixed for the same base engine model within the layout area there is full freedom to select the engine s smcr specified maximum continuous rating which is optimal for the ship and the operating profile the choice of smcr also depends on the lrm light running margin which is the ratio between the rpm value on the light propeller curve and the rpm value on the nominal propeller curve light running propeller curve can be defined once the hull resistance and propeller design are fixed starting from may 2015 man b w changed their recommended lrm from 3 7 to 4 10 in respond to the possible usage of lower power engines due to tightening eedi regulations man diesel and turbo 2015 generally sfoc specific fuel oil consumptions of the engine is higher when the chosen smcr point is near to the l1 l3 line and lower when near to l2 l4 line in a same engine layout man energy solutions 2018c the load diagram defines the power and speed limits of the engine these limits can be defined once the smcr of the engine has been selected from fig 3 line ① represents the maximum speed limit and it is defined such that the maximum allowable mechanical stresses and sliding speeds internally in the engine are not exceeded lines ② to ④ are the power limits for continuous running these limit lines ensure that ample air is present in the combustion chamber and maximum heat loads bearing loads mechanical stresses are not exceeded the allowable limits lines and are the power limits for the overload running it is permitted only 1 h for every 12 h to operate the engine between continuous running limits and overload running limits to avoid the engine damage therefore overload limits should not be used for the safety assessment of the ship in adverse weather conditions imo 2016 shigunov 2018 among the continuous running limit lines line ④ torque speed limit line plays the most important role when operating in the heavy loading conditions line ④ is the limit at which an ample air supply is available for combustion and imposes a limitation on the maximum combination of torque and speed to the left of the line ④ in torque rich operation the engine will lack air from the turbocharger to the combustion process i e the heat load limits may be exceeded and bearing loads might also become very high man energy solutions 2018b 2015 the definitions for the limitation lines and their relations to pmcr and nmcr are as follow man energy solutions 2015 line ① maximum speed limit 105 of nmcr line ② maximum power limit 100 of pmcr line ③ maximum torque or mep limit n line ④ maximum torque speed limit n2 line overload power limit 110 of pmcr line overload torque speed limit some studies on the means to broaden or enlarge the engine limit envelope by using the different turbocharging technologies can be found in klein 2002 kouroutzis and visser 2016 although advanced turbocharging technologies e g two stage turbocharging could theoretically enlarge the engine limit envelope by increasing the pressure inside the engine cylinders the thermal loading of the hot components in the combustion chamber are still bottleneck in most practical cases according to man b w its engine load diagram limits have stayed unchanged for years and the basic designs of engine components with regards to stresses temperatures emissions etc have been made up to these limits leaving no room for a general increase of these limits man diesel and turbo 2015 2 4 seakeeping 2 4 1 sea condition definition environmental conditions are defined by the beaufort numbers bf no which in turn relate to the wind speeds and significant wave height as shown in the table 1 wmo 2011 the mean wave period t0 is chosen as the most critical one based on the largest of 2nd order wave forces and moments around the head sea and bow quartering directions this value may not give the largest 1st order motions but to be consistent the same mean wave period is used for both 2nd order wave forces and 1st order wave motions 2 4 2 wind forces the wind forces and moments xa ya ka and na are estimated with the fujiwara s empirical method fujiwara et al 2001 1998 this estimation method which is based on the linear multiple regression model was obtained by using the experimental results of various kinds of ships with the modification for the effect of wind velocity profiles in experimental conditions 2 4 3 2nd order wave forces and moments the added wave resistance for different ship speeds and headings x w are estimated by maruo s theory maruo 1963 with the kochin function calculated by ogilive tuck s slender body theory ogilvie and tuck 1969 the wave induced steady sway force y w and yaw moment n w are calculated by a linear 3d panel method using the green function for zero forward speed with the first order ship motions taken into account yasukawa et al 2019 these wave induced steady forces and moments in irregular waves are calculated with the jonswap wave spectrum by assuming they are proportional to the square of wave height this is because these force and moment are the second order force with respect of wave steepness when the wave steepness increases the first order ship motion could include higher order effect so that the effect of nonlinear ship motions should be regarded as the third order or higher thus the effect of nonlinear ship motions on the second order wave forces and moments is ignored throughout this paper as higher order contribution since the added wave resistances in the long crested wave are found to be larger than those in the short crested wave the long crested added wave resistance data are used as a conservative estimation experimental validations of the calculation method for these second order wave forces and moments were done by yasukawa et al 2019 to reduce the simulation time these second order wave drift forces and moment are pre calculated and stored in a database as a function of ship speeds encounter headings significant wave heights and mean wave periods then they are used as a look up table during the simulation under quasi static assumption 2 4 4 1st order wave motions the severity and effects of propeller and rudder emergence can be realized if the first order harmonic motions especially heave roll and pitch can be obtained in time domain motion raos for various ship speeds and headings can be easily obtained by the potential flow methods with sufficient accuracy these motions raos which are in the frequency domain can be transformed into the time domain using the appropriate wave spectrum to obtain the first order ship motions in irregular waves firstly using the jonswap wave spectrum a number of wave amplitudes a k wave numbers k k and random phases ε k for a range of regular wave components ω e k are generated then first order motions η w in time domain for each mode of motion are obtained using the linear superposition of the motions caused by the regular waves of different frequency components as follow fossen 2011 10 η w t k 1 n η w k a k cos ω e k t η w k ε k p h a s e p o s where η w k and η w k are motion amplitudes and phase differences for each mode of motions from the motion raos the position phase phase pos is used to correct the wave motions from the origin of coordinate system to the location of the ship s c g in the horizontal plane as follow 11 p h a s e p o s k k x c g cos ψ y c g sin ψ then these first order motions are combined with the manoeuvring motions to obtain the total ship motions at the cg in time domain 2 5 assessment of propeller and rudder emergence to assess the propeller and rudder emergence the instantaneous positions of propeller and rudder with respect to the wave surface elevation are needed the positions of propeller and rudder in time domain can be obtained by correcting the total ship motions which are calculated in cg of the ship to the propeller and rudder locations using the 3d rotation matrix wave surface elevation at these locations ζ p r can be obtained using the same wave components generated to calculate the first order motions as follow fossen 2011 12 ζ p r t k 1 n a k cos ω k t ε k p h a s e p r the phases of the regular wave components need to be corrected to the propeller and rudder using the position phase phase p r similar to the 1st order wave motion calculation in eq 11 using the instantaneous positions of propeller and rudder and wave surface elevation at their positions the areas of propeller and rudder above the water can be determined when they are not fully submerged then the factors for thrust loss torque loss and rudder forces losses are obtained and fed back into the respective components deformation of the wave surface by the presence of ship hull is assumed to be small and therefore only incident wave surface elevation is considered here since the propeller thrust and rudder force are not necessarily related to waves the effect of the first order ship motions on the propeller thrust and the rudder force could be regarded as the first and second orders thus this effect should be included from a perturbation principle with respect to wave steepness 2 6 verification and validation of numerical modelling for verifying the numerical model used here comparative computations using different time step sizes in time domain simulation for a particular case were executed as shown in fig 4 it indicates that the time step size used in this paper i e 0 001 s throughout this paper is sufficiently small enough experimental validations of the numerical model were already reported by ohiwa and umeda 2016 for a bulk carrier in wind and waves and by umeda et al 2016 for a car carrier in wind and waves 3 numerical simulations result and discussion 3 1 subject ship and engine the subject ship used in this study is a handymax bulk carrier its hull form is originated from the kvlcc2 which is modified to have the block coefficient of 0 84 yasukawa et al 2019 2015 principal particulars of the ship propeller rudder and engine are shown in the table 2 3 2 scenario discription turn to head sea the simulation scenario is inspired by the grounding accident of the pasha bulker on the nobbys beach of newcastle australia while it was waiting for its cargo at anchorage 2 4 miles off the coast australian transport safety bureau 2008 according to the investigation report the master tried to depart from the anchorage and sail into open sea since it started to drag the anchor as the weather becomes severe the ship started to manoeuvre nearly in beam sea and failed to keep the head sea condition for weather vanning and ended grounding on the beach in this scenario the ship is initially assumed to be at the beam sea with a certain initial speed and then it will try to turn to the head sea condition using the pd autopilot the manoeuvring simulations for this scenario are separated into four different sections in the first section the effects of propeller and rudder emergences on the ship trajectory speed engine rpm and response of governor are investigated and then manoeuvring simulations in different beaufort conditions are executed in the second section in the third section the effects of the initial forward speed on the ship trajectory are examined finally the effect of changing engine or smcr on the ship speed and trajectory are studied in the fourth section in all cases the wind and waves are assumed coming from the same direction of zero degrees 3 3 effects of propeller and rudder emergence to investigate the effects of propeller and rudder emergence on the ship behaviour a comparative simulation in bf 10 is done with and without emergence effects using the initial forward speed of 2 knots the first graph in fig 5 shows the instantaneous position of the upper tip of the propeller relative to the wave surface elevation although some propeller emergences can be seen in the time history the frequency and severity of emergence in this particular case are not too high this explains the reason why there is only a slight difference between two situations in the time history of ship forward speeds as shown in the second plot of the fig 7 it should be remembered that the severity of emergence depends not only on the significant wave height but also on the mean wave period of the chosen wave spectrum in the case of rudder the emergence frequency and severity are significantly higher than that of the propeller as the upper tip of the rudder is higher than that of propeller the effect can also be seen in the difference between two situations in the ship trajectories and time history of rudder angles fig 6 and fig 7 the difference in rudder command may also be contributed by the imperfection in the filtering of harmonic yaw motion feedbacked into the autopilot the time history of engine propeller rpm power developed and fuel index command by the governor are shown in fig 8 when the propeller emergence occurs there are sudden jumps in the engine rpm as shown in the first graph of the fig 8 but these jumps do not exceed the engine speed limit threshold since the emergence duration is too short and the governor is fast enough to react to those sudden engine speed jumps moreover the engine rpm is already in a significantly lower condition than the threshold value due to heavy loading on the propeller caused by severe wind and waves in real situations the delays in governor fuel pump and engine torque generation may also contribute over speeding of the engine leading to the complete engine shutdown 3 4 comparison of different bf conditions to investigate the navigational safety of the ship in different severities of weather conditions manoeuvring simulations in several different bf nos are compared using the initial forward speed of 2 knots the subject ship can manoeuvre and keep the head sea up to bf 10 condition using the installed engine power however the trajectory and final steady speed of bf 10 condition are significantly less safe compared to the lower bf no as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 the time history of the engine propeller rpm and power developed and governor fuel index position are shown in the fig 11 hereafter the spikes due to emergence effect in these timeseries plots are removed for clarity of comparison 3 5 effects of initial forward speed to examine the effects of different initial speeds in time domain simulations the simulations for two severe bf conditions bf 10 and bf 11 are executed by systematically changing the initial forward speed fig 12 shows the trajectory plots of the ship in bf 10 using initial speeds of 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 knots respectively the trajectories in bf 11 are shown in the fig 13 with the initial speeds of 0 5 10 and 15 knots respectively although there are no differences in the final steady equilibrium conditions the differences in the initial forward speeds of the time domain simulation have the significant effects on the trajectory of the ship these differences in trajectories are mainly contributed by the differences in rudder effects caused by the initial speed of the ship equilibrium calculations do not reveal these differences and they are only able to see in the time domain simulations these may decide whether the accident happens or not if the operating area is restricted 3 6 effects of changing engine or smcr to investigate the performance of ship adverse weather with different engines or smcr three new smcr points which are based on the same engine base model or layout are proposed as listed in table 3 the smcr points of four different engines and their associated load limit diagrams are shown in fig 14 generally when the different engine smcr is considered the propeller design should also be changed in that case the propeller curve would be shifted to lower or higher rpm affecting the lrm however here the propeller data are kept constant to simplify the comparison of different engines the smcr point of engl1 is chosen as the highest available point of the given layout diagram of the base engine model since this point has the larger power than original engine engori the calm water ship design speed shall be higher on the other hand the eedi value shall be the highest among the others since both pmcr and sfoc are higher moreover the improvement of the engine limit lines in the heavy loading conditions low rpm is slight as can be seen in fig 14 the smcr of englow is chosen as 20 reduction in power and 10 reduction in rpm of the original engine this engine has the advantages in term of eedi value and sfoc with the compromise of design ship speed but the lower engine power can cause troubles in the heavy weather conditions finally the smcr point of englrm is chosen as the same pmcr as the original engine but lower nmcr to maximize the lrm within the given engine layout since lrm and engine limits are highest this engine could give the largest ship speed in adverse weather man diesel and turbo 2015 but there would be compromises in calm water ship speed and sfoc and eedi value the required eedi values for subject ship and attained eedi values with four different engines are shown in table 4 and table 5 respectively attained eedi calculations are based on the example calculations from 2018 guidelines on the method of calculation of attained eedi for new ships annex 5 of mepc 308 73 imo 2018 with necessary assumptions the simulation results for four different engines in bf 10 with the initial forward speed of 2 knots are shown in fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 respectively in each case of simulation nmcr value of the respective engines is used as the set point rpm to the governor as shown in the fig 16 even though the smcr of engl1 is significantly higher than original engine the improvement in final ship speed is quite small 0 7 knots with engori and 0 76 knots with engl1 since the difference in engine limits in high load condition is just a minor on the other hand some improvement in ship trajectory still can be found in the case of englow the ship completely failed to manoeuvre in bf 10 condition among the four engines englrm gave the highest final speed 1 1 knots and safest trajectory this is explained by the higher engine limits in heavy loading conditions affected by choosing larger lrm although it has the same power as the original engine from the time history of rpm and fuel index position for englrm it can be seen that the governor s fuel index command is lower than one while it is keeping the set point rpm this means it is not using the full potential of the engine and still can be improved by using the larger set point rpm than nmcr 4 conclusions a modular simulation model for manoeuvring in adverse weather conditions which also considers the effects of propeller and rudder emergences was proposed the proposed setup is quite flexible in changing the physical components and environmental conditions the time taken for each simulation is also very short and it is in order of seconds various manoeuvring simulations are shown by using the different physical parameters and environmental conditions in the comparison of simulation results with and without emergence effects the ship speed is not significantly affected by emergences since propeller emergences are not frequent and the duration of emergences are quite short some noticeable effects can be seen in the ship trajectories since rudder emergences are more severe compared to the propeller emergences engine over speeding didn t occur in the sample case shown bf 10 since the pi governor was fast enough to compensate for the sudden engine speed jumps engine over speeding is more likely to occur in the directions other than head sea and bow quartering waves since the average equilibrium engine speed in these conditions are higher due to less heavy loading on the propeller since the simulations are based on the ideal conditions with simplified models it is difficult to take account all the possible effects and the behaviour in real situations would be contributed by other unaccounted factors in simulations simulations under different bf conditions show that the subject ship can manoeuvre to head sea up to bf 10 conditions but with very small final steady speed in bf 10 in practical situations where rudder angle is controlled by the human in discrete form and the exact directions of wind and waves are not easily accessible especially when the wind and wave directions are not aligned the control would be less efficient than simulations and the results could be quite different using different initial forward speeds in time domain simulations is found to have the significant effects on the ship trajectories although the final steady state equilibrium conditions are the same obviously different initial ship headings shall also give more or less significantly different trajectories when accessing the safety of the ship in adverse conditions not only the equilibrium ship speed but also the ship s trajectories are important if the ship is operating in the restricted areas such as coastal areas port areas etc in the evaluation of the different engine smcrs choosing smcr with higher lrm has the substantial advantageous over ship speed and safety in adverse weather conditions but there should be some compromises in calm water ship speed sfoc and eedi values declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this

is on the rise with a forecasted 28 increase by 2040 u s energy information agency 2017 although much effort is being made to develop renewable energy and nuclear power generation is possible most of this energy use is expected to be dominated by petroleum and natural gas u s energy information agency 2017 among the various methods for power generation the use of lng is considered to be more environmentally friendly than coal fired or nuclear power generation mazyan et al 2016 in order to prepare for additional energy demand there is an increasing interest in the design of floating lng regasification facilities the volume of lng becomes about 1 600 of the volume in its gaseous state providing ease of storage kumar et al 2011 despite such efficiency an unwanted event such as lng leakage may result in life property and environment damages due to low temperature exposure asphyxiation fire or explosions etc there have been several studies on floating lng facilities such as lng fsru floating storage and regasification unit and lng fpso floating production storage and operation some of them are focused on the operational problems such as loading unloading and regasification of lng zellouf and portannier 2011 suggested an lng storage process and investigated the production of boil off gas bog during lng s unloading and storage operations for an lng fsru li and li 2016 analysed the factors affecting the bog generation in the lng receiving terminal they conducted optimization for the improvement against bog fluctuations by applying dynamic simulation kurle et al 2017 analysed the lng vessel loading process to obtain bog generation profiles in consideration of the effect of various parameters with respect to loading time effendy et al 2017 presented a dynamic modelling for an lng storage tank in a regasification terminal incorporating lng recirculation for cooling the transfer lines in loading and unloading some other studies performed researches about hazard identification and risk assessment of floating lng facilities paltrinieri et al 2015 conducted hazard identification of lng regasification facilities considering lng specific scenarios based on the systematization of data from past events and studies they prioritized severity of atypical accident scenarios such as terrorist attack asphyxiation bleve boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion etc aneziris et al 2014 presented an integrated risk assessment framework which follows the steps of hazard identification accident sequence modelling and quantification consequence assessment and integration of results they performed a risk assessment of onshore and offshore lng terminals with the framework however the framework follows basic risk assessment steps which have been adopted in many other studies licari and weimer 2011 explained risk based approach in lng terminal siting and discussed the different perspectives of regulatory and approval processes between u s and europe d alessandro et al d alessandro et al 2016 applied quantitative risk assessment qra techniques to complement the social and environmental evaluation for decision making of an onshore lng regasification plant siting martins et al 2016 presented a qra of hazardous events especially during the loading and unloading of lng between a typical lng carrier and an offshore terminal dan et al 2014 conducted a quantitative assessment of the risk of fire and explosion in the lng liquefaction process of an lng fpso yang et al 2018 analysed fire scenarios caused by ignition sources located in different places on an lng fpso they performed cfd computational fluid dynamics simulations to analyse the impact of fire however they did not consider the transition from fire to explosion jeong et al 2018 assessed the safety of a medium sized fru floating regasification unit using their in house software and compared the results against the results from conventional qualitative risk assessment such as hazop many of previous studies on floating lng facilities have focused on solving operational problems such as loading unloading and bog generation although some papers have addressed risk assessment they have been limited to topics such as hazard identification risk prioritization and terminal siting there have been several qras but the targets were lng fpsos a small fru and onshore terminals there has not yet been a study of fire and explosion risk assessment for regasification process of an lng fsru as far as the author knows in this study following a process simulation to find the operational conditions a quantitative risk assessment was performed with combinations of frequencies and consequences of fire and explosion owing to lng leakage the results of risk assessment are presented against acceptance criteria the systematic methods and risk results presented in this study can be applied to quantifying fire and explosion risks when designing new lng fsrus and other lng facilities 2 system 2 1 fsru an lng fsru stores lng in containment tanks after loading from lng carriers the stored lng is supplied to onshore after being converted into ng through regasification process lee and choi 2016 the lng fsru analysed in this study has a rectangular shape of 300 m loa length over all and 40 m breadth the lng fsru is floating in a turret mooring manner side by side loading is adopted when lng is transferred from lng carriers the gas processing capability of the lng fsru is 3 bscmpa billion standard cubic meter per annum with 5 containment tanks of which the volume is 25 000 m3 each the number of average working personnel on board is 40 it was assumed that these workers were evenly distributed throughout the lng fsru 2 2 regasification process the regasification process of lng vaporization is shown in fig 1 lng 1 stored in containment tanks are pressurized by the cryogenic pump p 100 the pressurized lng 2 experiences the first heat up by absorbing heat from sea water through lng 100 heat exchanger the heated lng 3 is converted into the gaseous state after the second heat up through lng 101 heat exchanger the converted gas ng out is connected into pipelines for consumer supply seawater was used as lng heating medium and it is supplied after being pressurized by seawater pump p 102 lng 1 is supplied with the temperature and pressure of 163 c 1 bar while the ng out is produced with the conditions of 0 c 40 bar the temperature and pressure of seawater supply are 15 c 1 bar and the used seawater is discharged at 5 c 5 bar the compositions of lng used in this study is presented in table 1 imo 2009 lee 2017 the commercial software hysys developed by aspen technology was used for process simulation aspen technology peng robinson eos equation of state is applied for process modelling and thermodynamic analysis as it is known to relatively accurately predict the thermodynamic properties of various hydrocarbons including lng peng and robinson 1976 dauber and span 2008 table 2 presents the process parameters of each state resulted from the process simulation 3 risk analysis the objective of this study is to analyse the fire and explosion risk which have been specified in the previous qualitative risk assessment such as hazid for this purpose leak frequency ignition probability and the consequences such as radiation and overpressure were estimated the risk were presented by the combination of these the workflow presented in fig 2 shows the overall analysis procedure 3 1 leak frequency estimation the regasification process has a probability that equipment and piping may experience a leak the commercial program leak was used to calculate a possible leak frequency dnvgl 2011 leak hole sizes were divided into four categories and the results of leak frequency calculations are shown in table 3 along with the corresponding ranges 3 2 representative hole size to obtain the hole size used for consequence analysis eq 1 was used to obtain the representative hole size for each category dnvgl 2011 lee et al 2015 the leak calculation constant m has various values for different equipment but in consideration of the system structures of regasification process an average value of 0 8 may be applied dnvgl 2011 spouge 2005 1 d rep m m 2 d to m 2 d from m 2 d to m d from m 1 2 to check the preliminary risk leak frequencies and representative hole sizes are presented together in fig 3 the leak frequency showed a tendency to decrease while the hole size increased while categories a and b have high leak frequencies and small hole sizes categories c and d are vice versa 3 3 ignition probability there have been several different models developed for the ignition probability of a leak in chemical processes small plant gas lpg scenario from risk assessment data directory developed by ogp international association of oil gas producers was applied international association of oil and gas producers 2010 the scenario can be used for releases of flammable gases vapour or liquids significantly above their normal boiling point from small onshore plants plant area up to 1200 m2 site area up to 35 000 m2 further discussions regarding the application of ignition probability were provided in section 4 4 the probabilities obtained are for the ignition accounting only for the release rate so a value of 0 2 and 0 8 were multiplied for immediate ignition and delayed ignition respectively to estimate the frequencies of the jet fire and explosion risk lee et al 2015 rew et al 1997 pesce et al 2012 zhu et al 2012 the representative hole size and ignition probability for each category is listed in table 4 the probability of confined area is required for estimation of explosion consequence however exact determination of this value is difficult and controversial instead a set of probabilities of 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 for a confined area was applied and compared dan et al 2014 two cases of leak directions as horizontal and vertical are considered the probabilities of leak direction for both cases were applied to be 0 5 the total frequency of an end event case can be estimated as eq 2 2 f t f l x p ign x p id x p c x p dir 3 4 consequence estimation average wind speed over a year of the candidate location of the lng fsru installation is about 3 m s the d class is applied as pasquill stability of the atmosphere the directions of wind may vary depending on the site condition however wind directions may be disregarded considering the weather vanning effect for the turret moored lng fsru regasification process systems are assumed to be located in the central ron of the lng fsru the lethality was applied for the estimation of consequence severity the radiation intensity was used for consequence estimation of jet fire incidents while the overpressure was used for explosion incidents for jet fires with radiation intensities of 37 5 and 12 5 kw m2 100 and 50 lethality were applied respectively for explosions with overpressures of 1 0 3 and 0 1 bar lethality values of 100 50 and 10 were adopted center for chemical process safety 1999 the results of consequence can be presented as number of fatalities which can be calculated with eq 3 3 n f n p x p l x a c a f an event tree of consequential scenarios was generated considering plausible subsequent events after an initial leak event the event tree is shown in fig 4 there are jet fire and pool fire for immediate ignition branch in the event tree however considering that lng is in high pressure it would be reasonable to analyse the case with jet fire in this study and in fact no pool fire was found in consequence simulations the radiation and overpressure were obtained in order to find the consequence for each branch s end event in the event tree the estimation was done by using a consequence simulation software phast dnvgl 2010 the methods used for the consequence estimation of explosion and jet fire are tnt and cone model respectively the phast software has a limitation that it does not take into account the effects of surrounding structures nevertheless this analysis can be considered meaningful from two perspectives first fsru is not a complex process plant such as an lng fpso but rather it is a simple regasification process the topside deck of the fsru is very wide compared to the size of the process so open space is a reasonable assumption second performing precise cfd analyses in consideration of surrounding structures requires a great deal of time and expense it is meaningful to be able to save time and money but also to estimate risk of the project in more conservative way 4 results and discussion 4 1 fire risk the risk results of the simulated jet fire scenarios are presented in table 5 jet fires of horizontal leak direction showed higher risks in general than vertical leak direction there was no radiation intensity of 37 5 kw m2 for vertical leak direction which is due to the fact that the leak direction is upward and the effect of radiation is not so severe the highest jet fire risk was shown in the case of horizontal leak direction with leak category d resulted in 3 76e 04 yr fatality the pll potential loss of life is 6 70e 04 yr and ir individual risk is 1 68e 05 yr for jet fire risk 4 2 fire safety distance in order to determine the correlation between the distance and the frequency of the flame length of each jet fire event an f l curve is presented in fig 5 f on y axis means the accumulated frequency of accidents involving l or longer flame length on x axis the shortest is 4 76 m for the case of vertical direction leak a category while the longest is 189 53 m for the case of horizontal d from the shortest to the longest the f l curve lies far below 1 0e 4 in this case finding a safety distance is meaningless because the frequency is very low for all distances anyway it shows that the safety distance for the jet fire flame from the leak point at the most conservative is about 4 76 m of which the f is 6 5e 5 yr this means that if a person structure or equipment is at least more than 4 76 m away from the leak point the frequency of jet fire flame reaching will be lower than 6 5e 5 yr which is a very low frequency the greater the distance the lower the frequency 4 3 explosion risk although the jet fire results of two leak directions showed different patterns explosion risk results showed a similar trend for horizontal and vertical leak directions overall this is because jet fires with immediate ignition are more affected by leak direction while the explosions which have delayed ignition are more influenced by wind and dispersion effect than the leak direction risk results of the simulated explosion scenarios are presented in the table 6 for the case when the probability of confinement is 0 5 the cases of horizontal a vertical a and b did not show explosion risk this is because the amount of leakages for these cases were insufficient to form vapour clouds the highest risk of explosion was the case of vertical d category showing a fatality of 2 08e 04 yr it was found that explosion risk is higher than jet fire risk as pll and ir by explosion were 6 96e 04 yr and 1 74e 05 yr respectively 4 4 risk presentation the acceptance criteria for ir in this study was suggested to have 1 0e 04 to 1 0e 06 yr as the range of the alarp as low as reasonably practicable ron hse 2001 the total plls incorporating jet fire and explosion risk are 1 09e 03 1 37e 03 and 1 64e 03 for different p c of 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively corresponding irs are 2 72e 05 3 41e 05 and 4 11e 05 all of which are in the alarp ron pll and ir values are presented in table 7 ir results are shown in fig 6 for the case of probability of confinement is 0 5 the first character h or v on the x axis label of the figure means leak directions of horizontal or vertical and the second character a b c or d means leak hole size categories in order to find out the group risk of the lng fsru f n curves for different p c were created and shown in fig 7 f on y axis means the accumulated frequency of accidents involving n or more fatalities on x axis it was confirmed that the group risk of the lng fsru is also in the alarp ron regarding ignition probability there are also scenarios for offshore processes in ogp data directory however these are not appropriate for an fsru as they correspond to gas production plants which include separation compression condensate handling etc and the risk will be even lower when offshore gas process data are adopted since the ignition probabilities of these scenarios are less than those of the scenario applied in this paper in terms of the maximum probability of ignition the values in the ogp offshore process scenarios do not exceed 0 1 and one of the well known ignition models cox model does not exceed 0 3 cox et al 1990 however these limits are not placed in this study for consistent application of the selected scenario as a result the current analysis takes a conservative approach and if these maximums are applied the risk will be lower 5 conclusion in this study a risk assessment of fire and explosion for a regasification process in an lng fsru was conducted the regasification process was designed and the process simulation was performed considering the required gas processing capability to obtain the thermodynamic state and condition of the process by applying these operating conditions the leak frequencies representative hole sizes and ignition probabilities for four hole size categories were estimated an event tree of consequential scenarios was generated in accordance with subsequent events after an initial leak event consequence modelling was conducted for the estimation of risk of each end event scenario horizontal and vertical directions of leak were applied and the weather condition of the candidate site was considered the final risk consequences were obtained as fatalities by applying lethality values in jet fire the risk of horizontal leak direction was higher than vertical leak direction while explosion risk was similar in both directions for jet fire an f l curve is presented to find the probabilistic safety distance for flame lengths which showed very low frequencies for all distances the individual risk of fire and explosion was found to be from 2 72 to 4 11e 05 which is in alarp ron compared to the acceptance criteria f n curves for fatality showed that the group risk is also in alarp ron although the risk is in alarp ron a future study that proposes risk control options to further reduce risk and perform cost benefit analysis will be meaningful as the energy consumption is increasing worldwide lng is attracting attention as a decent alternative given its availability and low environmental impact compared to other fuels there is an increasing interest in the design of floating lng regasification facilities in order to prepare for additional energy demand despite variety in earlier studies on floating lng facilities many of them have focused on operational problems or limited risk assessment the method and results

is on the rise with a forecasted 28 increase by 2040 u s energy information agency 2017 although much effort is being made to develop renewable energy and nuclear power generation is possible most of this energy use is expected to be dominated by petroleum and natural gas u s energy information agency 2017 among the various methods for power generation the use of lng is considered to be more environmentally friendly than coal fired or nuclear power generation mazyan et al 2016 in order to prepare for additional energy demand there is an increasing interest in the design of floating lng regasification facilities the volume of lng becomes about 1 600 of the volume in its gaseous state providing ease of storage kumar et al 2011 despite such efficiency an unwanted event such as lng leakage may result in life property and environment damages due to low temperature exposure asphyxiation fire or explosions etc there have been several studies on floating lng facilities such as lng fsru floating storage and regasification unit and lng fpso floating production storage and operation some of them are focused on the operational problems such as loading unloading and regasification of lng zellouf and portannier 2011 suggested an lng storage process and investigated the production of boil off gas bog during lng s unloading and storage operations for an lng fsru li and li 2016 analysed the factors affecting the bog generation in the lng receiving terminal they conducted optimization for the improvement against bog fluctuations by applying dynamic simulation kurle et al 2017 analysed the lng vessel loading process to obtain bog generation profiles in consideration of the effect of various parameters with respect to loading time effendy et al 2017 presented a dynamic modelling for an lng storage tank in a regasification terminal incorporating lng recirculation for cooling the transfer lines in loading and unloading some other studies performed researches about hazard identification and risk assessment of floating lng facilities paltrinieri et al 2015 conducted hazard identification of lng regasification facilities considering lng specific scenarios based on the systematization of data from past events and studies they prioritized severity of atypical accident scenarios such as terrorist attack asphyxiation bleve boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion etc aneziris et al 2014 presented an integrated risk assessment framework which follows the steps of hazard identification accident sequence modelling and quantification consequence assessment and integration of results they performed a risk assessment of onshore and offshore lng terminals with the framework however the framework follows basic risk assessment steps which have been adopted in many other studies licari and weimer 2011 explained risk based approach in lng terminal siting and discussed the different perspectives of regulatory and approval processes between u s and europe d alessandro et al d alessandro et al 2016 applied quantitative risk assessment qra techniques to complement the social and environmental evaluation for decision making of an onshore lng regasification plant siting martins et al 2016 presented a qra of hazardous events especially during the loading and unloading of lng between a typical lng carrier and an offshore terminal dan et al 2014 conducted a quantitative assessment of the risk of fire and explosion in the lng liquefaction process of an lng fpso yang et al 2018 analysed fire scenarios caused by ignition sources located in different places on an lng fpso they performed cfd computational fluid dynamics simulations to analyse the impact of fire however they did not consider the transition from fire to explosion jeong et al 2018 assessed the safety of a medium sized fru floating regasification unit using their in house software and compared the results against the results from conventional qualitative risk assessment such as hazop many of previous studies on floating lng facilities have focused on solving operational problems such as loading unloading and bog generation although some papers have addressed risk assessment they have been limited to topics such as hazard identification risk prioritization and terminal siting there have been several qras but the targets were lng fpsos a small fru and onshore terminals there has not yet been a study of fire and explosion risk assessment for regasification process of an lng fsru as far as the author knows in this study following a process simulation to find the operational conditions a quantitative risk assessment was performed with combinations of frequencies and consequences of fire and explosion owing to lng leakage the results of risk assessment are presented against acceptance criteria the systematic methods and risk results presented in this study can be applied to quantifying fire and explosion risks when designing new lng fsrus and other lng facilities 2 system 2 1 fsru an lng fsru stores lng in containment tanks after loading from lng carriers the stored lng is supplied to onshore after being converted into ng through regasification process lee and choi 2016 the lng fsru analysed in this study has a rectangular shape of 300 m loa length over all and 40 m breadth the lng fsru is floating in a turret mooring manner side by side loading is adopted when lng is transferred from lng carriers the gas processing capability of the lng fsru is 3 bscmpa billion standard cubic meter per annum with 5 containment tanks of which the volume is 25 000 m3 each the number of average working personnel on board is 40 it was assumed that these workers were evenly distributed throughout the lng fsru 2 2 regasification process the regasification process of lng vaporization is shown in fig 1 lng 1 stored in containment tanks are pressurized by the cryogenic pump p 100 the pressurized lng 2 experiences the first heat up by absorbing heat from sea water through lng 100 heat exchanger the heated lng 3 is converted into the gaseous state after the second heat up through lng 101 heat exchanger the converted gas ng out is connected into pipelines for consumer supply seawater was used as lng heating medium and it is supplied after being pressurized by seawater pump p 102 lng 1 is supplied with the temperature and pressure of 163 c 1 bar while the ng out is produced with the conditions of 0 c 40 bar the temperature and pressure of seawater supply are 15 c 1 bar and the used seawater is discharged at 5 c 5 bar the compositions of lng used in this study is presented in table 1 imo 2009 lee 2017 the commercial software hysys developed by aspen technology was used for process simulation aspen technology peng robinson eos equation of state is applied for process modelling and thermodynamic analysis as it is known to relatively accurately predict the thermodynamic properties of various hydrocarbons including lng peng and robinson 1976 dauber and span 2008 table 2 presents the process parameters of each state resulted from the process simulation 3 risk analysis the objective of this study is to analyse the fire and explosion risk which have been specified in the previous qualitative risk assessment such as hazid for this purpose leak frequency ignition probability and the consequences such as radiation and overpressure were estimated the risk were presented by the combination of these the workflow presented in fig 2 shows the overall analysis procedure 3 1 leak frequency estimation the regasification process has a probability that equipment and piping may experience a leak the commercial program leak was used to calculate a possible leak frequency dnvgl 2011 leak hole sizes were divided into four categories and the results of leak frequency calculations are shown in table 3 along with the corresponding ranges 3 2 representative hole size to obtain the hole size used for consequence analysis eq 1 was used to obtain the representative hole size for each category dnvgl 2011 lee et al 2015 the leak calculation constant m has various values for different equipment but in consideration of the system structures of regasification process an average value of 0 8 may be applied dnvgl 2011 spouge 2005 1 d rep m m 2 d to m 2 d from m 2 d to m d from m 1 2 to check the preliminary risk leak frequencies and representative hole sizes are presented together in fig 3 the leak frequency showed a tendency to decrease while the hole size increased while categories a and b have high leak frequencies and small hole sizes categories c and d are vice versa 3 3 ignition probability there have been several different models developed for the ignition probability of a leak in chemical processes small plant gas lpg scenario from risk assessment data directory developed by ogp international association of oil gas producers was applied international association of oil and gas producers 2010 the scenario can be used for releases of flammable gases vapour or liquids significantly above their normal boiling point from small onshore plants plant area up to 1200 m2 site area up to 35 000 m2 further discussions regarding the application of ignition probability were provided in section 4 4 the probabilities obtained are for the ignition accounting only for the release rate so a value of 0 2 and 0 8 were multiplied for immediate ignition and delayed ignition respectively to estimate the frequencies of the jet fire and explosion risk lee et al 2015 rew et al 1997 pesce et al 2012 zhu et al 2012 the representative hole size and ignition probability for each category is listed in table 4 the probability of confined area is required for estimation of explosion consequence however exact determination of this value is difficult and controversial instead a set of probabilities of 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 for a confined area was applied and compared dan et al 2014 two cases of leak directions as horizontal and vertical are considered the probabilities of leak direction for both cases were applied to be 0 5 the total frequency of an end event case can be estimated as eq 2 2 f t f l x p ign x p id x p c x p dir 3 4 consequence estimation average wind speed over a year of the candidate location of the lng fsru installation is about 3 m s the d class is applied as pasquill stability of the atmosphere the directions of wind may vary depending on the site condition however wind directions may be disregarded considering the weather vanning effect for the turret moored lng fsru regasification process systems are assumed to be located in the central ron of the lng fsru the lethality was applied for the estimation of consequence severity the radiation intensity was used for consequence estimation of jet fire incidents while the overpressure was used for explosion incidents for jet fires with radiation intensities of 37 5 and 12 5 kw m2 100 and 50 lethality were applied respectively for explosions with overpressures of 1 0 3 and 0 1 bar lethality values of 100 50 and 10 were adopted center for chemical process safety 1999 the results of consequence can be presented as number of fatalities which can be calculated with eq 3 3 n f n p x p l x a c a f an event tree of consequential scenarios was generated considering plausible subsequent events after an initial leak event the event tree is shown in fig 4 there are jet fire and pool fire for immediate ignition branch in the event tree however considering that lng is in high pressure it would be reasonable to analyse the case with jet fire in this study and in fact no pool fire was found in consequence simulations the radiation and overpressure were obtained in order to find the consequence for each branch s end event in the event tree the estimation was done by using a consequence simulation software phast dnvgl 2010 the methods used for the consequence estimation of explosion and jet fire are tnt and cone model respectively the phast software has a limitation that it does not take into account the effects of surrounding structures nevertheless this analysis can be considered meaningful from two perspectives first fsru is not a complex process plant such as an lng fpso but rather it is a simple regasification process the topside deck of the fsru is very wide compared to the size of the process so open space is a reasonable assumption second performing precise cfd analyses in consideration of surrounding structures requires a great deal of time and expense it is meaningful to be able to save time and money but also to estimate risk of the project in more conservative way 4 results and discussion 4 1 fire risk the risk results of the simulated jet fire scenarios are presented in table 5 jet fires of horizontal leak direction showed higher risks in general than vertical leak direction there was no radiation intensity of 37 5 kw m2 for vertical leak direction which is due to the fact that the leak direction is upward and the effect of radiation is not so severe the highest jet fire risk was shown in the case of horizontal leak direction with leak category d resulted in 3 76e 04 yr fatality the pll potential loss of life is 6 70e 04 yr and ir individual risk is 1 68e 05 yr for jet fire risk 4 2 fire safety distance in order to determine the correlation between the distance and the frequency of the flame length of each jet fire event an f l curve is presented in fig 5 f on y axis means the accumulated frequency of accidents involving l or longer flame length on x axis the shortest is 4 76 m for the case of vertical direction leak a category while the longest is 189 53 m for the case of horizontal d from the shortest to the longest the f l curve lies far below 1 0e 4 in this case finding a safety distance is meaningless because the frequency is very low for all distances anyway it shows that the safety distance for the jet fire flame from the leak point at the most conservative is about 4 76 m of which the f is 6 5e 5 yr this means that if a person structure or equipment is at least more than 4 76 m away from the leak point the frequency of jet fire flame reaching will be lower than 6 5e 5 yr which is a very low frequency the greater the distance the lower the frequency 4 3 explosion risk although the jet fire results of two leak directions showed different patterns explosion risk results showed a similar trend for horizontal and vertical leak directions overall this is because jet fires with immediate ignition are more affected by leak direction while the explosions which have delayed ignition are more influenced by wind and dispersion effect than the leak direction risk results of the simulated explosion scenarios are presented in the table 6 for the case when the probability of confinement is 0 5 the cases of horizontal a vertical a and b did not show explosion risk this is because the amount of leakages for these cases were insufficient to form vapour clouds the highest risk of explosion was the case of vertical d category showing a fatality of 2 08e 04 yr it was found that explosion risk is higher than jet fire risk as pll and ir by explosion were 6 96e 04 yr and 1 74e 05 yr respectively 4 4 risk presentation the acceptance criteria for ir in this study was suggested to have 1 0e 04 to 1 0e 06 yr as the range of the alarp as low as reasonably practicable ron hse 2001 the total plls incorporating jet fire and explosion risk are 1 09e 03 1 37e 03 and 1 64e 03 for different p c of 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively corresponding irs are 2 72e 05 3 41e 05 and 4 11e 05 all of which are in the alarp ron pll and ir values are presented in table 7 ir results are shown in fig 6 for the case of probability of

order to find out the group risk of the lng fsru f n curves for different p c were created and shown in fig 7 f on y axis means the accumulated frequency of accidents involving n or more fatalities on x axis it was confirmed that the group risk of the lng fsru is also in the alarp ron regarding ignition probability there are also scenarios for offshore processes in ogp data directory however these are not appropriate for an fsru as they correspond to gas production plants which include separation compression condensate handling etc and the risk will be even lower when offshore gas process data are adopted since the ignition probabilities of these scenarios are less than those of the scenario applied in this paper in terms of the maximum probability of ignition the values in the ogp offshore process scenarios do not exceed 0 1 and one of the well known ignition models cox model does not exceed 0 3 cox et al 1990 however these limits are not placed in this study for consistent application of the selected scenario as a result the current analysis takes a conservative approach and if these maximums are applied the risk will be lower 5 conclusion in this study a risk assessment of fire and explosion for a regasification process in an lng fsru was conducted the regasification process was designed and the process simulation was performed considering the required gas processing

22124,marine surveying does not receive full benefits from rtk because there are lack of near reference stations along the coastal lines compared with rtk ppp can realize positioning with just a single station which can allow a wider operation range in marine applications but its elevation positioning accuracy is significantly lower than the horizontal direction for some ships with relatively static offshore operations the vertical movement of ships is mainly affected by the tide and the fluctuation of tide can be obtained by global tide models etc therefore we propose a gps ppp method with a sea surface geodetic height constraint to make full use of sea tide motion information to improve ppp effect in this paper we establish the sea surface height constraint ppp shc ppp model it is noted that the gps height is relative to wgs 84 reference ellipsoid thus we convert the tide fluctuation information to the sea surface height relative to wgs 84 reference ellipsoid by adding a fixed value which is the geodetic height of gps receiver at the first epoch obtained in advance by using the post positioning ppp minus the corresponding epoch s water level data predicted by fes2014 validated by kinematic experiments our shc ppp method can improve the vertical positioning accuracy over conventional ppp pppc by 79 keywords sea surface geodetic height global positioning system gps precise point positioning ppp sea surface height constrained ppp shc ppp 1 introduction thanks to the development of positioning technology in particular global positioning system gps applications related to marine surveying such as seabed topography and geomorphology water depth analysis and exploration of marine resources gain substantial acceptance through precise measurement offered by the positioning technology mao and zhang 1993 common gps positioning method on the sea include real time kinematic rtk carrier phase differential positioning zhang et al 2019 and precise point positioning ppp li et al 2009 liang et al 2017 zhai and huang 2017 since the rtk method needs a reference station to help determine and correct positioning errors the use of rtk method is not appropriate for marine environment where there are few reference stations in the area especially in the open sea the ppp method can realize positioning and has an unlimited operation range without the use of reference stations for marine environment the ppp method is a better choice than the rtk method wang and fei 2017 in marine environment the current ppp method offers acceptable positioning accuracy along the horizontal direction however the positioning accuracy along the vertical direction is still poor for ships or vessels with relatively static offshore operations their positions along the vertical direction should be affected by the height of the tide pitch roll wind etc in general the height of tide significantly contributes to the height of the ships since there are established and mature techniques in determining the height of tide we could integrate this information to the current ppp method in order to reduce positioning error along the vertical direction in this paper we show that we could apply the predicted tide information based on the conventional finite element solution tide model fes2014 carrere et al 2016 to the ppp method in order to help improve the positioning accuracy along the vertical direction we validated our proposed method with simulation and actual experiments and found that the positioning accuracy along the vertical direction improved significantly 2 background in the open marine environment ppp method without any assistance from reference stations is a good choice for positioning technology because reference stations cannot easily be placed in the open sea for economic and technical reasons modern marine applications require better positioning accuracy in the marine environment than what conventional ppp can offer several studies tried to apply concepts of dgps rtk and ppp method in marine environment and found that the ppp method is the more appropriate method of positioning landau et al 2009 positioning using the ppp approach on land environment is quite mature and researchers have been trying to improve its positioning performance using various approaches and additional information gao et al 2015 phatak et al 2002 phatak et al 2002 proposed a direct solution method for positioning with three gps satellites and applied the kalman filter kf method with elevation constraint and found that the convergence time for stable and accurate position was greatly shortened guo et al 2015 put forward a constraint ppp method with the consideration of the speed and path of moving vehicles and found that the constraint ppp method could improve the accuracy significantly compared to the conventional ppp method especially in harsh environment with few observable satellites or large geometric dilution of precision gdop value the results of these works suggest that additional observational data can help improve the positioning accuracy of the ppp method several studies found that the error in the vertical direction is approximately twice of the error in the horizontal direction gao et al 2006 desanto et al 2019 yang et al 2017 2019 and tide fluctuation information also called water level fluctuation information could be used to help improve the accuracy of vertical positioning in the marine environment since the vertical position elevation of ships with relative static offshore operations mainly depended on the tide height at present tide fluctuation information with certain accuracy can be obtained through the observation of satellite altimetry dropping automatic tide gauge and tide level observation stations bao and xu 2016 feng et al 2016 wang et al 2018 yan 2013 there are several models of tide levels such as nao99b fes2014 tpxo7 2 got4 7 and eot10a which can be used to predict real world water level in different geographical areas zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 at incredible accuracy the fes2014 tide model in particular offers tide prediction with less than 20 cm accuracy along the shore and in the middle of the sea carrere et al 2016 3 methods 3 1 concept since the tide fluctuation information is one of the main contributors to ship movement in elevation direction the vertical positioning of a ship can be calculated based on the measured tide fluctuation and tide model and the measured gps positioning using the ppp method we proposed an improved vertical positioning method over a gps based ppp method called sea surface height constraint ppp shc ppp method by taking the tide fluctuation information into account the sea surface height data obtained from the tide fluctuation information would be used as a constraint to limit the error which could be caused by the conventional gps based ppp pppc method which does not take the tide fluctuation data into account the tide fluctuation information is obtained from tide stations and fes2014 model which is widely accepted as an accurate tide model since the data from the fes2014 model is relative to the local mean sea level frame not based on wgs 84 frame the data from the fes2014 model must be converted to the wgs 84 frame in order to validate our positioning method using the tide fluctuation information we carry out simulation and actual kinematic experiments the validation is simplified by taking only the position of gps phase center which neglects the influences caused by the ship s posture variation 3 2 pppc model equation 1 describes the pppc model that we use as a benchmark to our proposed method the pppc model zumberge et al 1997 is based on the extended kalman filter ekf gelb 1974 as follows

height constraint ppp model 3 3 1 height constraint method in order to improve the vertical accuracy of the conventional ppp pppc model the tide fluctuation information is obtained from tide stations and fes2014 the information has to be converted into the wgs 84 frame whose point coordinates x y z are described as follows 7 x 2 a 2 y 2 a 2 z 2 b 2 1 where a and b represent the long and short semi axes of the wgs 84 reference ellipsoid respectively phatak et al 2002 let the vertical height of the receiver on a ship with respect to the reference ellipsoid in the wgs 84 frame be h since h is much smaller than a and b we have landau et al 2009 8 x r 2 a h 2 y r 2 a h 2 z r 2 b h 2 1 in order to determine h we can find the partial derivatives of h with respect to receiver coordinates x r y r z r

and pppc shc ppp and n represents the total epochs used in solving rms 5 tide fluctuation information collection the tide fluctuation information is obtained from the tide station and fes2014 using the following methods 5 1 tide station method the tide fluctuation information provides sea surface geodetic height data according to the principle shown in fig 1 which can be calculated and equation 19 as follows li et al 2011 19 h s s g h h m s l h w l v where h s s g h represents the sea surface geodetic height h m s l represents the distance between local mean sea level and the wgs 84 reference ellipsoid surface h w l represents the sea surface height relative to the local mean sea level which can be obtained via the observation at the tide station and v represents the observation error we collect the tide fluctuation information as h w l using the sca11 3 float type water level gauge at the tide station shown in fig 2 the water level gauge developed by tianjin hydrowise technology development center under the china national marine technology center can collect data related to water level sea surface temperature and salinity wind speed and direction the data are stored according to the coastal observation data standard gb t 14914 2006 the water level is sampled every 1 min and has 1 mm s resolution sca11 3 float type water level gauge has an average fault free working time of more than 5000 h and average fault recovery time of less than 0 5 h allowing it to be effective in distinguishing the high tide from low tide the main technical specifications of sca11 3 float type water level gauge in table 1 our simulation experiment uses tide station method to obtain the observation data which are used as the shc ppp model constraint the observation data from the tide station method are the sea surface geodetic height converted into the gps geodetic height data fig 1 according to equation 20 20 h g h s s g h h p where h g represents the geodetic height of gps antenna h s s g h represents the sea surface geodetic height and h p represents the height of the gps antenna phase center distance from the sea surface 5 2 fes2014 method the fes2014 model is the latest version of the finite element solution fes ocean tidal model developed by the french tidal group carrere et al 2016 lyard et al 2016 this model combines the t p jason 1 jason 2 jason ers 1 ers 2 and envisat satellite altimeter data the model can provide 34 constituents consisting of 2n2 eps2 j1 k1 k2 l2 la2 m2 m3 m4 m6 m8 mf mks2 mm mn4 ms4 msf msqm mtm mu2 n2 n4 interchange nu2 o1 p1 q1 r2 s1 s2 s4 sa ssa t2 of the tide and trend information the resolution of the model results is 1 16 we use fes2014 to predict the fluctuation of the water level at gps observation points in actual experiment the predicted water level is denoted by h w l in equation 19 the method to gain the height constraint data is as follows firstly the observation data is solved by the trip software and the solution results with the accuracy about 5 cm are obtained li et al 2016 since the data obtained from gps observations are in wgs 84 frame and the data obtained from the prediction of water level are in the local mean sea level frame carrere et al 2016 the predicted water level fluctuation data must be converted to geodetic height data relative to wgs 84 frame similar to the simulation experiments we set h p in formula 20 is zero then the geodetic height of antenna phase center h g is equal to the geodetic height of sea surface h s s g h according to fig 3 we can find that the geodetic height of sea surface h s s g h is equal to the sum of the predicted water level h p r e the geodetic height of local mean sea level h m w and the error h o t h e r caused by other factors like wind wave barometric pressure and so on according to equation 21 therefore in order to acquire the value of h s s g h we need to know the distance h m w between the mean sea level and the wgs 84 reference ellipsoid 21 h g h s s g h h m w h p r e h o t h e r according to equation 21 we can gain h m w by formula 22 22 h m w h g h p r e h o t h e r since the value of h o t h e r in equation 22 is unknown the first epoch result of trip recorded as h t 1 and the corresponding epoch of water level data recorded as h p r e 1 predicted by fes2014 can be used to obtain the geodetic height of local mean sea level h m w 1 given a corresponding epoch error h o t h e r 1 according to equation 23 23 h m w 1 h m w h o t h e r 1 h t 1 h p r e 1 we assume that the sea is calm and the wind is weak while the ship is working and in order to facilitate the analysis of shc ppp s effectiveness we suppose h o t h e r is the same throughout our operation we choose h o t h e r 1 to represent the value of h o t h e r the geodetic height of sea surface at the ith epoch can be used as a constraint which is recorded as h c o n s i can be calculated by equation 24 24 h c o n s i h m w 1 h p r e i where i 1 2 n and n represents the total number of epochs participated in the experiment and the following is the same in order to gain the constraint data error h e r r o r i we use the generated geodetic height of sea surface h c o n s i minus the reference h r i which can be seen in equation 25 25 h e r r o r i h c o n s i h r i h t 1 h r 1 i 1 h m w h o t h e r 1 h p r e i h r i i 2 h t 1 h p r e 1 h p r e i h r i i 2 where h r i refers to ith epoch s solution of rtk according to equation 25 we find that h e r r o r i represents the difference between rtk s height solution and height constraint data at the ith epoch it can also be regarded as the water level error caused by the wind wave and barometric pressure fes2014 model error and system error caused by trip software and our own procedure and so on 6 experiments and results in order to verify the feasibility of the above proposed solution method we carried out the simulation experiment and the actual experiment as mentioned in introduction the position information obtained from the simulation experiment and the actual experiment in this paper referred to the position information of gps phase center we analyzed the positions of antenna phase center as follows 6 1 simulation experiment in the simulation experiment the tide station data were actually obtained from a water level gauge in the west port of yantai shandong province china the water level gauge sampled the water level every minute see section 5 1 the gps data used were one day observation data of jfng station provided by the international gnss service igs the jfng station sampled the water level data at the rate of 1 30 hz or once every 30 s equivalent to 2880 epochs a day we needed to ensure that each epoch has a corresponding elevation constraint value in order to realize shc ppp the existing water level data need to be preprocessed we interpolated the observed water level data at an interval of 30 s using the cubic spline interpolation method in order to ensure the smooth overall trend sim et al 2019 for our simulation experiment we set the value of h p in equation 20 to zero so that the sea surface geodetic height was equal to the geodetic height of gps antenna we designated the simulated geodetic height of the local mean sea level h m s l in equation 19 to be the difference between the actual geodetic height of jfng station provided by igs which is 71 324 m and the interpolated water level at the first epoch the geodetic height constraint data of the total of 2880 ephemera samples in a day can be obtained by adding the water level data and the simulated h m s l together the observation error of water level measurement could be viewed as the difference between the geodetic height constraint data and the actual geodetic height of the jfng station provided by the igs in most cases the errors were found to be less than 10 cm fig 4 thus we could set v a r h j 0 01 m 2 our simulation experiment used the static observation of jfng station obtained from the actual coordinates of jfng station provided by the igs as our reference in order to support the validation analysis of our simulation method by comparing the positioning results between pppc and shc ppp the pppc and shc ppp methods were used to calculate the kinematic ppp of jfng observation data and the calculated results were compared with the reference 3d coordinates x 2279828 8292m y 5004706 5483 m z 3219777 4684m of the jfng station provided by the igs the experimental results in the north n east e and up u directions are shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows that there is no significant difference calculated using the pppc and shc ppp methods in east and north direction but there is a significant difference in the u direction when comparing to the pppc method the shc ppp method can significantly improve the positioning accuracy in the u direction the shc ppp method can also limit the fluctuation of the position in the u direction to a certain range at the very beginning fig 6 shows the first 100 epochs of the results shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 6 that the shc ppp method can effectively control the fluctuation in the u direction at the very beginning the improvement in the calculation accuracy in the u direction of shc ppp method is shown clearly in fig 7 which contains the calculation results from the 1800th to the 2160th epoch of fig 5 in the u direction there is a significant difference between the pppc and shc ppp methods compared to the pppc method the shc ppp method can reduce the rms error in the u direction by approximately 4 cm which can be translated to the accuracy improvement in the u direction of 57 according to table 2 we can conclude that the shc ppp method has no apparent effect in the e and n directions 6 2 actual kinematic experiment in the actual kinematic experiment we observed the water level data for 7 h on a survey vessel in calm sea surface which corresponds to the 0 1 level of sea conditions we collected the water level data with the sample frequency of 1 hz 1 record for every 1 s the ship s trajectory and working range are shown in fig 8 since the water level of the entire trajectory of the ship could not be acquired accurately we chose the starting and ending positions of the ships as point a 35 7630 n 120 2560 e and point b 35 8616 n 120 1688 e in fig 8 in order to analyze the spatial difference of the water level of the two positions the distance between point a and b was 13 49 km the water levels at point a and point b were predicted by using the fes2014 model with the time resolution of 1 s the predicted water level difference between point a and point b are shown in fig 9 we could see that the predicted water level difference between point a and point b were less than 6 cm which were considered to be very small thus we could consider that the water levels at point a and point b are the same we could then choose point a s predicted water level as the height constraint data for the experiment we setup a reference station near the working area on the shore and made sure that the working area was covered by the reference station the vessel s partial trajectory during our experiments is showed in fig 10 we then compared the positions obtained from the rtk method which are recorded as pppr against the pppc and shc ppp methods in order to determine the performance of our proposed shc ppp method fig 11 shows the errors we obtained from our actual experiments using the height constraint data mentioned in section 5 2 we can see that most of the errors are within 0 4 m the errors could be caused by other factors that may be overlooked in our models in this case we set v a r h j to be 0 2 m 2 similar to the simulation experiment we also used the pppc and shc ppp methods for the kinematic ppp calculation the result of the rtk method is used as a reference recorded as pppr in order to benchmark the performance of the pppc and shc ppp method we chose the coordinate of the vessel at first epoch of rtk method as the origin of the enu system the calculated height level differences between the water level calculated by the pppc and pppr c r methods and between shc ppp and pppr h r methods in enu coordinate system are plotted in fig 12 in red and blue color respectively according to fig 12 compared with the pppc method the shc ppp method could control the deviation fluctuation of the positioning results within a certain range at the beginning in the u direction in order to describe the performance difference between the pppc and shc ppp methods quantitatively we used equation 18 to calculate the rms error of c r and h r respectively using fig 12 we analyzed our data and found that it required 200 epochs to converge to within 20 cm in both the e and u directions so we took the solution results after the 200th epoch for the following analysis we recorded the solutions from the 200th epoch to the 10196th epoch as part a and the difference between pppr and pppc and between shc ppp of part a are showed in fig 13 also the rms error of part a are calculated in table 3 fig 13 shows the positioning performance of the shc ppp with pppc methods in different directions according to the figure the shc ppp method can limit the deviation of the solution within a relatively smooth range in u direction combine fig 13 and table 3 together we can see that compared with the pppc method shc ppp can reduce the rms errors by 30 cm in u direction in other words the positioning accuracy in the u direction was improved by 79 compared to the positioning accuracy obtained from the pppc method comprehensive analysis shows that compared with pppc method shc ppp method can improve the vertical positioning accuracy by 79 and improve the accuracy of three dimensional positioning by 67 we also found that the shc ppp method has no significant effect on the accuracy in the e and n directions 7 conclusion generally the positioning accuracy of the conventional ppp pppc method in vertical direction is lower than that in horizontal direction in order to improve the positioning accuracy in elevation direction we propose a gps based precise positioning method with sea surface geodetic height constraint shc ppp our proposed method takes the tide fluctuation information into account for improving the vertical positioning accuracy the shc ppp method can help provide support for modern applications that require high vertical accuracy such as deep sea control points measurement sun et al 2019 and underwater topography survey hatanaka et al 2005 in order to validate the effectiveness of the shc ppp method the simulation experiment and actual experiment were carried out the experimental data used in simulation experiment mainly consist of two parts one is the water level data of yantai west port collected by sca11 3 water level gauge and the other is the jfng station observation data provided by igs using these two datasets the sea surface geodetic data with an error of 10 cm were derived as constraint data in the simulation experiment the ppp kinematic positions were calculated by using the pppc and shc ppp methods we observed that our proposed shc ppp method can significantly improve the positioning accuracy in the vertical or u direction the rms error in the u direction is reduced from 7 cm to 3 cm 57 percent improvement in addition the shc ppp method can limit the deviation of the positioning in the u direction to a certain range at the very beginning of the experiment we performed the actual experiment using the fes2014 forecast data model and the observed gps positioning data in the sea the analysis of the experiment results showed that the shc ppp method clearly stabilized the positioning accuracy in the u direction since the first few epochs in other words the method could quickly limit the deviation of observed positions within a certain range at the time when the positioning errors in the e and n directions converge to less than 20 cm we analyzed the positioning accuracy in the u direction after the 200th epoch we recorded this part as part a by analyzing part a comprehensively we found that compared with the pppc method the shc ppp method can improve the vertical positioning accuracy by 79 and it can improve the accuracy of three dimensional positioning by 67 the simulation and actual experiment results showed that the shc ppp method can improve the accuracy in the vertical direction to some extent although the shc ppp provide no significant accuracy improvement in the horizontal directions in the perspective of elevation and three dimensional positioning the shc ppp method can significantly improve the positioning accuracy in order to validate the effectiveness of the shc ppp method we setup a hypothesis we supposed that the water level fluctuation caused by waves wind and other factors is the same during our experiments we used the positioning calculated at the first epoch of trip software to calculate the distance between local mean sea level and wgs 84 ellipsoid under this hypothesis we carried out our simulation and actual experiment in order to analyze the effectiveness of the shc ppp method conveniently we neglected some errors such as the influences caused by ship s posture speed etc this is based on the notion that the positioning data used in actual experiment were collected in a calm sea surface which referred to 0 1 level sea conditions theoretically this should not affect the validation of the feasibility of the shc ppp method since the shc ppp and pppc methods were treated in the same way regardless of the addition of various constraints we would like to note that the fes2014 model is typically used to predict long period tidal phenomena not including short wave factors such as wind wave and barometric pressure in this paper we regard those short wave factors as errors in constraint data the results could be more credible if we used the real sea level observation data in our future work we plan to use real sea surface geodetic height observation data to validate the shc ppp method since the main purpose of this paper is to validate the feasibility of this method in order to improve the positioning accuracy in the u direction this paper does not focus on the influence of constraint data accuracy funding this research is funded by national key r d program of china grant no 2018yfc1503606 2018yfc1407401 national natural science foundation of china grant no

22124,marine surveying does not receive full benefits from rtk because there are lack of near reference stations along the coastal lines compared with rtk ppp can realize positioning with just a single station which can allow a wider operation range in marine applications but its elevation positioning accuracy is significantly lower than the horizontal direction for some ships with relatively static offshore operations the vertical movement of ships is mainly affected by the tide and the fluctuation of tide can be obtained by global tide models etc therefore we propose a gps ppp method with a sea surface geodetic height constraint to make full use of sea tide motion information to improve ppp effect in this paper we establish the sea surface height constraint ppp shc ppp model it is noted that the gps height is relative to wgs 84 reference ellipsoid thus we convert the tide fluctuation information to the sea surface height relative to wgs 84 reference ellipsoid by adding a fixed value which is the geodetic height of gps receiver at the first epoch obtained in advance by using the post positioning ppp minus the corresponding epoch s water level data predicted by fes2014 validated by kinematic experiments our shc ppp method can improve the vertical positioning accuracy over conventional ppp pppc by 79 keywords sea surface geodetic height global positioning system gps precise point positioning ppp sea surface height constrained ppp shc ppp 1 introduction thanks to the development of positioning technology in particular global positioning system gps applications related to marine surveying such as seabed topography and geomorphology water depth analysis and exploration of marine resources gain substantial acceptance through precise measurement offered by the positioning technology mao and zhang 1993 common gps positioning method on the sea include real time kinematic rtk carrier phase differential positioning zhang et al 2019 and precise point positioning ppp li et al 2009 liang et al 2017 zhai and huang 2017 since the rtk method needs a reference station to help determine and correct positioning errors the use of rtk method is not appropriate for marine environment where there are few reference stations in the area especially in the open sea the ppp method can realize positioning and has an unlimited operation range without the use of reference stations for marine environment the ppp method is a better choice than the rtk method wang and fei 2017 in marine environment the current ppp method offers acceptable positioning accuracy along the horizontal direction however the positioning accuracy along the vertical direction is still poor for ships or vessels with relatively static offshore operations their positions along the vertical direction should be affected by the height of the tide pitch roll wind etc in general the height of tide significantly contributes to the height of the ships since there are established and mature techniques in determining the height of tide we could integrate this information to the current ppp method in order to reduce positioning error along the vertical direction in this paper we show that we could apply the predicted tide information based on the conventional finite element solution tide model fes2014 carrere et al 2016 to the ppp method in order to help improve the positioning accuracy along the vertical direction we validated our proposed method with simulation and actual experiments and found that the positioning accuracy along the vertical direction improved significantly 2 background in the open marine environment ppp method without any assistance from reference stations is a good choice for positioning technology because reference stations cannot easily be placed in the open sea for economic and technical reasons modern marine applications require better positioning accuracy in the marine environment than what conventional ppp can offer several studies tried to apply concepts of dgps rtk and ppp method in marine environment and found that the ppp method is the more appropriate method of positioning landau et al 2009 positioning using the ppp approach on land environment is quite mature and researchers have been trying to improve its positioning performance using various approaches and additional information gao et al 2015 phatak et al 2002 phatak et al 2002 proposed a direct solution method for positioning with three gps satellites and applied the kalman filter kf method with elevation constraint and found that the convergence time for stable and accurate position was greatly shortened guo et al 2015 put forward a constraint ppp method with the consideration of the speed and path of moving vehicles and found that the constraint ppp method could improve the accuracy significantly compared to the conventional ppp method especially in harsh environment with few observable satellites or large geometric dilution of precision gdop value the results of these works suggest that additional observational data can help improve the positioning accuracy of the ppp method several studies found that the error in the vertical direction is approximately twice of the error in the horizontal direction gao et al 2006 desanto et al 2019 yang et al 2017 2019 and tide fluctuation information also called water level fluctuation information could be used to help improve the accuracy of vertical positioning in the marine environment since the vertical position elevation of ships with relative static offshore operations mainly depended on the tide height at present tide fluctuation information with certain accuracy can be obtained through the observation of satellite altimetry dropping automatic tide gauge and tide level observation stations bao and xu 2016 feng et al 2016 wang et al 2018 yan 2013 there are several models of tide levels such as nao99b fes2014 tpxo7 2 got4 7 and eot10a which can be used to predict real world water level in different geographical areas zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 at incredible accuracy the fes2014 tide model in particular offers tide prediction with less than 20 cm accuracy along the shore and in the middle of the sea carrere et al 2016 3 methods 3 1 concept since the tide fluctuation information is one of the main contributors to ship movement in elevation direction the vertical positioning of a ship can be calculated based on the measured tide fluctuation and tide model and the measured gps positioning using the ppp method we proposed an improved vertical positioning method over a gps based ppp method called sea surface height constraint ppp shc ppp method by taking the tide fluctuation information into account the sea surface height data obtained from the tide fluctuation information would be used as a constraint to limit the error which could be caused by the conventional gps based ppp pppc method which does not take the tide fluctuation data into account the tide fluctuation information is obtained from tide stations and fes2014 model which is widely accepted as an accurate tide model since the data from the fes2014 model is relative to the local mean sea level frame not based on wgs 84 frame the data from the fes2014 model must be converted to the wgs 84 frame in order to validate our positioning method using the tide fluctuation information we carry out simulation and actual kinematic experiments the validation is simplified by taking only the position of gps phase center which neglects the influences caused by the ship s posture variation 3 2 pppc model equation 1 describes the pppc model that we use as a benchmark to our proposed method the pppc model zumberge et al 1997 is based on the extended kalman filter ekf gelb 1974 as follows

height constraint ppp model 3 3 1 height constraint method in order to improve the vertical accuracy of the conventional ppp pppc model the tide fluctuation information is obtained from tide stations

we then obtain h x r x r a h b h 3 b h 3 x r 2 y r 2 a h 3 z r 2 9 h y r y r a h b h 3 b h 3 x r 2 y r 2 a h 3 z r 2 h z r z r a h 3 b h b h 3 x r 2 y r 2 a h 3 z r 2 and 10 d h h x r d x r h y r d y

information is added to the positioning calculation the covariance matrix of the observed quantity part of the extended kalman filter ekf can be rewritten as follows 15 r d i a g r c r p r h where r c represents the covariance matrix of carrier phase linear combination observation value error r p represents covariance matrix of errors of pseudo range linear combination observations and r h represents the variance matrix of the residuals of prior elevation information if there are n satellites are observed in the jth observation epoch supposing that all the observed values of n satellites participate in the solving process h pd j can be written as 16 h pd j c 1 p 1 c 2 p 2 c n p n h j t where c i e 1 m t i p i e 1 m t 0 h j dh d r r 0 0 0 for i 1 2 n meanwhile the covariance

error of carrier phase of the ith satellite r p i represents the variance of the error of pseudo range observation value of the ith satellite v a r h j represents the variance of the error of the elevation constraint data of the jth observation epoch 4 evaluation method we performed our proposed method in simulation and actual kinematic experiments and chose to measure the root mean square error rms error in order to evaluate the accuracy performance of our proposed method in order to analyze the accuracy visually the experimental results used in equation 18 are converted in the enu coordinate system enu system the rms error can be measured as follows 18 r m s e r r o r 1 n x i x r i 2 n where x i represents the bias between the first epoch solution of pppr and the pppc shc ppp solution in the ith epoch x r i represents the bias between the first epoch solution of pppr and the pppr solution in the ith epoch x i x r i represents the ith epoch s bias difference between pppr and pppc shc ppp and n represents the total epochs used in solving rms 5 tide fluctuation information collection the tide fluctuation information is obtained from the tide station and fes2014 using the following methods 5 1 tide station method the tide fluctuation information provides sea surface geodetic height data according to the principle shown in fig 1 which can be calculated and equation 19 as follows li et al 2011 19 h s s g h h m s l h w l v where h s s g h represents the sea surface geodetic height h m s l represents the distance between local mean sea level and the wgs 84 reference ellipsoid surface h w l represents the sea surface height relative to the local mean sea level which can be obtained via the observation at the tide station and v represents the observation error we collect the tide fluctuation information as h w l using the sca11 3 float type water level gauge at the tide station shown in fig 2 the water level gauge developed by tianjin hydrowise technology development center under the china national marine technology center can collect data related to water level sea surface temperature and salinity wind speed and direction the data are stored according to the coastal observation data standard gb t 14914 2006 the water level is sampled every 1 min and has 1 mm s resolution sca11 3 float type water level gauge has an average fault free working time of more than 5000 h and average fault recovery time of less than 0 5 h allowing it to be effective in distinguishing the high tide from low tide the main technical specifications of sca11 3 float type water level gauge in table 1 our simulation experiment uses tide station method to obtain the observation data which are used as the shc ppp model constraint the observation data from the tide station method are the sea surface geodetic height converted into the gps geodetic height data fig 1 according to equation 20 20 h g h s s g h h p where h g represents the geodetic height of gps antenna h s s g h represents the sea surface geodetic height and h p represents the height of the gps antenna phase center distance from the sea surface 5 2 fes2014 method the fes2014 model is the latest version of the finite element solution fes ocean tidal model developed by the french tidal group carrere et al 2016 lyard et al 2016 this model combines the t p jason 1 jason 2 jason ers 1 ers 2 and envisat satellite altimeter data the model can provide 34 constituents consisting of 2n2 eps2 j1 k1 k2 l2 la2 m2 m3 m4 m6 m8 mf mks2 mm mn4 ms4 msf msqm mtm mu2 n2 n4 interchange nu2 o1 p1 q1 r2 s1 s2 s4 sa ssa t2 of the tide and trend information the resolution of the model results is 1 16 we use fes2014 to predict the fluctuation of the water level at gps observation points in actual experiment the predicted water level is denoted by h w l in equation 19 the method to gain the height constraint data is as follows firstly the observation data is solved by the trip software and the solution results with the accuracy about 5 cm are obtained li et al 2016 since the data obtained from gps observations are in wgs 84 frame and the data obtained from the prediction of water level are in the local mean sea level frame carrere et al 2016 the predicted water level fluctuation data must be converted to geodetic height data relative to wgs 84 frame similar to the simulation experiments we set h p in formula 20 is zero then the geodetic height of antenna phase center h g is equal to the geodetic height of sea surface h s s g h according to fig 3 we can find that the geodetic height of sea surface h s s g h is equal to the sum of the predicted water level h p r e the geodetic height of local mean sea level h m w and the error h o t h e r caused by other factors like wind wave barometric pressure and so on according to equation 21 therefore in order to acquire the value of h s s g h we need to know the distance h m w between the mean sea level and the wgs 84 reference ellipsoid 21 h g h s s g h h m w h p r e h o t h e r according to equation 21 we can gain h m w by formula 22 22 h m w h g h p r e h o t h e r since the value of h o t h e r in equation 22 is unknown the first epoch result of trip recorded as h t 1 and the corresponding epoch of water level data recorded as h p r e 1 predicted by fes2014 can be used to obtain the geodetic height of local mean sea level h m w 1 given a corresponding epoch error h o t h e r 1 according to equation 23 23 h m w 1 h m w h o t h e r 1 h t 1 h p r e 1 we assume that the sea is calm and the wind is weak while the ship is working and in order to facilitate the analysis of shc ppp s effectiveness we suppose h o t h e r is the same throughout our operation we choose h o t h e r 1 to represent the value of h o t h e r the geodetic height of sea surface at the ith epoch can be used as a constraint which is recorded as h c o n s i can be calculated by equation 24 24 h c o n s i h m w 1 h p r e i where i 1 2 n and n represents the total number of epochs participated in the experiment and the following is the same in order to gain the constraint data error h e r r o r i we use the generated geodetic height of sea surface h c o n s i minus the reference h r i which can be seen in equation 25 25 h e r r o r i h c o n s i h r i h t 1 h r 1 i 1 h m w h o t h e r 1 h p r e i h r i i 2 h t 1 h p r e 1 h p r e i h r i i 2 where h r i refers to ith epoch s solution of rtk according to equation 25 we find that h e r r o r i represents the difference between rtk s height solution and height constraint data at the ith epoch it can also be regarded as the water level error caused by the wind wave and barometric pressure fes2014 model error and system error caused by trip software and our own procedure and so on 6 experiments and results in order to verify the feasibility of the above proposed solution method we carried out the simulation experiment and the actual experiment as mentioned in introduction the position information obtained from the simulation experiment and the actual experiment in this paper referred to the position information of gps phase center we analyzed the positions of antenna phase center as follows 6 1 simulation experiment in the simulation experiment the tide station data were actually obtained from a water level gauge in the west port of yantai shandong province china the water level gauge sampled the water level every minute see section 5 1 the gps data used were one day observation data of jfng station provided by the international gnss service igs the jfng station sampled the water level data at the rate of 1 30 hz or once every 30 s equivalent to 2880 epochs a day we needed to ensure that each epoch has a corresponding elevation constraint value in order to realize shc ppp the existing water level data need to be preprocessed we interpolated the observed water level data at an interval of 30 s using the cubic spline interpolation method in order to ensure the smooth overall trend sim et al 2019 for our simulation experiment we set the value of h p in equation 20 to zero so that the sea surface geodetic height was equal to the geodetic height of gps antenna we designated the simulated geodetic height of the local mean sea level h m s l in equation 19 to be the difference between the actual geodetic height of jfng station provided by igs which is 71 324 m and the interpolated water level at the first epoch the geodetic height constraint data of the total of 2880 ephemera samples in a day can be obtained by adding the water level data and the simulated h m s l together the observation error of water level measurement could be viewed as the difference between the geodetic height constraint data and the actual geodetic height of the jfng station provided by the igs in most cases the errors were found to be less than 10 cm fig 4 thus we could set v a r h j 0 01 m 2 our simulation experiment used the static observation of jfng station obtained from the actual coordinates of jfng station provided by the igs as our reference in order to support the validation analysis of our simulation method by comparing the positioning results between pppc and shc ppp the pppc and shc ppp methods were used to calculate the kinematic ppp of jfng observation data and the calculated results were compared with the reference 3d coordinates x 2279828 8292m y 5004706 5483 m z 3219777 4684m of the jfng station provided by the igs the experimental results in the north n east e and up u directions are shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows that there is no significant difference calculated using the pppc and shc ppp methods in east and north direction but there is a significant difference in the u direction when comparing to the pppc method the shc ppp method can significantly improve the positioning accuracy in the u direction the shc ppp method can also limit the fluctuation of the position in the u direction to a certain range at the very beginning fig 6 shows the first 100 epochs of the results shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 6 that the shc ppp method can effectively control the fluctuation in the u direction at the very beginning the improvement in the calculation accuracy in the u direction of shc ppp method is shown clearly in fig 7 which contains the calculation results from the 1800th to the 2160th epoch of fig 5 in the u direction there is a significant difference between the pppc and shc ppp methods compared to the pppc method the shc ppp method can reduce the rms error in the u direction by approximately 4 cm which can be translated to the accuracy improvement in the u direction of 57 according to table 2 we can conclude that the shc ppp method has no apparent effect in the e and n directions 6 2 actual kinematic experiment in the actual kinematic experiment we observed the water level data for 7 h on a survey vessel in calm sea surface which corresponds to the 0 1 level of sea conditions we collected the water level data with the sample frequency of 1 hz 1 record for every 1 s the ship s trajectory and working range are shown in fig 8 since the water level of the entire trajectory of the ship could not be acquired accurately we chose the starting and ending positions of the ships as point a 35 7630 n 120 2560 e and point b 35 8616 n 120 1688 e in fig 8 in order to analyze the spatial difference of the water level of the two positions the distance between point a and b was 13 49 km the water levels at point a and point b were predicted by using the fes2014 model with the time resolution of 1 s the predicted water level difference between point a and point b are shown in fig 9 we could see that the predicted water level difference between point a and point b were less than 6 cm which were considered to be very small thus we could consider that the water levels at point a and point b are the same we could then choose point a s predicted water level as the height constraint data for the experiment we setup a reference station near the working area on the shore and made sure that the working area was covered by the reference station the vessel s partial trajectory during our experiments is showed in fig 10 we then compared the positions obtained from the rtk method which are recorded as pppr against the pppc and shc ppp methods in order to determine the performance of our proposed shc ppp method fig 11 shows the errors we obtained from our actual experiments using the height constraint data mentioned in section 5 2 we can see that most of the errors are within 0 4 m the errors could be caused by other factors that may be overlooked in our models in this case we set v a r h j to be 0 2 m 2 similar to the simulation experiment we also used the pppc and shc ppp methods for the kinematic ppp calculation the result of the rtk method is used as a reference recorded as pppr in order to benchmark the performance of the pppc and shc ppp method we chose the coordinate of the vessel at first epoch of rtk method as the origin of the enu system the calculated height level differences between the water level calculated by the pppc and pppr c r methods and between shc ppp and pppr h r methods in enu coordinate system are plotted in fig 12 in red and blue color respectively according to fig 12 compared with the pppc method the shc ppp method could control the deviation fluctuation of the positioning results within a certain range at the beginning in the u direction in order to describe the performance difference between the pppc and shc ppp methods quantitatively we used equation 18 to calculate the rms error of c r and h r respectively using fig 12 we analyzed our data and found that it required 200 epochs to converge to within 20 cm in both the e and u directions so we took the solution results after the 200th epoch for the following analysis we recorded the solutions from the 200th epoch to the 10196th epoch as part a and the difference between pppr and pppc and between shc ppp of part a are showed in fig 13 also the rms error of part a are calculated in table 3 fig 13 shows the positioning performance of the shc ppp with pppc methods in different directions according to the figure the shc ppp method can limit the deviation of the solution within a relatively smooth range in u direction combine fig 13 and table 3 together we can see that compared with the pppc method shc ppp can reduce the rms errors by 30 cm in u direction in other words the positioning accuracy in the u direction was improved by 79 compared to the positioning accuracy obtained from the pppc method comprehensive analysis shows that compared with pppc method shc ppp method can improve the vertical positioning accuracy by 79 and improve the accuracy of three dimensional positioning by 67 we also found that the shc ppp method has no significant effect on the accuracy in the e and n directions 7 conclusion generally the positioning accuracy of the conventional ppp pppc method in vertical direction is lower than that in horizontal direction in order to improve the positioning accuracy in elevation direction we propose a gps based precise positioning method with sea surface geodetic height constraint shc ppp our proposed method takes the tide fluctuation information into account for improving the vertical positioning accuracy the shc ppp method can help provide support for modern applications that require high vertical accuracy such as deep sea control points measurement sun et al 2019 and underwater topography survey hatanaka et al 2005 in order to validate the effectiveness of the shc ppp method the simulation experiment and actual experiment were carried out the experimental data used in simulation experiment mainly consist of two parts one is the water level data of yantai west port collected by sca11 3 water level gauge and the other is the jfng station observation data provided by igs using these two datasets the sea surface geodetic data with an error of 10 cm were derived as constraint data in the simulation experiment the ppp kinematic positions were calculated by using the pppc and shc ppp methods we observed that our proposed shc ppp method can significantly improve the positioning accuracy in the vertical or u direction the rms error in the u direction is reduced from 7 cm to 3 cm 57 percent improvement in addition the shc ppp method can limit the deviation of the positioning in the u direction to a certain range at the very beginning of the experiment we performed the actual experiment using the fes2014 forecast data model and the observed gps positioning data in the sea the analysis of the experiment results showed that the shc ppp method clearly stabilized the positioning accuracy in the u direction since the first few epochs in other words the method could quickly limit the deviation of observed positions within a certain range at the time when the positioning errors in the e and n directions converge to less than 20 cm we analyzed the positioning accuracy in the u direction after the 200th epoch we recorded this part as part a by analyzing part a comprehensively we found that compared with the pppc method the shc ppp method can improve the vertical positioning accuracy by 79 and it can improve the accuracy of three dimensional positioning by 67 the simulation and actual experiment results showed that the shc ppp method can improve the accuracy in the vertical direction to some extent although the shc ppp provide no significant accuracy improvement in the horizontal directions in the perspective of elevation and three dimensional positioning the shc ppp method can significantly improve the positioning accuracy in order to validate the effectiveness of the shc ppp method we setup a hypothesis we supposed that the water level fluctuation caused by waves wind and other factors is the same during our experiments we used the positioning calculated at the first epoch of trip software to calculate the distance between local mean sea level and wgs 84 ellipsoid under this hypothesis we carried out our simulation and actual experiment in order to analyze the effectiveness of the shc ppp method conveniently we neglected some errors such as the influences caused by ship s posture speed etc this is based on the notion that the positioning data used in actual experiment were collected in a calm sea surface which referred to 0 1 level sea conditions theoretically this should not affect the validation of the feasibility of the shc ppp method since the shc ppp and pppc methods were treated in the same way regardless of the addition of various constraints we would like to note that the fes2014 model is typically used to predict long period tidal phenomena not including short wave factors such as wind wave and barometric pressure in this paper we regard those short wave factors as errors in constraint data the results could be more credible if we used the real sea level observation data in our future work we plan to use real sea surface geodetic height observation data to validate the shc ppp method since the main purpose of this paper is to validate the feasibility of this method in order to improve the positioning accuracy in the u direction this paper does not focus on the influence of constraint data accuracy funding this research is funded by national key r d program of china grant no 2018yfc1503606 2018yfc1407401 national natural science foundation of china grant no
