2985,isotopic signatures of anthropogenic sulfate sources within the upper silesian urban area southern poland were investigated to increase the reliability of the origin assessment of groundwater contaminants to analyze δ34s and δ18o in sulfate 64 samples were collected representing several sulfate sources synthetic and organic fertilizers raw and treated wastewater mine water leachate from landfills mine heaps and industrial waste dumps additionally 10 surface water samples were taken from contaminated rivers regarded as potential groundwater pollution sources results of δ34s and δ18o in sulfate derived from anthropogenic sources were compared with literature data which indicated significant discrepancies for some contamination sources the results were applied to assess so4 2 origin in groundwater samples from the gliwice aquifer apart from the δ34s and δ18o data the study included measurements of major ions inorganic nitrogen forms trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene in groundwater isotopic analyses of river water samples confirmed the impact of urbanized and industrialized areas on surface water pollution and possible influence on groundwater contamination the values of δ34s and δ18o similar to wastewater were reported for most groundwater samples from the gliwice carbonate aquifer groundwater contamination was also manifested by higher values of electrical conductivity and concentrations of chloride sodium trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene the comparison of recent isotopic data on so4 2 sources with literature values clearly shows that it is very important to investigate local potential contamination sources to increase their reliability in determining the source of groundwater or river water pollution keywords contamination sulfate isotopes groundwater protection poland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction proper management of drinking water resources requires recognition of threats to water quality groundwater resources are less vulnerable to pollution compared to surface water but in case of pollution it is much more difficult to find the source of contamination cook and herczeg 2000 appelo et al 2005 pinder and celia 2006 edmunds et al 2008 a very useful tool applied by researchers for decades is isotopic analysis of contaminants the method is based on the fact that many predominant pollution sources present different sometimes unique isotopic signatures krouse and mayer 2000 bottrell et al 2008 aravena and mayer 2009 sulfate is not considered a toxic component of water but its excessive amounts result in deterioration of drinking water quality due to the influence on hardness and taste as well as its potential effect on causing diarrhea moreover elevated concentration of so4 2 causes corrosion in water pipelines and concrete materials trettin et al 2002 choi et al 2011 witczak et al 2013 the common drinking water limit for so4 2 concentration is 250 mg l who 2011 based on the taste and odor issues sulfate in groundwater comes from both natural pyrite oxidation gypsum dissolution soil sulfate atmospheric deposition and anthropogenic wastewater organic and synthetic fertilizers and industrial wastes sources e g clark and fritz 1997 krouse and mayer 2000 puig et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 isotopic composition of so4 2 molecules in the aquatic environment is a subject to measurable natural variations that result in specific isotopic signatures of so4 2 derived from different sources bottrell et al 2008 in oxidizing conditions when bacterial sulfate reduction does not occur oxygen and sulfur isotopes in so4 2 are resistant to exchange processes in groundwater on timescales of 10 100 ka in the near neutral ph range lloyd 1967 under anaerobic conditions sulfate reducing microorganisms use so4 2 as an electron acceptor for respiration the bacterial sulfate reduction bsr to sulfur or sulfide is a principal process responsible for isotope fractionation enriching 34s and 18o in the remaining sulfate as sulfate concentrations decrease clark and fritz 1997 canfield 2001 isotopic studies of sulfate have been used in hydrogeology for many decades e g claypool et al 1980 cortecci et al 1981 taylor et al 1984 fouillac et al 1990 strebel et al 1990 bottrell et al 1991 trembaczowski 1991 habicht and canfield 1997 moncaster et al 2000 dogramaci et al 2001 knöller and schubert 2010 caschetto et al 2017 pittalis et al 2018 biddau et al 2019 torres martinez et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 yet laboratory experiments on sulfur isotope geochemistry began much earlier thode et al 1949 trofimov 1949 researchers focused mainly on bacterial degradation of sulfate oxidation of sulfides isotopic signatures of sulfate originating from different sources and mixing of sulfate of different origin the achievements of researchers are widely used to trace sulfate fate in groundwater environment to evaluate the effectiveness of measures for mitigation of groundwater degradation or to assess the origin of sulfate observed in groundwater especially in the context of anthropogenic impact on groundwater quality isotopic investigation of sulfate sources in groundwater is crucial for the proper assessment of anthropogenic impact on groundwater quality while isotopic studies of natural sulfate sources such as evaporite minerals sulfide minerals or soil sulfur have been performed widely the isotopic signatures of anthropogenic sources have been investigated relatively less frequently therefore researchers worldwide very often use literature data e g puig et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 which in the case of anthropogenic sources can lead to misinterpretations of the origin of sulfate dissolved in groundwater in urban areas this is mostly because of regional differences in isotopic signatures of sulfate in such pollution sources as wastewater e g bottrell et al 2008 shin et al 2015 or synthetic fertilizers e g cravotta 1997 shin et al 2015 the aim of this study was to investigate isotopic signature of selected anthropogenic sulfate sources in the most urbanized and industrialized region of poland and then to compare the results with literature data from other parts of the world the idea of this study came from the fact that the results of isotopic studies of anthropogenic sources published so far were sometimes very varied and within wide ranges which did not allow for proper assessment of the origin of pollution the results of the study were applied to determine sources of groundwater contamination based on the isotopic composition of sulfate in a triassic carbonate aquifer located in the upper silesian urban area in southern poland 2 materials and methods 2 1 upper silesian urban area the upper silesian urban area usua of the total area approx 2850 km2 is located in southern poland in the northern part of the upper silesian coal basin fig 1 the region is one of the most industrialized areas in europe mainly because of large deposits of hard coal but also because of high concentration of other industries like power production mostly coal fired power plants metal electromechanical and chemical industrial plants apart from the industrial character of the usua the land use of the region is dominated by agriculture clc 2018 one of the most adverse effects of mining and industrial activities is the presence of anthropogenic wastelands such as mine heaps and waste dumps which are scattered all over the region lewińska preis et al 2021 nádudvari et al 2021 the specific land use and development result in a diverse range of contamination sources including point sources e g septic tanks point sewage discharges landfills and nonpoint sources of pollution e g agricultural operations highway run off leaky sewer pipes gas emission from an industrial plant into the atmosphere różkowski 2008 the upper silesian urban area lies in a basin between the vistula and oder rivers their tributaries are usually low gradient streams and the watershed runs across the central part of the region the long term anthropogenic pressures strongly affected the surface water environment the significant changes relate physical properties and chemical composition of river water and characteristics of watercourses wastewater including mine water industrial and municipal sewage accounts for a large proportion of the total river discharge in addition due to mining activities numerous rivers turned into losing streams and thus polluted surface water influences groundwater quality in many parts of the region cabała et al 2004 bondaruk et al 2015 anthropogenic activities in the usua also led to changes in regional climatic conditions manifested by increased precipitation temperature and air pollution continuous measurements of air quality in the usua conducted by the chief inspectorate of environmental protection over the past 20 years have shown that so2 concentration has been decreasing significantly https powietrze gios gov pl annual average air concentrations of so2 in a measuring station in katowice have declined from about 40 µg dm3 in 2001 to 7 µg dm3 in 2020 the regional climatic changes are related to high emissions associated with the generation of thermal energy steam and by products of combustion processes which indirectly affect the quality of the water environment różkowski et al 1997 the distinctive feature of the silesian geology is carboniferous coal bearing deposits overlaid primarily by triassic carbonate deposits and quaternary clastic sediments różkowski 2004 the quaternary aquifers are influenced by many anthropogenic activities which results in significant groundwater contamination in many parts of the region therefore most of the local well fields abstract groundwater from the triassic aquifers which constitutes the important drinking water source in the region kowalczyk 2003a 2 2 the gliwice aquifer the groundwater samples were taken from the gliwice carbonate aquifer fig 2 located in the western part of the upper silesian urban area the aquifer is composed of limestones and dolomites of a maximum thickness of 200 m the gliwice aquifer consists of two layers middle and lower triassic fig 3 initially separated by marls and subsequently connected hydraulically due to diagenetic processes and anthropogenic activities mining and boreholes the recharge zone of the aquifer is located in the eastern part fig 2 where the triassic carbonate rocks outcrop or are covered by permeable or semi permeable quaternary deposits with a thickness ranging from a few meters up to 40 m różkowski 1990 kowalczyk 2003a the aquifer is confined in the northern and western parts under natural conditions groundwater flow direction was from the north east towards the south west however flow patterns have been considerably changed by intensive water abstraction by large well fields for supplying local residents with drinking water more detailed characteristics of the aquifer can be found in the previous papers about the research area jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2017 jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2020 groundwater samples were collected from 12 production wells three piezometers one historic mine shaft one outlet of historic mine adit the black trout adit and from a pond filled with drainage water in a closed dolomite quarry the wells and piezometers differ in depths and screen intervals table 1 the piezometers are 42 49 m deep and their screens are placed in the middle triassic layer muschelkalk in turn the wells have a wider range of depths i e from 47 5 to 245 m and are screened at different stratigraphic layers sometimes they screen two triassic layers middle and lower triassic together fig 3 as the screens of production wells are considerably longer up to 145 m than the screens of piezometers the samples collected from the wells represent a mixture of groundwater recharged over a wide area and having relatively diversified residence times it poses huge difficulties in interpreting the origin of so4 2 and other water constituents nevertheless the research so far revealed spatial differentiation of groundwater chemistry in the area of the tarnowskie góry town being more important than the depth related gradients jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2020 2 3 sampling and analyses samples representing anthropogenic sources of sulfate surface water and groundwater were collected in the period of 4 april to 5 july 2018 the collected samples represent the following sources of sulfate synthetic fertilizers used in agriculture and horticulture 11 samples municipal and domestic wastewater treated and untreated 25 samples leachate from municipal landfills 9 samples leachate from heaps of mine and metallurgical wastes 6 samples mine water 5 samples organic fertilizers pig and poultry manure 3 samples leachate from the landfills of the former chemical plant in tarnowskie góry 5 samples the study attempted to collect precipitation samples for analysis of sulfate isotopic composition but the sulfate concentration was very low therefore the authors concluded that rainwater is not a significant source of so4 2 in groundwater in the study area and eventually excluded it from the study 2 4 synthetic fertilizers the 11 fertilizer samples can be classified into two groups based on their use the first group samples f1 f7 represents fertilizers used for extensive farming mostly for soil fertilization the second group samples f8 f11 incudes fertilizers used for horticulture or lawn fertilization the samples f5 f7 and f8 represent simple fertilizers consisting of mg k and fe sulfate respectively the remaining samples represent compound fertilizers where sulfur is a secondary nutrient of varying content in the samples f1 f2 f4 and f9 the sulfur compounds constitute from 5 to 10 much higher content of sulfur compounds 18 5 26 is declared for the fertilizer samples f3 f6 f10 and f11 table s1 in the supplementary materials all samples were collected from commercial suppliers in poland the solid samples were dissolved in distilled water stirred for 24 h and filtered 2 5 wastewater this type of sulfate source was collected as grab samples of treated and untreated wastewater from seven wastewater treatment plants and three samples s4 s13 and s14 represent untreated sewage discharged directly to local rivers seven wastewater treatment plants represent different types of treatment technologies and different capacity of sewage treated per day from 1 500 to 65 000 m3 d the smaller ones treat only household sewage from small areas whereas the biggest ones treat domestic and industrial wastewater from several town districts the samples were collected in 1 5 l plastic bottles and kept cold during transport to the laboratory in the laboratory the untreated sewage samples were centrifuged to remove the coarse fraction and were subsequently filtered through a whatman fiberglass filter of 1 5 μm pore size the samples of treated sewage were filtered through both types of filters of 1 5 μm and 0 45 μm pore size 2 6 landfill leachate samples of landfill leachate were initially taken from the collectors of pristine leachate drained from beneath the landfill body unfortunately it turned out that no sulfate sulfur was present in the samples due to extremely low redox conditions to find out the isotopic signatures of s and o in sulfate coming from the landfill the authors decided to collect water from the surface reservoirs of leachates or from the ponds being in a direct lateral contact with old reclaimed landfills samples l4 l9 in addition three contaminated groundwater samples l1 l3 from the piezometers of the monitoring network of the unsealed landfill were taken as the samples resembled direct impact of the leachates on groundwater 2 7 leachates from post mining and metallurgical waste the silesian region is characterized by numerous heaps of post mining and metallurgical waste part of them contains mixed waste sometimes with addition of municipal waste because most of them were formed decades ago when there were no regulations on landfills in poland the waste dumps in the usua usually contain a few percent of coal bearing rocks sandstones siltstones and claystones that contain organic matter fe sulfides and carbonates exothermic oxidation of organic matter called self heating and the subsequent accumulation of heat energy within the dump may lead to self ignition intensified by pyrite marcasite or siderite oxidation high temperature changes in coal wastes affected by fire revealed alterations known as combustion metamorphism stracher et al 2011 2015 the mineral composition of coal wastes reflects the primary composition of gangue rocks and minerals associated with coal seams thermally affected parts of the dumps are composed mainly of cristobalite tridymite celsian anorthite cordierite indialite mullite olivine augite spinel group hematite and glass subordinate phases are often represented by chalcopyrite fe oxides elemental lead and zns exhalating phases with sal ammoniac elemental sulfur and k mg fe nh4 al sulfates and chlorides are blooming around vents of relatively low temperature fumarole ciesielczuk et al 2014 pierwoła et al 2018 nádudvari et al 2021 gypsum and jarosite are also found as a result of weathering processes ciesielczuk 2015 wastes accumulated at a dump containing predominantly slags from an old smelting plant are composed of oxides spinel hematite zincite silicates and aluminosilicates e g olivine pyroxene nepheline plagioclase and k feldspar sulfides pyrrhotite rudashevskyite galena metallic phases pure iron and iron arsenic mixture and secondary phases like gypsum or apatite warchulski et al 2015 for this study six samples of surface water representing impact of such heaps were collected the samples were taken from the reservoir supplied by the heap drainage water sample p1 and from ponds recharged by seepage water from the heaps samples p2 p6 the actual impact of the leachates on the sampled pond water was confirmed by the extreme concentration of sulfate or by the elevated ph 9 0 in the case of low sulfate concentration 2 8 mine water within the project five groundwater samples were collected from one closed zn pb ore mine which was still dewatered due to the hard coal mining activity carried out below in the past the mine exploited zn pb ores from the ore bearing dolomites of the middle triassic age the ores include both oxidized calamine deposits and sulfide minerals sphalerite and galena banks et al 2020 four water samples were taken from two galleries samples m1 m4 and one sample was collected from a discharge channel m5 on the surface 2 9 organic fertilizers during the project lifetime april july 2018 many samples of solid and liquid manure were taken to extract water soluble sulfate the liquid samples were filtered through a whatman fiberglass filter of 1 5 μm pore size whereas solid samples were soaked in distilled water for 24 h average δ18o of the distilled water was 9 5 the soak procedure was performed for 3 day old manure and for 11 day old samples to see any changes resulting from the increasing time of exposure to the atmosphere unfortunately most of the samples did not contain sulfate sulfur only in two cases sulfate in water was found poultry and pig solid manure samples of1 and of2 represent water extract from the 3 day old manure of both poultry and pig origin while samples of3 and of4 represent water extract of 11 day old poultry manure 2 10 wastes of the former chemical plant waste of the chemical plant in tarnowskie góry closed since the 1990 s pose a huge threat to groundwater quality in the study area to obtain reliable information on the isotopic signature of s and o in sulfate coming from both types of waste stored in the new landfill as well as the remaining in the soil five different samples were collected samples c1 and c2 represent leachate from the new landfill taken from the two different collectors samples c3 c4 and c5 are groundwater collected from three observation wells representing a strong impact of the waste remaining in the soil as confirmed by their location and elevated electrical conductivity of sampled groundwater 2 11 surface water samples ten surface water samples were collected from six rivers and one canal in the period of 25 april to 1 july 2018 the rivers were selected in a way to investigate different pressures on surface water quality some rivers are recipients of mainly municipal and domestic wastewater or a mixture of industrial and municipal sewage other receive the input of mine drainage water four river water samples r1 r2 r4 and r5 were additionally analyzed for chemical composition including major ions inorganic nitrogen forms trichloroethene tce and tetrachloroethene pce 2 12 groundwater samples a total of 18 groundwater samples were collected from the gliwice aquifer in the period of 11 april to 28 june 2018 all groundwater samples were filtered in the field through a millipore membrane filter of 0 45 μm pore size after filtering the samples were divided one aliquot was used for analyses of major and minor ions another aliquot was used for isotopic investigation of sulfate additional samples of unfiltered groundwater were collected in dark glass bottles for analysis of trichloroethene tce and tetrachloroethene pce the following parameters of groundwater were determined in the field ph and eh measured with an eurosensor epp 1 and an eurosensor eptagp 323 w electrodes respectively connected to a cp 401 elmetron ph meter electrical conductivity ec 60 electrode connected to elmetron cc 401 concentration of dissolved o2 wtw oxi 315i meter with a cellox 325 electrode and so4 2 using the hach dr1900 portable spectrophotometer sulfaver 4 powder pillow tests the field measurements were also conducted for all other liquid samples wastewater leachates from municipal and industrial landfills from heaps of post mining and metallurgical wastes ore mine drainage water rivers and leachates from the landfills of the closed chemical plant in tarnowskie góry the concentrations of five cations ca2 mg2 na k nh4 and four anions so4 2 cl no3 no2 in groundwater samples and four river water samples were determined by ion chromatography method metrohm 850 professional ic accuracy and precision below 5 at the institute of earth sciences university of silesia in katowice the concentration of hco3 was determined by alkalinity titration with hcl all water samples met a quality requirement of a maximum 5 error of ionic charge balance the presence of tce and pce were analyzed at the laboratory of the voivodship sanitary and epidemiological station in katowice using a method of gas chromatography with electron capture detection gc ecd accuracy and precision of 5 all liquid samples were filtered through a millipore membrane filter of 0 45 μm pore size unless otherwise described after filtering all samples sources of sulfate contamination surface water and groundwater were acidified to ph of around 2 0 by adding hcl and subsequently sulfates were precipitated as baso4 by adding an appropriate volume of 10 solution of bacl2 the samples were transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c for 24 h to allow precipitate to settle down in the laboratory the samples were centrifuged before removing decanted water then the baso4 residue was washed using distilled water until cl was completely removed after that the baso4 precipitate was dried out at 103 c for 24 h subsequently δ18o was analyzed using a flash ea 1112ht elemental analyzer thermo scientific coupled to a delta v advantage mass spectrometer thermo scientific in a continuous he flow system approximately 400 µg of baso4 wrapped in a silver foil is pyrolyzed at 1450

the analyses of stable isotopes of sulfate were performed by the stable isotope laboratory of the institute of geological sciences polish academy of sciences notation of the results is expressed in terms of δ relative to the international standards v smow vienna standard mean ocean water for δ18o and vcdt vienna canyon diablo troilite for δ34s 3 results and discussion detailed results of isotopic analysis of sulfate extracted from anthropogenic sources of groundwater pollution are provided in tables s1 s9 of the supplementary material statistical summary of the obtained results are provided in table 2 3 1 anthropogenic sources of sulfate among the obtained results for so4 2 derived from anthropogenic pollution sources isotopic composition of synthetic fertilizers δ34s 3 0 6 4

of δ18o from 9 0 to 14 6 whereas δ34s ranged from 1 2 to 9 4 fig 4 table s1 of the supplementary material the only result deviating from the others was obtained for a sample f4 representing fertilizer for which values of δ18o and δ34s were 7 6 and 14 2 respectively the difference may be due to a different substrates used for the fertilizer s production the result of δ34s for this sample shows the lowest value among the currently investigated fertilizers but also among the literature data literature data on isotopic signature of sulfur and oxygen in fertilizers show relatively large variation table 3 cravotta 1997 presented the largest number of original results of δ34s in total sulfur present in soil surface water and fertilizers 28 samples in total his data revealed a great variation in δ34s in fertilizers from 0 5 to 19 9 while the soil and stream water samples taken from fertilized land showed the results in the range of 3 3 to 8 4 vitoria et al 2004 provided a widely referenced study on isotopic signature of sulfate in synthetic fertilizers they found a considerable variation in δ34s from 6 4 to 21 4 and a narrower range of δ18o from 7 7 to 16 5 while the δ18o values are similar to the present results the sulfur isotopes show a higher proportion of 34s shin et al 2015 analyzed five samples of fertilizers and found δ34s in the range of 7 6 to 2 6 which is considerably lower than the dominant group of the results of the present study but higher compared to the f4 sample zhang et al 2015 compiled the isotopic data from previous research references therein where δ34s in fertilizers ranged from 3 1 to 20 7 whereas δ18o ranged from 7 5 to 20 1 the δ18o data from that study are more diversified compared to the present ones the presented differences in the isotopic composition of sulfur and oxygen derived from fertilizers all over the world result most probably from the different substrates of sulfur and different technologies applied by the manufacturers the fact that the dominant group of polish samples revealed relatively narrow ranges of δ18o from 9 0 to 14 6 and δ34s from 1 2 to 9 4 may result from more unified methods of production of synthetic fertilizers in poland and more homogeneous substrates for the production of fertilizers the sulfur substrates used by the polish manufacturers are mainly sulfuric vi acid mg sulfate monohydrate kieserite ammonium sulfate k sulfate or elemental sulfur e g kowal 2009 it is very difficult to compare the sources of sulfur in fertilizers all over the world because of the lack of information in the published papers the outstanding results obtained for the f4 sample indicate the need for further research on the isotopic composition of synthetic fertilizers produced in poland this particular manufacture was established in the place of the former sulfur mine in the tarnobrzeg town studies on the isotopic composition of elemental sulfur and sulfate sulfur from that area showed a wide range of results from 0 5 to 50 hałas and kurpiewski 1982 this is different from the result of the f4 sample δ34s 14 2 which suggests that other than local sources are used for fertilizer production these days sulfate extracted from manure revealed isotopic signature being different from synthetic fertilizers fig 4 table 2 the δ18o values were in the range from 0 9 to 2 8 while the δ34s values ranged from 3 0 to 8 3 table s2 of the supplementary material literature data on sulfur isotopes in animal manure both sulfate and total sulfur are more uniform compared to synthetic fertilizers otero et al 2007 reported a relatively narrow range of sulfur and oxygen isotopes in manure sulfate δ34s from 0 to 5 δ18o from 3 8 to 6 similarly to results of shin et al 2014 δ34s from 0 5 to 6 and δ18o from 3 5 to 10 other data compiled by zhang et al 2015 are in line with the present study δ34s from 3 2 to 6 4 also the study of cravotta 1997 produced relatively similar results even though he analyzed isotopic signature of total sulfur not sulfate the δ34s values ranged from 0 9 to 6 8 in manure samples this comparison shows that δ34s values in livestock manure from around the world are relatively homogeneous and the differences in δ18oso4 result most probably from variations in the local δ18o of water molecules that take part in the oxidation of sulfur present in the manure samples representing leakage from municipal and industrial landfills are characterized by high values of both δ18o and δ34s the obtained results are in the range of 6 7 to 13 4 for δ18o and from 10 9 to 25 6 for δ34s fig 5 table s3 of the supplementary material concentration of sulfate in these samples ranged from 68 to 1760 mg l isotopic signature of sulfate originating from landfill leachates turned out to be most similar to sulfate coming from dissolution of evaporitic minerals like gypsum claypool et al 1980 cortecci et al 1981 krouse and mayer 2000 which makes differentiation between these two sources more difficult moreover it is difficult to assess if these results characterize the original isotopic composition of sulfate coming from the leachates not subjected to microbial reduction processes the analysis of pristine leachate samples taken directly from the landfill installation showed the absence of sulfate sulfur therefore the authors decided to sample surface water and groundwater influenced by the leachates as they contained so4 2 ion because the leachates initially did not contain sulfate sulfur and then sulfate appeared later in the leachates or in groundwater surface water influenced by leachates it is probable that sulfate originated from the oxidation of reduced forms of sulfur from the landfill an argument for the lack of sulfate biodegradation is the presence of oxygen in the investigated samples on the other hand an argument for the impact of bsr on the observed isotopic composition of so4 2 are relatively high values of δ18o from 6 7 to 13 4 based on the collected data it is difficult to assess if the obtained isotopic signature of sulfate in leachates and water directly influenced by leachates is original and unmodified by subsequent biodegradation processes results of isotopic analyses of sulfate in landfill leachate are not very common in the literature van breukelen et al 2003 provided a range of δ34s values from 3 3 to 9 1 for seven groundwater samples influenced by landfill leachate including one sample upstream the contamination plume and one below the plume the authors concluded the meteoric origin of sulfate in the analyzed samples sulfate in the ore mine drainage water revealed low values of δ18o being in the range of 3 1 to 0 9 whereas δ34s ranged from 0 3 to 9 2 fig 5 table s4 of the supplementary material sulfate concentration ranged from 980 to 2560 mg l the data come from a single mine and cannot be used separately as an indicator of sulfate source the results are in line with the reported isotopic composition of zn pb ores occurring in the area of the investigated mine harańczyk 1993 literature data on mine water most often refer to acid mine drainage amd among many published studies gammons et al 2010 presented δ34s results for water influenced by amd in the range from 16 1 to 9 3 and δ18o from 12 5 to 9 1 migaszewski et al 2008 reported even lower values of δ34s from 22 3 to 11 1 whereas δ18o values showed significant enrichment in the heavier isotope from 4 4 to 1 1 the subsequent study on amd water performed by migaszewski et al 2018 showed new ranges of δ34s from 17 31 to 5 31 and δ18o from 11 07 to 1 12 all these studies confirmed a strong relation between isotopic composition of so4 2 in amd water and δ34s values observed in mineral sulfides mostly pyrite this indicates that in the case of mine water as a major source of groundwater contamination it is extremely important to study local isotopic signatures of sulfur in minerals as a basis for interpretation of groundwater pollution sources a very interesting and comprehensive study on mine water in the upper silesian coal basin was performed by pluta 2002 she analyzed 41 samples of hard coal mine water in terms of sulfate isotopes and obtained a number of different results depending on the sulfur form present in the rock matrix the δ34s data ranged from 4 7 to 40 8 and the δ18o ranged from 0 7 to 20 6 the author distinguished five major groups of water samples differing in sulfate origin based on the isotopic composition i dissolution of evaporitic minerals e g gypsum or anhydrite of permian triassic jurrasic cretaceous and neogene age ii sulfate from evaporitic minerals that were subjected to bacterial reduction iii oxidation of sulfides coming from bacterial reduction of sulfate from evaporites dating from permian to neogene iv sulfur from atmospheric deposition and v oxidation of sulfides characterized by negative values of δ34s sulfate concentrations in the analyzed samples ranged from 45 to 3 820 mg l and the highest concentrations were observed in the samples subjected to bsr in the case of leachates from heaps of post mining and metallurgical wastes the values of δ34s fitted in a narrow range from 2 5 to 4 3 while δ18o data showed a greater range from 2 1 to 7 6 fig 5 table s5 of the supplemental files an exception was the sample p6 δ18o 6 6 δ34s 11 5 taken from a water reservoir located by the heap of post mining wastes but occasionally recharged by discharges of water from a hard coal mine therefore the isotopic composition of so4 2 in the p6 sample most probably represents sulfate in mine water the study showed that water leaching from industrial heaps has the highest concentration of so4 2 up to 7 000 mg l and electrical conductivity reaching 14 760 μs cm it appears that in areas such as the upper silesian urban area leachate from heaps of mine and metallurgical waste is potentially one of the most important sources of groundwater pollution because there are no data on the isotopic composition of sulfur in mine and metallurgical wastes in the usua it is difficult to clearly assess the relationship between the isotopic composition of so4 2 in leachates and sulfur in the waste material however it can be assumed that the waste is characterized by the sulfur present in the coal seams and associated rocks it is interesting to note that the range of results for sulfur isotopes in leachates is very small this is most likely due to the fact that the isotopes are averaged from a mixture of different forms of sulfur present in the waste originating from different mines and are subject not only to weathering but also to combustion processes thus the isotopic composition of so4 2 in heap leachates is not a unique and characteristic signature but rather represents an average value of the sulfur isotopic composition of the waste literature data on isotopic composition of so4 2 in leachate from mining and metallurgical wastes are much more limited compared to other contamination sources talavera mendoza et al 2016 published results of isotopic analyses of six samples of leachate discharge from mining wastes accumulated in tailings impoundments in taxco mexico the values of δ34s ranged from 4 6 to 2 3 which are depleted in 34s compared to the present study this is most probably because of the difference in the source rocks the results of the isotopic analysis of sulfate derived from wastewater are quite homogeneous which is more noticeable in the case of treated sewage samples s16 s25 the values of δ34s for raw wastewater range from 0 4 to 9 3 whereas for treated wastewater it is from 0 4 to 4 3 the values of δ18o for raw wastewater are in the range of 0 7 to 6 1 and in the case of treated wastewater from 1 9 to 5 9 fig 6 table s6 of the supplementary material sulfate concentration in raw wastewater 47 124 mg l was lower compared to treated wastewater 74 200 mg l a possible explanation for this is a common use of aluminum sulfate as a flocculation enhancer in the wastewater treatment plants sadowski et al 2018 isotopic composition of sulfate or total sulfur in wastewater has been studied by many researchers bottrell et al 2008 found the δ34s values of untreated sewage in the range of 5 to 12 35 and the δ18o in the range of 8 1 to 17 9 which are mostly out of the ranges within the present study similarly otero et al 2007 presented results different from the present study δ34s from 9 5 to 13 2 and δ18o from 9 8 to 10 8 as well as jurado et al 2013 who observed narrow ranges of isotopic signature of sewage sulfate δ34s from 7 3 to 9 9 δ18o from 10 9 to 11 8 the study of cravotta 1997 on isotopic composition of total sulfur in sewage effluents produced results similar to the present study δ34s from 3 5 to 6 4 whereas shin et al 2015 obtained the highest results of δ34s in two sewage samples 15 1 and 24 2 a possible explanation for the differences in δ34s and δ18o values in wastewater obtained from the literature and the present study may be an influence of bsr on the sulfate prior to precipitation to baso4 in the present study the time between sewage sampling and baso4 precipitation was a couple of hours usually 4 8 h which makes potential biodegradation of sulfate rather unlikely the other authors provided a general description of the applied methods without mentioning the sample storage time the longer storage time may potentially promote partial degradation of so4 2 in wastewater which is rich in organic material another explanation is an influence of bsr during wastewater treatment processes because commonly applied methods of wastewater treatment include an anoxic phase khanal and huang 2003 chan et al 2009 kowalik and bartkiewicz 2018 where sulfate reduction may take place in the present study the concentration of so4 2 in the treated wastewater is higher compared to the raw wastewater table s6 of the supplementary material which may imply that sulfate reduction is not an important process unexpectedly diversified results were obtained for samples representing leachates from the old and new landfills of the former chemical plant in tarnowskie góry values of δ18o of so4 2 derived from two samples of direct leachates from a new landfill c1 and c2 were 2 0 and 4 0 and results of δ34s were 12 2 and 9 2 while so4 2 concentrations were 61 and 340 mg l respectively table s7 of the supplementary material in the case of samples representing groundwater strongly influenced by leachates from old landfills c3 c4 and c5 the δ18o values were in the range from 2 8 to 9 5 and values of δ34s ranged from 4 2 to 9 8 whereas so4 2 concentrations were in the range of 460 1 116 mg l the results showed high heterogeneity of the isotope composition of sulfate in the leachates as well as huge heterogeneity of sulfate loads in individual regions of the former chemical plant 3 2 river water the results of isotopic analyses of so4 2 in samples of water from the rivers in the upper silesian urban area showed diversified sources of so4 2 a dominant population of samples six samples revealed isotopic signatures of so4 2 typical of sewage δ18o in the range of 2 6 to 5 6 and values of δ34s from 0 5 to 4 4 fig 7 table s8 of the supplementary material indeed the samples come from the rivers which receive discharges of treated and untreated wastewater a distinctive result was obtained for the sample r8 which represented a river receiving discharges of water drained from a hard coal mine mine water recharge periodically a surface water reservoir which adjoins the heap of post mining wastes isotopic composition of so4 2 in a water sample taken from this reservoir p6 showed similarity to the sample r8 it is noteworthy that the values of δ34s and δ18o in samples p6 and r8 are different from the samples collected in a zn pb ore mine m1 m5 two other samples r3 and r9 characterized with distinctive isotopic signature of so4 2 represent water from rivers being recipients of mine water as well as leachates from a number of heaps the r3 sample δ18o 0 8 δ34s 9 6 was taken in the area of discharge of zn pb ore mine water and the results obtained for the r3 sample are very similar to isotope signature of so4 2 in mine water in particular to the sample m5 the r9 sample represents water from a river running through a landscape covered with heaps it was taken in the vicinity of a leachate pond at a huge mine waste dump named smolnica p3 fig 1 although the so4 2 isotopes are quite similar for these two samples r9 and p3 it seems that so4 2 in the r9 may originate from a larger number of sources apart from that concentrations of so4 2 differ significantly from 430 mg l in river water r9 to 1 800 mg l in pond water p3 the last sample of this type r10 was collected from a canal flowing into the brynica river water in the canal comes from an area of allotments and a heat and power plant the results of isotopic analysis of sulfate δ18o 2 5 δ34s 6 0 differ from other surface water samples also from the sewage isotope signature and probably represent a different source of so4 2 3 3 groundwater chemistry groundwater of the gliwice aquifer represents a fairly consistent water type based on min 20 of ion contribution most samples belong to ca mg hco3 so4 and ca mg hco3 water types which is consistent with a predominant circulation in limestone and dolomite only one sample w12 represents a ca na hco3 cl type a piper diagram presenting ratios of the major cations and anions in groundwater from the gliwice aquifer shows fairly consistent distribution of major ions fig 8 the outstanding groundwater samples are w6 w7 and w12 located in the town center and thus exhibiting a higher fraction of so4 2 and cl in the anionic composition on the other hand the w10 sample shows the highest proportion of bicarbonate compared with other anions the sample shows the lowest value of electrical conductivity and the lowest concentrations of most analyzed constituents therefore it can be considered as the most natural groundwater sample and it can be easily found in the following graphs figs 9 10 in the lower left corner an interesting finding from the study of groundwater chemistry is that groundwater salinity represented by electrical conductivity strongly correlates with cl r2 0 86 fig 9 which may result from the fact that human activity is the major factor controlling groundwater quality in the study area sulfate concentration is not so well correlated with electrical conductivity r2 0 66 fig 9 comparison of cl and na with so4 2 concentration in groundwater samples fig 10 reveals that these anions have similar sources but one sample w12 is distinguished from the others by elevated concentration of cl and na the w12 sample is located in the industrial part of tarnowskie góry thus it represents a specific source of contamination the situation is even more complicated when taking into account the relationship between no3 and so4 2 in groundwater sampled across the aquifer fig 10 it is clear that no3 concentrations do not follow the pattern characteristic of so4 2 cl and na the highest concentration of no3 was observed in the samples w13 and w17 located in tarnowskie góry these two observation wells are surrounded by arable fields in the vicinity of the triassic outcrops thus no3 most probably comes from agricultural activities this means that the observed chemical composition of groundwater in the gliwice aquifer is a result of many factors affecting the groundwater environment 3 4 so4 2 isotopes in groundwater groundwater samples taken from the gliwice carbonate aquifer show diversified isotopic signature of so4 2 δ34s 2 7 3 7 and δ18o 2 5 2 3 fig 11 table s9 of the supplementary material in general three populations can be distinguished based on the results obtained in 2018 including one dominant group most groundwater samples are characterized by the isotopic composition of so4 2 typical for wastewater the δ18o values for these samples are in the range of 1 7 to 5 5 while the range of δ34s values is narrower from 0 4 to 4 3 the origin of so4 2 from wastewater is very likely mainly due to the fact that most of the groundwater samples were taken in residential and industrial areas at the time of groundwater sampling 2018 most of the town was already connected to a sewage system however in many parts of the town the sewage system had been built shortly before the research was carried out in addition there is a possibility that wastewater may seep into the groundwater from leaking sewer systems farther studies including analyses of such additional tracers as e coli pharmaceuticals and personal care products should be conducted in the future to investigate an impact of wastewater on groundwater in this area it is noteworthy that one sample collected from the area of the former chemical plant c5 lies very close to this dominant groundwater group on the diagram fig 11 it is probable that at least some of the groundwater samples located close to the c5 sample represent influence of old landfills of the chemical plant on groundwater the other two groups of samples differ quite clearly from this population two samples w8 and w11 revealed elevated values of both isotopes δ18o results were 7 2 and 8 4 and δ34s values were 10 1 and 11 5 respectively such results may indicate the origin of so4 2 from landfill leachates or from two sources mixed dissolution of evaporitic minerals such as gypsum or anhydrite and sewage concentrations of so4 2 in these two samples are not high and were only 70 mg l and 61 mg l respectively redox potential measured in the field was different for both samples in the case of w8 eh was 126 5 mv with a concentration of oxygen equal to 1 14 mg l whereas for the w11 sample eh was 13 mv suggesting more reducing conditions but o2 concentration was higher 3 3 mg l however it seems that the measurement of oxygen content could have been influenced by several factors e g by operation of a well pump which could inject air together with pumped water or the measurement itself could have been made with the water not properly isolated from the atmosphere previous research conducted at this well in 2010 indicated a minimum oxygen content of 0 2 mg l jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2017 analysis of the land use in the vicinity of the wells as well as the depth of the wells screens leads to the following conclusions in the case of the w8 sample the well is 167 m deep and the borehole is an open hole at the depth from 101 to 167 m the well is located in the town center close to the historic mining excavations to the depth of several dozen meters the aquifer here is unconfined and it is very likely that multiple sulfate sources may play an important role in the evolution of groundwater chemistry evaporitic minerals present in the triassic formations sewage infiltrating from the surface and possibly sulfidic minerals present in the middle triassic limestones and dolomites an interesting fact is that in a distance of several dozens of meters there is a historic mine shaft w7 56 m deep now used as a source of potable water the isotopic signature of so4 2 extracted from the w7 sample suggests sewage as the most probable source and so4 2 concentration is 172 mg l comparison of these two samples w7 and w8 shows vertical differentiation of groundwater chemistry and a strong influence of human activity on groundwater quality the situation is quite different in the case of the w11 groundwater sample the sample was taken from a 250 m deep well with a screen placed at a depth of 109 to 237 m the borehole is located away from the urban area where the aquifer is confined by a 50 meter layer of miocene clays which implies reducing conditions in the aquifer it is probable that bacterial sulfate reduction altered the original isotopic signature of so4 2 in the w11 sample however the presence of dissolved oxygen and nitrate in groundwater suggests that sulfate reducing conditions were not prevailing throughout the groundwater flow path to the well or the collected sample due to over 100 m long screen consists of groundwater fractions that experienced different environmental and human pressures therefore possible sources of sulfate in the w11 sample are dissolution of evaporitic minerals of marine origin if bsr did not significantly alter the original sulfate isotopes wastewater or manure the last two groundwater samples w1 and w16 are characterized by lower values of δ18o and δ34s compared to all other groundwater samples the results of δ18o were 0 2 and 1 2 while δ34s were equal to 4 8 and 2 0 respectively the most probable source of sulfate in these two samples is oxidation of sulfide minerals of terrestrial origin fig 12 shows relationship between so4 2 concentration and δ34s and δ18o in groundwater samples the samples presenting distinct isotopic signatures of so4 2 are marked in the graphs w8 and w11 have elevated values of δ34s and δ18o while w1 and w16 have negative values of δ34s and δ18o all the groundwater samples present typical so4 2 concentration between 50 and 112 mg l except for two samples w6 and w7 having relatively high so4 2 concentration 185 7 mg l and 193 6 mg l respectively they are located in the industrial zone of tarnowskie góry and represent direct impact of human activities related to the town management mainly leakage of wastewater it seems that groundwater infiltrating within the town contains elevated so4 2 which is being diluted as it travels downgradient and mixes with groundwater recharged outside of the town no significant correlation was observed between δ34s and or δ18o values and so4 2 concentration in groundwater which is commonly provided as an argument for bacterial sulfate reduction krouse and mayer 2000 bsr results in enrichment in heavy isotopes of o and s in the remaining unreacted so4 2 clark and fritz 1997 the reported slopes of lines characteristic of bsr on the δ18o vs δ34s plot for the remaining so4 2 are between 0 26 and 0 48 gammons et al 2013 for the study area the observed slope is 0 56 fig 11 which is above the provided range and suggests that bsr does not account for the observed variation in the isotopic composition of so4 2 across the investigated part of the gliwice aquifer two rivers running across the study area stoła and drama are also plotted in the diagram fig 12 the δ34s and δ18o values of both rivers are similar and typical for wastewater and for the majority of groundwater samples but concentrations of so4 2 are lower in the drama river compared to the stoła river two outstanding groundwater samples w6 and w7 show so4 2 concentration similar to the stoła river and in fact the river flows across the industrial zone of tarnowskie góry near the two wells previous studies in the area of tarnowskie góry e g kowalczyk 2003b showed that stoła is a recipient of multiple wastewater discharges including industrial sewage furthermore stoła was proven to be locally a losing stream it is clear that groundwater samples collected from the w6 and w7 wells represent a direct impact of industrial and municipal wastewater another finding to support this conclusion is significant contamination of these samples with tce max concentration of 230 µg l in w7 and pce up to 297 µg l in w6 groundwater contamination with tce and pce in tarnowskie góry was a subject of a number of investigation e g kowalczyk et al 2001 jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2020 it was found that these halocarbons came from a few sources located in the industrial zone of tarnowskie góry a former garrison laundry and at least one industrial plant although the present study did not show the presence of tce and pce in the water collected from the stoła river previous research revealed trace concentration of these halocarbons in the stoła river up to 0 3 µg l of tce and up to 2 5 µg l of pce kowalczyk et al 2001 such concentrations confirm the impact of industrial wastewater on the quality of the stoła river in the past tce and pce concentrations in other groundwater samples are much lower compared to the samples w6 and w7 table s9 of the supplementary material but the presence of these compounds indicates progressing migration in the gliwice aquifer the presented results and their interpretation based on the new isotopic data of anthropogenic sources of sulfate are not consistent with the results of similar studies published in 2017 by jakóbczyk karpierz et al in the previous research isotopic composition of so4 2 in groundwater sampled from the gliwice aquifer was compared with the literature data on isotopic signature of typical sulfate sources as a result it was concluded that so4 2 came mainly from agricultural sources as the arable fields are located east of the tarnowskie góry town in the recharge zone of the gliwice aquifer this study revealed that synthetic fertilizers used in poland have distinct values of δ18o and δ34s in sulfate which precludes its dominant role in sulfate origin nevertheless livestock manure spread temporarily on arable fields may contribute to the enrichment of groundwater in sulfate as the isotopic signature of manure is consistent with isotopic composition of so4 2 found in some groundwater samples 4 conclusions the results of studies on isotopic composition of selected anthropogenic sources of sulfate in the upper silesian urban area showed the importance of studying local sources especially in the context of a large impact of human activity on groundwater quality the isotopic composition of sulfate in wastewater in the study area is much more homogeneous and consistent compared to the range formed based on literature data from different parts of the world also the results obtained for synthetic fertilizers are different from the other sulfate sources and the range is more narrow compared to the compilations from around the world conducted analysis of δ34s and δ18o enabled defining more precise ranges for isotopic signatures of anthropogenic sources specific to the upper silesian urban area and thus facilitating the assessment of so4 2 origin in the gliwice carbonate aquifer the presented study includes isotopic analyses of pollution sources scattered within a significant part of the usua and adjacent areas this allows the results of δ34s and δ18o to be used in further research on other aquifers within the region studies of the isotopic composition of so4 2 in rivers of the usua indicate that wastewater is the major source of this ion in river water however some rivers are major recipients of mine water discharges from zn pb ore and coal mines the isotopic composition of so4 2 in drainage water from these two types of mines differs significantly as many rivers within the usua are losing streams due to mining activities surface water can significantly influence groundwater quality therefore in addition to typical anthropogenic sources it is crucial to apply isotopic studies to surface water especially in heavily urbanized and industrialized areas the results of studies on groundwater from the gliwice aquifer indicate that the main source of so4 2 in groundwater is wastewater it is also possible that in the area of tarnowskie góry leachate from the landfills of the former chemical plant is another potential so4 2 source few samples indicate the origin of sulfate from natural dissolution of sulfate minerals or oxidation of sulfides it is also difficult to exclude sulfate reduction as an important process affecting sulfate isotopic composition for some sampling points groundwater contamination with trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene observed particularly in the industrial part of tarnowskie góry confirms strong influence of industrial leachates on the groundwater quality many factors and processes may govern the groundwater chemistry in the study area one important conclusion from the study is that isotopic investigation of sulfate alone is not sufficient in identifying sources of groundwater pollution in urban areas the results of the research highlight the importance of multiple analyses and combination of stable isotopes and chemical studies in a proper assessment of contaminants fate and the origin of groundwater chemical composition credit authorship contribution statement sabina jakóbczyk karpierz conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation

2985,isotopic signatures of anthropogenic sulfate sources within the upper silesian urban area southern poland were investigated to increase the reliability of the origin assessment of groundwater contaminants to analyze δ34s and δ18o in sulfate 64 samples were collected representing several sulfate sources synthetic and organic fertilizers raw and treated wastewater mine water leachate from landfills mine heaps and industrial waste dumps additionally 10 surface water samples were taken from contaminated rivers regarded as potential groundwater pollution sources results of δ34s and δ18o in sulfate derived from anthropogenic sources were compared with literature data which indicated significant discrepancies for some contamination sources the results were applied to assess so4 2 origin in groundwater samples from the gliwice aquifer apart from the δ34s and δ18o data the study included measurements of major ions inorganic nitrogen forms trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene in groundwater isotopic analyses of river water samples confirmed the impact of urbanized and industrialized areas on surface water pollution and possible influence on groundwater contamination the values of δ34s and δ18o similar to wastewater were reported for most groundwater samples from the gliwice carbonate aquifer groundwater contamination was also manifested by higher values of electrical conductivity and concentrations of chloride sodium trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene the comparison of recent isotopic data on so4 2 sources with literature values clearly shows that it is very important to investigate local potential contamination sources to increase their reliability in determining the source of groundwater or river water pollution keywords contamination sulfate isotopes groundwater protection poland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction proper management of drinking water resources requires recognition of threats to water quality groundwater resources are less vulnerable to pollution compared to surface water but in case of pollution it is much more difficult to find the source of contamination cook and herczeg 2000 appelo et al 2005 pinder and celia 2006 edmunds et al 2008 a very useful tool applied by researchers for decades is isotopic analysis of contaminants the method is based on the fact that many predominant pollution sources present different sometimes unique isotopic signatures krouse and mayer 2000 bottrell et al 2008 aravena and mayer 2009 sulfate is not considered a toxic component of water but its excessive amounts result in deterioration of drinking water quality due to the influence on hardness and taste as well as its potential effect on causing diarrhea moreover elevated concentration of so4 2 causes corrosion in water pipelines and concrete materials trettin et al 2002 choi et al 2011 witczak et al 2013 the common drinking water limit for so4 2 concentration is 250 mg l who 2011 based on the taste and odor issues sulfate in groundwater comes from both natural pyrite oxidation gypsum dissolution soil sulfate atmospheric deposition and anthropogenic wastewater organic and synthetic fertilizers and industrial wastes sources e g clark and fritz 1997 krouse and mayer 2000 puig et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 isotopic composition of so4 2 molecules in the aquatic environment is a subject to measurable natural variations that result in specific isotopic signatures of so4 2 derived from different sources bottrell et al 2008 in oxidizing conditions when bacterial sulfate reduction does not occur oxygen and sulfur isotopes in so4 2 are resistant to exchange processes in groundwater on timescales of 10 100 ka in the near neutral ph range lloyd 1967 under anaerobic conditions sulfate reducing microorganisms use so4 2 as an electron acceptor for respiration the bacterial sulfate reduction bsr to sulfur or sulfide is a principal process responsible for isotope fractionation enriching 34s and 18o in the remaining sulfate as sulfate concentrations decrease clark and fritz 1997 canfield 2001 isotopic studies of sulfate have been used in hydrogeology for many decades e g claypool et al 1980 cortecci et al 1981 taylor et al 1984 fouillac et al 1990 strebel et al 1990 bottrell et al 1991 trembaczowski 1991 habicht and canfield 1997 moncaster et al 2000 dogramaci et al 2001 knöller and schubert 2010 caschetto et al 2017 pittalis et al 2018 biddau et al 2019 torres martinez et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 yet laboratory experiments on sulfur isotope geochemistry began much earlier thode et al 1949 trofimov 1949 researchers focused mainly on bacterial degradation of sulfate oxidation of sulfides isotopic signatures of sulfate originating from different sources and mixing of sulfate of different origin the achievements of researchers are widely used to trace sulfate fate in groundwater environment to evaluate the effectiveness of measures for mitigation of groundwater degradation or to assess the origin of sulfate observed in groundwater especially in the context of anthropogenic impact on groundwater quality isotopic investigation of sulfate sources in groundwater is crucial for the proper assessment of anthropogenic impact on groundwater quality while isotopic studies of natural sulfate sources such as evaporite minerals sulfide minerals or soil sulfur have been performed widely the isotopic signatures of anthropogenic sources have been investigated relatively less frequently therefore researchers worldwide very often use literature data e g puig et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 which in the case of anthropogenic sources can lead to misinterpretations of the origin of sulfate dissolved in groundwater in urban areas this is mostly because of regional differences in isotopic signatures of sulfate in such pollution sources as wastewater e g bottrell et al 2008 shin et al 2015 or synthetic fertilizers e g cravotta 1997 shin et al 2015 the aim of this study was to investigate isotopic signature of selected anthropogenic sulfate sources in the most urbanized and industrialized region of poland and then to compare the results with literature data from other parts of the world the idea of this study came from the fact that the results of isotopic studies of anthropogenic sources published so far were sometimes very varied and within wide ranges which did not allow for proper assessment of the origin of pollution the results of the study were applied to determine sources of groundwater contamination based on the isotopic composition of sulfate in a triassic carbonate aquifer located in the upper silesian urban area in southern poland 2 materials and methods 2 1 upper silesian urban area the upper silesian urban area usua of the total area approx 2850 km2 is located in southern poland in the northern part of the upper silesian coal basin fig 1 the region is one of the most industrialized areas in europe mainly because of large deposits of hard coal but also because of high concentration of other industries like power production mostly coal fired power plants metal electromechanical and chemical industrial plants apart from the industrial character of the usua the land use of the region is dominated by agriculture clc 2018 one of the most adverse effects of mining and industrial activities is the presence of anthropogenic wastelands such as mine heaps and waste dumps which are scattered all over the region lewińska preis et al 2021 nádudvari et al 2021 the specific land use and development result in a diverse range of contamination sources including point sources e g septic tanks point sewage discharges landfills and nonpoint sources of pollution e g agricultural operations highway run off leaky sewer pipes gas emission from an industrial plant into the atmosphere różkowski 2008 the upper silesian urban area lies in a basin between the vistula and oder rivers their tributaries are usually low gradient streams and the watershed runs across the central part of the region the long term anthropogenic pressures strongly affected the surface water environment the significant changes relate physical properties and chemical composition of river water and characteristics of watercourses wastewater including mine water industrial and municipal sewage accounts for a large proportion of the total river discharge in addition due to mining activities numerous rivers turned into losing streams and thus polluted surface water influences groundwater quality in many parts of the region cabała et al 2004 bondaruk et al 2015 anthropogenic activities in the usua also led to changes in regional climatic conditions manifested by increased precipitation temperature and air pollution continuous measurements of air quality in the usua conducted by the chief inspectorate of environmental protection over the past 20 years have shown that so2 concentration has been decreasing significantly https powietrze gios gov pl annual average air concentrations of so2 in a measuring station in katowice have declined from about 40 µg dm3 in 2001 to 7 µg dm3 in 2020 the regional climatic changes are related to high emissions associated with the generation of thermal energy steam and by products of combustion processes which indirectly affect the quality of the water environment różkowski et al 1997 the distinctive feature of the silesian geology is carboniferous coal bearing deposits overlaid primarily by triassic carbonate deposits and quaternary clastic sediments różkowski 2004 the quaternary aquifers are influenced by many anthropogenic activities which results in significant groundwater contamination in many parts of the region therefore most of the local well fields abstract groundwater from the triassic aquifers which constitutes the important drinking water source in the region kowalczyk 2003a 2 2 the gliwice aquifer the groundwater samples were taken from the gliwice carbonate aquifer fig 2 located in the western part of the upper silesian urban area the aquifer is composed of limestones and dolomites of a maximum thickness of 200 m the gliwice aquifer consists of two layers middle and lower triassic fig 3 initially separated by marls and subsequently connected hydraulically due to diagenetic processes and anthropogenic activities mining and boreholes the recharge zone of the aquifer is located in the eastern part fig 2 where the triassic carbonate rocks outcrop or are covered by permeable or semi permeable quaternary deposits with a thickness ranging from a few meters up to 40 m różkowski 1990 kowalczyk 2003a the aquifer is confined in the northern and western parts under natural conditions groundwater flow direction was from the north east towards the south west however flow patterns have been considerably changed by intensive water abstraction by large well fields for supplying local residents with drinking water more detailed characteristics of the aquifer can be found in the previous papers about the research area jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2017 jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2020 groundwater samples were collected from 12 production wells three piezometers one historic mine shaft one outlet of historic mine adit the black trout adit and from a pond filled with drainage water in a closed dolomite quarry the wells and piezometers differ in depths and screen intervals table 1 the piezometers are 42 49 m deep and their screens are placed in the middle triassic layer muschelkalk in turn the wells have a wider range of depths i e from 47 5 to 245 m and are screened at different stratigraphic layers sometimes they screen two triassic layers middle and lower triassic together fig 3 as the screens of production wells are considerably longer up to 145 m than the screens of piezometers the samples collected from the wells represent a mixture of groundwater recharged over a wide area and having relatively diversified residence times it poses huge difficulties in interpreting the origin of so4 2 and other water constituents nevertheless the research so far revealed spatial differentiation of groundwater chemistry in the area of the tarnowskie góry town being more important than the depth related gradients jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2020 2 3 sampling and analyses samples representing anthropogenic sources of sulfate surface water and groundwater were collected in the period of 4 april to 5 july 2018 the collected samples represent the following sources of sulfate synthetic fertilizers used in agriculture and horticulture 11 samples municipal and domestic wastewater treated and untreated 25 samples leachate from municipal landfills 9 samples leachate from heaps of mine and metallurgical wastes 6 samples mine water 5 samples organic fertilizers pig and poultry manure 3 samples leachate from the landfills of the former chemical plant in tarnowskie góry 5 samples the study attempted to collect precipitation samples for analysis of sulfate isotopic composition but the sulfate concentration was very low therefore the authors concluded that rainwater is not a significant source of so4 2 in groundwater in the study area and eventually excluded it from the study 2 4 synthetic fertilizers the 11 fertilizer samples can be classified into two groups based on their use the first group samples f1 f7 represents fertilizers used for extensive farming mostly for soil fertilization the second group samples f8 f11 incudes fertilizers used for horticulture or lawn fertilization the samples f5 f7 and f8 represent simple fertilizers consisting of mg k and fe sulfate respectively the remaining samples represent compound fertilizers where sulfur is a secondary nutrient of varying content in the samples f1 f2 f4 and f9 the sulfur compounds constitute from 5 to 10 much higher content of sulfur compounds 18 5 26 is declared for the fertilizer samples f3 f6 f10 and f11 table s1 in the supplementary materials all samples were collected from commercial suppliers in poland the solid samples were dissolved in distilled water stirred for 24 h and filtered 2 5 wastewater this type of sulfate source was collected as grab samples of treated and untreated wastewater from seven wastewater treatment plants and three samples s4 s13 and s14 represent untreated sewage discharged directly to local rivers seven wastewater treatment plants represent different types of treatment technologies and different capacity of sewage treated per day from 1 500 to 65 000 m3 d the smaller ones treat only household sewage from small areas whereas the biggest ones treat domestic and industrial wastewater from several town districts the samples were collected in 1 5 l plastic bottles and kept cold during transport to the laboratory in the laboratory the untreated sewage samples were centrifuged to remove the coarse fraction and were subsequently filtered through a whatman fiberglass filter of 1 5 μm pore size the samples of treated sewage were filtered through both types of filters of 1 5 μm and 0 45 μm pore size 2 6 landfill leachate samples of landfill leachate were initially taken from the collectors of pristine leachate drained from beneath the landfill body unfortunately it turned out that no sulfate sulfur was present in the samples due to extremely low redox conditions to find out the isotopic signatures of s and o in sulfate coming from the landfill the authors decided to collect water from the surface reservoirs of leachates or from the ponds being in a direct lateral contact with old reclaimed landfills samples l4 l9 in addition three contaminated groundwater samples l1 l3 from the piezometers of the monitoring network of the unsealed landfill were taken as the samples resembled direct impact of the leachates on groundwater 2 7 leachates from post mining and metallurgical waste the silesian region is characterized by numerous heaps of post mining and metallurgical waste part of them contains mixed waste sometimes with addition of municipal waste because most of them were formed decades ago when there were no regulations on landfills in poland the waste dumps in the usua usually contain a few percent of coal bearing rocks sandstones siltstones and claystones that contain organic matter fe sulfides and carbonates exothermic oxidation of organic matter called self heating and the subsequent accumulation of heat energy within the dump may lead to self ignition intensified by pyrite marcasite or siderite oxidation high temperature changes in coal wastes affected by fire revealed alterations known as combustion metamorphism stracher et al 2011 2015 the mineral composition of coal wastes reflects the primary composition of gangue rocks and minerals associated with coal seams thermally affected parts of the dumps are composed mainly of cristobalite tridymite celsian anorthite cordierite indialite mullite olivine augite spinel group hematite and glass subordinate phases are often represented by chalcopyrite fe oxides elemental lead and zns exhalating phases with sal ammoniac elemental sulfur and k mg fe nh4 al sulfates and chlorides are blooming around vents of relatively low temperature fumarole ciesielczuk et al 2014 pierwoła et al 2018 nádudvari et al 2021 gypsum and jarosite are also found as a result of weathering processes ciesielczuk 2015 wastes accumulated at a dump containing predominantly slags from an old smelting plant are composed of oxides spinel hematite zincite silicates and aluminosilicates e g olivine pyroxene nepheline plagioclase and k feldspar sulfides pyrrhotite rudashevskyite galena metallic phases pure iron and iron arsenic mixture and secondary phases like gypsum or apatite warchulski et al 2015 for this study six samples of surface water representing impact of such heaps were collected the samples were taken from the reservoir supplied by the heap drainage water sample p1 and from ponds recharged by seepage water from the heaps samples p2 p6 the actual impact of the leachates on the sampled pond water was confirmed by the extreme concentration of sulfate or by the elevated ph 9 0 in the case of low sulfate concentration 2 8 mine water within the project five groundwater samples were collected from one closed zn pb ore mine which was still dewatered due to the hard coal mining activity carried out below in the past the mine exploited zn pb ores from the ore bearing dolomites of the middle triassic age the ores include both oxidized calamine deposits and sulfide minerals sphalerite and galena banks et al 2020 four water samples were taken from two galleries samples m1 m4 and one sample was collected from a discharge channel m5 on the surface 2 9 organic fertilizers during the project lifetime april july 2018 many samples of solid and liquid manure were taken to extract water soluble sulfate the liquid samples were filtered through a whatman fiberglass filter of 1 5 μm pore size whereas solid samples were soaked in distilled water for 24 h average δ18o of the distilled water was 9 5 the soak procedure was performed for 3 day old manure and for 11 day old samples to see any changes resulting from the increasing time of exposure to the atmosphere unfortunately most of the samples did not contain sulfate sulfur only in two cases sulfate in water was found poultry and pig solid manure samples of1 and of2 represent water extract from the 3 day old manure of both poultry and pig origin while samples of3 and of4 represent water extract of 11 day old poultry manure 2 10 wastes of the former chemical plant waste of the chemical plant in tarnowskie góry closed since the 1990 s pose a huge threat to groundwater quality in the study area to obtain reliable information on the isotopic signature of s and o in sulfate coming from both types of waste stored in the new landfill as well as the remaining in the soil five different samples were collected samples c1 and c2 represent leachate from the new landfill taken from the two different collectors samples c3 c4 and c5 are groundwater collected from three observation wells representing a strong impact of the waste remaining in the soil as confirmed by their location and elevated electrical conductivity of sampled groundwater 2 11 surface water samples ten surface water samples were collected from six rivers and one canal in the period of 25 april to 1 july 2018 the rivers were selected in a way to investigate different pressures on surface water quality some rivers are recipients of mainly municipal and domestic wastewater or a mixture of industrial and municipal sewage other receive the input of mine drainage water four river water samples r1 r2 r4 and r5 were additionally analyzed for chemical composition including major ions inorganic nitrogen forms trichloroethene tce and tetrachloroethene pce 2 12 groundwater samples a total of 18 groundwater samples were collected from the gliwice aquifer in the period of 11 april to 28 june 2018 all groundwater samples were filtered in the field through a millipore membrane filter of 0 45 μm pore size after filtering the samples were divided one aliquot was used for analyses of major and minor ions another aliquot was used for isotopic investigation of sulfate additional samples of unfiltered groundwater were collected in dark glass bottles for analysis of trichloroethene tce and tetrachloroethene pce the following parameters of groundwater were determined in the field ph and eh measured with an eurosensor epp 1 and an eurosensor eptagp 323 w electrodes respectively connected to a cp 401 elmetron ph meter electrical conductivity ec 60

of tce and pce were analyzed at the laboratory of the voivodship sanitary and epidemiological station in katowice using a method of gas chromatography with electron capture detection gc ecd accuracy and precision of 5 all liquid samples were filtered through a millipore membrane filter of 0 45 μm pore size unless otherwise described after filtering all samples sources of sulfate contamination surface water and groundwater were acidified to ph of around 2 0 by adding hcl and subsequently sulfates were precipitated as baso4 by adding an appropriate volume of 10 solution of bacl2 the samples were transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c for 24 h to allow precipitate to settle down in the laboratory the samples were centrifuged before removing decanted water then the baso4 residue was washed using distilled water until cl was completely removed after that the baso4 precipitate was dried out at 103 c for 24 h subsequently δ18o was analyzed using a flash ea 1112ht elemental

the analyses of stable isotopes of sulfate were performed by the stable isotope laboratory of the institute of geological sciences polish academy of sciences notation of the results is expressed in

isotopic analysis of sulfate extracted from anthropogenic sources of groundwater pollution are provided in tables s1 s9 of the supplementary material statistical summary of the obtained results are provided in table 2 3 1 anthropogenic sources of sulfate among the obtained results for so4 2 derived from anthropogenic pollution sources isotopic composition of synthetic fertilizers δ34s 3 0 6 4

3 2 1 5 organic fertilizers δ34s 3 5 2 5 δ18o 2 0 0 8 and leachates from heaps δ34s 4 0 3 3 δ18o 5 4 2 3 turned out to be quite similar a characteristic feature of synthetic fertilizers is high values of δ18o from 9 0 to 14 6 whereas δ34s ranged from 1 2 to 9 4 fig 4 table s1 of the supplementary material the only result deviating from the others was obtained for a sample f4 representing fertilizer for which values of δ18o and δ34s were 7 6 and 14 2 respectively the difference may be due to a different substrates used for the fertilizer s production the result of δ34s for this sample shows the lowest value among the currently investigated fertilizers but also among the literature data literature data on isotopic signature of sulfur and oxygen in fertilizers show relatively large variation table 3 cravotta 1997 presented the largest number of original results of δ34s in total sulfur present in soil surface water and fertilizers 28 samples in total his data revealed a great variation in δ34s in fertilizers from 0 5 to 19 9 while the soil and stream water samples taken from fertilized land showed the results in the range of 3 3 to 8 4 vitoria et al 2004 provided a widely referenced study on isotopic signature of sulfate in synthetic fertilizers they found a considerable variation in δ34s from 6 4 to 21 4 and a narrower range of δ18o from 7 7 to 16 5 while the δ18o values are similar to the present results the sulfur isotopes show a higher proportion of 34s shin et al 2015 analyzed five samples of fertilizers and found δ34s in the range of 7 6 to 2 6 which is considerably lower than the dominant group of the results of the present study but higher compared to the f4 sample zhang et al 2015 compiled the isotopic data from previous research references therein where δ34s in fertilizers ranged from 3 1 to 20 7 whereas δ18o ranged from 7 5 to 20 1 the δ18o data from that study are more diversified compared to the present ones the presented differences in the isotopic composition of sulfur and oxygen derived from fertilizers all over the world result most probably from the different substrates of sulfur and different technologies applied by the manufacturers the fact that the dominant group of polish samples revealed relatively narrow ranges of δ18o from 9 0 to 14 6 and δ34s from 1 2 to 9 4 may result from more unified methods of production of synthetic fertilizers in poland and more homogeneous substrates for the production of fertilizers the sulfur substrates used by the polish manufacturers are mainly sulfuric vi acid mg sulfate monohydrate kieserite ammonium sulfate k sulfate or elemental sulfur e g kowal 2009 it is very difficult to compare the sources of sulfur in fertilizers all over the world because of the lack of information in the published papers the outstanding results obtained for the f4 sample indicate the need for further research on the isotopic composition of synthetic fertilizers produced in poland this particular manufacture was established in the place of the former sulfur mine in the tarnobrzeg town studies on the isotopic composition of elemental sulfur and sulfate sulfur from that area showed a wide range of results from 0 5 to 50 hałas and kurpiewski 1982 this is different from the result of the f4 sample δ34s 14 2 which suggests that other than local sources are used for fertilizer production these days sulfate extracted from manure revealed isotopic signature being different from synthetic fertilizers fig 4 table 2 the δ18o values were in the range from 0 9 to 2 8 while the δ34s values ranged from 3 0 to 8 3 table s2 of the supplementary material literature data on sulfur isotopes in animal manure both sulfate and total sulfur are more uniform compared to synthetic fertilizers otero et al 2007 reported a relatively narrow range of sulfur and oxygen isotopes in manure sulfate δ34s from 0 to 5 δ18o from 3 8 to 6 similarly to results of shin et al 2014 δ34s from 0 5 to 6 and δ18o from 3 5 to 10 other data compiled by zhang et al 2015 are in line with the present study δ34s from 3 2 to 6 4 also the study of cravotta 1997 produced relatively similar results even though he analyzed isotopic signature of total sulfur not sulfate the δ34s values ranged from 0 9 to 6 8 in manure samples this comparison shows that δ34s values in livestock manure from around the world are relatively homogeneous and the differences in δ18oso4 result most probably from variations in the local δ18o of water molecules that take part in the oxidation of sulfur present in the manure samples representing leakage from municipal and industrial landfills are characterized by high values of both δ18o and δ34s the obtained results are in the range of 6 7 to 13 4 for δ18o and from 10 9 to 25 6 for δ34s fig 5 table s3 of the supplementary material concentration of sulfate in these samples ranged from 68 to 1760 mg l isotopic signature of sulfate originating from landfill leachates turned out to be most similar to sulfate coming from dissolution of evaporitic minerals like gypsum claypool et al 1980 cortecci et al 1981 krouse and mayer 2000 which makes differentiation between these two sources more difficult moreover it is difficult to assess if these results characterize the original isotopic composition of sulfate coming from the leachates not subjected to microbial reduction processes the analysis of pristine leachate samples taken directly from the landfill installation showed the absence of sulfate sulfur therefore the authors decided to sample surface water and groundwater influenced by the leachates as they contained so4 2 ion because the leachates initially did not contain sulfate sulfur and then sulfate appeared later in the leachates or in groundwater surface water influenced by leachates it is probable that sulfate originated from the oxidation of reduced forms of sulfur from the landfill an argument for the lack of sulfate biodegradation is the presence of oxygen in the investigated samples on the other hand an argument for the impact of bsr on the observed isotopic composition of so4 2 are relatively high values of δ18o from 6 7 to 13 4 based on the collected data it is difficult to assess if the obtained isotopic signature of sulfate in leachates and water directly influenced by leachates is original and unmodified by subsequent biodegradation processes results of isotopic analyses of sulfate in landfill leachate are not very common in the literature van breukelen et al 2003 provided a range of δ34s values from 3 3 to 9 1 for seven groundwater samples influenced by landfill leachate including one sample upstream the contamination plume and one below the plume the authors concluded the meteoric origin of sulfate in the analyzed samples sulfate in the ore mine drainage water revealed low values of δ18o being in the range of 3 1 to 0 9 whereas δ34s ranged from 0 3 to 9 2 fig 5 table s4 of the supplementary material sulfate concentration ranged from 980 to 2560 mg l the data come from a single mine and cannot be used separately as an indicator of sulfate source the results are in line with the reported isotopic composition of zn pb ores occurring in the area of the investigated mine harańczyk 1993 literature data on mine water most often refer to acid mine drainage amd among many published studies gammons et al 2010 presented δ34s results for water influenced by amd in the range from 16 1 to 9 3 and δ18o from 12 5 to 9 1 migaszewski et al 2008 reported even lower values of δ34s from 22 3 to 11 1 whereas δ18o values showed significant enrichment in the heavier isotope from 4 4 to 1 1 the subsequent study on amd water performed by migaszewski et al 2018 showed new ranges of δ34s from 17 31 to 5 31 and δ18o from 11 07 to 1 12 all these studies confirmed a strong relation between isotopic composition of so4 2 in amd water and δ34s values observed in mineral sulfides mostly pyrite this indicates that in the case of mine water as a major source of groundwater contamination it is extremely important to study local isotopic signatures of sulfur in minerals as a basis for interpretation of groundwater pollution sources a very interesting and comprehensive study on mine water in the upper silesian coal basin was performed by pluta 2002 she analyzed 41 samples of hard coal mine water in terms of sulfate isotopes and obtained a number of different results depending on the sulfur form present in the rock matrix the δ34s data ranged from 4 7 to 40 8 and the δ18o ranged from 0 7 to 20 6 the author distinguished five major groups of water samples differing in sulfate origin based on the isotopic composition i dissolution of evaporitic minerals e g gypsum or anhydrite of permian triassic jurrasic cretaceous and neogene age ii sulfate from evaporitic minerals that were subjected to bacterial reduction iii oxidation of sulfides coming from bacterial reduction of sulfate from evaporites dating from permian to neogene iv sulfur from atmospheric deposition and v oxidation of sulfides characterized by negative values of δ34s sulfate concentrations in the analyzed samples ranged from 45 to 3 820 mg l and the highest concentrations were observed in the samples subjected to bsr in the case of leachates from heaps of post mining and metallurgical wastes the values of δ34s fitted in a narrow range from 2 5 to 4 3 while δ18o data showed a greater range from 2 1 to 7 6 fig 5 table s5 of the supplemental files an exception was the sample p6 δ18o 6 6 δ34s 11 5 taken from a water reservoir located by the heap of post mining wastes but occasionally recharged by discharges of water from a hard coal mine therefore the isotopic composition of so4 2 in the p6 sample most probably represents sulfate in mine water the study showed that water leaching from industrial heaps has the highest concentration of so4 2 up to 7 000 mg l and electrical conductivity reaching 14 760 μs cm it appears that in areas such as the upper silesian urban area leachate from heaps of mine and metallurgical waste is potentially one of the most important sources of groundwater pollution because there are no data on the isotopic composition of sulfur in mine and metallurgical wastes in the usua it is difficult to clearly assess the relationship between the isotopic composition of so4 2 in leachates and sulfur in the waste material however it can be assumed that the waste is characterized by the sulfur present in the coal seams and associated rocks it is interesting to note that the range of results for sulfur isotopes in leachates is very small this is most likely due to the fact that the isotopes are averaged from a mixture of different forms of sulfur present in the waste originating from different mines and are subject not only to weathering but also to combustion processes thus the isotopic composition of so4 2 in heap leachates is not a unique and characteristic signature but rather represents an average value of the sulfur isotopic composition of the waste literature data on isotopic composition of so4 2 in leachate from mining and metallurgical wastes are much more limited compared to other contamination sources talavera mendoza et al 2016 published results of isotopic analyses of six samples of leachate discharge from mining wastes accumulated in tailings impoundments in taxco mexico the values of δ34s ranged from 4 6 to 2 3 which are depleted in 34s compared to the present study this is most probably because of the difference in the source rocks the results of the isotopic analysis of sulfate derived from wastewater are quite homogeneous which is more noticeable in the case of treated sewage samples s16 s25 the values of δ34s for raw wastewater range from 0 4 to 9 3 whereas for treated wastewater it is from 0 4 to 4 3 the values of δ18o for raw wastewater are in the range of 0 7 to 6 1 and in the case of treated wastewater from 1 9 to 5 9 fig 6 table s6 of the supplementary material sulfate concentration in raw wastewater 47 124 mg l was lower compared to treated wastewater 74 200 mg l a possible explanation for this is a common use of aluminum sulfate as a flocculation enhancer in the wastewater treatment plants sadowski et al 2018 isotopic composition of sulfate or total sulfur in wastewater has been studied by many researchers bottrell et al 2008 found the δ34s values of untreated sewage in the range of 5 to 12 35 and the δ18o in the range of 8 1 to 17 9 which are mostly out of the ranges within the present study similarly otero et al 2007 presented results different from the present study δ34s from 9 5 to 13 2 and δ18o from 9 8 to 10 8 as well as jurado et al 2013 who observed narrow ranges of isotopic signature of sewage sulfate δ34s from 7 3 to 9 9 δ18o from 10 9 to 11 8 the study of cravotta 1997 on isotopic composition of total sulfur in sewage effluents produced results similar to the present study δ34s from 3 5 to 6 4 whereas shin et al 2015 obtained the highest results of δ34s in two sewage samples 15 1 and 24 2 a possible explanation for the differences in δ34s and δ18o values in wastewater obtained from the literature and the present study may be an influence of bsr on the sulfate prior to precipitation to baso4 in the present study the time between sewage sampling and baso4 precipitation was a couple of hours usually 4 8 h which makes potential biodegradation of sulfate rather unlikely the other authors provided a general description of the applied methods without mentioning the sample storage time the longer storage time may potentially promote partial degradation of so4 2 in wastewater which is rich in organic material another explanation is an influence of bsr during wastewater treatment processes because commonly applied methods of wastewater treatment include an anoxic phase khanal and huang 2003 chan et al 2009 kowalik and bartkiewicz 2018 where sulfate reduction may take place in the present study the concentration of so4 2 in the treated wastewater is higher compared to the raw wastewater table s6 of the supplementary material which may imply that sulfate reduction is not an important process unexpectedly diversified results were obtained for samples representing leachates from the old and new landfills of the former chemical plant in tarnowskie góry values of δ18o of so4 2 derived from two samples of direct leachates from a new landfill c1 and c2 were 2 0 and 4 0 and results of δ34s were 12 2 and 9 2 while so4 2 concentrations were 61 and 340 mg l respectively table s7 of the supplementary material in the case of samples representing groundwater strongly influenced by leachates from old landfills c3 c4 and c5 the δ18o values were in the range from 2 8 to 9 5 and values of δ34s ranged from 4 2 to 9 8 whereas so4 2 concentrations were in the range of 460 1 116 mg l the results showed high heterogeneity of the isotope composition of sulfate in the leachates as well as huge heterogeneity of sulfate loads in individual regions of the former chemical plant 3 2 river water the results of isotopic analyses of so4 2 in samples of water from the rivers in the upper silesian urban area showed diversified sources of so4 2 a dominant population of samples six samples revealed isotopic signatures of so4 2 typical of sewage δ18o in the range of 2 6 to 5 6 and values of δ34s from 0 5 to 4 4 fig 7 table s8 of the supplementary material indeed the samples come from the rivers which receive discharges of treated and untreated wastewater a distinctive result was obtained for the sample r8 which represented a river receiving discharges of water drained from a hard coal mine mine water recharge periodically a surface water reservoir which adjoins the heap of post mining wastes isotopic composition of so4 2 in a water sample taken from this reservoir p6 showed similarity to the sample r8 it is noteworthy that the values of δ34s and δ18o in samples p6 and r8 are different from the samples collected in a zn pb ore mine m1 m5 two other samples r3 and r9 characterized with distinctive isotopic signature of so4 2 represent water from rivers being recipients of mine water as well as leachates from a number of heaps the r3 sample δ18o 0 8 δ34s 9 6 was taken in the area of discharge of zn pb ore mine water and the results obtained for the r3 sample are very similar to isotope signature of so4 2 in mine water in particular to the sample m5 the r9 sample represents water from a river running through a landscape covered with heaps it was taken in the vicinity of a leachate pond at a huge mine waste dump named smolnica p3 fig 1 although the so4 2 isotopes are quite similar for these two samples r9 and p3 it seems that so4 2 in the r9 may originate from a larger number of sources apart from that concentrations of so4 2 differ significantly from 430 mg l in river water r9 to 1 800 mg l in pond water p3 the last sample of this type r10 was collected from a canal flowing into the brynica river water in the canal comes from an area of allotments and a heat and power plant the results of isotopic analysis of sulfate δ18o 2 5 δ34s 6 0 differ from other surface water samples also from the sewage isotope signature and probably represent a different source of so4 2 3 3 groundwater chemistry groundwater of the gliwice aquifer represents a fairly consistent water type based on min 20 of ion contribution most samples belong to ca mg hco3 so4 and ca mg hco3 water types which is consistent with a predominant circulation in limestone and dolomite only one sample w12 represents a ca na hco3 cl type a piper diagram presenting ratios of the major cations and anions in groundwater from the gliwice aquifer shows fairly consistent distribution of major ions fig 8 the outstanding groundwater samples are w6 w7 and w12 located in the town center and thus exhibiting a higher fraction of so4 2 and cl in the anionic composition on the other hand the w10 sample shows the highest proportion of bicarbonate compared with other anions the sample shows the lowest value of electrical conductivity and the lowest concentrations of most analyzed constituents therefore it can be considered as the most natural groundwater sample and it can be easily found in the following graphs figs 9 10 in the lower left corner an interesting finding from the study of groundwater chemistry is that groundwater salinity represented by electrical conductivity strongly correlates with cl r2 0 86 fig 9 which may result from the fact that human activity is the major factor controlling groundwater quality in the study area sulfate concentration is not so well correlated with electrical conductivity r2 0 66 fig 9 comparison of cl and na with so4 2 concentration in groundwater samples fig 10 reveals that these anions have similar sources but one sample w12 is distinguished from the others by elevated concentration of cl and na the w12 sample is located in the industrial part of tarnowskie góry thus it represents a specific source of contamination the situation is even more complicated when taking into account the relationship between no3 and so4 2 in groundwater sampled across the aquifer fig 10 it is clear that no3 concentrations do not follow the pattern characteristic of so4 2 cl and na the highest concentration of no3 was observed in the samples w13 and w17 located in tarnowskie góry these two observation wells are surrounded by arable fields in the vicinity of the triassic outcrops thus no3 most probably comes from agricultural activities this means that the observed chemical composition of groundwater in the gliwice aquifer is a result of many factors affecting the groundwater environment 3 4 so4 2 isotopes in groundwater groundwater samples taken from the gliwice carbonate aquifer show diversified isotopic signature of so4 2 δ34s 2 7 3 7 and δ18o 2 5 2 3 fig 11 table s9 of the supplementary material in general three populations can be distinguished based on the results obtained in 2018 including one dominant group most groundwater samples are characterized by the isotopic composition of so4 2 typical for wastewater the δ18o values for these samples are in the range of 1 7 to 5 5 while the range of δ34s values is narrower from 0 4 to 4 3 the origin of so4 2 from wastewater is very likely mainly due to the fact that most of the groundwater samples were taken in residential and industrial areas at the time of groundwater sampling 2018 most of the town was already connected to a sewage system however in many parts of the town the sewage system had been built shortly before the research was carried out in addition there is a possibility that wastewater may seep into the groundwater from leaking sewer systems farther studies including analyses of such additional tracers as e coli pharmaceuticals and personal care products should be conducted in the future to investigate an impact of wastewater on groundwater in this area it is noteworthy that one sample collected from the area of the former chemical plant c5 lies very close to this dominant groundwater group on the diagram fig 11 it is probable that at least some of the groundwater samples located close to the c5 sample represent influence of old landfills of the chemical plant on groundwater the other two groups of samples differ quite clearly from this population two samples w8 and w11 revealed elevated values of both isotopes δ18o results were 7 2 and 8 4 and δ34s values were 10 1 and 11 5 respectively such results may indicate the origin of so4 2 from landfill leachates or from two sources mixed dissolution of evaporitic minerals such as gypsum or anhydrite and sewage concentrations of so4 2 in these two samples are not high and were only 70 mg l and 61 mg l respectively redox potential measured in the field was different for both samples in the case of w8 eh was 126 5 mv with a concentration of oxygen equal to 1 14 mg l whereas for the w11 sample eh was 13 mv suggesting more reducing conditions but o2 concentration was higher 3 3 mg l however it seems that the measurement of oxygen content could have been influenced by several factors e g by operation of a well pump which could inject air together with pumped water or the measurement itself could have been made with the water not properly isolated from the atmosphere previous research conducted at this well in 2010 indicated a minimum oxygen content of 0 2 mg l jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2017 analysis of the land use in the vicinity of the wells as well as the depth of the wells screens leads to the following conclusions in the case of the w8 sample the well is 167 m deep and the borehole is an open hole at the depth from 101 to 167 m the well is located in the town center close to the historic mining excavations to the depth of several dozen meters the aquifer here is unconfined and it is very likely that multiple sulfate sources may play an important role in the evolution of groundwater chemistry evaporitic minerals present in the triassic formations sewage infiltrating from the surface and possibly sulfidic minerals present in the middle triassic limestones and dolomites an interesting fact is that in a distance of several dozens of meters there is a historic mine shaft w7 56 m deep now used as a source of potable water the isotopic signature of so4 2 extracted from the w7 sample suggests sewage as the most probable source and so4 2 concentration is 172 mg l comparison of these two samples w7 and w8 shows vertical differentiation of groundwater chemistry and a strong influence of human activity on groundwater quality the situation is quite different in the case of the w11 groundwater sample the sample was taken from a 250 m deep well with a screen placed at a depth of 109 to 237 m the borehole is located away from the urban area where the aquifer is confined by a 50 meter layer of miocene clays which implies reducing conditions in the aquifer it is probable that bacterial sulfate reduction altered the original isotopic signature of so4 2 in the w11 sample however the presence of dissolved oxygen and nitrate in groundwater suggests that sulfate reducing conditions were not prevailing throughout the groundwater flow path to the well or the collected sample due to over 100 m long screen consists of groundwater fractions that experienced different environmental and human pressures therefore possible sources of sulfate in the w11 sample are dissolution of evaporitic minerals of marine origin if bsr did not significantly alter the original sulfate isotopes wastewater or manure the last two groundwater samples w1 and w16 are characterized by lower values of δ18o and δ34s compared to all other groundwater samples the results of δ18o were 0 2 and 1 2 while δ34s were equal to 4 8 and 2 0 respectively the most probable source of sulfate in these two samples is oxidation of sulfide minerals of terrestrial origin fig 12 shows relationship between so4 2 concentration and δ34s and δ18o in groundwater samples the samples presenting distinct isotopic signatures of so4 2 are marked in the graphs w8 and w11 have elevated values of δ34s and δ18o while w1 and w16 have negative values of δ34s and δ18o all the groundwater samples present typical so4 2 concentration between 50 and 112 mg l except for two samples w6 and w7 having relatively high so4 2 concentration 185 7 mg l and 193 6 mg l respectively they are located in the industrial zone of tarnowskie góry and represent direct impact of human activities related to the town management mainly leakage of wastewater it seems that groundwater infiltrating within the town contains elevated so4 2 which is being diluted as it travels downgradient and mixes with groundwater recharged outside of the town no significant correlation was observed between δ34s and or δ18o values and so4 2 concentration in groundwater which is commonly provided as an argument for bacterial sulfate reduction krouse and mayer 2000 bsr results in enrichment in heavy isotopes of o and s in the remaining unreacted so4 2 clark and fritz 1997 the reported slopes of lines characteristic of bsr on the δ18o vs δ34s plot for the remaining so4 2 are between 0 26 and 0 48 gammons et al 2013 for the study area the observed slope is 0 56 fig 11 which is above the provided range and suggests that bsr does not account for the observed variation in the isotopic composition of so4 2 across the investigated part of the gliwice aquifer two rivers running across the study area stoła and drama are also plotted in the diagram fig 12 the δ34s and δ18o values of both rivers are similar and typical for wastewater and for the majority of groundwater samples but concentrations of so4 2 are lower in the drama river compared to the stoła river two outstanding groundwater samples w6 and w7 show so4 2 concentration similar to the stoła river and in fact the river flows across the industrial zone of tarnowskie góry near the two wells previous studies in the area of tarnowskie góry e g kowalczyk 2003b showed that stoła is a recipient of multiple wastewater discharges including industrial sewage furthermore stoła was proven to be locally a losing stream it is clear that groundwater samples collected from the w6 and w7 wells represent a direct impact of industrial and municipal wastewater another finding to support this conclusion is significant contamination of these samples with tce max concentration of 230 µg l in w7 and pce up to 297 µg l in w6 groundwater contamination with tce and pce in tarnowskie góry was a subject of a number of investigation e g kowalczyk et al 2001 jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2020 it was found that these halocarbons came from a few sources located in the industrial zone of tarnowskie góry a former garrison laundry and at least one industrial plant although the present study did not show the presence of tce and pce in the water collected from the stoła river previous research revealed trace concentration of these halocarbons in the stoła river up to 0 3 µg l of tce and up to 2 5 µg l of pce kowalczyk et al 2001 such concentrations confirm the impact of industrial wastewater on the quality of the stoła river in the past tce and pce concentrations in other groundwater samples are much lower compared to the samples w6 and w7 table s9 of the supplementary material but the presence of these compounds indicates progressing migration in the gliwice aquifer the presented results and their interpretation based on the new isotopic data of anthropogenic sources of sulfate are not consistent with the results of similar studies published in 2017 by jakóbczyk karpierz et al in the previous research isotopic composition of so4 2 in groundwater sampled from the gliwice aquifer was compared with the literature data on isotopic signature of typical sulfate sources as a result it was concluded that so4 2 came mainly from agricultural sources as the arable fields are located east of the tarnowskie góry town in the recharge zone of the gliwice aquifer this study revealed that synthetic fertilizers used in poland have distinct values of δ18o and δ34s in sulfate which precludes its dominant role in sulfate origin nevertheless livestock manure spread temporarily on arable fields may contribute to the enrichment of groundwater in sulfate as the isotopic signature of manure is consistent with isotopic composition of so4 2 found in some groundwater samples 4 conclusions the results of studies on isotopic composition of selected anthropogenic sources of sulfate in the upper silesian urban area showed the importance of studying local sources especially in the context of a large impact of human activity on groundwater quality the isotopic composition of sulfate in wastewater in the study area is much more homogeneous and consistent compared to the range formed based on literature data from different parts of the world also the results obtained for synthetic fertilizers are different from the other sulfate sources and the range is more narrow compared to the compilations from around the world conducted analysis of δ34s and δ18o enabled defining more precise ranges for isotopic signatures of anthropogenic sources specific to the upper silesian urban area and thus facilitating the assessment of so4 2 origin in the gliwice carbonate aquifer the presented study includes isotopic analyses of pollution sources scattered within a significant part of the usua and adjacent areas this allows the results of δ34s and δ18o to be used in further research on other aquifers within the region studies of the isotopic composition of so4 2 in rivers of the usua indicate that wastewater is the major source of this ion in river water however some rivers are major recipients of mine water discharges from zn pb ore and coal mines the isotopic composition of so4 2 in drainage water from these two types of mines differs significantly as many rivers within the usua are losing streams due to mining activities surface water can significantly influence groundwater quality therefore in addition to typical anthropogenic sources it is crucial to apply isotopic studies to surface water especially in heavily urbanized and industrialized areas the results of studies on groundwater from the gliwice aquifer indicate that the main source of so4 2 in groundwater is wastewater it is also possible that in the area of tarnowskie góry leachate from the landfills of the former chemical plant is another potential so4 2 source few samples indicate the origin of sulfate from natural dissolution of sulfate minerals or oxidation of sulfides it is also difficult to exclude sulfate reduction as an important process affecting sulfate isotopic composition for some sampling points groundwater contamination with trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene observed particularly in the industrial part of tarnowskie góry confirms strong influence of industrial leachates on the groundwater quality many factors and processes may govern the groundwater chemistry in the study area one important conclusion from the study is that isotopic investigation of sulfate alone is not sufficient in identifying sources of groundwater pollution in urban areas the results of the research highlight the importance of multiple analyses and combination of stable isotopes and chemical studies in a proper assessment of contaminants fate and the origin of groundwater chemical composition credit authorship contribution statement sabina jakóbczyk karpierz conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation

2986,mediterranean coastal lagoons are influenced from a wide variety of external factors such as surface and groundwater flows and climate dynamics they are also vulnerable to human activities which have caused a significant loss of these types of habitats as a result the eu habitat management have now prioritized restoration of natural wetlands however there is a lack of systemic studies on the mechanisms of coastal wetland degradation and ecohydrological processes that determine restored ecological functioning as an end goal as well as a lack of reference sites to make comparisons furthermore while lagoon morphometry and underlying sediment permeability have been studied extensively combining these disciplines to evaluate lagoon hydrology and salinity dynamics is yet to be fully explored the aim of this study was to analyze the hydrological dynamics of 4 newly constructed lagoons and compare them with 2 natural lagoons in the la pletera salt marshes and evaluate the restoration and conservation efforts we use the general lake model glm to assess water volume fluctuations salinity variability and lagoon water circulation groundwater and surface water inflows outflows and evaporation we also combine data of the underlying lithological characteristics and lagoon morphometry to compare and better understand the interplay of these parameters on the hydrological behavior of each lagoon results indicated that the older and natural lagoons exhibited more consistent patterns of confinement with deeper morphologies lower evaporation effect lower water circulation and more annual patterns of salinity fluctuation the presence of low permeability layers also resulted in less fluctuation of higher salinity levels conversely three of the four new lagoons had similar shallower morphologies and higher evaporation fluxes but exhibited different water circulation patterns due to the presence or absence of low permeability layers also their salinity fluctuations were more influenced by seasonal mixing than by evaporation indicating more susceptibility to climatic influence in their annual hydrological pattern than in the natural lagoons this could prove important when constructing and restoring lagoons according to predetermined morphology and underlying sediment patterns as it could ultimately limit or enhance the success of set objectives and overall ecological functioning in a flooding confinement driven lagoon ecosystem conditioned by irregular and unpredictable climatic events keywords general lake model constructed coastal lagoons groundwater surface water interaction lagoon morphometry lagoon water circulation salinity fluctuation data availability data is provided in the supplementary material as well as in the online repository 1 introduction coastal lagoons are diverse in their geomorphological and hydrological characteristics and have a wide variety of influences from external factors such as freshwater and saltwater inputs tidal regimes and climate dynamics basset et al 2013 guelorget and perthuisot 1983 kennish and paerl 2010 kjerfve 1986 pérez ruzafa et al 2005 nidzieko et al 2014 coastal lagoons within the mediterranean region are influenced more by storm events than by tidal regimes and their surface connection to the sea and freshwater sources are limited for most of the year these types of lagoon ecosystems defined as confined coastal lagoons are typically shallow 5m and their salinity regimes fluctuate significantly according to the amount of freshwater input the climate and the level of connectedness to the sea ridden and adams 2008 trobajo et al 2002 tyler et al 2001 furthermore these lagoons have also been described as surface representations of shallow aquifers and only recently have groundwater processes been recognized as significant contributors to their hydrological behaviors and biogeochemical compositions casamitjana et al 2019 menció et al 2017 slomp and van cappellen 2004 windom et al 2006 as a result they are vulnerable to minor changes in catchment and groundwater hydrology chikita et al 2015 menció et al 2017 rodellas et al 2018 sadat noori et al 2016 also it has been shown that both freshwater inputs and morphological characteristics can control biological roles and determine the level of impact of confined lagoons basset et al 2006 cancela da fonseca et al 2001 cañedo argüelles and rieradevall 2010 félix et al 2015 it is therefore important from a management perspective to understand the hydrology of these ecosystems and to quantify the level of impact they may endure due to changes in surface and groundwater inputs while coastal wetlands and lagoons are well documented as being the most fluctuating and productive ecosystems in the world it is also well documented that coastal wetlands are severely threatened due to climate change or shifts in land use cvetkovic and chow fraser 2011 gabler et al 2017 newton et al 2012 wingard and lorenz 2014 in addition coastal wetland deterioration can contribute to climate change due to reduced carbon storage capabilities delaune and white 2012 unep map and plan bleu 2020 noted a 48 percent reduction in natural wetland habitats between 1970 and 2013 in the mediterranean basin alone thus the eu habitat management has prioritized restoration and recovery of the ecosystem services of these habitats which is why projects such as life nature have awarded financial assistance for restoration purposes on some mediterranean coastal lagoons quintana et al 2018 while this is a great step in mitigating coastal lagoon degradation aquatic habitat restoration can be challenging and ecological functioning as an end goal is not always fulfilled due to a lack of integrated understanding of the ecosystem being restored hobbs and harris 2001 also comparison of restoration efforts with other natural sites is not always possible due to a lack of reference sites or pre existing studies anton pardo et al 2013 while the majority of wetland restoration projects usually focus on eutrophication control vegetation restoration or water quality improvement the mechanistic understanding of coastal wetland degradation and ecohydrological processes especially large scale hydrological and biological connectivity is still not fully understood cui and yang 2006 harttera and ryan 2010 scheffer et al 1993 in case of the flooding confinement pattern of mediterranean coastal lagoons it has been shown that community structure dynamics are dependent on nutrient dynamics and the variability of water volume and salinity fluctuations gascón et al 2005 quintana et al 2006 while lagoon morphometry and underlying sediment permeability have been studied extensively combining these disciplines to evaluate lagoon hydrology and salinity dynamics is yet to be fully explored therefore a multidisciplinary approach in understanding these ecohydrological processes will help to evaluate overall ecological functioning within these ecosystem types the la pletera salt marshes is an example of a coastal wetland system affected by a failed urbanization project and was awarded financial assistance from the life project http lifepletera com es life pletera which aimed to restore this protected area and to recover its ecological functioning by dismantling unused urban features various studies were conducted to assess several structural and functional indicators of restoration of the salt marsh among these studies two were focused on the salinity fluctuations and groundwater dependence of two natural lagoons bpi and fra and one constructed lagoon g02 in 2002 see menció et al 2017 and casamitjana et al 2019 in 2016 three new lagoons l01 l04 and m03 were created under the second phase of the life project and they were constructed by excavating the sediment below sea level while also considering the underlying sedimentary pattern to ensure the conservation of low permeability layers present geoservei 2016 the aim was to facilitate higher salinity conditions by decreasing an efficient connection with the aquifer during periods of confinement to increase favorable refuges for the endangered iberian toothcarp fish aphanius iberus alcaraz et al 2008 badosa et al 2006 these conditions are important to reduce the competition of the invasive mosquitofish gambusia holbrooki which is more adapted to freshwater flooding conditions and less salinity variability alcaraz garcia berthou 2007 rincón 2002 ruiz navarro et al 2011 the aim of this study was to analyze the overall hydrological dynamics of the new lagoons including g02 along with their dependence on groundwater circulations and compare them with natural lagoons to assess the restoration efforts of increasing salinity fluctuations higher salinity during the dry period and ecological functioning we used the one dimensional general lake model glm to assess water volume fluctuations salinity variability and lagoon water circulation groundwater and surface water inflows rainfall outflows and evaporation to assess how the lagoons hydrological behaviors and their dependence on groundwater and surface water fluxes contribute not only to their salinity fluctuations but their total water budgets we also combine data of the underlying lithological characteristics and the overall morphometry of the natural and new lagoons to better understand the interplay of such parameters on the hydrological behavior of each lagoon individually and in comparison with each other 2 site description the study was carried out in the la pletera salt marshes which is located in the baix ter wetlands in the northeast of catalunya fig 1 a and south of the urban center of l estartit torroella de montgrí girona the climate is sub humid mediterranean and has mean temperatures of 25 c in summer and 10 c in winter the average rainfall is 590 mm year with the highest rainfall periods in spring 140 mm and autumn 200 mm estartit meteorological station 1966 2021 period pascual 2021 the la pletera lagoon system consists of six permanent lagoons two of which are natural fra and bpi fig 1 b which run perpendicular to the coastline and are remnants of an abandoned river channel the other 4 lagoons g02 l01 l04 and m03 fig 1 b were constructed and restored under two life projects 2002 and 2016 and run parallel to the coastline behind an aeolian dune system fig 1b a shallow subterranean plastic clay layer 30 90 cm in depth is present in the ssw of the salt marshes fig 1b table 1 the underlying lithological characteristics of the lagoons were analyzed by geoservei in 2016 the presence of marsh silts predominates in the areas of the natural lagoons in layers above sea level while the presence of alluvium and sands are more common in the new lagoons bpi is the only lagoon with low permeability clay layers above sea level at sea level the presence of a plastic clay layer becomes evident and extends across the central area of the fra lagoon the entire area of the m03 lagoon and three quarters of the area of the l04 lagoon which then tapers away towards the north the layer reaches a depth of around 90 cm below sea level especially in fra table 3 and fig 1c g02 does not show a record of a low permeability layer at a depth deeper than 1 m below sea level permeable fine sands form the underlying base of the lagoon systems except for fra which still shows the presence of the low permeability plastic clay layer fine sands however predominate the deeper sediment profiles of all the lagoons during the survey l01 had no low permeability layers detected throughout its sediment profile in summary the lagoons with underlying low permeability layers are bpi fra m03 and part of l04 while l01 and g02 has higher permeability layers throughout its sediment profile 2 1 historical background as is the case in other mediterranean regions this area has been affected by high anthropic pressure and the salt marsh was subjected to partial urbanization with alterations to its landscape and hydrology during the late 1980s this project was later discontinued in the 1990s years later efforts were underway to recover the areás ecological functioning and two life nature restoration projects http lifepletera com en life pletera were implemented the first project in 2002 created the lagoon g02 to ensure water permanency the lagoon was excavated below sea level during construction fig 2 a the second project in 2016 dismantled the remaining urban features promenade accesses filling material breakwaters and debris fig 2 a and was substituted by a set of new lagoons l01 m03 l04 with varying depths and shapes to produce lagoons with different salinity levels and permanency characteristics fig 1 fig 2 b quintana et al 2018 quintana et al 2018 go on to explain that among different criteria for the restoration the design of the topographic distributions of the lagoons were intended to be a reminder of the failed urbanization process with the old accesses and promenades converted into lagoons while the old roundabouts separate the permanent lagoons the intention was to create a recovered area with restored ecological functioning and not a pristine salt marsh this was because the old morphology was strongly altered and impossible to replicate 2 2 hydrology the hydrology of the la pletera lagoons is characterized by the absence of continuous surface freshwater or seawater inflows it has a micro tidal regime with a spring tidal range of about 0 15 m the water bodies are located behind a foredune with surface water exchanges occurring mainly during winter sea storms or intense rainfall events pascual 2021 these cyclonic storm events associated with strong easterly winds known as llevantades can cause sea level rise of more than 1 m marquès et al 2001 during these periods sea waves may enter the saltmarshes and together with the freshwater surface flow overland flow sub surface flow lateral percolation through the topsoil and groundwater inputs can cause a 0 3 0 9 m increase in the level of the salt marsh therefore the hydrology is strongly influenced by the sea with sudden sea storm flooding followed by extended periods of decreasing water levels and increasing salinity during confinement badosa et al 2007 lópez flores et al 2006 quintana et al 1998 2018 in hydrogeological terms the la pletera salt marsh area is connected to the shallowest level of the quaternary sediments that fill the regional basin menció et al 2017 as an unconfined aquifer with a thickness of 10 30 m this unit was formed by recent alluvial deposits which becomes marsh and coastal deposits near the coastline montaner 2010 icgc 2011a icgc 2011b this results in permanent water levels in the lagoons and contributes up to 80 of the summer water exchange when surface exchanges are scarce menció et al 2017 furthermore menció et al 2017 also concluded through hydrochemical and isotopic analyses that the water salinity of the lagoons is determined by two main processes freshwater and seawater mixing in the lagoon and aquifer and evaporation the resulting fluctuations of physical and chemical parameters such as salinity levels allow for just a few euryhaline species to establish significant populations in these lagoons 3 methods 3 1 morphometry lithological and physical characteristics bathymetric data were used to calculate the physical characteristics and morphometry of the lagoons morphometric parameters such as mean depth relative depth and volume development were calculated based on the methods by hutchinson 1957 this included calculations of the rate of change of area with respect to volume the geomorphological profiling and geological analysis were conducted in combination with drilling boreholes in the lagoon pre construction phase geoservei 2016 the main characteristics of the lagoons were estimated from the bathymetric data that were incorporated into autocad lt software to estimate surface areas volumes lengths and widths 3 2 hydrological dynamics schlumberger water level data loggers accuracy 0 02 m were used to determine daily water levels from november 2014 to september 2017 fig 3 water levels in 2018 and 2019 were obtained biweekly from depth gauge boards installed in the lagoons a ctd profiler sea sun technology was used to measure biweekly values for temperature and salinity daily average relative humidity precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were obtained from the ĺestartit meteorological station 2 km from the lagoons pascual 2021 this was used to determine the evaporation and precipitation in these lagoons data for solar radiation was obtained daily from mas badia la tallada 10 km from the la pletera in 2016 and 2017 and in situ in the la pletera with radiation sensors in 2018 and 2019 3 3 the general lake model glm and application the now well documented glm is an open source model developed as an initiative of the global lake ecological observatory network gleon with several publications documenting simulations using the model bueche et al 2017 briefly it is a one dimensional open source code designed to simulate the hydrodynamics of lakes reservoirs and wetlands hipsey et al 2019 and integrates a lagrangian layer structure similar to other 1 d lake model designs hamilton and schladow 1997 imberger and patterson 1981 by integrating the effects such as inflows and outflows mixing as well as surface heating and cooling the model computes vertical profiles of temperature salinity and density casamitjana et al 2019 the glm was applied in the la pletera lagoons in previous studies to analyze the groundwater influence in the salt marsh see menció et al 2017 and the water circulation patterns and salinity fluctuations see casamitjana et al 2019 and provided to our knowledge the first of its application in small water bodies that do not exceed 3 m in depth this study is a continuation of the work conducted by casamitjana et al 2019 and follows the same methodology in the application of the glm this study however extends the period of the natural and old lagoons bpi fra and g02 to 2019 and introduces 3 new lagoons l01 l04 and m03 constructed in 2016 the selected study period was from march 2016 to september 2019 due to the availability of data from the m03 lagoon as it was constructed later than the other lagoons the methodology of applying the glm will be explained briefly below however for a full description of the governing equations of the glm the chosen outlet point depths to model the best fit for salinity and temperature as well as observed meteorological data see data in brief inflow and outflow measurements were estimated from the water levels of the lagoons from the bathymetry data water volume at any single depth was estimated using a polynomial fit with values of r squared r2 that indicate the goodness of fit table 2 this was then followed by the net daily inflow and outflow calculations to fit the volume fluctuations the modeled inflows and outflows were then set from the net daily inflow and outflow calculations the modeled volumes were then compared to the observed water volumes as rain fluxes and evaporation are modeled separately from the inflows and outflows differing volumes emerged through an iterative process the inflows and outflows were adjusted until the modeled and real volume temperature and salinity values showed the smallest possible differences many inflows and outflows were compatible with a single water level due to estimations from the inflows and outflows however we followed the hypothesis that there is either inflow or outflow but not both at the same time for a certain day especially in summer and autumn indeed the real inflow can be higher than the estimated inflow into the lagoons in some situations especially in periods of heavy autumn rains with small estimated times for water renewal 10 days nevertheless this analysis determined the minimum inflows necessary to accurately model the observed volume levels simulation performance was assessed using the commonly applied root mean square relative error rmsre and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse table 4 3 4 data analyses bivariate pearson s correlation coefficient was used to analyze whether a statistically significant linear relationship existed between variables influencing lagoon salinity and volume levels salinity volume evaporation total inflow total outflow inflow salinity rain and surface temperature and to assess the strength of this relationship within the lagoons due to highly seasonal patterns linear mixed models were used to allow for both fixed and random effects within the analysis and aggregate the hierarchical data based on the month and year on lagoons which showed no significance in annual patterns stepwise multiple regression models for hydrological parameters affecting salinity and volume were used to analyze the variance among lagoons grouped according to their features 1 new lagoons l01 l04 m03 g02 2 old lagoons bpi fra 3 presence of low permeability layers bpi fra l04 m03 and 4 absence of low permeability layers l01 g02 statistical analyses were done with r software version 4 1 2 r project for statistical computing vienna austria and the jamovi project 2021 jamovi version 2 2 2 computer software retrieved from https www jamovi org uncertainties for empirical and modeled mean values in this study were quantified by the standard coefficient of variation following the methods by håkanson 2005 the cv value within lagoon variability cvw is calculated from time series data and is related to hydrological and physical conditions variations within and among lagoons were analyzed using the standard coefficient of variation cv to quantify parameter uncertainties as illustrated by håkanson 2005 4 results 4 1 the main characteristics and morphometry of the lagoons table 3 shows the main characteristics and morphometric features of the six lagoons in the la pletera salt marsh the new lagoons l01 l04 m03 were more homogeneous in their main characteristics and showed similarities in their volumes surface areas and mean depths they also had little stratification in their surface and bottom salinity levels l01 was the shallowest of all 6 lagoons and 2 5 fold shallower than fra l04 and m03 were similar in their volume development values at 0 80 while l01 had a value similar to the natural lagoons at 1 2 1 36 indicating a typical conical depression shape and easily eroded geology the new lagoonś relative depths were similar and lower than 2 in contrast the natural lagoons and g02 were more heterogeneous in terms of their volumes and surface areas with notable stratification in surface and bottom salinity levels in bpi and fra g02 showed little stratification in salinity levels despite being the second deepest lagoon the natural lagoons and g02 also differed in their mean depths with bpi showing a notably lower mean depth level in comparison with all the lagoons bpi also had the lowest volume development value indicating that it has less of a uniform bottom and is more of a localized deep hole the fra and g02 lagoons however showed more similarity in terms of their mean depths and have the highest volume development values they were also the deepest lagoons with higher relative depths including bpi in comparison with the other lagoons with g02 above 3 5 table 3 when comparing all the lagoons together little differences in their average surface temperatures were observed bpi fra and m03 showed 1 5 to 2 fold higher surface salinity levels than the rest of the lagoons bpi and fra had the biggest contrast in terms of the volume capacity of all the lagoons with fra having a 20 fold greater volume capacity than bpi l01 showed the lowest surface salinity levels with nearly a 1 5 to 2 5 fold lower difference than the rest of the lagoons fra and g02 had the highest lake number values followed by bpi suggesting more water column stability in these lagoons than the new lagoons l04 l01 and m03 fig 3 a shows the normalized bathymetric profiles of the six lagoons and illustrates their respective surface to height ratios the respective heights and surface areas were normalized by their maximum height and surface area values the new lagoons were similar in their bathymetric profiles shown as darker lines in contrast the natural lagoons and g02 showed differences in their profiles with bpi having the biggest surface area over height change the deeper the lagoon becomes l04 had a slightly higher surface area change with respect to its height the natural lagoons had more of a conical depression shape as can be seen with the volume development ratios in table 3 with fra showing more increase in height over its surface area at around 50 of its height with only an increase of 15 of its surface area fig 3 a fig 3 b shows the calculated rate of change of area with respect to volume values highlighted in red indicate estimated average depths in summer june to september blue indicates the estimated average depths of the lagoons for the rest of the year that excludes summer for the convenience in representation and due to the nature of the bathymetric data and varying depths of each lagoon depth are estimates that can either be above or below the indicated level within 0 1 m 0 2 m l04 l01 and m03 had similar average water depths and were shallower than the natural lagoons and g02 both in summer and for the rest of the year the difference in the new lagoonś water levels in summer compared with the rest of the year is 0 2 m 0 3 m in contrast the natural lagoons and g02 showed a 0 5 m difference in their water levels from summer to the rest of the year the rate of change of area with respect to volume shows that the new lagoons had a higher surface area rate of change than the natural lagoons and g02 at shallower depths fig 3 b this can be seen in the similar bathymetric profiles and steady increase in surface area over the heights illustrated in the darker lines in fig 3 a fra and g02 had a less rate of change of area as the lagoons get deeper fig 3 b this can also be seen in the increase in the height over surface area the deeper the lagoons become fig 3 a however bpi showed the opposite trend where the rate of change of area increases as the lagoon gets deeper g02 showed a 65 fold lower rate of change of area compared with l04 in the summer which also had the highest rate of change on average out of all the lagoons 4 2 water volume fluctuations fig 4 shows relative water volumes of all six lagoons normalized by their initial water volume on the 1st of october with the hydrological period beginning in october the previous year the year 2015 2016 was evaluated from april to october of the same year due to the availability of data similar patterns of mixing and desiccation can be seen in all the lagoons with levels increasing from the initial volume in autumn and returning to the initial volume level towards the end of summer fig 4 the year 2015 2016 and 2018 2019 had no influence of storms and only significant rainfall events fig 2 a d with 2018 2019 showing the most significant rainfall events and changes in volume levels in all the lagoons all lagoons behaved similarly in 2015 2016 with more fluctuation of volume levels in l01 than in the other lagoons fig 2 a the year 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 showed significant storm events with waves higher than 3 m on all occasions combined with significant rainfall in 2017 11 mm 126 mm fig 2 b c when evaluating the individual responses of the lagoons to rainfall and or seawater inputs the higher rainfalls above 100 mm affected bpi more with a 6 fold increase in its relative volume in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 l04 showed high fluctuations in its volume levels from both rainfall and seawater inputs overall g02 had a lower response in its relative volumes from rainfall and seawater inputs over the 4 year study period the newer lagoons l04 l01 and m03 showed a 3 to 9 fold increase in their relative volumes due to seawater inputs and a 2 5 to 3 5 fold increase with significant rainfall events in contrast g02 and fra only had a 1 5 to 3 5 fold increase during similar events 4 3 calculated glm water circulation and surface area fluxes simulation performance was assessed using the commonly applied nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square relative error rmsre table 4 for the 4 year study period the nse values on average for volume were 0 95 and 0 7 for salinity and temperature the values for rmsre were 10 for volume 20 for salinity and 23 for temperature modeled vs observed data graphs are shown in the data in brief fig 5 shows the modeled fluxes per unit of water volume of the lagoons calculated during the study period from 2016 to 2019 these fluxes are calculated in cubic meters per day per lagoon volume and are together categorized as water circulation within the lagoons inflow v outflow v evaporation v rain v for the convenience of representation calculations are converted to cubic millimeters per day except for surface area the selected time includes the periods of mixing which occur in october after the autumn rains and subsequent desiccation that occurs towards september in the summer and illustrates the overall average hydrological behavior of each lagoon inflow and outflow were modeled as a singular occurrence and did not occur concurrently also due to the nature of the hydrological activity in mediterranean lagoons the sensitivity of mean calculations was considered representative modeled results of inflow outflow evaporation and rain were normalized by their respective lagoon volumes at each time step to best represent the overall circulation of each lagoon relative to other lagoons surface area flux calculations were also normalized by their respective water volumes and included to compare with evaporation fluxes differences in mean water circulation between the lagoons can be seen across the 4 year study period despite m03 and bpi having similar mean evaporation 7 69 mm3 day 1 and 7 49 mm3 day 1 respectively l04 showed a higher surface area per volume that corresponds with higher evaporation per volume fig 5 c e while g02 had the lowest corresponding surface area and evaporation fluxes indicating a positive relationship between the surface area to volume ratio and evaporation for all the lagoons combined pearsońs correlation p 0 001 r2 0 79 supplementary table 1 the new lagoons l01 and l04 showed higher circulation with higher mean evaporation inflow and outflow in comparison with m03 and the natural lagoons bpi fra and g02 fig 5 a b c l01 and l04 had a 1 8 fold higher difference in mean inflow in comparison with m03 12 9 mm3 day 1 12 7 mm3 day 1 and 7 01 mm3 day 1 respectively while l01 showed a nearly 2 5 fold increase in mean outflow compared with mo3 8 64 mm3 day 1 and 3 53 mm3 day 1 respectively the mean effect of rain over volume was greatest in l04 and lowest in g02 with a 3 fold difference between them 5 13 mm3 day 1 and 1 72 mm3 day 1 respectively and follow a similar mean pattern to that of the surface area over volume measurements 4 4 modeled salinity inflows table 5 shows the modeled salinity inflows of the lagoons to match observed salinity levels inflow salinity values were manually entered into the glm on a daily basis for each lagoon bpi fra and m03 salinity levels were set above mediterranean sea salinity levels 37 ppt in 2016 2017 only for bpi 2018 and 2019 only in m03 this occurred mainly in the summer and autumn periods with m03 showing high inflow salinity across the seasons except in 2017 and the autumn of 2019 g02 registered higher salinity only in the summer of 2018 l04 and l01 showed no inflow salinity greater than sea salinity with l01 showing the lowest inflow salinities of all the lagoons during summer and autumn overall 2019 showed lower salinity inflow levels in all the lagoons while 2016 and 2018 had the highest levels table 6 4 5 variations among and within lagoons the within lagoon variations for all variables except surface area mainly depend on seasonal climatic changes such as desiccation in summer and seawater intrusions from winter cyclonic storms the cv expressing variations among lagoons cva is defined from the coefficient of variation of mean monthly values from different lagoons both cvw and cva were calculated from march 2016 to september 2019 as expected there were no significant differences between cvw and cva for surface temperature with variation around 20 and driven by seasonal temperature changes significant differences in morphological features surface area and volume can be seen within and among the lagoons with bpi showing the greater variance of both within the lagoon and g02 showing the lower variations within the largest variations among the lagoons were in their volume and surface areas circulation parameters among the lagoons showed variation at 30 for inflow v outflow v evap v and rain v however the circulation parameters within the lagoons had high variation due to occasional daily zero values in outflow v with l04 having a 3 fold higher variation than l01 salinity variation within the individual lagoons was 1 5 fold lower in both l01 and fra compared with the rest of the lagoons and 3 fold lower than bpi the natural lagoons bpi and fra showed the lowest inflow salinity variations while the new lagoons had a 1 5 2 fold higher variation than the natural lagoons 4 6 variables influencing salinity and volume levels to assess the relationship between variables that influence volume and salinity levels within the lagoons a series of pearson product moment correlations were performed table 7 when assessing the relationships influencing salinity the volume levels were negatively correlated with salinity in all the lagoons except for l01 where its total inflow was associated with salinity levels evaporation was associated with salinity in the natural lagoons and g02 where it was negatively correlated with salinity in bpi and positively correlated in the fra and g02 lagoons evaporation however had no significant correlation with salinity in the new lagoons also inflow salinity was associated with salinity levels only in bpi as expected the total inflow calculated by the glm was positively correlated with volume levels in all the lagoons evaporation was negatively correlated with volume levels in fra and g02 however evaporation was positively correlated with volume levels in bpi and l04 inflow salinity was positively correlated with volume levels in l04 and l01 table 8 shows the analysis of variance among lagoons grouped according to their features using stepwise multiple regression models for hydrological parameters affecting salinity and volume the lagoons are categorized as new lagoons l01 l04 m03 g02 old lagoons bpi fra presence of low permeability layers bpi fra l04 m03 and absence of low permeability layers l01 g02 g02 was removed from table 8 c d to improve consistency in lagoon morphology the new lagoonś salinity fluctuations were explained more by total inflow and outflow than by rain and evaporation in the regression models a c while volume levels explained more of the variance in the old lagoons e a similar effect on salinity was seen in lagoons with low permeability layers where volume had a bigger influence g however a combination of inflow salinity and volume helped to explain more of the variance in salinity fluctuations in lagoons without low permeability layers i total inflow and outflow affected the volume fluctuations more in the new lagoons d while rain and evaporation explained nearly all of the variance in the old lagoons f a similar result was obtained in lagoons with the presence of low permeability layers where rain and evaporation explained nearly all of the variation despite the inclusion of lagoons l04 and m03 h however the model improved greatly when total outflow was added to lagoons without low permeability layers 5 discussion recent method and technology improvements in data collection has seen a deluge of data generation and environmental modeling is a way of observing systems coherently with large data sets farley et al 2018 porter et al 2012 as with all models choosing the level of resolution and complexity within a generic model structure that is both accessible and can confidently predict system process is challenging at best bruce et al 2018 hipsey et al 2019 stress testing the glm over a global network by bruce et al 2018 identified a range of limitations that included warm or cold biased estimations and larger mean errors of temperature depending on the frequency and location of meteorological data collected accurate light extinction coefficients kw and wind speed measurements as well as the parameterization and classification to physical characteristics were also emphasized to improve model performance furthermore to increase the applicability of the glm to a wide variety of systems it was proposed to adopt a bayesian hierarchical calibration framework and increase the flexibility of assumed globally common parameter values for the core hydrodynamic parameters our investigation into shallow coastal lagoons is one of the first to our knowledge to model these types of systems that don t exceed 3 m in depth while it was found that shallow well mixed lakes performed better overall during stress testing bruce et al 2018 this study contributes to an ever increasing list of diverse system types modeled by the glm and provides insights into shallow well mixed lagoon systems with higher salinity fluctuations also the diversity of morphologies of the new and natural lagoons combined with underlying lithological characteristics and different hydrological parameters modeled separately has provided an opportunity to not only quantitatively assess the success of restoration but also to analyze factors that contribute to lagoon circulation and water volume fluctuations section 5 1 as well as lagoon salinity variability section 5 2 5 1 shallower lagoon morphometry and lack of low permeability layers can increase overall water circulation and volume fluctuation 5 1 1 lagoon circulation and morphometry our results indicate differences in the hydrodynamics of the lagoons when assessing overall water circulation and volume fluctuations in conjunction with differing lagoon morphometry and the presence or absence of low permeability layers differences between the lagoons start with their lithological characteristics and permeability shown in table 1 and are defined by their temporal and spatial distributions firstly the accumulation of decomposing plant and organic matter in marsh silts is found at the sediment water interface in the natural lagoons and not in the new lagoons due to insufficient time for decay and accumulation table 1 boadella et al 2021 geoservei 2016 the new lagoons have mostly sandy silts and alluvium deposits at the sediment water interface as unconsolidated deposits the permeability of these sediments differ with marsh silts having moderate to low permeability in the old lagoons and high to low permeability in alluvium and medium sands in the new lagoons freeze cherry 1979 lewis et al 2006 the underlying fine sands for all the lagoons have a high to moderate permeability freeze cherry 1979 lewis et al 2006 also the plastic clay layer is distributed in the south and south west of the study site which represents significantly lower permeability freeze cherry 1979 lewis et al 2006 for the affected lagoons fig 1 and reduces the efficiency of groundwater input in fra m03 and part of l04 although bpi didńt register the presence of this layer its lithological characteristics are nevertheless dominated by low permeability silts and clays table 1 also the decision to emulate the new lagoons l01 l04 and m03 to previous urban developments such as promenades and rotundas as well as to preserve the shallow underlying low permeability layers provided a guideline during construction and resulted in similar and shallower mean depths and bathymetrical profiles table 3 and fig 3 a this led to different morphometric features as well as lithological characteristics between the new and the natural lagoons resulting in differences in the hydrological patterns between them the new lagoons have similar summer and yearlong water levels higher rate of change with respect to volume and higher surface to volume ratios surface v in comparison with the old lagoons fig 3 b fig 5 e therefore the new lagoons have a higher evaporation flux in comparison with the old lagoons fig 5 c a higher surface v ratio results in higher evaporation casamitjana et al 2019 mcjannet et al 2008 this is also observed in the rate of change of area with respect to volume fig 3 b where the new lagoons surface areas increase with lower water volume the strength of the one dimensional glm to differentiate inflows outflows mixing and surface mass fluxes allows for the distinction of different circulation patterns within the lagoons this includes inflows separate from rainfall and outflow from evaporation due to the nature of the hydrological activity in mediterranean lagoons the occurrence of extreme values for inflow outflow and rain was common and concurrent with episodes of non occurrence i e either inflow or outflow occurred and periods of no rain this resulted in highly skewed data in its distribution supplementary fig 1 a b c d e f supplementary fig 2 a b c d e nevertheless the nse and rmsre values indicate reasonable adjustments despite the sudden changes in volumes table 4 also the sensitivity of mean calculations was considered convenient and representative as the occurrence of both extreme values and the non occurrence of daily parameters are equally important in water circulation representations distinguishing circulation parameters allowed for two contrasting patterns to emerge between the natural lagoons and g02 and the new lagoons l04 and l01 the circulation is higher in l01 and l04 than the natural lagoons and g02 in all parameters calculated by the glm fig 5 a b c d this also coincides with differences in the morphometric features where mean depth and relative depth are greater in fra and g02 table 3 and their variation of surface area and volume was lower table 6 both features indicate the deepness of the lagoons and hutchinson 1957 and wetzel and likens 1991 note that those that have a higher relative depth approaching 4 usually have smaller surface areas and exhibit greater resistance to mixing this idea is strengthened with the higher lake numbers for fra g02 and bpi table 3 also despite no observation of low permeability layers in g02 table 1 the response to inputs is more moderate and only increases once above 2 times its relative volume after the dry period fig 4 suggesting water column stability due to deeper lagoon morphometry and resistance to high volume fluctuation as a result of higher relative and mean depths this can be seen in table 8 where most of the variance is explained for volume fluctuations in the new lagoons when including total inflow and outflow d whereas most is explained in the old lagoons through evaporation and rainfall with little affect from total inflow and outflow f combining all these factors has led to two main findings that could be explained by lagoon morphometry first the less effect of water volume fluctuations in fra and g02 can be attributed to more water column stability due to variations in density with depth and lower evaporation effect due to smaller surface v ratio and second the new lagoons shallower profiles are sensitive to water inflows and outflows due to lower volume capacity and are subject to higher evaporation effect by the higher surface v ratio the result is higher water turnover for l04 and l01 and a quicker response to external drivers such as winter cyclonic storms or long dry periods 5 1 2 influence of low permeability layers on water circulation notable differences in the circulation patterns of m03 are observed in comparison with the other new lagoons despite sharing similar morphometric features m03 has different inflow outflow and evaporation patterns from l04 and l01 fig 5 a b c also the total coverage of underlying low permeability layers in m03 s wetted area is unique where all other lagoons except for bpi have a combination of low permeable and permeable layers underlying the wetted area fig 1 and table 1 and the more inland topographical location suggests this lagoon is subject to more confinement than the rest of the lagoons furthermore in the absence of sea storms and with rain inputs only m03 showed minimal fluctuation in water volumes in comparison with l01 and l04 fig 4 a indicating a smaller influence of rising groundwater also sea storm inputs and high rainfall can increase all the lagoonś water volume 2 12 times the initial volume in autumn however there is a lag in declining water volume levels after such events in m03 while l04 and l01 s volume levels decline quicker fig 4 b c d a similar pattern of lag can also be seen in fra m03 and bpi showed similar evaporation patterns over their respective volumes fig 5 c despite having similar surface area fluxes with l01 which has no low permeability layers fig 5 e table 1 furthermore a large part of the variance of volume fluctuations in lagoons without low permeability layers is explained with the inclusion of total outflows table 8 j whereas inflow and outflow contribute only a percentage of the total fluctuations in the presence of these layers table 8 h this suggests the underlying low permeability layers overall effect on hydrological behavior which influences inflows outflows and evaporation patterns resulting in a more elevated confinement pattern of circulation due to a less efficient connection with the aquifer therefore low permeability layers and lagoon morphometry can influence water circulation and volume fluctuations and the interplay of both can create similar hydrological behavior this is the case with bpi and m03 which behaved similarly in terms of lag in response to both inflows and outflows yet can have high increases in their relative volumes due to their lower mean and relative depths table 3 5 2 the presence and absence of underlying low permeability layers influence lagoon salinity variability 5 2 1 presence of low permeability layers in conjunction with the presence of underlying low permeability layers table 1 and fig 1 bpi fra and m03 show higher surface and bottom average salinity levels table 3 furthermore to fit the gml results to the experimental data when modeling salinity the inflow salinity levels were set to values higher than sea salinity mediterranean salinity 37ppt mainly during the summer and autumn seasons table 5 a similar observation was made by casamitjana et al 2019 who suggested that these salinity values are similar to those at the bottom of the lagoons or have a higher salinity with little stratification as is the case in m03 table 3 the study concluded that differences in water input amounts and water salinity may be attributable to the composition and permeability of the lagoons sediment while that study showed this effect in the natural lagoons bpi and fra having higher salinity inflows while g02 lower this was also observed in the new lagoon m03 showing high salinity levels in its inflows mainly during the summer autumn period table 5 although indirect these results suggest that there is a less efficient connection occurring with the aquifer which minimizes groundwater inflows and outflow circulations fig 5 and therefore more water confinement this idea is supported by a strong negative correlation between volume levels and salinity table 7 particularly in bpi fra and m03 as well as a negative correlation of total outflows and salinity levels indicating that outflows are more restricted by the low permeability layers this has an effect of increasing overall lagoon salinity when water levels decrease this idea is strengthened when volume is included in the multiple regression models that affect salinity levels in the presence of low permeability layers table 8 g however when groundwater levels increase mostly during autumn and winter cyclonic storm events fig 4 the groundwater inflows into these lagoons have salinity similar to summer salinity levels additionally some of the inflowing surface waters can have higher salinities because they flow through small salt deposits formed due to the evaporation of small ponds in between the lagoons and the sea casamitjana et al 2019 these results support similar findings by sadat noori et al 2016 who observed inputs of shallow brackish hypersaline pore water into the lagoons when groundwater levels rise also rodellas et al 2020 observed that the increased hydraulic gradient favors the upward advection of deep hypersaline pore waters in periods of shallow lagoon water depths zarroca et al 2011 went further to explain that textural and mineralogical characteristics condition the retention of salts in sediment as the low permeability of clays as well as the high capacity of adsorption and absorption contribute to the increase of ion concentrations 5 2 2 absence of low permeability layers while higher salinity levels seem to correspond with the spatial distribution of low permeability layers lagoons with lower overall salinity levels l01 l04 and g02 also correspond with the absence or partial presence of low permeability layers during rainy and stormy periods mostly in spring and autumn the inflow is estimated to be a mixture of groundwater and surface water while for the rest of the year inflow is mostly from underground sources menció et al 2017 l01 showed significant freshening during the summer period table 3 with higher salinity inflows of seawater entering during autumn storm events this suggests freshwater is the main input from the aquifer possibly due to freshwater stratification on top of a saltwater wedge menció et al 2017 although l04 had the low permeability layer conserved the partial distribution of this layer has resulted in some connection with the underlying aquifer and as a consequence more freshening and water circulation table 5 fig 5 a b in seemingly contrasting behavior to the presence of low permeability layers there were no or weak correlations found for volume levels and salinity in l01 and l04 and outflow had no effect on their salinity levels suggesting the more efficient connection to the shallow aquifer and susceptibility to the influence of circulating waters surface and groundwater inflows despite having the highest evaporation flux of all the lagoons this idea is further strengthened by the lowest coefficient of variation for inflow and outflow in l01 in table 6 this finding is in agreement with rodellas et al 2018 who determined that water recirculating through permeable sediments in a coastal lagoon could account for more than 60 of the total recharge in our case this kind of circulation may explain a significant amount of the water flow that occurs at the beginning of the autumn it is long been held that in a flooding confinement hydrological pattern coastal lagoon surface waters would be more susceptible to evaporation and salinity would increase as water levels decrease when analyzing the annual hydrological pattern there is a positive correlation of evaporation with salinity levels in the natural lagoon fra and g02 but does not correlate with salinity levels in the new lagoons table 7 bpi had a negative correlation due to a smaller surface area at lower volume levels however when aggregating the data by seasons using mixed linear models i e winter spring summer and autumn evaporation is positively correlated with salinity levels between the winter and summer seasons in both l04 and m03 r 0 44 and 0 57 respectively p 0 05 supplementary table 2 but not for l01 where its increasing salinity is more dependent on annual total inflows as well as inflow salinities table 7 r 0 45 p 0 05 due to sea water inputs furthermore a third of the variance in new lagoonś salinity can be explained by including inflow salinity while evaporation is not significant in the multiple regression models table 8 i these results imply two findings first while evaporation affects the salinity levels in the lagoons the new lagoonś salinity is controlled more by seasonal inputs second the absence of low permeability layers limits salinity variation in a confined lagoon system it is well documented that evaporation plays a role in changes in salinity levels e g lécuyer et al 2012 abd ellah and hussein 2009 also many studies have focused on submarine groundwater discharge sgd through permeable sediments and its influence on nutrient loadings and salinity of surface water bodies anschutz et al 2009 liefer et al 2013 rodellas et al 2015 however few have quantified parameters affecting salinity fluctuations with known sedimentary patterns and their influence on the overall hydrological pattern from surface and groundwater flows both from land to sea and vice versa our results show that there is an overall influence of low permeability layers on lagoon salinity variability despite the strong influences of external hydrological patterns this can be seen in the similarity of the morphometric features in l01 l04 and m03 where all are relatively shallow and have a high evaporation flux with low water levels in summer yet their salinity variability varies widely with m03 showing the highest fluctuations with lower circulation fig 5 and table 5 similarly fra and g02 show similar hydrological behavior with similar morphometric features fig 5 and table 3 but with different salinity levels the results of this study show that the new lagoons especially l01 seem to be more influenced by annual mixing than by evaporation and possibly due to underlying low permeability layer distributions that influence the efficient connection with the aquifer this is supported by menció et al 2017 who found that groundwater contributions could be as high as 80 in the dry season therefore lagoon salinity flux is not only limited by lagoon morphology or by evaporation fluxes but also by the extent of connection with the aquifer and circulating waters 5 2 2 1 a lesson learned the case of g02 as mentioned before g02 was excavated below sea level to ensure water permanency all year round however the underlying lithological characteristics were not taken into consideration and any presence of low permeability layers were probably removed during construction at the time the intention was to increase refuges for the aphanius iberus however in the years that followed g02 showed higher circulations and consistently lower salinity levels than the desired fluctuations with evidence of a higher connection with the aquifer casamitjana et al 2019 this has resulted in higher populations of gambusia holbrooki fig 7 knowledge of this inspired the preservation of low permeability layers during the construction of the new lagoons in 2016 in the hope of reducing an efficient connection with the aquifer and increase salinity fluctuations as the results of this study suggests there has been an element of influence from low permeability layers and early indications suggest that the aphanius iberus is benefitting from these measures fig 7 5 3 a tentative conceptual model our observations offer some conceptual insight into the la pletera salt marsh hydrology as summarized in fig 6 in a coastal lagoon system that is highly variable finding an annual pattern related to hydrological biogeochemical and ecological functioning can be challenging with the exception of surface temperature variation among the lagoons of the la pletera salt marsh is high with a range of 30 to 127 for all variables table 6 illustrating the diversity in lagoon structure and hydrological behavior variation within the individual lagoons is also very high indicating the different ways individual lagoons behave to external climatic and hydrogeological influences this results in a hydrologically dynamic system with correlating parameters often overlapping when analyzing relationships which can be seen in the correlation matrix in table 7 this has been noted in other studies where the overall hydrology is strongly conditioned by the mediterranean climate which is irregular and unpredictable and cause wide fluctuations in lagoon physical chemical and biological composition álvarez cobelas et al 2005 beklioglu et al 2003 fernández aláez et al 1999 quintana et al 2006 romo et al 2004 despite this unpredictability and variability our results suggest an emergence of annual patterns of salinity levels and more hydrological stability less water circulation these are seemingly determined by morphometric features and distributions of underlying low permeability layers despite all having the same climatic limitations this interaction is better summarized in the conceptual model in fig 6 where all 6 lagoonś hydrological patterns of circulation and salinity levels are plotted according to their morphologies and the presence or absence of low permeability layers lagoons that are efficiently connected with the aquifer and are shallow in terms of their morphometric features higher surface area to volume ratios tend to exhibit higher circulation and less variation in salinity in our case low salinity as freshening was occurring from groundwater inputs in l01 conversely lagoons that are deeper with less surface area to volume ratios and have low permeable underlying layers tend to exhibit more hydrological and salinity stability with lower circulation and higher salinity levels fra this illustrates that hydrological variability within the lagoons can be proportional to their physical and geomorphologic variability when comparing the restoration of the new lagoons to the natural lagoons we can see that the topographical distribution morphology and underlying lithology preservation resulted in distinct hydrological behaviors the new lagoons inflows and outflows that occur during high precipitation and sea storm events override the annual patterns of confinement seen in the natural lagoons and are more susceptible to climatic influence in their annual hydrological pattern studies have noted that confined coastal lagoons in arid or semi arid regions with little freshwater inflow limited water exchange with the sea and high evaporation rates may result in longer turnover times more stable water columns and become highly saline copeland 1967 moore and slinn 1984 saccà 2016 while small in scale our study has shown the extent of variation among and within the lagoon systems and highlights the importance of morphology and groundwater contributions in a system highly driven by climatic changes from a restoration perspective understanding hydrological behavior and parameters that drive them can help to achieve specific ecological functioning objectives outlined in a project 5 4 aphanius iberus conservation and ecological functioning in terms of conservation efforts of the aphanius iberus versus the gambusia holbrooki an important aspect that often influences their population dynamics is varying climate i e the wet years which usually results in less salinity in the lagoons favor the gambusia holbrooki while the dry years favor the aphanius iberus with more salinity nevertheless two aspects arise from the conceptual model drawn in fig 6 first lagoons with less permeable sediments with resulting higher water salinity and or less deep water columns with higher salinity fluctuations appear to be the more suitable conditions for aphanius iberus brown parts of fig 6 second there is a trade off in these aphanius iberus favorable conditions shallow lagoons facilitate salinity variability depending on the connection with the aquifer but with more risk of desiccation during dry years while deep lagoons prevent desiccation but exhibit less salinity variability in wet years the actual populations and distributions of the two species from 2018 to 2019 can be seen in fig 7 where bpi fra and m03 held better numbers of aphanius iberus versus gambusia holbrooki despite the significant rainfall and sea storm events fig 4 c d therefore a combination of several different water bodies with different morphologies and water depths seems to be the best solution to ensure the conservation of aphanius iberus in restored mediterranean salt marshes in terms of ecological functioning the la pletera salt marshes have seen plant succession towards more mature habitats over the years following the construction of the lagoons and restoration of the area the intention was to create rich and diverse mosaic of habitats and some halophyte populations have already been established in areas of high salinity while the perennial and globally distributed rupia cirrhosa has already started to colonize the new lagoons bou et al 2018 this species is of great importance in the la pletera as it not only usually grows in deeper waters and tolerates more saline conditions but it also creates favorable habitats for the aphanius iberus bou et al 2018 therefore the management and conservation of both these species could fall within the same favorable conditions depending on lagoon morphology and the presence and absence of low permeability layers also investigation into ecosystem metabolism dynamics of the old and new lagoons from 2016 to 2018 found that although the gross primary productivity to ecosystem respiration values gpp er were close to 1 g02 and fra were slightly heterotrophy and the potential productivity occurred in winter when nutrient loading occurs from water inputs bas silvestre et al 2020 another study by carrasco barea et al 2018 found that carbon storage in sediments were 3 fold higher in bpi fra and g02 than in l01 l04 and m03 although g02 had not reached the same levels as the natural lagoons it was concluded that lagoon age is an important factor determining carbon storage a similar idea was hypothesized by boadella et al 2021 that investigated microbial heterotrophic functioning this study suggested that after 15 years of restoration g02 could achieve functional recovery through organic matter and nutrient cycling while it was difficult to conclude completed restoration of the new lagoons 1 year after construction 2017 from a hydrological perspective the magnitude of water inputs and circulation facilitating nutrient loading could be influenced by an efficient connection with the aquifer and or susceptibility to climate events and surface inputs due to shallower lagoon morphology this could ultimately influence gpp and er as well as the entrance and cycling of organic matter overall the construction and restoration of the la pletera salt marshes have been largely successful in terms of restoration criteria established in quintana et al 2018 these include the preservation of the flooding confinement model increasing existing colonies of the iberian toothcarp by increasing salinity fluctuations and conserving the ecological functioning of the ecosystem the different lagoon morphologies and varying permeability layers have not only influenced salinity levels but also the heterogeneity of water circulations and levels of confinement which is typical of these ecosystems and to which all the species present are adapted as the hydrological behavior of the lagoons has already been established by the glm further study into water quality by means of aquatic ecology modeling is a logical next step in providing deeper insight into not only the effects of hydrology and hydrogeology on the nutrient cycle but also the response of the lagoon communities to different scenarios driven by increased or decreased anthropological activities and climate change 6 conclusions increasing anthropogenic activity threatens to degrade mediterranean coastal lagoons and reduce their numbers with an ever increasing need to protect and restore coastal lagoons comes also the need to increase our mechanistic understanding of coastal wetland hydrology and ecohydrological processes one of the main restoration objectives of the la pletera saltmarshes is the conservation of the endangered iberian toothcarp which requires higher salinity fluctuations the construction of the new lagoons in the la pletera saltmarsh preserved the underlying low permeability layers to create more of a confined pattern during the summer months and increase salinity levels our results indicate that while the presence and absence of low permeability layers can influence salinity fluctuations lagoon morphometry can also promote hydrological and salinity stability the interplay of these two parameters however can also have overriding effects on annual hydrological and salinity patterns this could prove important when constructing and restoring lagoons according to predetermined morphology and underlying sediment patterns as it could ultimately limit or enhance the success of set objectives and overall ecological functioning in a flooding confinement driven lagoon ecosystem conditioned by irregular and unpredictable climatic events credit authorship contribution statement

2986,mediterranean coastal lagoons are influenced from a wide variety of external factors such as surface and groundwater flows and climate dynamics they are also vulnerable to human activities which have caused a significant loss of these types of habitats as a result the eu habitat management have now prioritized restoration of natural wetlands however there is a lack of systemic studies on the mechanisms of coastal wetland degradation and ecohydrological processes that determine restored ecological functioning as an end goal as well as a lack of reference sites to make comparisons furthermore while lagoon morphometry and underlying sediment permeability have been studied extensively combining these disciplines to evaluate lagoon hydrology and salinity dynamics is yet to be fully explored the aim of this study was to analyze the hydrological dynamics of 4 newly constructed lagoons and compare them with 2 natural lagoons in the la pletera salt marshes and evaluate the restoration and conservation efforts we use the general lake model glm to assess water volume fluctuations salinity variability and lagoon water circulation groundwater and surface water inflows outflows and evaporation we also combine data of the underlying lithological characteristics and lagoon morphometry to compare and better understand the interplay of these parameters on the hydrological behavior of each lagoon results indicated that the older and natural lagoons exhibited more consistent patterns of confinement with deeper morphologies lower evaporation effect lower water circulation and more annual patterns of salinity fluctuation the presence of low permeability layers also resulted in less fluctuation of higher salinity levels conversely three of the four new lagoons had similar shallower morphologies and higher evaporation fluxes but exhibited different water circulation patterns due to the presence or absence of low permeability layers also their salinity fluctuations were more influenced by seasonal mixing than by evaporation indicating more susceptibility to climatic influence in their annual hydrological pattern than in the natural lagoons this could prove important when constructing and restoring lagoons according to predetermined morphology and underlying sediment patterns as it could ultimately limit or enhance the success of set objectives and overall ecological functioning in a flooding confinement driven lagoon ecosystem conditioned by irregular and unpredictable climatic events keywords general lake model constructed

freshwater and saltwater inputs tidal regimes and climate dynamics basset et al 2013 guelorget and perthuisot 1983 kennish and paerl 2010 kjerfve 1986 pérez ruzafa et al 2005 nidzieko et al 2014 coastal lagoons within the mediterranean region are influenced more by storm events than by tidal regimes and their surface connection to the sea and freshwater sources are limited for most of the year these types of lagoon ecosystems defined as confined coastal lagoons are typically shallow 5m and their salinity regimes fluctuate significantly according to the amount of freshwater input the climate and the level of connectedness to the sea ridden and adams 2008 trobajo et al 2002 tyler et al 2001 furthermore these lagoons have also been described as surface representations of shallow aquifers and only recently have groundwater processes been recognized as significant contributors to their hydrological behaviors and biogeochemical compositions casamitjana et al 2019 menció et al 2017 slomp and van cappellen 2004 windom et al 2006 as a result they are vulnerable to minor changes in catchment and groundwater hydrology chikita et al 2015 menció et al 2017 rodellas et al 2018 sadat noori et al 2016 also it has been shown that both freshwater inputs and morphological characteristics can control biological roles and determine the level of impact of confined lagoons basset et al 2006 cancela da fonseca et al 2001 cañedo argüelles and rieradevall 2010 félix et al 2015 it is therefore important from a management perspective to understand the hydrology of these ecosystems and to quantify the level of impact they may endure due to changes in surface and groundwater inputs while coastal wetlands and lagoons are well documented as being the most fluctuating and productive ecosystems in the world it is also well documented that coastal wetlands are severely threatened due to climate change or shifts in land use cvetkovic and chow fraser 2011 gabler et al 2017 newton et al 2012 wingard and lorenz 2014 in addition coastal wetland deterioration can contribute to climate change due to reduced carbon storage capabilities delaune and white 2012 unep map and plan bleu 2020 noted a 48 percent reduction in natural wetland habitats between 1970 and 2013 in the mediterranean basin alone thus the eu habitat management has prioritized restoration and recovery of the ecosystem services of these habitats which is why projects such as life nature have awarded financial assistance for restoration purposes on some mediterranean coastal lagoons quintana et al 2018 while this is a great step in mitigating coastal lagoon degradation aquatic habitat restoration can be challenging and ecological functioning as an end goal is not always fulfilled due to a lack of integrated understanding of the ecosystem being restored hobbs and harris 2001 also comparison of restoration efforts with other natural sites is not always possible due to a lack of reference sites or pre existing studies anton pardo et al 2013 while the majority of wetland restoration projects usually focus on eutrophication control vegetation restoration or water quality improvement the mechanistic understanding of coastal wetland degradation and ecohydrological processes especially large scale hydrological and biological connectivity is still not fully understood cui and yang 2006 harttera and ryan 2010 scheffer et al 1993 in case of the flooding confinement pattern of mediterranean coastal lagoons it has been shown that community structure dynamics are dependent on nutrient dynamics and the variability of water volume and salinity fluctuations gascón et al 2005 quintana et al 2006 while lagoon morphometry and underlying sediment permeability have been studied extensively combining these disciplines to evaluate lagoon hydrology and salinity dynamics is yet to be fully explored therefore a multidisciplinary approach in understanding these ecohydrological processes will help to evaluate overall ecological functioning within these ecosystem types the la pletera salt marshes is an example of a coastal wetland system affected by a failed urbanization project and was awarded financial assistance from the life project http lifepletera com es life pletera which aimed to restore this protected area and to recover its ecological functioning by dismantling unused urban features various studies were conducted to assess several structural and functional indicators of restoration of the salt marsh among these studies two were focused on the salinity fluctuations and groundwater dependence of two natural lagoons bpi and fra and one constructed lagoon g02 in 2002 see menció et al 2017 and casamitjana et al 2019 in 2016 three new lagoons l01 l04 and m03 were created under the second phase of the life project and they were constructed by excavating the sediment below sea level while also considering the underlying sedimentary pattern to ensure the conservation of low permeability layers present geoservei 2016 the aim was to facilitate higher salinity conditions by decreasing an efficient connection with the aquifer during periods of confinement to increase favorable refuges for the endangered iberian toothcarp fish aphanius iberus alcaraz et al 2008 badosa et al 2006 these conditions are important to reduce the competition of the invasive mosquitofish gambusia holbrooki which is more adapted to freshwater flooding conditions and less salinity variability alcaraz garcia berthou 2007 rincón 2002 ruiz navarro et al 2011 the aim of this study was to analyze the overall hydrological dynamics of the new lagoons including g02 along with their dependence on groundwater circulations and compare them with natural lagoons to assess the restoration efforts of increasing salinity fluctuations higher salinity during the dry period and ecological functioning we used the one dimensional general lake model glm to assess water volume fluctuations salinity variability and lagoon water circulation groundwater and surface water inflows rainfall outflows and evaporation to assess how the lagoons hydrological behaviors and their dependence on groundwater and surface water fluxes contribute not only to their salinity fluctuations but their total water budgets we also combine data of the underlying lithological characteristics and the overall morphometry of the natural and new lagoons to better understand the interplay of such parameters on the hydrological behavior of each lagoon individually and in comparison with each other 2 site description the study was carried out in the la pletera salt marshes which is located in the baix ter wetlands in the northeast of catalunya fig 1 a and south of the urban center of l estartit torroella de montgrí girona the climate is sub humid mediterranean and has mean temperatures of 25 c in summer and 10 c in winter the average rainfall is 590 mm year with the highest rainfall periods in spring 140 mm and autumn 200 mm estartit meteorological station 1966 2021 period pascual 2021 the la pletera lagoon system consists of six permanent lagoons two of which are natural fra and bpi fig 1 b which run perpendicular to the coastline and are remnants of an abandoned river channel the other 4 lagoons g02 l01 l04 and m03 fig 1 b were constructed and restored under two life projects 2002 and 2016 and run parallel to the coastline behind an aeolian dune system fig 1b a shallow subterranean plastic clay layer 30 90 cm in depth is present in the ssw of the salt marshes fig 1b table 1 the underlying lithological characteristics of the lagoons were analyzed by geoservei in 2016 the presence of marsh silts predominates in the areas of the natural lagoons in layers above sea level while the presence of alluvium and sands are more common in the new lagoons bpi is the only lagoon with low permeability clay layers above sea level at sea level the presence of a plastic clay layer becomes evident and extends across the central area of the fra lagoon the entire area of the m03 lagoon and three quarters of the area of the l04 lagoon which then tapers away towards the north the layer reaches a depth of around 90 cm below sea level especially in fra table 3 and fig 1c g02 does not show a record of a low permeability layer at a depth deeper than 1 m below sea level permeable fine sands form the underlying base of the lagoon systems except for fra which still shows the presence of the low permeability plastic clay layer fine sands however predominate the deeper sediment profiles of all the lagoons during the survey l01 had no low permeability layers detected throughout its sediment profile in summary the lagoons with underlying low permeability layers are bpi fra m03 and part of l04 while l01 and g02 has higher permeability layers throughout its sediment profile 2 1 historical background as is the case in other mediterranean regions this area has been affected by high anthropic pressure and the salt marsh was subjected to partial urbanization with alterations to its landscape and hydrology during the late 1980s this project was later discontinued in the 1990s years later efforts were underway to recover the areás ecological functioning and two life nature restoration projects http lifepletera com en life pletera were implemented the first project in 2002 created the lagoon g02 to ensure water permanency the lagoon was excavated below sea level during construction fig 2 a the second project in 2016 dismantled the remaining urban features promenade accesses filling material breakwaters and debris fig 2 a and was substituted by a set of new lagoons l01 m03 l04 with varying depths and shapes to produce lagoons with different salinity levels and permanency characteristics fig 1 fig 2 b quintana et al 2018 quintana et al 2018 go on to explain that among different criteria for the restoration the design of the topographic distributions of the lagoons were intended to be a reminder of the failed urbanization process with the old accesses and promenades converted into lagoons while the old roundabouts separate the permanent lagoons the intention was to create a recovered area with restored ecological functioning and not a pristine salt marsh this was because the old morphology was strongly altered and impossible to replicate 2 2 hydrology the hydrology of the la pletera lagoons is characterized by the absence of continuous surface freshwater or seawater inflows it has a micro tidal regime with a spring tidal range of about 0 15 m the water bodies are located behind a foredune with surface water exchanges occurring mainly during winter sea storms or intense rainfall events pascual 2021 these cyclonic storm events associated with strong easterly winds known as llevantades can cause sea level rise of more than 1 m marquès et al 2001 during these periods sea waves may enter the saltmarshes and together with the freshwater surface flow overland flow sub surface flow lateral percolation through the topsoil and groundwater inputs can cause a 0 3 0 9 m increase in the level of the salt marsh therefore the hydrology is strongly influenced by the sea with sudden sea storm flooding followed by extended periods of decreasing water levels and increasing salinity during confinement badosa et al 2007 lópez flores et al 2006 quintana et al 1998 2018 in hydrogeological terms the la pletera salt marsh area is connected to the shallowest level of the quaternary sediments that fill the regional basin menció et al 2017 as an unconfined aquifer with a thickness of 10 30 m this unit was formed by recent alluvial deposits which becomes marsh and coastal deposits near the coastline montaner 2010 icgc 2011a icgc 2011b this results in permanent water levels in the lagoons and contributes up to 80 of the summer water exchange when surface exchanges are scarce menció et al 2017 furthermore menció et al 2017 also concluded through hydrochemical and isotopic analyses that the water salinity of the lagoons is determined by two main processes freshwater and seawater mixing in the lagoon and aquifer and evaporation the resulting fluctuations of physical and chemical parameters such as salinity levels allow for just a few euryhaline species to establish significant populations in these lagoons 3 methods 3 1 morphometry lithological and physical characteristics bathymetric data were used to calculate the physical characteristics and morphometry of the lagoons morphometric parameters such as mean depth relative depth and volume development were calculated based on the methods by hutchinson 1957 this included calculations of the rate of change of area with respect to volume the geomorphological profiling and geological analysis were conducted in combination with drilling boreholes in the lagoon pre construction phase geoservei 2016 the main characteristics of the lagoons were estimated from the bathymetric data that were incorporated into autocad lt software to estimate surface areas volumes lengths and widths 3 2 hydrological dynamics schlumberger water level data loggers accuracy 0 02 m were used to determine daily water levels from november 2014 to september 2017 fig 3 water levels in 2018 and 2019 were obtained biweekly from depth gauge boards installed in the lagoons a ctd profiler sea sun technology was used to measure biweekly values for temperature and salinity daily average relative humidity precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were obtained from the ĺestartit meteorological station 2 km from the lagoons pascual 2021 this was used to determine the evaporation and precipitation in these lagoons data for solar radiation was obtained daily from mas badia la tallada 10 km from the la pletera in 2016 and 2017 and in situ in the la pletera with radiation sensors in 2018 and 2019 3 3 the general lake model glm and application the now well documented glm is an open source model developed as an initiative of the global lake ecological observatory network gleon with several publications documenting simulations using the model bueche et al 2017 briefly it is a one dimensional open source code designed to simulate the hydrodynamics of lakes reservoirs and wetlands hipsey et al 2019 and integrates a lagrangian layer structure similar to other 1 d lake model designs hamilton and schladow 1997 imberger and patterson 1981 by integrating the effects such as inflows and outflows mixing as well as surface heating and cooling the model computes vertical profiles of temperature salinity and density casamitjana et al 2019 the glm was applied in the la pletera lagoons in previous studies to analyze the groundwater influence in the salt marsh see menció et al 2017 and the water circulation patterns and salinity fluctuations see casamitjana et al 2019 and provided to our knowledge the first of its application in small water bodies that do not exceed 3 m in depth this study is a continuation of the work conducted by casamitjana et al 2019 and follows the same methodology in the application of the glm this study however extends the period of the natural and old lagoons bpi fra and g02 to 2019 and introduces 3 new lagoons l01 l04 and m03 constructed in 2016 the selected study period was from march 2016 to september 2019 due to the availability of data from the m03 lagoon as it was constructed later than the other lagoons the methodology of applying the glm will be explained briefly below however for a full description of the governing equations of the glm the chosen outlet point depths to model the best fit for salinity and temperature as well as observed meteorological data see data in brief inflow and outflow measurements were estimated from the water levels of the lagoons from the bathymetry data water volume at any single depth was estimated using a polynomial fit with values of r squared r2 that indicate the goodness of fit table 2 this was then followed by the net daily inflow and outflow calculations to fit the volume fluctuations the modeled inflows and outflows were then set from the net daily inflow and outflow calculations the modeled volumes were then compared to the observed water volumes as rain fluxes and evaporation are modeled separately from the inflows and outflows differing volumes emerged through an iterative process the inflows and outflows were adjusted until the modeled and real volume temperature and salinity values showed the smallest possible differences many inflows and outflows were compatible with a single water level due to estimations from the inflows and outflows however we followed the hypothesis that there is either inflow or outflow but not both at the same time for a certain day especially in summer and autumn indeed the real inflow can be higher than the estimated inflow into the lagoons in some situations especially in periods of heavy autumn rains with small estimated times for water renewal 10 days nevertheless this analysis determined the minimum inflows necessary to accurately model the observed volume levels simulation performance was assessed using the commonly applied root mean square relative error rmsre and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse table 4 3 4 data analyses bivariate pearson s correlation coefficient was used to analyze whether a statistically significant linear relationship existed between variables influencing lagoon salinity and volume levels salinity volume evaporation total inflow total outflow inflow salinity rain and surface temperature and to assess the strength of this relationship within the lagoons due to highly seasonal patterns linear mixed models were used to allow for both fixed and random effects within the analysis and aggregate the hierarchical data based on the month and year on lagoons which showed no significance in annual patterns stepwise multiple regression models for hydrological parameters affecting salinity and volume were used to analyze the variance among lagoons grouped according to their features 1 new lagoons l01 l04 m03 g02 2 old lagoons bpi fra 3 presence of low permeability layers bpi fra l04 m03 and 4 absence of low permeability layers l01 g02 statistical analyses were done with r software version 4 1 2 r project for statistical computing vienna austria and the jamovi project 2021 jamovi version 2 2 2 computer software retrieved from https www jamovi org uncertainties for empirical and modeled mean values in this study were quantified by the standard coefficient of variation following the methods by håkanson 2005 the cv value within lagoon variability cvw is calculated from time series data and is related to hydrological and physical conditions variations within and among lagoons were analyzed using the standard coefficient of variation cv to quantify parameter uncertainties as illustrated by håkanson 2005 4 results 4 1 the main characteristics and morphometry of the lagoons table 3 shows the main characteristics and morphometric features of the six lagoons in the la pletera salt marsh the new lagoons l01 l04 m03 were more homogeneous in their main characteristics and showed similarities in their volumes surface areas and mean depths they also had little stratification in their surface and bottom salinity levels l01 was the shallowest of all 6 lagoons and 2 5 fold shallower than fra l04 and m03 were similar in their volume development values at 0 80 while l01 had a value similar to the natural lagoons at 1 2 1 36 indicating a typical conical depression shape and easily eroded geology the new lagoonś relative depths were similar and lower than 2 in contrast the natural lagoons and g02 were more heterogeneous in terms of their volumes and surface areas with notable stratification in surface and bottom salinity levels in bpi and fra g02 showed little stratification in salinity levels despite being the second deepest lagoon the natural lagoons and g02 also differed in their mean depths with bpi showing a notably lower mean depth level in comparison with all the lagoons bpi also had the lowest volume development value indicating that it has less of a uniform bottom and is more of a localized deep hole the fra and g02 lagoons however showed more similarity in terms of their mean depths and have the highest volume development values they were also the deepest lagoons with higher relative depths including bpi in comparison with the other lagoons with g02 above 3 5 table 3 when comparing all the lagoons together little differences in their average surface temperatures were observed bpi fra and m03 showed 1 5 to 2 fold higher surface salinity levels than the rest of the lagoons bpi and fra had the biggest contrast in terms of the volume capacity of all the lagoons with fra having a 20 fold greater volume capacity than bpi l01 showed the lowest surface salinity levels with nearly a 1 5 to 2 5 fold lower difference than the rest of the lagoons fra and g02 had the highest lake number values followed by bpi suggesting more water column stability in these lagoons than the new lagoons l04 l01 and m03 fig 3 a shows the normalized bathymetric profiles of the six lagoons and illustrates their respective surface to height ratios the respective heights and surface areas were normalized by their maximum height and surface area values the new lagoons were similar in their bathymetric profiles shown as darker lines in contrast the natural lagoons and g02 showed differences in their profiles with bpi having the biggest surface area over height change the deeper the lagoon becomes l04 had a slightly higher surface area change with respect to its height the natural lagoons had more of a conical depression shape as can be seen with the volume development ratios in table 3 with fra showing more increase in height over its surface area at around 50 of its height with only an increase of 15 of its surface area fig 3 a fig 3 b shows the calculated rate of change of area with respect to volume values highlighted in red indicate estimated average depths in summer june to september blue indicates the estimated average depths of the lagoons for the rest of the year that excludes summer for the convenience in representation and due to the nature of the bathymetric data and varying depths of each lagoon depth are estimates that can either be above or below the indicated level within 0 1 m 0 2 m l04 l01 and m03 had similar average water depths and were shallower than the natural lagoons and g02 both in summer and for the rest of the year the difference in the new lagoonś water levels in summer compared with the rest of the year is 0 2 m 0 3 m in contrast the natural lagoons and g02 showed a 0 5 m difference in their water levels from summer to the rest of the year the rate of change of area with respect to volume shows that the new lagoons had a higher surface area rate of change than the natural lagoons and g02 at shallower depths fig 3 b this can be seen in the similar bathymetric profiles and steady increase in surface area over the heights illustrated in the darker lines in fig 3 a fra and g02 had a less rate of change of area as the lagoons get deeper fig 3 b this can also be seen in the increase in the height over surface area the deeper the lagoons become fig 3 a however bpi showed the opposite trend where the rate of change of area increases as the lagoon gets deeper g02 showed a 65 fold lower rate of change of area compared with l04 in the summer which also had the highest rate of change on average out of all the lagoons 4 2 water volume fluctuations fig 4 shows relative water volumes of all six lagoons normalized by their initial water volume on the 1st of october with the hydrological period beginning in october the previous year the year 2015 2016 was evaluated from april to october of the same year due to the availability of data similar patterns of mixing and desiccation can be seen in all the lagoons with levels increasing from the initial volume in autumn and returning to the initial volume level towards the end of summer fig 4 the year 2015 2016 and 2018 2019 had no influence of storms and only significant rainfall events fig 2 a d with 2018 2019 showing the most significant rainfall events and changes in volume levels in all the lagoons all lagoons behaved similarly in 2015 2016 with more fluctuation of volume levels in l01 than in the other lagoons fig 2 a the year 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 showed significant storm events with waves higher than 3 m on all occasions combined with significant rainfall in 2017 11 mm 126 mm fig 2 b c when evaluating the individual responses of the lagoons to rainfall and or seawater inputs the higher rainfalls above 100 mm affected bpi more with a 6 fold increase in its relative volume in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 l04 showed high fluctuations in its volume levels from both rainfall and seawater inputs overall g02 had a lower response in its relative volumes from rainfall and seawater inputs over the 4 year study period the newer lagoons l04 l01 and m03 showed a 3 to 9 fold increase in their relative volumes due to seawater inputs and a 2 5 to 3 5 fold increase with significant rainfall events in contrast g02 and fra only had a 1 5 to 3 5 fold increase during similar events 4 3 calculated glm water circulation and surface area fluxes simulation performance was assessed using the commonly applied nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square relative error rmsre table 4 for the 4 year study period the nse values on average for volume were 0 95 and 0 7 for salinity and temperature the values for rmsre were 10 for volume 20 for salinity and 23 for temperature modeled vs observed data graphs are shown in the data in brief fig 5 shows the modeled fluxes per unit of water volume of the lagoons calculated during the study period from 2016 to 2019 these fluxes are calculated in cubic meters per day per lagoon volume and are together categorized as water circulation within the lagoons inflow v outflow v evaporation v rain v for the convenience of representation calculations are converted to cubic millimeters per day except for surface area the selected time includes the periods of mixing which occur in october after the autumn rains and subsequent desiccation that occurs towards september in the summer and illustrates the overall average hydrological behavior of each lagoon inflow and outflow were modeled as a singular occurrence and did not occur concurrently also due to the nature of the hydrological activity in mediterranean lagoons the sensitivity of mean calculations was considered representative modeled results of inflow outflow evaporation and rain were normalized by their respective lagoon volumes at each time step to best represent the overall circulation of each lagoon relative to other lagoons surface area flux calculations were also normalized by their respective water volumes and included to compare with evaporation fluxes differences in mean water circulation between the lagoons can be seen across the 4 year study period despite m03 and bpi having similar mean evaporation 7 69 mm3 day 1 and 7 49 mm3 day 1 respectively l04 showed a higher surface area per volume that corresponds with higher evaporation per volume fig 5 c e while g02 had the lowest corresponding surface area and evaporation fluxes indicating a positive relationship between the surface area to volume ratio and evaporation for all the lagoons combined pearsońs correlation p 0 001 r2 0 79 supplementary table 1 the new lagoons l01 and l04 showed higher circulation with higher mean evaporation inflow and outflow in comparison with m03 and the natural lagoons bpi fra and g02 fig 5 a b c l01 and l04 had a 1 8 fold higher difference in mean inflow in comparison with m03 12 9 mm3 day 1 12 7 mm3 day 1 and 7 01 mm3 day 1 respectively while l01 showed a nearly 2 5 fold increase in mean outflow compared with mo3 8 64 mm3 day 1 and 3 53 mm3 day 1 respectively the mean effect of rain over volume was greatest in l04 and lowest in g02 with a 3 fold difference between them 5 13 mm3 day 1 and 1 72 mm3 day 1 respectively and follow a similar mean pattern to that of the surface area over volume measurements 4 4 modeled salinity inflows table 5 shows the modeled salinity inflows of the lagoons to match observed salinity levels inflow salinity values were manually entered into the glm on a daily basis for each lagoon bpi fra and m03 salinity levels were set above mediterranean sea salinity levels 37 ppt in 2016 2017 only for bpi 2018 and 2019 only in m03 this occurred mainly in the summer and autumn periods with m03 showing high inflow salinity across the seasons except in 2017 and the autumn of 2019 g02 registered higher salinity only in the summer of 2018 l04 and l01 showed no inflow salinity greater than sea salinity with l01 showing the lowest inflow salinities of all the lagoons during summer and autumn overall 2019 showed lower salinity inflow levels in all the lagoons while 2016 and 2018 had the highest levels table 6 4 5 variations among and within lagoons the within lagoon variations for all variables except surface area mainly depend on seasonal climatic changes such as desiccation in summer and seawater intrusions from winter cyclonic storms the cv expressing variations among lagoons cva is defined from the coefficient of variation of mean monthly values from different lagoons both cvw and cva were calculated from march 2016 to september 2019 as expected there were no significant differences between cvw and cva for surface temperature with variation around 20 and driven by seasonal temperature changes significant differences in morphological features surface area and volume can be seen within and among the lagoons with bpi showing the greater variance of both within the lagoon and g02 showing the lower variations within the largest variations among the lagoons were in their volume and surface areas circulation parameters among the lagoons showed variation at 30 for inflow v outflow v evap v and rain v however the circulation parameters within the lagoons had high variation due to occasional daily zero values in outflow v with l04 having a 3 fold higher variation than l01 salinity variation within the individual lagoons was 1 5 fold lower in both l01 and fra compared with the rest of the lagoons and 3 fold lower than bpi the natural lagoons bpi and fra showed the lowest inflow salinity variations while the new lagoons had a 1 5 2 fold higher variation than the natural lagoons 4 6 variables influencing salinity and volume levels to assess the relationship between variables that influence volume and salinity levels within the lagoons a series of pearson product moment correlations were performed table 7 when assessing the relationships influencing salinity the volume levels were negatively correlated with salinity in all the lagoons except for l01 where its total inflow was associated with salinity levels evaporation was associated with salinity in the natural lagoons and g02 where it was negatively correlated with salinity in bpi and positively correlated in the fra and g02 lagoons evaporation however had no significant correlation with salinity in the new lagoons also inflow salinity was associated with salinity levels only in bpi as expected the total inflow calculated by the glm was positively correlated with volume levels in all the lagoons evaporation was negatively correlated with volume levels in fra and g02 however evaporation was positively correlated with volume levels in bpi and l04 inflow salinity was positively correlated with volume levels in l04 and l01 table 8 shows the analysis of variance among lagoons grouped according to their features using stepwise multiple regression models for hydrological parameters affecting salinity and volume the lagoons are categorized as new lagoons l01 l04 m03 g02 old lagoons bpi fra presence of low permeability layers bpi fra l04 m03 and absence of low permeability layers l01 g02 g02 was removed from table 8 c d to improve consistency in lagoon morphology the new lagoonś salinity fluctuations were explained more by total inflow and outflow than by rain and evaporation in the regression models a c while volume levels explained more of the variance in the old lagoons e a similar effect on salinity was seen in lagoons with low permeability layers where volume had a bigger influence g however a combination of inflow salinity and volume helped to explain more of the variance in salinity fluctuations in lagoons without low permeability layers i total inflow and outflow affected the volume fluctuations more in the new lagoons d while rain and evaporation explained nearly all of the variance in the old lagoons f a similar result was obtained in lagoons with the presence of low permeability layers where rain and evaporation explained nearly all of the variation despite the inclusion of lagoons l04 and m03 h however the model improved greatly when total outflow was added to lagoons without low permeability layers 5 discussion recent method and technology improvements in data collection has seen a deluge of data generation and environmental modeling is a way of observing systems coherently with large data sets farley et al 2018 porter et al 2012 as with all models choosing the level of resolution and complexity within a generic model structure that is both accessible and can confidently predict system process is challenging at best bruce et al 2018 hipsey et al 2019 stress testing the glm over a global network by bruce et al 2018 identified a range of limitations that included warm or cold biased estimations and larger mean errors of temperature depending on the frequency and location of meteorological data collected accurate light extinction coefficients kw and wind speed measurements as well as the parameterization and classification to physical characteristics were also emphasized to improve model performance furthermore to increase the applicability of the glm to a wide variety of systems it was proposed to adopt a bayesian hierarchical calibration framework and increase the flexibility of assumed globally common parameter values for the core hydrodynamic parameters our investigation into shallow coastal lagoons is one of the first to our knowledge to model these types of systems that don t exceed 3 m in depth while it was found that shallow well mixed lakes performed better overall during stress testing bruce et al 2018 this study contributes to an ever increasing list of diverse system types modeled by the glm and provides insights into shallow well mixed lagoon systems with higher salinity fluctuations also the diversity of morphologies of the new and natural lagoons combined with underlying lithological characteristics and different hydrological parameters modeled separately has provided an opportunity to not only quantitatively assess the success of restoration but also to analyze factors that contribute to lagoon circulation and water volume fluctuations section 5 1 as well as lagoon salinity variability section 5 2 5 1 shallower lagoon morphometry and lack of low permeability layers can increase overall water circulation and volume fluctuation 5 1 1 lagoon circulation and morphometry our results indicate differences in the hydrodynamics of the lagoons when assessing overall water circulation and volume fluctuations in conjunction with differing lagoon morphometry and the presence or absence of low permeability layers differences between the lagoons start with their lithological characteristics and permeability shown in table 1 and are defined by their temporal and spatial distributions firstly the accumulation of decomposing plant and organic matter in marsh silts is found at the sediment water interface in the natural lagoons and not in the new lagoons due to insufficient time for decay and accumulation table 1 boadella et al 2021 geoservei 2016 the new lagoons have mostly sandy silts and alluvium deposits at the sediment water interface as unconsolidated deposits the permeability of these sediments differ with marsh silts having moderate to low permeability in the old lagoons and high to low permeability in alluvium and medium sands in the new lagoons freeze cherry 1979 lewis et al 2006 the underlying fine sands for all the lagoons have a high to moderate permeability freeze cherry 1979 lewis et al 2006 also the plastic clay layer is distributed in the south and south west of the study site which represents significantly lower permeability freeze cherry 1979 lewis et al 2006 for the affected lagoons fig 1 and reduces the efficiency of groundwater input in fra m03 and part of l04 although bpi didńt register the presence of this layer its lithological characteristics are nevertheless dominated by low permeability silts and clays table 1 also the decision to emulate the new lagoons l01 l04 and m03 to previous urban developments such as promenades and rotundas as well as to preserve the shallow underlying low permeability layers provided a guideline during construction and resulted in similar and shallower mean depths and bathymetrical profiles table 3 and fig 3 a this led to different morphometric features as well as lithological characteristics between the new and the natural lagoons resulting in differences in the hydrological patterns between them the new lagoons have similar summer and yearlong water levels higher rate of change with respect to volume and higher surface to volume ratios surface v in comparison with the old lagoons fig 3 b fig 5 e therefore the new lagoons have a higher evaporation flux in comparison with the old lagoons fig 5 c a higher surface v ratio results in higher evaporation casamitjana et al 2019 mcjannet et al 2008 this is also observed in the rate of change of area with respect to volume fig 3 b where the new lagoons surface areas increase with lower water volume the strength of the one dimensional glm to differentiate inflows outflows mixing and surface mass fluxes allows for the distinction of different circulation patterns within the lagoons this includes inflows separate from rainfall and outflow from evaporation due to the nature of the hydrological activity in mediterranean lagoons the occurrence of extreme values for inflow outflow and rain was common and concurrent with episodes of non occurrence i e either inflow or outflow occurred and periods of no rain this resulted in highly skewed data in its distribution supplementary fig 1 a b c d e f supplementary fig 2 a b c d e nevertheless the nse and rmsre values indicate reasonable adjustments despite the sudden changes in volumes table 4 also the sensitivity of mean calculations was considered convenient and representative as the occurrence of both extreme values and the non occurrence of daily parameters are equally important in water circulation representations distinguishing circulation parameters allowed for two contrasting patterns to emerge between the natural lagoons and g02 and the new lagoons l04 and l01 the circulation is higher in l01 and l04 than the natural lagoons and g02 in all parameters calculated by the glm fig 5 a b c d this also coincides with differences in the morphometric features where mean depth and relative depth are greater in fra and g02 table 3 and their variation of surface area and volume was lower table 6 both features indicate the deepness of the lagoons and hutchinson 1957 and wetzel and likens 1991 note that those that have a higher relative depth approaching 4 usually have smaller surface areas and exhibit greater resistance to mixing this idea is strengthened with the higher lake numbers for fra g02 and bpi table 3 also despite no observation of low permeability layers in g02 table 1 the response to inputs is more moderate and only increases once above 2 times its relative volume after the dry period fig 4 suggesting water column stability due to deeper lagoon morphometry and resistance to high volume fluctuation as a result of higher relative and mean depths this can be seen in table 8 where most of the variance is explained for volume fluctuations in the new lagoons when including total inflow and outflow d whereas most is explained in the old lagoons through evaporation and rainfall with little affect from total inflow and outflow f combining all these factors has led to two main findings that could be explained by lagoon morphometry first the less effect of water volume fluctuations in fra and g02 can be attributed to more water column stability due to variations in density with depth and lower evaporation effect due to smaller surface v ratio and second the new lagoons shallower profiles are sensitive to water inflows and outflows due to lower volume capacity and are subject to higher evaporation effect by the higher surface v ratio the result is higher water turnover for l04 and l01 and a quicker response to external drivers such as winter cyclonic storms or long dry periods 5 1 2 influence of low permeability layers on water circulation notable differences in the circulation patterns of m03 are observed in comparison with the other new lagoons despite sharing similar morphometric features m03 has different inflow outflow and evaporation patterns from l04 and l01 fig 5 a b c also the total coverage of underlying low permeability layers in m03 s wetted area is unique where all other lagoons except for bpi have a combination of low permeable and permeable layers underlying the wetted area fig 1 and table 1 and the more inland topographical location suggests this lagoon is subject to more confinement than the rest of the lagoons furthermore in the absence of sea storms and with rain inputs only m03 showed minimal fluctuation in water volumes in comparison with l01 and l04 fig 4 a indicating a smaller influence of rising groundwater also sea storm inputs and high rainfall can increase all the lagoonś water volume 2 12 times the initial volume in autumn however there is a lag in declining water volume levels after such events in m03 while l04 and l01 s volume levels decline quicker fig 4 b c d a similar pattern of lag can also be seen in fra m03 and bpi showed similar evaporation patterns over their respective volumes fig 5 c despite having similar surface area fluxes with l01 which has no low permeability layers fig 5 e table 1 furthermore a large part of the variance of volume fluctuations in lagoons without low permeability layers is explained with the inclusion of total outflows table 8 j whereas inflow and outflow contribute only a percentage of the total fluctuations in the presence of these layers table 8 h this suggests the underlying low permeability layers overall effect on hydrological behavior which influences inflows outflows and evaporation patterns resulting in a more elevated confinement pattern of circulation due to a less efficient connection with the aquifer therefore low permeability layers and lagoon morphometry can influence water circulation and volume fluctuations and the interplay of both can create similar hydrological behavior this is the case with bpi and m03 which behaved similarly in terms of lag in response to both inflows and outflows yet can have high increases in their relative volumes due to their lower mean and relative depths table 3 5 2 the presence and absence of underlying low permeability layers influence lagoon salinity variability 5 2 1 presence of low permeability layers in conjunction with the presence of underlying low permeability layers table 1 and fig 1 bpi fra and m03 show higher surface and bottom average salinity levels table 3 furthermore to fit the gml results to the experimental data when modeling salinity the inflow salinity levels were set to values higher than sea salinity mediterranean salinity 37ppt mainly during the summer and autumn seasons table 5 a similar observation was made by casamitjana et al 2019 who suggested that these salinity values are similar to those at the bottom of the lagoons or have a higher salinity with little stratification as is the case in m03 table 3 the study concluded that differences in water input amounts and water salinity may be attributable to the composition and permeability of the lagoons sediment while that study showed this effect in the natural lagoons bpi and fra having higher salinity inflows while g02 lower this was also observed in the new lagoon m03 showing high salinity levels in its inflows mainly during the summer autumn period table 5 although indirect these results suggest that there is a less efficient connection occurring with the aquifer which minimizes groundwater inflows and outflow circulations fig 5 and therefore more water confinement this idea is supported by a strong negative correlation between volume levels and salinity table 7 particularly in bpi fra and m03 as well as a negative correlation of total outflows and salinity levels indicating that outflows are more restricted by the low permeability layers this has an effect of increasing overall lagoon salinity when water levels decrease this idea is strengthened when volume is included in the multiple regression models that affect salinity levels in the presence of low permeability layers table 8 g however when groundwater levels increase mostly during autumn and winter cyclonic storm events fig 4 the groundwater inflows into these lagoons have salinity similar to summer salinity levels additionally some of the inflowing surface waters can have higher salinities because they flow through small salt deposits formed due to the evaporation of small ponds in between the lagoons and the sea casamitjana et al 2019 these results support similar findings by sadat noori et al 2016 who observed inputs of shallow brackish hypersaline pore water into the lagoons when groundwater levels rise also rodellas et al 2020 observed that the increased hydraulic gradient favors the upward advection of deep hypersaline pore waters in periods of shallow lagoon water depths zarroca et al 2011 went further to explain that textural and mineralogical characteristics condition the retention of salts in sediment as the low permeability of clays as well as the high capacity of adsorption and absorption contribute to the increase of ion concentrations 5 2 2 absence of low permeability layers while higher salinity levels seem to correspond with the spatial distribution of low permeability layers lagoons with lower overall salinity levels l01 l04 and g02 also correspond with the absence or partial presence of low permeability layers during rainy and stormy periods mostly in spring and autumn the inflow is estimated to be a mixture of groundwater and surface water while for the rest of the year inflow is mostly from underground sources menció et al 2017 l01 showed significant freshening during the summer period table 3 with higher salinity inflows of seawater entering during autumn storm events this suggests freshwater is the main input from the aquifer possibly due to freshwater stratification on top of a saltwater wedge menció et al 2017 although l04 had the low permeability layer conserved the partial distribution of this layer has resulted in some connection with the underlying aquifer and as a consequence more freshening and water circulation table 5 fig 5 a b in seemingly contrasting behavior to the presence of low permeability layers there were no or weak correlations found for volume levels and salinity in l01 and l04 and outflow had no effect on their salinity levels suggesting the more efficient connection to the shallow aquifer and susceptibility to the influence of circulating waters surface and groundwater inflows despite having the highest evaporation flux of all the lagoons this idea is further strengthened by the lowest coefficient of variation for inflow and outflow in l01 in table 6 this finding is in agreement with rodellas et al 2018 who determined that water recirculating through permeable sediments in a coastal lagoon could account for more than 60 of the total recharge in our case this kind of circulation may explain a significant amount of the water flow that occurs at the beginning of the autumn it is long been held that in a flooding confinement hydrological pattern coastal lagoon surface waters would be more susceptible to evaporation and salinity would increase as water levels decrease when analyzing the annual hydrological pattern there is a positive correlation of evaporation with salinity levels in the natural lagoon fra and g02 but does not correlate with salinity levels in the new lagoons table 7 bpi had a negative correlation due to a smaller surface area at lower volume levels however when aggregating the data by seasons using mixed linear models i e winter spring summer and autumn evaporation is positively correlated with salinity levels between the winter and summer seasons in both l04 and m03 r 0 44 and 0 57 respectively p 0 05 supplementary table 2 but not for l01 where its increasing salinity is more dependent on annual total inflows as well as inflow salinities table 7 r 0 45 p 0 05 due to sea water inputs furthermore a third of the variance in new lagoonś salinity can be explained by including inflow salinity while evaporation is not significant in the multiple regression models table 8 i these results imply two findings first while evaporation affects the salinity levels in the lagoons the new lagoonś salinity is controlled more by seasonal inputs second the absence of low permeability layers limits salinity variation in a confined lagoon system it is well documented that evaporation plays a role in changes in salinity levels e g lécuyer et al 2012 abd ellah and hussein 2009 also many studies have focused on submarine groundwater discharge sgd through permeable sediments and its influence on nutrient loadings and salinity of surface water bodies anschutz et al 2009 liefer et al 2013 rodellas et al 2015 however few have quantified parameters affecting salinity fluctuations with known sedimentary patterns and their influence on the overall hydrological pattern from surface and groundwater flows both from land to sea and vice versa our results show that there is an overall influence of low permeability layers on lagoon salinity variability despite the strong influences of external hydrological patterns this can be seen in the similarity of the morphometric features in l01 l04 and m03 where all are relatively shallow and have a high evaporation flux with low water levels in summer yet their salinity variability varies widely with m03 showing the highest fluctuations with lower circulation fig 5 and table 5 similarly fra and g02 show similar hydrological behavior with similar morphometric features fig 5 and table 3 but with different salinity levels the results of this study show that the new lagoons especially l01 seem to be more influenced by annual mixing than by evaporation and possibly due to underlying low permeability layer distributions that influence the efficient connection with the aquifer this is supported by menció et al 2017 who found that groundwater contributions could be as high as 80 in the dry season therefore lagoon salinity flux is not only limited by lagoon morphology or by evaporation fluxes but also by the extent of connection with the aquifer and circulating waters 5 2 2 1 a lesson learned the case of g02 as mentioned before g02 was excavated below sea level to ensure water permanency all year round however the underlying lithological characteristics were not taken into consideration and any presence of low permeability layers were probably removed during construction at the time the intention was to increase refuges for the aphanius iberus however in the years that followed g02 showed higher circulations and consistently lower salinity levels than the desired fluctuations with evidence of a higher connection with the aquifer casamitjana et al 2019 this has resulted in higher populations of gambusia holbrooki fig 7 knowledge of this inspired the preservation of low permeability layers during the construction of the new lagoons in 2016 in the hope of reducing an efficient connection with the aquifer and increase salinity fluctuations as the results of this study suggests there has been an element of influence from low permeability layers and early indications suggest that the aphanius iberus is benefitting from these measures fig 7 5 3 a tentative conceptual model our observations offer some conceptual insight into the la pletera salt marsh hydrology as summarized in fig 6 in a coastal lagoon system that is highly variable finding an annual pattern related to hydrological biogeochemical and ecological functioning can be challenging with the exception of surface temperature variation among the lagoons of the la pletera salt marsh is high with a range of 30 to 127 for all variables table 6 illustrating the diversity in lagoon structure and hydrological behavior variation within the individual lagoons is also very high indicating the different ways individual lagoons behave to external climatic and hydrogeological influences this results in a hydrologically dynamic system with correlating parameters often overlapping when analyzing relationships which can be seen in the correlation matrix in table 7 this has been noted in other studies where the overall hydrology is strongly conditioned by the mediterranean climate which is irregular and unpredictable and cause wide fluctuations in lagoon physical chemical and biological composition álvarez cobelas et al 2005 beklioglu et al 2003 fernández aláez et al 1999 quintana et al 2006 romo et al 2004 despite this unpredictability and variability our results suggest an emergence of annual patterns of salinity levels and more hydrological stability less water circulation these are seemingly determined by morphometric features and distributions of underlying low permeability layers despite all having the same climatic limitations this interaction is better summarized in the conceptual model in fig 6 where all 6 lagoonś hydrological patterns of circulation and salinity levels are plotted according to their morphologies and the presence or absence of low permeability layers lagoons that are efficiently connected with the aquifer and are shallow in terms of their morphometric features higher surface area to volume ratios tend to exhibit higher circulation and less variation in salinity in our case low salinity as freshening was occurring from groundwater inputs in l01 conversely lagoons that are deeper with less surface area to volume ratios and have low permeable underlying layers tend to exhibit more hydrological and salinity stability with lower circulation and higher salinity levels fra this illustrates that hydrological variability within the lagoons can be proportional to their physical and geomorphologic variability when comparing the restoration of the new lagoons to the natural lagoons we can see that the topographical distribution morphology and underlying lithology preservation resulted in distinct hydrological behaviors the new lagoons inflows and outflows that occur during high precipitation and sea storm events override the annual patterns of confinement seen in the natural lagoons and are more susceptible to climatic influence in their annual hydrological pattern studies have noted that confined coastal lagoons in arid or semi arid regions with little freshwater inflow limited water exchange with the sea and high evaporation rates may result in longer turnover times more stable water columns and become highly saline copeland 1967 moore and slinn 1984 saccà 2016 while small in scale our study has shown the extent of variation among and within the lagoon systems and highlights the importance of morphology and groundwater contributions in a system highly driven by climatic changes from a restoration perspective understanding hydrological behavior and parameters that drive them can help to achieve specific ecological functioning objectives outlined in a project 5 4 aphanius iberus conservation and ecological functioning in terms of conservation efforts of the aphanius iberus versus the gambusia holbrooki an important aspect that often influences their population dynamics is varying climate i e the wet years which usually results in less salinity in the lagoons favor the gambusia holbrooki while the dry years favor the aphanius iberus with more salinity nevertheless two aspects arise from the conceptual model drawn in fig 6 first lagoons with less permeable sediments with resulting higher water salinity and or less deep water columns with higher salinity fluctuations appear to be the more suitable conditions for aphanius iberus brown parts of fig 6 second there is a trade off in these aphanius iberus favorable conditions shallow lagoons facilitate salinity variability depending on the connection with the aquifer but with more risk of desiccation during dry years while deep lagoons prevent desiccation but exhibit less salinity variability in wet years the actual populations and distributions of the two species from 2018 to 2019 can be seen in fig 7 where bpi fra and m03 held better numbers of aphanius iberus versus gambusia holbrooki despite the significant rainfall and sea storm events fig 4 c d therefore a combination of several different water bodies with different morphologies and water depths seems to be the best solution to ensure the conservation of aphanius iberus in restored mediterranean salt marshes in terms of ecological functioning the la pletera salt marshes have seen plant succession towards more mature habitats over the years following the construction of the lagoons and restoration of the area the intention was to create rich and diverse mosaic of habitats and some halophyte populations have already been established in areas of high salinity while the perennial and globally distributed rupia cirrhosa has already started to colonize the new lagoons bou et al 2018 this species is of great importance in the la pletera as it not only usually grows in deeper waters and tolerates more saline conditions but it also creates favorable habitats for the aphanius iberus bou et al 2018 therefore the management and conservation of both these species could fall within the same favorable conditions depending on lagoon morphology and the presence and absence of low permeability layers also investigation into ecosystem metabolism dynamics of the old and new lagoons from 2016 to 2018 found that although the gross primary productivity to ecosystem respiration values gpp er were close to 1 g02 and fra were slightly heterotrophy and the potential productivity occurred in winter when nutrient loading occurs from water inputs bas silvestre et al 2020 another study by carrasco barea et al 2018 found that carbon storage in sediments were 3 fold higher in bpi fra and g02 than in l01 l04 and m03 although g02 had not reached the same levels as the natural lagoons it was concluded that lagoon age is an important factor determining carbon storage a similar idea was hypothesized by boadella et al 2021 that investigated microbial heterotrophic functioning this study suggested that after 15 years of restoration g02 could achieve functional recovery through organic matter and nutrient cycling while it was difficult to conclude completed restoration of the new lagoons 1 year after construction 2017 from a hydrological perspective the magnitude of water inputs and circulation facilitating nutrient loading could be influenced by an efficient connection with the aquifer and or susceptibility to climate events and surface inputs due to shallower lagoon morphology this could ultimately influence gpp and er as well as the entrance and cycling of organic matter overall the construction and restoration of the la pletera salt marshes have been largely successful in terms of restoration criteria established in quintana et al 2018 these include the preservation of the flooding confinement model increasing existing colonies of the iberian toothcarp by increasing salinity fluctuations and conserving the ecological functioning of the ecosystem the different lagoon morphologies and varying permeability layers have not only influenced salinity levels but also the heterogeneity of water circulations and levels of confinement which is typical of these ecosystems and to which all the species present are adapted as the hydrological behavior of the lagoons has already been established by the glm further study into water quality by means of aquatic ecology modeling is a logical next step in providing deeper insight into not only the effects of hydrology and hydrogeology on the nutrient cycle but also the response of the lagoon communities to different scenarios driven by increased or decreased anthropological activities and climate change 6 conclusions increasing anthropogenic activity threatens to degrade mediterranean coastal lagoons and reduce their numbers with an ever increasing need to protect and restore coastal lagoons comes also the need to increase our mechanistic understanding of coastal wetland hydrology and ecohydrological processes one of the main restoration objectives of the la pletera saltmarshes is the conservation of the endangered iberian toothcarp which requires higher salinity fluctuations the construction of the new lagoons in the la pletera saltmarsh preserved the underlying low permeability layers to create more of a confined pattern during the summer months and increase salinity levels our results indicate that while the presence and absence of low permeability layers can influence salinity fluctuations lagoon morphometry can also promote hydrological and salinity stability the interplay of these two parameters however can also have overriding effects on annual hydrological and salinity patterns this could prove important when constructing and restoring lagoons according to predetermined morphology and underlying sediment patterns as it could ultimately limit or enhance the success of set objectives and overall ecological functioning in a flooding confinement driven lagoon ecosystem conditioned by irregular and unpredictable climatic events credit authorship contribution statement

2987,in the real time flood control operation of a multi reservoir system the multi reservoir real time flood control hybrid operation mrfcho model with reduced structure is an effective way to improve the efficiency but the reduction of the model structure may cause greater flood risk this paper focuses on this scientific problem and evaluates the reliability of the mrfcho model in real time flood control operation through risk analysis firstly the flood risk is defined then the bayesian network risk analysis model is established through four parts bayesian network structure construction training samples generation parameter learning and inference this paper takes the flood control system in upstream of the lutaizi point in the huaihe river basin as a case study the flood risk of the mrfcho model caused by the model structure reduction is quantitatively described the spatial distribution and propagation characteristics of flood risk are evaluated and the flood risk caused by the double uncertainties of the model structure and flood forecasting is analyzed besides the factors affecting the risk of the public flood control point are diagnosed the results show that 1 the model structure reduction does not significantly increase the flood risk at the public flood control point and there is no obvious propagation law of flood risk in space 2 compared with only considering the model structure reduction considering the double uncertainties of flood forecasting and model structure reduction has a 65 probability of increasing the risk 3 runoff from the runheji point in the upper reaches of main stream and the lateral inflow of lutaizi point are the main reasons for the risk of lutaizi point keywords multi reservoir system flood control operation model structure reduction hydrological uncertainty risk analysis bayesian network 1 introduction as one of the most common natural disasters floods are extremely destructive and pose a great threat to society as the model of an organic combination of flood control engineering measures and non engineering measures real time flood control operation of multi reservoir systems plays an important role in mitigating flood disasters the multi reservoir real time flood control operation is obtaining operation schemes based on the flood forecasting and reservoir information and then making flood control decisions the forecast optimal operation flood routing chain is affected by many uncertainty factors such as the flood forecasting error reservoir capacity curve error reservoir discharge curve error flood routing error etc the comprehensive influence of these uncertainties leads to risk in flood control decision making it is of great significance to analyze the risk of reservoir flood control operation because it is related to the safety of life and property in the past few decades many studies have contributed to the development of risk analysis of flood control systems the widely used theoretical methods mainly include the return period method tung and mays 1981 asce et al 2013 the analytical method jiang 1998 the reliability analysis method melching 1992 the stochastic simulation method li et al 2010 bayesian network method pan et al 2019 lu et al 2020 etc with the gradual expansion of the flood control system the flood control operation has gradually developed from single reservoir optimal operation to river reservoir joint optimal operation and multi reservoir system joint optimal operation accordingly the research on flood control operation risk analysis has also experienced the development process from the single reservoir operation risk analysis to river reservoir operation risk analysis and then to the multi reservoir operation risk analysis the risk of a single reservoir operation usually refers to the probability of reservoir overtopping kwon and moon 2006 analyzed the probability of dam overtopping based on the nonparametric probability density estimation method the latin hypercube sampling method and the bootstrap resampling methods yan et al 2014 studied the risk of the flood control operation of geheyan reservoir under several kinds of forecasting accuracy which provided a scientific basis for the forecast and operation of the reservoir hsu et al 2011 studied the risk of reservoir overtopping affected by flood and wind huang et al 2018 took various uncertainty factors such as flood forecasting and flood hygrograph into consideration and introduced the entropy method to analyze the risk of single reservoir flood control operation the risk analysis of the joint operation of the reservoir and downstream river usually considers the risk of reservoir overtopping and the flood risk at the downstream control point diao and wang 2010 considered a variety of uncertainty factors and analyzed the risk of river reservoir flood control systems based on the stochastic simulation method chen et al 2015 proposed the calculation formulas of the risk at each moment of the river reservoir flood control system and the comprehensive risk of the flooding process based on the combination theory of stochastic processes at present as the scale of the multi reservoir system is becoming larger and larger the complexity of the system is getting higher and higher various uncertainty factors influence each other resulting in the difficulty of joint probability solutions the research on risk analysis of the joint operation of multi reservoir systems is deepening gradually chen et al 2017 chen et al 2019 put forward risk analysis methods of a multi reservoir system based on the decomposition integration method and dynamic bayesian network theory respectively which provided effective methods for risk analysis of complex multi reservoir systems zhang et al 2019 divided the operation horizon into two stages the forecast lead time period and the beyond forecast time period and simulated the uncertainties of the two stages respectively the application in cascade reservoirs shows that the power generation in the flood season can be increased without increasing the flood risk xu et al 2021 established an integrated model of real time flood control risk identification analysis and diagnosis for multi reservoir systems based on the copula function and found that the risk analysis considering the temporal and spatial correlation is more conducive to the overall safety of the flood control system in real time flood control operation of a multi reservoir system the dynamic change of rainfall flood and reservoir storage leads to the dynamic change of flood control capacity of the reservoir at a certain moment the reservoirs have different flood control effects the reservoir with significant flood control effect is defined as an effective reservoir otherwise it is defined as a noneffective reservoir li et al 2019 proposed a multi reservoir real time flood control hybrid operation mrfcho model in which the effective reservoirs are operated jointly and the noneffective reservoirs are operated separately compared to the multi reservoir real time flood control joint operation mrfcjo model of all reservoirs the mrfcho model can improve flood control efficiency because the model structure is reduced however the mrfcjo model usually brings the greatest flood control benefits and the reduction of the model structure may lead to a decrease in flood control benefits and an increase in flood risk therefore the quantitative risk assessment of the mrfcho model is a key measure to evaluate the reliability of the model the existing studies are all aimed at risk analysis of a single reservoir or a flood control system with fixed topology how to establish the risk assessment model of the mrfcho model quantitatively analyze the risk caused by model structure reduction and its evolution rules and clarify the causes of risks is of great significance for guiding real time flood control operation and risk decision making the bayesian network has a powerful ability to solve the joint probability distribution and it is an effective tool for expressing uncertainty knowledge and probabilistic reasoning weber et al 2012 marcot and penman 2019 with the changes in real time rain and flood conditions the dynamic combination of effective reservoirs and noneffective reservoirs of the mrfcho model further exacerbates the difficulty of solving the joint probability distribution therefore the bayesian network is introduced to describe the flood risk under the double uncertainties of structure reduction and flood forecasting in this paper first the definitions of the risks under the double uncertainties are proposed then the bayesian network based risk analysis model is established in four steps namely bayesian network topological structure construction training samples generation parameter learning and inference finally in the case study the risk caused by the structural reduction of the mrfcho model as well as the spatial evolution characteristics of the risk is analyzed the risk caused by the double uncertainties of structure reduction and flood prediction is described quantificationally and the cause of flood risk at the public flood control point is diagnosed the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 defines the flood risk and establishes the bayesian network based risk analysis model section 3 presents a case study as well as results and discussions finally section 4 concludes this paper 2 methodology the risk analysis of the mrfcho model with a reduced model structure is carried out in this paper first the flood risk of the mrfcho model is defined after that the bayesian network based risk analysis model is constructed through four processes network structure construction training samples generation parameter learning and inference the framework of this paper is shown in fig 1 2 1 definition of flood risk establishing the mrfcjo model and implementing a joint operation of all reservoirs is the traditional way for real time flood control operation the mrfcho model in which the effective reservoirs are operated jointly and the noneffective reservoirs are operated separately was proposed to increase efficiency li et al 2019 the objective function of the mrfcjo model is shown in formula a 1 and the objective functions of the mrfcho model are shown in formulas a 2 and a 3 besides the constraints are shown in formula a 4 to formula a 8 in general the risk is the product of the probability of an event occurring and its consequences in the field of hydrology it is often difficult to measure the consequences of events such as economic losses casualties etc therefore the risk is usually simplified and defined as the probability of occurrence of a risk event tung and mays 1981 sun et al 2018 according to this definition the flood risk at the public control point is defined as the probability that the actual peak discharge exceeds the safety discharge at the flood control point 1 risk p q c m q s qs f q c m d q c m where qs is the safety discharge at the public control point q c m is the peak discharge of the flood hydrograph at the public control point p q c m q s is the probability that the peak discharge at a public control point exceeds the safety discharge f q c m is the probability density function pdf of q c m determined by bayesian network parameter learning 1 risk caused by the model structure reduction the risk of the mrfcho model caused by the model structure reduction is the change in the flood risk at the public control point compared with the mrfcjo model which is expressed by the following formula 2 δ r i s k 1 r i s k 1 r i s k 0 where ris k 1 is the flood risk at the public control point generated by the mrfcho model which is calculated by formula 1 ris k 0 is the flood risk at the public control point generated by the mrfcjo model which is calculated by formula 1 δ r i s k 1 is the risk of the mrfcho model caused by the model structure reduction the schematic of flood risk is shown in fig 2 2 risk caused by the model structure reduction and flood forecast in the real time operation of reservoirs flood forecast error is the main uncertainty factor affecting the operation result yan et al 2014 considering the peak discharge forecast error of the reservoir inflow and lateral inflow this paper carries out the flood risk analysis under the double uncertainties of the model structure reduction and flood forecast of the mrfcho model the peak discharge forecast error is denoted as ε then 3 q m q m 1 ε where q m is the actual peak discharge q m is the forecasted peak discharge if the flood risk of the mrfcho model considering the flood forecast error is ris k 2 then the flood risk with double uncertainties is defined as 4 δ r i s k 2 r i s k 2 r i s k 0 2 2 construction of the bayesian network structure bayesian network is composed of two elements model structure and parameters the model structure is represented by a directed acyclic graph dag where random variables represent nodes and directed edges between nodes represent the causal relationship between the random variables weber et al 2012 baksh et al 2018 the flood risk at the public control point refers to the joint probability distribution of peak discharge exceeding the safety discharge under the influence of upstream reservoir release and lateral inflow according to the bayesian theory it can be expressed as 5 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i π i where x i represents the random variable π i is the father node of x i n is the total number of random variables p x i π i is the conditional probability density function of x i p x 1 x 2 x n is the joint probability distribution of n random variables if there are m reservoirs and n control points in the flood control system the inflow of the ith reservoir is q r i the outflow of the ith reservoir is q r i the lateral inflow in the upstream of the jth control point is q l j and the flow at the jth control point q c j the generalized configuration of a multi reservoir system is shown in fig 3 the mrfcjo model and the mrfcho model have the same reservoir inflows and lateral inflows but different reservoir outflows and flows of the control point the ith reservoir outflow of the mrfcjo model is denoted as q r i 0 and the flow of the jth control point is denoted as q c j 0 the ith reservoir outflow of the mrfcho model is denoted as q r i 1 and the flow at the jth control point is denoted as q c j 1 the first step of establishing a bayesian network based risk analysis model is structure learning which refers to the determination of the optimal network topology based on expert knowledge or training data sets madsen et al 2017 in the problem of flood risk analysis for multi reservoir systems decision makers mainly focus on whether the peak discharge of the control point exceeds the safety discharge therefore this paper selects the following four kinds of random variables as the nodes of the bayesian network 1 the peak discharge of the ith reservoir inflow q r mi 2 the peak discharge of the ith reservoir outflow of the mrfcjo model q r mi 0 and the mrfcho model q r mi 1 3 the peak discharge of lateral inflow in the upstream of the jth control point q l mj 4 the peak discharge of the flow at the jth control point of the mrfcjo model q c mj 0 and the mrfcho model q c mj 1 since experts have a clear cognition of the causal relationship between these random variables the network topology can be constructed directly based on expert knowledge shown as the following steps 1 the four kinds of random variables are generalized as the network nodes the variables of the mrfcjo model are q r mi q r mi 0 q l mj q c mj 0 and the variables of the mrfcho model are q r mi q r mi 1 q l mj q c mj 1 2 according to the flood control system structure shown in fig 3 all m reservoirs and n flood control points are ranked according to the principle of first upstream then downstream first tributary then main stream 3 the causal relationship of each random variable is analyzed and the bayesian network nodes are ranked according to the order of the reservoirs and flood control points as well as the principle of first cause then result for random variables 4 the directed edge is determined according to the causality of random variables that is the direction from the cause node to the result node the structure of the bayesian network of the mrfcjo model and the mrfcho model is shown in fig 4 2 3 generation of the bayesian network training samples parameters of a bayesian network are the prior probability density function of the root node and the conditional probability distribution of the non root node parameter learning refers to determining the parameters of the bayesian network with a determined network structure based on expert experience or training samples zhou et al 2016 2 3 1 generation of the spatial magnitude double random flood samples in the real time operation of multi reservoirs floods are stochastic in both space and magnitude spatial randomness means that the inflow of a reservoir may occur in another reservoir or area at other times a lateral inflow may also occur in a reservoir or other areas that is the flood morphology of a certain location i e a reservoir inflow or a lateral inflow may be the same as that of others anywhere to make the bayesian network more adaptable in real time flood risk reasoning this paper proposes a space magnitude double random training sample generation method for the flood control system including m reservoirs and n flood control points as shown in fig 3 the training samples are generated according to the following steps 1 selecting the k annual maximum peak discharges of p gauging stations it is assumed that the annual maximum peak discharge conforms to the p iii distribution function the linear moment method is used to estimate the parameters and the probability density distribution function of annual maximum flood peak discharge of each station is obtained denoted as f 1 f 2 f p where the probability density distribution function of the uth gauging station is f u 2 dividing the sub basin of each gauging station it is assumed that the peak discharge of reservoir inflow and lateral inflow in the uth sub basin has the same distribution as the uth gauging station 3 for the flood control system as shown in fig 3 l historical typical floods are selected taking into account factors such as flood magnitude and flood morphology each typical flood includes inflows of m reservoirs and lateral inflows of n flood control point there are a total of o l m n historical floods the o flood is taken as the historical flood sample set and the historical flood peak discharges are denoted as q m h h 1 2 o 4 if the ith reservoir is in the uth sub basin according to the distribution f u the latin hypercube sampling lhs method is used to generate a random sample set of peak discharges with a sample size of z denoted as q r mi v i 1 2 m v 1 2 z 5 if the vth peak discharge of the ith reservoir q r mi v has the smallest difference with the flood peak discharge q m h in the o sample set then the homogeneous multiple enlargement method ge et al 2013 is applied to enlarge the hth flood according to the ratio q r mi v q m h the vth inflow of the ith reservoir can be then obtained denoted as q r i v 6 for m reservoirs generating z reservoir inflow samples following step 4 to step 5 denoted as q r i v i 1 2 m v 1 2 z 7 if the jth flood control point is in the uth sub basin the lhs method is used to generate z peak discharge of the lateral inflow which follows the distribution f u denoted as q l mj v j 1 2 n v 1 2 z 8 if the vth peak discharge of the jth flood control point q l mj v has the smallest difference with the flood peak discharge q m h in the o sample set then the homogeneous multiple enlargement method is applied to enlarge the hth flood according to the ratio q l mj v q m h the vth inflow of the jth flood control point can be then obtained denoted as q l j v 9 for n flood control points generating z lateral inflow samples following step 7 to step 8 denoted as q l j v j 1 2 n v 1 2 z 10 the random flood sample set which includes z samples of reservoir inflows and lateral inflows can be obtained denoted as s q v q r i v q l j v i 1 2 m j 1 2 n v 1 2 z 2 3 2 extraction of bayesian network training samples the random flood sample set s q v q r i v q l j v includes reservoir inflows and interval inflows in order to generate bayesian network training samples z floods in s q v should be taken as the input of the mrfcjo model and the mrfccho model to obtain the reservoir outflows and flows at the flood control point respectively the effective reservoirs for each flood are identified according to the rfc method before implementing operation for the mrfcho model li et al 2020 the floods and operation schemes of the mrfcjo model are denoted as s 0 q r i v q r i v 0 q l j v q c j v 0 where i 1 2 m j 1 2 n v 1 2 z q r i v is the vth inflow of ith reservoir q r i v 0 is the vth outflow of the ith reservoir obtained by the mrfcjo model q l j v is the vth lateral inflow of the upstream of jth flood control point q c j v 0 is the vth flow at the jth flood control point obtained by the mrfcjo model the floods and operation schemes of the mrfcho model are denoted as s 1 q r i v q r i v 1 q l j v q c j v 1 where q r i v 1 is the vth outflow of the ith reservoir obtained by the mrfcho model q c j v 1 is the vth flow at the jth flood control point obtained by the mrfcho model the peak discharge from s 0 and s 1 are extracted to obtain the bayesian network training sample set of the mrfcjo and mrfcho model denoted as s m 0 q r mi v q r mi v 0 q l mj v q c mj v 0 and s m 1 q r mi v q r mi v 1 q l mj v q c mj v 1 respectively where i 1 2 m j 1 2 n v 1 2 z q r mi v is the vth inflow peak discharge of ith reservoir q r mi v 0 is the vth outflow peak discharge of ith reservoir obtained by the mrfcjo model q r mi v 1 is the vth outflow peak discharge of ith reservoir obtained by the mrfcho model q l mj v is the vth lateral inflow peak discharge of the upstream of jth flood control point q c mj v 0 is the vth flow peak discharge at the jth flood control point obtained by the mrfcjo model q c mj v 1 is the vth flow peak discharge at the jth flood control point obtained by the mrfcho model 2 4 parameter learning of the bayesian network parameter learning of the bayesian network is determining the prior probability density functions of root nodes and the conditional probability density functions of non root nodes the four random variables selected in this paper are all continuous variables so these variables are needed to be discretized because the bayesian network can only deal with discrete variables this paper adopts the equal width method to discretize continuous variables lu et al 2020 the equal width method is an unsupervised discretization method which divides the range of random variables into b intervals on average and each interval has the same width and is equal to x max x min b where x max is the maximum value of the variable and x min is the minimum value of the variable the more the interval is divided the more accurate the reasoning result will be but at the same time the amount of calculation will increase exponentially the sample set s m 0 of the mrfcjo model and s m 1 of the mrfcho model contain the values of each node of four random variables which form complete training sets for bayesian network parameter learning in this paper the maximum likelihood estimation mle method richards 1961 is used for parameter learning if there are o observing samples denoted as x x 1 x 2 x o the likelihood function is 6 l θ x p x θ x x p x x θ the estimated parameter value is 7 θ arg max θ l θ x arg max θ x x ln p x θ through bayesian network learning the trained bayesian network of the mrfcjo model and the mrfcho model can be obtained 2 5 inference of the bayesian network inference means that based on the trained bayesian network given the observed values of some nodes calculate the posterior probability of other unknown nodes according to the joint probability distribution in this paper the junction tree algorithm is used for bayesian network inference the node with an observation value is the evidence node denoted as evi the node with the probability distribution to be solved is called the query node denoted as que according to the bayesian theory when the value of evidence node is e the posterior probability of query node is 8 p que e v i e p evi e q u e p que p evi e the advantage of bayesian network for probabilistic reasoning is that it is not restricted by the direction and can be used to calculate the probability distribution of other nodes by giving any node value according to the direction of reasoning it can be divided into prediction and diagnosis 1 prediction prediction is a top down inference and it is from cause to result the probability of different consequences can be analyzed according to the known evidence in the risk analysis of flood control operation the peak discharge of reservoir inflow and lateral inflow are known and form a predictive sample set denoted as s f m q r mi v q l mj v i 1 2 m j 1 2 n v 1 2 z where z is the total number of predictive samples prediction refers to inferring the probability of flood risk in downstream flood control points based on the predictive sample set s f m 2 diagnosis diagnose is a bottom up inference and it is from result to cause the possible reasons and probabilities of such results can be inferred and analyzed based on known results in the risk analysis of flood control operation given that the peak discharge at a flood control point exceeds the safety discharge the most likely range of the peak discharge of its parent node can be inferred the factors causing such risk and the probability of each factor can be diagnosed to guide risk control 3 case study the huaihe river basin is one of the most severe flood disaster areas in china because of frequent rainstorms in the flood season this paper takes the reservoir system in the upper and middle reaches of the huaihe river basin as a case study the flood control system consists of 14 reservoirs and 11 flood control points among which lutaizi is the public flood control point the flood control system and its conceptual diagram are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively 3 1 structure construction and parameter learning of the bayesian network the peak discharge of inflow and outflow of 14 reservoirs the peak discharge of lateral inflow in upstream of 11 flood control points and the peak discharge of flow at the 11 flood control points are generalized into network nodes then ranking the network nodes drawing the directed edges according to causality and the bayesian network structure of the flood control system is obtained as shown in fig 7 in the huaihe river basin since the 14 reservoirs were put into operation the basin wide flood which has large scale influence is infrequent considering the location of rainstorm center flood magnitude and flood morphology 13 historical typical floods which include inflows of 14 reservoirs and lateral inflows of 11 flood control points are selected i e l 13 o 13 14 11 325 the division of sub basins is shown in fig 6 according to the training sample generation method described in section 2 3 1000 random floods are generated as input to the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model the random floods and operation results are used to extract training samples for bayesian network parameter learning the peak discharge of the ith reservoir inflow is q r mi v and the peak discharge of lateral inflow in upstream of the jth control point is q l mj v for the mrfcho model the peak discharge of the ith reservoir outflow is q r mi v 1 and the peak discharge of the flow at the jth control point is q c mj v 1 for the mrfcjo model the peak discharge of the ith reservoir outflow is q r mi v 0 and the peak discharge of the flow at the jth control point is q c mj v 0 the above random variables are discretized according to the equal width method in this paper the interval widths are all set as 200 m3 s that is x max x min b 2 00 m3 s the discrete sample set corresponding to the mrfcho model is denoted as s m 1 q r mi v q r mi v 1 q l mj v q c mj v 1 i 1 2 14 j 1 2 11 v 1 2 1000 the discrete sample set corresponding to the mrfcjo model is denoted as s m 0 q r mi v q r mi v 0 q l mj v q c mj v 0 i 1 2 14 j 1 2 11 v 1 2 1000 in this paper the sample set s m 1 and s m 0 are used for parameter learning of the bayesian network the prior probability density functions of the peak discharge of the reservoir inflow and lateral inflow can be then determined as well as the conditional probability density functions of the peak discharge of the reservoir outflow and flow at the flood control point the flood risk analysis of the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model in real time operation can be then carried out based on the trained bayesian network 3 2 prediction generate 100 floods and the peak discharge of reservoir inflows and lateral inflows constitute the bayesian network prediction sample set denoted as s f m q r m 1 v q r m 14 v q l m 1 v q l m 11 v v 1 2 100 the risk prediction of 100 flood samples in the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model are carried out respectively the flood risk at public flood control points caused by the structural reduction of the mrfcho model is quantified and the spatial distribution and evolution of the flood risk are analyzed in addition the risk under the double uncertainties of model structure reduction and flood forecasting is described quantitatively 3 2 1 flood risk caused by the model structure reduction the samples in the sample set s f m are input as evidence into the bayesian network of the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model and prediction is performed to obtain the probability distribution of the flood peak flow at the lutaizi point the actual safety discharge of lutai point is 10000 m3 s the flood risk of lutaizi point under the mrfcho and mrfcjo model operation can be calculated by formula 1 and the flood risk caused by the model structure reduction can be calculated by formula 2 the flood risk caused by the structure reduction of the mrfcho model is shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that 57 of the samples have a flood risk probability within 0 2 and 91 of the samples have a flood risk probability within 0 6 the probability of flood risk caused by the model structure reduction is less than 1 5 which shows that the reduction of the model structure does not result in a significant increase in flood risk at the public flood point take sample no 62 the highest risk sample for a detailed analysis when the safety discharge of the luthaizi point takes different values the flood risks of the luthaizi point corresponding to the two operation models can be calculated according to formula 1 as shown in fig 9 as can be seen from fig 9 the flood risk rate of the lutaizi point obtained by the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model decreases with the increase of the safety discharge of the lutaizi point when the safety discharge is less than 5000 m3 s the flood risk probability of both models is close to 100 when the safety discharge is larger than 12000 m3 s the risks of the two models are close to zero the higher the flood control standard of the flood control point the larger the safety discharge and the lower the risk under the same flood event in addition the flood risk rate corresponding to the mrfcho model is slightly higher than that of the mrfcjo model but the difference between the two models corresponding to different safety discharges is different when the safety discharge takes the actual value 10000 m3 s the risk of the mrfcho model is 3 87 and the risk of the mrfcjo model is 2 46 with a difference of 1 41 when the safety discharge is 7000 m3 s the difference between the two models is the largest which is 6 68 therefore the flood risk caused by model structure reduction uncertainty δ r i s k 1 changes with the change of safety discharge of the flood control point the flood risk of the mrfcho model of the no 62 flood sample is the largest indicating that the flood sample is of a large magnitude in this case when the safety discharge is 12000 m3 s the risk is close to zero therefore if the lutaizi point is to avoid any risk in a large flood the flood control standard can be improved and the corresponding safety discharge is 12000 m3 s 3 2 2 the spatial characteristics of the risk of the mrfcho model the flood risk of each flood control point is calculated to analyze the spatial evolution characteristics of flood risk of the mrfcho model the flood risk of 11 flood control points is deduced by the bayesian network model according to the actual safety discharges of these flood control points the flood risk of each sample at bantai xixian wangjiaba luohe and hengpaitou points is zero huangchuan runheji zhoukou and fuyang points have low flood risks jiangjiaji and lutaizi points have relatively high flood risks the statistical results of the number of samples in different risk intervals are shown in table 1 spatial characteristics of flood risk in the flood control system are shown in fig 10 1 spatial distribution characteristics of flood risk it can be seen from table 1 that the flood risk probability of huangchuan runheji zhoukou and fuyang points is mostly concentrated within 0 05 and the maximum risk probability of fuyang point does not exceed 0 2 among them huangchuan zhoukou and fuyang are flood control points on the tributaries of the huaihe river and their safety discharges are 1500 m3 s 3000 m3 s and 3300 m3 s respectively the magnitude of flood in their sub basins is generally small and the flood risk is low under the safety discharge the runheji point is the main flood control point on the main stream of the huaihe river with a safety discharge of 8000 m3 s and the flood risk is also low as can be seen from table 1 that jiangjiaji has the highest flood risk and the number of samples with a flood risk of less than 1 accounts for nearly 60 followed by those with a risk between 1 and 3 and the number of samples with the risk over 5 accounts for 7 the flood risk at the lutaizi point is second only to that of the jiangjiaji point the number of samples with a flood risk of less than 1 accounts for about 50 followed by the risk between 1 and 2 there are 11 flood samples with a risk greater than 2 and less than 4 according to the above results except for jiangjiaji and lutaizi points the flood risk of other points is almost negligible the jiangjiaji point with a safety discharge of 3580 m3 s is located in the southeast mountainous area of the huaihe river basin which is the area with the largest flood magnitude in the huaihe river basin the safety discharge of hengpaitou point in the southeast mountainous area is 8400 m3 s there are two reservoirs in upstream namely foziling and xianghongdian and the flood risk for all samples is 0 by comparison the flood control storage of nianyushan and meishan reservoir is a little different from that of the foziling and xianghongdian reservoir and both have a large flood regulation capacity the jiangjiaji point has a small safety discharge and low flood control standard which is the main factor causing the high flood risk improving the flood control standard of jiangjiaji point is an effective way to reduce its flood risk 2 spatial evolution of flood risk fig 10 illustrates that if the mrfcho model is used for operation only huangchuan point has a flood risk within 0 05 in upstream of wangjiaba point and flood risk will not occur in the 100 samples at the bantai xixian and wangjiaba points the flood risk from jiangjiaji to runheji is significantly reduced although the flow at runheji point contains its own lateral inflow and the flow above wangjiaba and jiangjiaji as the main point in the main stream of huaihe river runheji has a large safety discharge so the flood risk is low the flood risk from luohe to zhoukou and then to fuyang point increases slightly the flood risk from runheji fuyang and hengpaitou point to lutaizi point is obviously increased which may be due to the large lateral inflow in the upper reaches of lutaizi point coupled with the flow from runheji as well as the flow from hengpaitou and fuyang in the tributaries leading to the flood risk of lutaizi point 3 2 3 flood risk caused by the double uncertainties in the real time flood control operation of multi reservoirs the flood forecasting uncertainty is the main uncertainty factor affecting the operation results the impact of double uncertainties of flood forecasting and model structure reduction on flood risk of the mrfcho model is evaluated in this section it is assumed that the flood forecasting error ε is 10 according to the formula 3 the sample set considering the flood forecasting error is s f m q r m 1 v q r m 14 v q l m 1 v q l m 11 v v 1 2 100 the sample set s f m is input as evidence into the bayesian network of the mrfcho model and the probability distribution of flood peak discharge at each flood control point is obtained by prediction the safety discharge of lutaizi point is 10000 m3 s and the flood risk of lutaizi point is calculated by formula 1 according to formula 4 the flood risk caused by the double uncertainties can be then obtained and the statistical result is shown in fig 11 fig 11 shows that the number of samples with a flood risk of less than 0 2 caused by double uncertainties is the largest followed by between 0 2 0 4 and 0 4 0 6 the number of samples with a risk of less than 0 6 accounts for 82 however the flood risk caused by double uncertainties does not exceed 2 at most compared with the flood risk caused by the model structure reduction in fig 8 the flood risk caused by double uncertainties is larger on the whole the difference between the flood risk under double uncertainties and only the model structure reduction uncertainty is calculated that is the flood risk under double uncertainties minus the flood risk that only considers the model structure reduction and the result is shown in fig 12 it can be seen from fig 12 that the difference between flood risk caused by double uncertainties and model structure reduction is between 0 and 0 2 at most followed by 0 2 to 0 the number of samples with risk larger than 0 2 is obvious more than risk less than 0 2 the number of samples with risk larger than 0 accounts for 65 which indicates that the flood risk caused by double uncertainties of flood forecasting error and model structure reduction is generally greater than the flood risk caused by model structure reduction in 35 of the samples the flood risk caused by double uncertainties is lower indicating that the flood forecasting error may offset each other with the model structure reduction 3 3 diagnosis in addition to risk prediction the bayesian network can also be used for risk reverse diagnosis assuming the probability of flood risk at the lutaizi point and inferring the possible reasons for such a result so as to provide guidance for risk control assuming that in a certain flood the peak discharge of lutaizi point exceeds 10 of the safety discharge that is the value of node 50 is 11000 m3 s the bayesian network corresponding to the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model is used for diagnosis respectively the probability distribution of peak discharge of its parent node node 30 42 48 49 is obtained the probability distributions of flood peak discharge at runheji point node 30 fuyang point node 42 hengpetou point node 48 and peak discharge of lateral inflow in the upper reaches of lutaizi node 49 are shown in tables 2 5 tables 2 5 illustrates that when the peak discharge of lutaizi point exceeds the safety discharge and takes the value of 11000 m3 s the probability distributions obtained by the diagnosis of the bayesian network corresponding to the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model are similar if the mrfcho model is used for operation there is a 59 chance that the peak discharge at runheji point is between 4400 m3 s and 4600 m3 s and there is a 28 chance that it is between 6800 m3 s and 7000 m3 s the probability of peak discharge at the fuyang point is 87 between 2800 m3 s and 3000 m3 s the peak discharge at the henpaitou point has a 60 probability between 4400 m3 s and 4600 m3 s and a 30 probability between 2800 m3 s and 3000 m3 s there is a 66 chance of lateral inflow peak discharge of the lutaizi point is between 5200 m3 s and 5400 m3 s and a 34 chance of 4000 m3 s and 4400 m3 s the above results show that when the peak flow of the lutaizi point is 11000 m3 s the risk is mainly caused by the flow from the runheji point in the upper reaches of the main stream and the lateral inflow from the upper reaches of the lutaizi point followed by the flow from the hengpaitou point and the impact of flow at the fuyang point is the least in the follow up real time flood control operation if floods of a larger magnitude occur decision makers can focus on the effective reservoirs above runheji point and hengpaitou point under the premise of ensuring reservoir safety regulating the release of reservoirs in upstream of the runheji point and the hengpaitou point is a way to reduce the peak discharge of the lutaizi point and avoid flood risk 4 conclusions in the real time flood control operation of a multi reservoir system the mrfcho model is an effective way to improve the efficiency of flood control operation because the model structure is reduced in order to quantitatively evaluate the flood risk of the mrfcho model caused by the reduction of model structure this paper adopts the bayesian network which is extremely advantageous in the probabilistic reasoning of complex systems to conduct a risk analysis first the flood risk is defined then the bayesian network risk analysis model is established through four steps namely network structure construction training samples generation parameter learning and inference the flood control system in upstream of the lutaizi point in the huaihe river basin is taken as a case study in terms of prediction the flood risk of the mrfcho model caused by the model structure reduction is quantified the spatial distribution and evolution characteristics are analyzed and the risk under the double uncertainties of flood forecasting and model structure reduction is described in terms of diagnosis it is assumed that a flood risk occurs at a public flood control point and the cause of the risk is diagnosed the results show that 1 the flood risk of the mrfcho model is slightly greater than that of the mrfcjo model and the risk caused by the model structure reduction does not exceed 1 5 therefore the model structure reduction does not cause a significant increase in the flood risk at the public flood control point 2 when the mrfcho model is used for operation the flood risk at the jiangjiaji point is the highest which is caused by the low flood control standard of this flood control point the flood risk at the lutaizi point is the second highest and the other points have a low flood risk 3 the flood risk under the double uncertainties of flood forecasting and model structure reduction is within 2 the flood risk considering the double uncertainties is 65 greater than the flood risk considering only the model structure reduction considering the double uncertainties may also cause the risk reduction indicating that the two uncertainties may offset each other 4 the results of bayesian network diagnosis show that given the peak discharge of the lutaizi point the probability distribution of the related nodes obtained by the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model are similar the runoff from the runheji point and the lateral inflow in upstream of lutaizi point are the main reasons for the risk of the lutaizi point in this paper the flood risk and its spatial distribution characteristics caused by the model structure reduction of the mrfcho model are analyzed in the real time flood control operation the risk changes dynamically in the time course the evolution law of risk in time and space of the mrfcho model needs further study credit authorship contribution

2987,in the real time flood control operation of a multi reservoir system the multi reservoir real time flood control hybrid operation mrfcho model with reduced structure is an effective way to improve the efficiency but the reduction of the model structure may cause greater flood risk this paper focuses on this scientific problem and evaluates the reliability of the mrfcho model in real time flood control operation through risk analysis firstly the flood risk is defined then the bayesian network risk analysis model is established through four parts bayesian network structure construction training samples generation parameter learning and inference this paper takes the flood control system in upstream of the lutaizi point in the huaihe river basin as a case study the flood risk of the mrfcho model caused by the model structure reduction is quantitatively described the spatial distribution and propagation characteristics of flood risk are evaluated and the flood risk caused by the double uncertainties of the model structure and flood forecasting is analyzed besides the factors affecting the risk of the public flood control point are diagnosed the results show that 1 the model structure reduction does not significantly increase the flood risk at the public flood control point and there is no obvious propagation law of flood risk in space 2 compared with only considering the model structure reduction considering the double uncertainties of flood forecasting and model structure reduction has a 65 probability of increasing the risk 3 runoff from the runheji point in the upper reaches of main stream and the lateral inflow of lutaizi point are the main reasons for the risk of lutaizi point keywords multi reservoir system flood control operation model structure reduction hydrological uncertainty risk analysis bayesian network 1 introduction as one of the most common natural disasters floods are extremely destructive and pose a great threat to society as the model of an organic combination of flood control engineering measures and non engineering measures real time flood control operation of multi reservoir systems plays an important role in mitigating flood disasters the multi reservoir real time flood control operation is obtaining operation schemes based on the flood forecasting and reservoir information and then making flood control decisions the forecast optimal operation flood routing chain is affected by many uncertainty factors such as the flood forecasting error reservoir capacity curve error reservoir discharge curve error flood routing error etc the comprehensive influence of these uncertainties leads to risk in flood control decision making it is of great significance to analyze the risk of reservoir flood control operation because it is related to the safety of life and property in the past few decades many studies have contributed to the development of risk analysis of flood control systems the widely used theoretical methods mainly include the return period method tung and mays 1981 asce et al 2013 the analytical method jiang 1998 the reliability analysis method melching 1992 the stochastic simulation method li et al 2010 bayesian network method pan et al 2019 lu et al 2020 etc with the gradual expansion of the flood control system the flood control operation has gradually developed from single reservoir optimal operation to river reservoir joint optimal operation and multi reservoir system joint optimal operation accordingly the research on flood control operation risk analysis has also experienced the development process from the single reservoir operation risk analysis to river reservoir operation risk analysis and then to the multi reservoir operation risk analysis the risk of a single reservoir operation usually refers to the probability of reservoir overtopping kwon and moon 2006 analyzed the probability of dam overtopping based on the nonparametric probability density estimation method the latin hypercube sampling method and the bootstrap resampling methods yan et al 2014 studied the risk of the flood control operation of geheyan reservoir under several kinds of forecasting accuracy which provided a scientific basis for the forecast and operation of the reservoir hsu et al 2011 studied the risk of reservoir overtopping affected by flood and wind huang et al 2018 took various uncertainty factors such as flood forecasting and flood hygrograph into consideration and introduced the entropy method to analyze the risk of single reservoir flood control operation the risk analysis of the joint operation of the reservoir and downstream river usually considers the risk of reservoir overtopping and the flood risk at the downstream control point diao and wang 2010 considered a variety of uncertainty factors and analyzed the risk of river reservoir flood control systems based on the stochastic simulation method chen et al 2015 proposed the calculation formulas of the risk at each moment of the river reservoir flood control system and the comprehensive risk of the flooding process based on the combination theory of stochastic processes at present as the scale of the multi reservoir system is becoming larger and larger the complexity of the system is getting higher and higher various uncertainty factors influence each other resulting in the difficulty of joint probability solutions the research on risk analysis of the joint operation of multi reservoir systems is deepening gradually chen et al 2017 chen et al 2019 put forward risk analysis methods of a multi reservoir system based on the decomposition integration method and dynamic bayesian network theory respectively which provided effective methods for risk analysis of complex multi reservoir systems zhang et al 2019 divided the operation horizon into two stages the forecast lead time period and the beyond forecast time period and simulated the uncertainties of the two stages respectively the application in cascade reservoirs shows that the power generation in the flood season can be increased without increasing the flood risk xu et al 2021 established an integrated model of real time flood control risk identification analysis and diagnosis for multi reservoir systems based on the copula function and found that the risk analysis considering the temporal and spatial correlation is more conducive to the overall safety of the flood control system in real time flood control operation of a multi reservoir system the dynamic change of rainfall flood and reservoir storage leads to the dynamic change of flood control capacity of the reservoir at a certain moment the reservoirs have different flood control effects the reservoir with significant flood control effect is defined as an effective reservoir otherwise it is defined as a noneffective reservoir li et al 2019 proposed a multi reservoir real time flood control hybrid operation mrfcho model in which the effective reservoirs are operated jointly and the noneffective reservoirs are operated separately compared to the multi reservoir real time flood control joint operation mrfcjo model of all reservoirs the mrfcho model can improve flood control efficiency because the model structure is reduced however the mrfcjo model usually brings the greatest flood control benefits and the reduction of the model structure may lead to a decrease in flood control benefits and an increase in flood risk therefore the quantitative risk assessment of the mrfcho model is a key measure to evaluate the reliability of the model the existing studies are all aimed at risk analysis of a single reservoir or a flood control system with fixed topology how to establish the risk assessment model of the mrfcho model quantitatively analyze the risk caused by model structure reduction and its evolution rules and clarify the causes of risks is of great significance for guiding real time flood control operation and risk decision making the bayesian network has a powerful ability to solve the joint probability distribution and it is an effective tool for expressing uncertainty knowledge and probabilistic reasoning weber et al 2012 marcot and penman 2019 with the changes in real time rain and flood conditions the dynamic combination of effective reservoirs and noneffective reservoirs of the mrfcho model further exacerbates the difficulty of solving the joint probability distribution therefore the bayesian network is introduced to describe the flood risk under the double uncertainties of structure reduction and flood forecasting in this paper first the definitions of the risks under the double uncertainties are proposed then the bayesian network based risk analysis model is established in four steps namely bayesian network topological structure construction training samples generation parameter learning and inference finally in the case study the risk caused by the structural reduction of the mrfcho model as well as the spatial evolution characteristics of the risk is analyzed the risk caused by the double uncertainties of structure reduction and flood prediction is described quantificationally and the cause of flood risk at the public flood control point is diagnosed the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 defines the flood risk and establishes the bayesian network based risk analysis model section 3 presents a case study as well as results and discussions finally section 4 concludes this paper 2 methodology the risk analysis of the mrfcho model with a reduced model structure is carried out in this paper first the flood risk of the mrfcho model is defined after that the bayesian network based risk analysis model is constructed through four processes network structure construction training samples generation parameter learning and inference the framework of this paper is shown in fig 1 2 1 definition of flood risk establishing the mrfcjo model and implementing a joint operation of all reservoirs is the traditional way for real time flood control operation the mrfcho model in which the effective reservoirs are operated jointly and the noneffective reservoirs are operated separately was proposed to increase efficiency li et al 2019 the objective function of the mrfcjo model is shown in formula a 1 and the objective functions of the mrfcho model are shown in formulas a 2 and a 3 besides the constraints are shown in formula a 4 to formula a 8 in general the risk is the product of the probability of an event occurring and its consequences in the field of hydrology it is often difficult to measure the consequences of events such as economic losses casualties etc therefore the risk is usually simplified and defined as the probability of occurrence of a risk event tung and mays 1981 sun et al 2018 according to this definition the flood risk at the public control point is defined as the probability that the actual peak discharge exceeds the safety discharge at the flood control point 1 risk p q c m q s qs f q c m d q c m where qs is the safety discharge at the public control point q c m is the peak discharge of the flood hydrograph at the public control point p q c m q s is the probability that the peak discharge at a public control point exceeds the safety discharge f q c m is the probability density function pdf of q c m determined by bayesian network parameter learning 1 risk caused by the model structure reduction the risk of the mrfcho model caused by the model structure reduction is the change in the flood risk at the public control point compared with the mrfcjo model which is expressed by the following formula 2 δ r i s k 1 r i s k 1 r i s k 0 where ris k 1 is the flood risk at the public control point generated by the mrfcho model which is calculated by formula 1 ris k 0 is the flood risk at the public control point generated by the mrfcjo model which is calculated by formula 1 δ r i s k 1 is the risk of the mrfcho model caused by the model structure reduction the schematic of flood risk is shown in fig 2 2 risk caused by the model structure reduction and flood forecast in the real time operation of reservoirs flood forecast error is the main uncertainty factor affecting the operation result yan et al 2014 considering the peak discharge forecast error of the reservoir inflow and lateral inflow this paper carries out the flood risk analysis under the double uncertainties of the model structure reduction and flood forecast of the mrfcho model the peak discharge forecast error is denoted as ε then 3 q m q m 1 ε where q m is the actual peak discharge q m is the forecasted peak discharge if the flood risk of the mrfcho model considering the flood forecast error is ris k 2 then the flood risk with double uncertainties is defined as 4 δ r i s k 2 r i s k 2 r i s k 0 2 2 construction of the bayesian network structure bayesian network is composed of two elements model structure and parameters the model structure is represented by a directed acyclic graph dag where random variables represent nodes and directed edges between nodes represent the causal relationship between the random variables weber et al 2012 baksh et al 2018 the flood risk at the public control point refers to the joint probability distribution of peak discharge exceeding the safety discharge under the influence of upstream reservoir release and lateral inflow according to the bayesian theory it can be expressed as 5 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i π i where x i represents the random variable π i is the father node of x i n is the total number of random variables p x i π i is the conditional probability density function of x i p x 1 x 2 x n is the joint probability distribution of n random variables if there are m reservoirs and n control points in the flood control system the inflow of the ith reservoir is q r i the outflow of the ith reservoir is q r i the lateral inflow in the upstream of the jth control point is q l j and the flow at the jth control point q c j the generalized configuration of a multi reservoir system is shown in fig 3 the mrfcjo model and the mrfcho model have the same reservoir inflows and lateral inflows but different reservoir outflows and flows of the control point the ith reservoir outflow of the mrfcjo model is denoted as q r i 0 and the flow of the jth control point is denoted as q c j 0 the ith reservoir outflow of the mrfcho model is denoted as q r i 1 and the flow at the jth control point is denoted as q c j 1 the first step of establishing a bayesian network based risk analysis model is structure learning which refers to the determination of the optimal network topology based on expert knowledge or training data sets madsen et al 2017 in the problem of flood risk analysis for multi reservoir systems decision makers mainly focus on whether the peak discharge of the control point exceeds the safety discharge therefore this paper selects the following four kinds of random variables as the nodes of the bayesian network 1 the peak discharge of the ith reservoir inflow q r mi 2 the peak discharge of the ith reservoir outflow of the mrfcjo model q r mi 0 and the mrfcho model q r mi 1 3 the peak discharge of lateral inflow in the upstream of the jth control point q l mj 4 the peak discharge of the flow at the jth control point of the mrfcjo model q c mj 0 and the mrfcho model q c mj 1 since experts have a clear cognition of the causal relationship between these random variables the network topology can be constructed directly based on expert knowledge shown as the following steps 1 the four kinds of random variables are generalized as the network nodes the variables of the mrfcjo model are q r mi q r mi 0 q l mj q c mj 0 and the variables of the mrfcho model are q r mi q r mi 1 q l mj q c mj 1 2 according to the flood control system structure shown in fig 3 all m reservoirs and n flood control points are ranked according to the principle of first upstream then downstream first tributary then main stream 3 the causal relationship of each random variable is analyzed and the bayesian network nodes are ranked according to the order of the reservoirs and flood control points as well as the principle of first cause then result for random variables 4 the directed edge is determined according to the causality of random variables that is the direction from the cause node to the result node the structure of the bayesian network of the mrfcjo model and the mrfcho model is shown in fig 4 2 3 generation of the bayesian network training samples parameters of a bayesian network are the prior probability density function of the root node and the conditional probability distribution of the non root node parameter learning refers to determining the parameters of the bayesian network with a determined network structure based on expert experience or training samples zhou et al 2016 2 3 1 generation of the spatial magnitude double random flood samples in the real time operation of multi reservoirs floods are stochastic in both space and magnitude spatial randomness means that the inflow of a reservoir may occur in another reservoir or area at other times a lateral inflow may also occur in a reservoir or other areas that is the flood morphology of a certain location i e a reservoir inflow or a lateral inflow may be the same as that of others anywhere to make the bayesian network more adaptable in real time flood risk reasoning this paper proposes a space magnitude double random training sample generation method for the flood control system including m reservoirs and n flood control points as shown in fig 3 the training samples are generated according to the following steps 1 selecting the k annual maximum peak discharges of p gauging stations it is assumed that the annual maximum peak discharge conforms to the p iii distribution function the linear moment method is used to estimate the parameters and the probability density distribution function of annual maximum flood peak discharge of each station is obtained denoted as f 1 f 2 f p where the probability density distribution function of the uth gauging station is f u 2 dividing the sub basin of each gauging station it is assumed that the peak discharge of reservoir inflow and lateral inflow in the uth sub basin has the same distribution as the uth gauging station 3 for the flood control system as shown in fig 3 l historical typical floods are selected taking into account factors such as flood magnitude and flood morphology each typical flood includes inflows of m reservoirs and lateral inflows of n flood control point there are a total of o l m n historical floods the o flood is taken as the historical flood sample set and the historical flood peak discharges are denoted as q m h h 1 2 o 4 if the ith reservoir is in the uth sub basin according to the distribution f u the latin hypercube sampling lhs method is used to generate a random sample set of peak discharges with a sample size of z denoted as q r mi v i 1 2 m v 1 2 z 5 if the vth peak discharge of the ith reservoir q r mi v has the smallest difference with the flood peak discharge q m h in the o sample set then the homogeneous multiple enlargement method ge et al 2013 is applied to enlarge the hth flood according to the ratio q r mi v q m h the vth inflow of the ith reservoir can be then obtained denoted as q r i v 6 for m reservoirs generating z reservoir inflow samples following step 4 to step 5 denoted as q r i v i 1 2 m v 1 2 z 7 if the jth flood control point is in the uth sub basin the lhs method is used to generate z peak discharge of the lateral inflow which follows the distribution f u denoted as q l mj v j 1 2 n v 1 2 z 8 if the vth peak discharge of the jth flood control point q l mj v has the smallest difference with the flood peak discharge q m h in the o sample set then the homogeneous multiple enlargement method is applied to enlarge the hth flood according to the ratio q l mj v q m h the vth inflow of the jth flood control point can be then obtained denoted as q l j v 9 for n flood control points generating z lateral inflow samples following step 7 to step 8 denoted as q l j v j 1 2 n v 1 2 z 10 the random flood sample set which includes z samples of reservoir inflows and lateral inflows can be obtained denoted as s q v q r i v q l j v i 1 2 m j 1 2 n v 1 2 z 2 3 2 extraction of bayesian network training samples the random flood sample set s q v q r i v q l j v includes reservoir inflows and interval inflows in order to generate bayesian network training samples z floods in s q v should be taken as the input of the mrfcjo model and the mrfccho model to obtain the reservoir outflows and flows at the flood control point respectively the effective reservoirs for each flood are identified according to the rfc method before implementing operation for the mrfcho model li et al 2020 the floods and operation schemes of the mrfcjo model are denoted as s 0 q r i v q r i v 0 q l j v q c j v 0 where i 1 2 m j 1 2 n v 1 2 z q r i v is the vth inflow of ith reservoir q r i v 0 is the vth outflow of the ith reservoir obtained by the mrfcjo model q l j v is the vth lateral inflow of the upstream of jth flood control point q c j v 0 is the vth flow at the jth flood control point obtained by the mrfcjo model the floods and operation schemes of the mrfcho model are denoted as s 1 q r i v q r i v 1 q l j v q c j v 1 where q r i v 1 is the vth outflow of the ith reservoir obtained by the mrfcho model q c j v 1 is the vth flow at the jth flood control point obtained by the mrfcho model the peak discharge from s 0 and s 1 are extracted to obtain the bayesian network training sample set of the mrfcjo and mrfcho model denoted as s m 0 q r mi v q r mi v 0 q l mj v q c mj v 0 and s m 1 q r mi v q r mi v 1 q l mj v q c mj v 1 respectively where i 1 2 m j 1 2 n v 1 2 z q r mi v is the vth inflow peak discharge of ith reservoir q r mi v 0 is the vth outflow peak discharge of ith reservoir obtained by the mrfcjo model q r mi v 1 is the vth outflow peak discharge of ith reservoir obtained by the mrfcho model q l mj v is the vth lateral inflow peak discharge of the upstream of jth flood control point q c mj v 0 is the vth flow peak discharge at the jth flood control point obtained by the mrfcjo model q c mj v 1 is the vth flow peak discharge at the jth flood control point obtained by the mrfcho model 2 4 parameter learning of the bayesian network parameter learning of the bayesian network is determining the prior probability density functions of root nodes and the conditional probability density functions of non root nodes the four random variables selected in this paper are all continuous variables so these variables are needed to be discretized because the bayesian network can only deal with discrete variables this paper adopts the equal width method to discretize continuous variables lu et al 2020 the equal width method is an unsupervised discretization method which divides the range of random variables into b intervals on average and each interval has the same width and is equal to x max x min b where x max is the maximum value of the variable and x min is the minimum value of the variable the more the interval is divided the more accurate the reasoning result will be but at the same time the amount of calculation will increase exponentially the sample set s m 0 of the mrfcjo model and s m 1 of the mrfcho model contain the values of each node of four random variables which form complete training sets for bayesian network parameter learning in this paper the maximum likelihood estimation mle method richards 1961 is used for parameter learning if there are o observing samples denoted as x x 1 x 2 x o the likelihood function is 6 l θ x p x θ x x p x x θ the estimated parameter value is 7 θ arg max θ l θ x arg max θ x x ln p x θ through bayesian network learning the trained bayesian network of the mrfcjo model and the mrfcho model can be obtained 2 5 inference of the bayesian network inference means that based on the trained bayesian network given the observed values of some nodes calculate the posterior probability of other unknown nodes according to the joint probability distribution in this paper the junction tree algorithm is used for bayesian network inference the node with an observation value is the evidence node denoted as evi the node with the probability distribution to be solved is called the query node denoted as que according to the bayesian theory when the value of evidence node is e the posterior probability of query node is 8 p que e v i e p evi e q u e p que p evi e the advantage of bayesian network for probabilistic reasoning is that it is not restricted by the direction and can be used to calculate the probability distribution of other nodes by giving any node value according to the direction of reasoning it can be divided into prediction and diagnosis 1 prediction prediction is a top down inference and it is from cause to result the probability of different consequences can be analyzed according to the known evidence in the risk analysis of flood control operation the peak discharge of reservoir inflow and lateral inflow are known and form a predictive sample set denoted as s f m q r mi v q l mj v i 1 2 m j 1 2 n v 1 2 z where z is the total number of predictive samples prediction refers to inferring the probability of flood risk in downstream flood control points based on the predictive sample set s f m 2 diagnosis diagnose is a bottom up inference and it is from result to cause the possible reasons and probabilities of such results can be inferred and analyzed based on known results in the risk analysis of flood control operation given that the peak discharge at a flood control point exceeds the safety discharge the most likely range of the peak discharge of its parent node can be inferred the factors causing such risk and the probability of each factor can be diagnosed to guide risk control 3 case study the huaihe river basin is one of the most severe flood disaster areas in china because of frequent rainstorms in the flood season this paper takes the reservoir system in the upper and middle reaches of the huaihe river basin as a case study the flood control system consists of 14 reservoirs and 11 flood control points among which lutaizi is the public flood control point the flood control system and its conceptual diagram are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively 3 1 structure construction and parameter learning of the bayesian network the peak discharge of inflow and outflow of 14 reservoirs the peak discharge of lateral inflow in upstream of 11 flood control points and the peak discharge of flow at the 11 flood control points are generalized into network nodes then ranking the network nodes drawing the directed edges according to causality and the bayesian network structure of the flood control system is obtained as shown in fig 7 in the huaihe river basin since the 14 reservoirs were put into operation the basin wide flood which has large scale influence is infrequent considering the location of rainstorm center flood magnitude and flood morphology 13 historical typical floods which include inflows of 14 reservoirs and lateral inflows of 11 flood control points are selected i e l 13 o 13 14 11 325 the division of sub basins is shown in fig 6 according to the training sample generation method described in section 2 3 1000 random floods are generated as input to the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model the random floods and operation results are used to extract training samples for bayesian network parameter learning the peak discharge of the ith reservoir inflow is q r mi v and the peak discharge of lateral inflow in upstream of the jth control point is q l mj v for the mrfcho model the peak discharge of the ith reservoir outflow is q r mi v 1 and the peak discharge of the flow at the jth control point is q c mj v 1 for the mrfcjo model the peak discharge of the ith reservoir outflow is q r mi v 0 and the peak discharge of the flow at the jth control point is q c mj v 0 the above random variables are discretized according to the equal width method in this paper the interval widths are all set as 200 m3 s that is x max x min b 2 00 m3 s the discrete sample set corresponding to the mrfcho model is denoted as s m 1 q r mi v q r mi v 1 q l mj v q c mj v 1 i 1 2 14 j 1 2 11 v 1 2 1000 the discrete sample set corresponding to the mrfcjo model is denoted as s m 0 q r mi v q r mi v 0 q l mj v q c mj v 0 i 1 2 14 j 1 2 11 v 1 2 1000 in this paper the sample set s m 1 and s m 0 are used for parameter learning of the bayesian network the prior probability density functions of the peak discharge of the reservoir inflow and lateral inflow can be then determined as well as the conditional probability density functions of the peak discharge of the reservoir outflow and flow at the flood control point the flood risk analysis of the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model in real time operation can be then carried out based on the trained bayesian network 3 2 prediction generate 100 floods and the peak discharge of reservoir inflows and lateral inflows constitute the bayesian network prediction sample set denoted as s f m q r m 1 v q r m 14 v q l m 1 v q l m 11 v v 1 2 100 the risk prediction of 100 flood samples in the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model are carried out respectively the flood risk at public flood control points caused by the structural reduction of the mrfcho model is quantified and the spatial distribution and evolution of the flood risk are analyzed in addition the risk under the double uncertainties of model structure reduction and flood forecasting is described quantitatively 3 2 1 flood risk caused by the model structure reduction the samples in the sample set s f m are input as evidence into the bayesian network of the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model and prediction is performed to obtain the probability distribution of the flood peak flow at the lutaizi point the actual safety discharge of lutai point is 10000 m3 s the flood risk of lutaizi point under the mrfcho and mrfcjo model operation can be calculated by formula 1 and the flood risk caused by the model structure reduction can be calculated by formula 2 the flood risk caused by the structure reduction of the mrfcho model is shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that 57 of the samples have a flood risk probability within 0 2 and 91 of the samples have a flood risk probability within 0 6 the probability of flood risk caused by the model structure reduction is less than 1 5 which shows that the reduction of the model structure does not result in a significant increase in flood risk at the public flood point take sample no 62 the highest risk sample for a detailed analysis when the safety discharge of the luthaizi point takes different values the flood risks of the luthaizi point corresponding to the two operation models can be calculated according to formula 1 as shown in fig 9 as can be seen from fig 9 the flood risk rate of the lutaizi point obtained by the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model decreases with the increase of the safety discharge of the lutaizi point when the safety discharge is less than 5000 m3 s the flood risk probability of both models is close to 100 when the safety discharge is larger than 12000 m3 s the risks of the two models are close to zero the higher the flood control standard of the flood control point the larger the safety discharge and the lower the risk under the same flood event in addition the flood risk rate corresponding to the mrfcho model is slightly higher than that of the mrfcjo model but the difference between the two models corresponding to different safety discharges is different when the safety discharge takes the actual value 10000 m3 s the risk of the mrfcho model is 3 87 and the risk of the mrfcjo model is 2 46 with a difference of 1 41 when the safety discharge is 7000 m3 s the difference between the two models is the largest which is 6 68 therefore the flood risk caused by model structure reduction uncertainty δ r i s k 1 changes with the change of safety discharge of the flood control point the flood risk of the mrfcho model of the no 62 flood sample is the largest indicating that the flood sample is of a large magnitude in this case when the safety discharge is 12000 m3 s the risk is close to zero therefore if the lutaizi point is to avoid any risk in a large flood the flood control standard can be improved and the corresponding safety discharge is 12000 m3 s 3 2 2 the spatial characteristics of the risk of the mrfcho model the flood risk of each flood control point is calculated to analyze the spatial evolution characteristics of flood risk of the mrfcho model the flood risk of 11 flood control points is deduced by the bayesian network model according to the actual safety discharges of these flood control points the flood risk of each sample at bantai xixian wangjiaba luohe and hengpaitou points is zero huangchuan runheji zhoukou and fuyang points have low flood risks jiangjiaji and lutaizi points have relatively high flood risks the statistical results of the number of samples in different risk intervals are shown in table 1 spatial characteristics of flood risk in the flood control system are shown in fig 10 1 spatial distribution characteristics of flood risk it can be seen from table 1 that the flood risk probability of huangchuan runheji zhoukou and fuyang points is mostly concentrated within 0 05 and the maximum risk probability of fuyang point does not exceed 0 2 among them huangchuan zhoukou and fuyang are flood control points on the tributaries of the huaihe river and their safety discharges are 1500 m3 s 3000 m3 s and 3300 m3 s respectively the magnitude of flood in their sub basins is generally small and the flood risk is low under the safety discharge the runheji point is the main flood control point on the main stream of the huaihe river with a safety discharge of 8000 m3 s and the flood risk is also low as can be seen from table 1 that jiangjiaji has the highest flood risk and the number of samples with a flood risk of less than 1 accounts for nearly 60 followed by those with a risk between 1 and 3 and the number of samples with the risk over 5 accounts for 7 the flood risk at the lutaizi point is second only to that of the jiangjiaji point the number of samples with a flood risk of less than 1 accounts for about 50 followed by the risk between 1 and 2 there are 11 flood samples with a risk greater than 2 and less than 4 according to the above results except for jiangjiaji and lutaizi points the flood risk of other points is almost negligible the jiangjiaji point with a safety discharge of 3580 m3 s is located in the southeast mountainous area of the huaihe river basin which is the area with the largest flood magnitude in the huaihe river basin the safety discharge of hengpaitou point in the southeast mountainous area is 8400 m3 s there are two reservoirs in upstream namely foziling and xianghongdian and the flood risk for all samples is 0 by comparison the flood control storage of nianyushan and meishan reservoir is a little different from that of the foziling and xianghongdian reservoir and both have a large flood regulation capacity the jiangjiaji point has a small safety discharge and low flood control standard which is the main factor causing the high flood risk improving the flood control standard of jiangjiaji point is an effective way to reduce its flood risk 2 spatial evolution of flood risk fig 10 illustrates that if the mrfcho model is used for operation only huangchuan point has a flood risk within 0 05 in upstream of wangjiaba point and flood risk will not occur in the 100 samples at the bantai xixian and wangjiaba points the flood risk from jiangjiaji to runheji is significantly reduced although the flow at runheji point contains its own lateral inflow and the flow above wangjiaba and jiangjiaji as the main point in the main stream of huaihe river runheji has a large safety discharge so the flood risk is low the flood risk from luohe to zhoukou and then to fuyang point increases slightly the flood risk from runheji fuyang and hengpaitou point to lutaizi point is obviously increased which may be due to the large lateral inflow in the upper reaches of lutaizi point coupled with the flow from runheji as well as the flow from hengpaitou and fuyang in the tributaries leading to the flood risk of lutaizi point 3 2 3 flood risk caused by the double uncertainties in the real time flood control operation of multi reservoirs the flood forecasting uncertainty is the main uncertainty factor affecting the operation results the impact of double uncertainties of flood forecasting and model structure reduction on flood risk of the mrfcho model is evaluated in this section it is assumed that the flood forecasting error ε is 10 according to the formula 3 the sample set considering the flood forecasting error is s f m q r m 1 v q r m 14 v q l m 1 v q l m 11 v v 1 2 100 the sample set s f m is input as evidence into the bayesian network of the mrfcho model and the probability distribution of flood peak discharge at each flood control point is obtained by prediction the safety discharge of lutaizi point is 10000 m3 s and the flood risk of lutaizi point is calculated by formula 1 according to formula 4 the flood risk caused by the double uncertainties can be then obtained and the statistical result is shown in fig 11 fig 11 shows that the number of samples with a flood risk of less than 0 2 caused by double uncertainties is the largest followed by between 0 2 0 4 and 0 4 0 6 the number of samples with a risk of less than 0 6 accounts for 82 however the flood risk caused by double uncertainties does not exceed 2 at most compared with the flood risk caused by the model structure reduction in fig 8 the flood risk caused by double uncertainties is larger on the whole the difference between the flood risk under double uncertainties and only the model structure reduction uncertainty is calculated that is the flood risk under double uncertainties minus the flood risk that only considers the model structure reduction and the result is shown in fig 12 it can be seen from fig 12 that the difference between flood risk caused by double uncertainties and model structure reduction is between 0 and 0 2 at most followed by 0 2 to 0 the number of samples with risk larger than 0 2 is obvious more than risk less than 0 2 the number of samples with risk larger than 0 accounts for 65 which indicates that the flood risk caused by double uncertainties of flood forecasting error and model structure reduction is generally greater than the flood risk caused by model structure reduction in 35 of the samples the flood risk caused by double uncertainties is lower indicating that the flood forecasting error may offset each other with the model structure reduction 3 3 diagnosis in addition to risk prediction the bayesian network can also be used for risk reverse diagnosis assuming the probability of flood risk at the lutaizi point and inferring the possible reasons for such a result so as to provide guidance for risk control assuming that in a certain flood the peak discharge of lutaizi point exceeds 10 of the safety discharge that is the value of node 50 is 11000 m3 s the bayesian network corresponding to the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model is used for diagnosis respectively the probability distribution of peak discharge of its parent node node 30 42 48 49 is obtained the probability distributions of flood peak discharge at runheji point node 30 fuyang point node 42 hengpetou point node 48 and peak discharge of lateral inflow in the upper reaches of lutaizi node 49 are shown in tables 2 5 tables 2 5 illustrates that when the peak discharge of lutaizi point exceeds the safety discharge and takes the value of 11000 m3 s the probability distributions obtained by the diagnosis of the bayesian network corresponding to the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model are similar if the mrfcho model is used for operation there is a 59 chance that the peak discharge at runheji point is between 4400 m3 s and 4600 m3 s and there is a 28 chance that it is between 6800 m3 s and 7000 m3 s the probability of peak discharge at the fuyang point is 87 between 2800 m3 s and 3000 m3 s the peak discharge at the henpaitou point has a 60 probability between 4400 m3 s and 4600 m3 s and a 30 probability between 2800 m3 s and 3000 m3 s there is a 66 chance of lateral inflow peak discharge of the lutaizi point is between 5200 m3 s and 5400 m3 s and a 34 chance of 4000 m3 s and 4400 m3 s the above results show that when the peak flow of the lutaizi point is 11000 m3 s the risk is mainly caused by the flow from the runheji point in the upper reaches of the main stream and the lateral inflow from the upper reaches of the lutaizi point followed by the flow from the hengpaitou point and the impact of flow at the fuyang point is the least in the follow up real time flood control operation if floods of a larger magnitude occur decision makers can focus on the effective reservoirs above runheji point and hengpaitou point under the premise of ensuring reservoir safety regulating the release of reservoirs in upstream of the runheji point and the hengpaitou point is a way to reduce the peak discharge of the lutaizi point and avoid flood risk 4 conclusions in the real time flood control operation of a multi reservoir system the mrfcho model is an effective way to improve the efficiency of flood control operation because the model structure is reduced in order to quantitatively evaluate the flood risk of the mrfcho model caused by the reduction of model structure this paper adopts the bayesian network which is extremely advantageous in the probabilistic reasoning of complex systems to conduct a risk analysis first the flood risk is defined then the bayesian network risk analysis model is established through four steps namely network structure construction training samples generation parameter learning and inference the flood control system in upstream of the lutaizi point in the huaihe river basin is taken as a case study in terms of prediction the flood risk of the mrfcho model caused by the model structure reduction is quantified the spatial distribution and evolution characteristics are analyzed and the risk under the double uncertainties of flood forecasting and model structure reduction is described in terms of diagnosis it is assumed that a flood risk occurs at a public flood control point and the cause of the risk is diagnosed the results show that 1 the flood risk of the mrfcho model is slightly greater than that of the mrfcjo model and the risk caused by the model structure reduction does not exceed 1 5 therefore the model structure reduction does not cause a significant increase in the flood risk at the public flood control point 2 when the mrfcho model is used for operation the flood risk at the jiangjiaji point is the highest which is caused by the low flood control standard of this flood control point the flood risk at the lutaizi point is the second highest and the other points have a low flood risk 3 the flood risk under the double uncertainties of flood forecasting and model structure reduction is within 2 the flood risk considering the double uncertainties is 65 greater than the flood risk considering only the model structure reduction considering the double uncertainties may also cause the risk reduction indicating that the two uncertainties may offset each other 4 the results of bayesian network diagnosis show that given the peak discharge of the lutaizi point the probability distribution of the related nodes obtained by the mrfcho model and the mrfcjo model are similar the runoff from the runheji point and the lateral inflow in upstream of lutaizi point are the main reasons for the risk of the lutaizi point in this paper the flood risk and its spatial distribution characteristics caused by the model structure reduction of the mrfcho model are analyzed in the real time flood control operation the risk changes dynamically in the time course the evolution law of risk in time and space of the mrfcho model needs further study credit authorship contribution

2988,the tienshan mountains is the main water source and ecological barrier in the central portion of the silk road economic belt a new economic development zone with the asia pacific economic circle to the east and the european economic circle to the west production living ecological activities in the arid central asia region are heavily dependent on water resources mainly recharged from melt and alpine precipitation hence reliable projections of changes in extreme precipitation under global warming are particularly important for the utilization and management of water resources based on the downscaled and bias corrected state of art global climate models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 we investigate changes in extreme precipitation over the tienshan mountains central asia tmca under different levels of global warming 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c we specifically assess the robustness of changes and the benefits of limiting warming to 2 0 c as opposed to 3 0 c compared with the reference period 1976 2005 a robust change in extreme precipitation across the tmca is expected for all warming levels and the fraction of land faced a robust change also increases with warming levels furthermore there would be a substantial rise in extreme impacts in the tmca when shifting from increases of 2 0 c to 3 0 c in a scenario involving a 1 0 c rise i e from 2 0 c to 3 0 c nearly 85 70 and 60 19 of the land in the tmca will be affected by a robust increase in annual total wet day precipitation prcptot and number of light rain days r5mm respectively in the same scenario areas affected by robust changes in duration indices consecutive dry days cdd and consecutive wet days cwd will likely be less than 11 59 limiting warming to 2 0 c instead of 3 0 c can avoid a marked increased impacts of about 62 84 153 77 of the change in frequency intensity and duration of extreme precipitation keywords extreme precipitation global warming avoided impact tienshan mountains data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction natural and socio economic systems are extremely sensitive and fragile to changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events as these events often cause floods landslides mudslides and other natural disasters donat et al 2016 fischer and knutti 2015 king et al 2017 seneviratne et al 2021 since the 1950s increases in the intensity frequency and amount of heavy precipitation events on global scale over a majority of land regions have been observed and projected that increases take place in most land regions at 1 5 c global warming high confidence 2 c global warming likely and 4 c global warming very likely seneviratne et al 2021 the increase in extreme precipitation is closely related to changes in global temperature donat et al 2016 the current rise in temperature can explain 18 of extreme precipitation changes if the temperature rises 2 c the proportion bumps up to 40 increasing nonlinearly with global warming fischer and knutti 2015 in order to reduce the impact of climate change resulting from global warming the international community has reached an agreement to control the level of global warming to within a maximum increase of 2 c while striving to control it at a lower level of 1 5 c unfccc 2015 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc was invited to release the special report on global warming of 1 5 c in 2018 which has caused more and more scholars to pay attention to projections of hazard and risk at different warming levels at global and regional scales especially with regard to changes in climate extremes ipcc 2018 previous studies found that extreme precipitation yang et al 2018 zhang and zhou 2020 concurrent drought and heatwave zhang et al 2019 and other extreme events will increase with warming and that limiting warming will reduce the impacts associated with climate extremes zhang et al 2018 however these studies mostly used global climate models gcms such as the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zou et al 2021 or regional climate models rcms such as the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment dosio and fischer 2018 ge et al 2019 these models are forced by representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rather than by shared socioeconomic pathway ssp scenarios specifically designed for the sixth ipcc assessment report ipcc ar6 in addition most previous studies adopted a global shi et al 2021 europe dosio and fischer 2018 australia king et al 2017 or southeast asian perspective ge et al 2019 whereas our work focuses on the tienshan mountains central asia tmca as well the earlier studies neglected to address changes in extreme precipitation at different warming levels or to investigate potential impacts caused by 3 0 c or higher warming for the tmca existing research related to precipitation is limited and most of it focuses on annual precipitation hu et al 2017 precipitation concentration yang et al 2020a yang et al 2020b and stationarity yao et al 2021a furthermore in terms of extreme precipitation most existing studies reflect changes in historical periods liu et al 2021 luo et al 2020 wang et al 2013 zou et al 2021 whereas few investigate future changes in extreme precipitation and how the impacts of these changes might potentially be avoided by limiting warming levels therefore it is imperative to explore variations in extreme precipitation under different warming levels in order to better deal with relevant water resources management to mitigate hazards and losses now and into the future king et al 2017 li et al 2020 zou et al 2021 based on downscaled and bias corrected cmip6 gcms this study investigates future changes in extreme precipitation at different warming levels 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c over the tmca we are mainly concerned with the robustness of changes in extreme precipitation indices and the avoided impacts accrued by limiting warming to 2 0 c rather than to 3 0 c 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the tmca is located in the hinterland of the eurasian continent far from any ocean the inland remoteness of the place makes it difficult for water vapor to reach it making it a highly arid region of the world fig 1 chen et al 2018b zou et al 2021 the tmca is characterized by a semi arid and arid climate with strong evaporation and little precipitation average annual precipitation amounts are less than 300 mm yet the lowland areas of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan in central asia are among the world s largest irrigated zones farinotti et al 2015 at the same time the tmca region has some of the most fully developed glacier mountains in the world with a total area of almost 13 566 6 km2 chen et al 2016 glaciers snow melt water in high mountains forest precipitation in middle mountains and bedrock fissure water in low mountains feed most of the area s rivers supporting the development of agriculture and the economy in central asia chen et al 2016 farinotti et al 2015 however the tmca is not only an area highly sensitive to global climate change it is also a hot spot for water cycle change chen et al 2016 over the past half century the average annual warming rate in the tmca 0 34 c decade has been higher than the global annual warming rate 0 12 c decade li et al 2017 this intense warming is bound to accelerate the water cycle aggravate extreme hydrological events and increase the challenge of dealing with changes in water resources across the entire central asian region chen et al 2016 li et al 2017 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 climate simulation data the cmip has evolved over five phases to become one of the key elements of climate science and an effective tool for assessing climate change eyring et al 2016 currently the cmip6 has released several new global climate models based on a combination of the ssp and the rcp to project future scenarios for climate change https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 these results were used to draft the ipcc ar6 gao et al 2021 guo et al 2021 ipcc 2019 thus far the one third model released by cmip6 shows higher equilibrium climate sensitivity than the cmip5 forster et al 2020 compared with the cmip5 for example the cmip6 model shows a general improvement in simulating extreme climate and related trends chen et al 2020 moreover cmip6 has been applied to issues concerning climate change and water resources assessment not only in central asia guo et al 2021 but also in the united states yuan et al 2021 and in regions affected by indian summer monsoons gusain et al 2020 based on the better models as determined in previous studies guo et al 2021 we preliminarily selected six models in cmip6 for our research these models were chosen to include both the historical period 1850 2014 and the ssp245 and ssp585 forcing scenarios during 2015 2100 all models use only the first realization r1i1p1f1 with variables including temperature and precipitation the schema is shown in table s1 2 2 2 gridded observed data given the scarcity of observation sites and the missing data from many meteorological stations since 1990 in the study area we used data from water resources project called aphrodite the project is jointly carried out by the research institute for human and nature and the meteorological research institute of the japan meteorological agency aphrodite provided us with a set of highly resolved daily grid precipitation data for monsoon asian the middle east and russia northern eurasia which we employed as for observation data yatagai et al 2012 yatagai et al 2008 https aphrodite st hirosakiu ac jp download the gridded fields of daily precipitation are defined by interpolating rain gauge observations obtained from meteorological and hydrological stations throughout the above regions in combination with the intelligent interpolation algorithm of a digital elevation model this gives the dataset more advantages than other grid data chen et al 2018a ge et al 2019 sohn et al 2012 so it is often employed to obtain observational data for evaluating the performance of global climate models gusain et al 2020 kim et al 2019 samuels et al 2018 yatagai et al 2012 yatagai et al 2008 specifically aphrodite has been utilized for extreme climate and water resource evaluations such as in central asia fang et al 2015 the eastern mediterranean samuels et al 2018 and the asian summer monsoon regions kim et al 2019 among others in this paper we selected aphro ma 025deg v1101 1951 2007 as our observation data and 1976 2005 as our reference period 2 2 3 extreme precipitation diagnosis in this study a total of nine extreme precipitation indices table s2 proposed by the international expert group on climate change detection and indicators etccdi crd are employed to investigate changes in extreme precipitation in the tmca under different global warming levels 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c for each index we calculate extreme precipitation indices for every grid point of each model 2 3 methods 2 3 1 downscaling and bias correction the resolution of the gcms is relatively coarse and should be used with caution in certain locations dosio and fischer 2018 yang et al 2018 to remedy these shortcomings we located the nearest grid point relative to the study area in each gcms and then employed the bias correction method to correct their biases for bias correction methods on precipitation local intensity scaling loci and quantile mapping qm were beneficial to applications related to extreme precipitation events compared to other well performing methods fang et al 2015 themeβι et al 2011 2012 the loci correction idea aims to construct a scaling factor and realize the correction of precipitation by judging the relationship between precipitation at a specific time and the wet day threshold the process is as follows fang et al 2015 1 p c o r m d 0 p r a w m d p t h r e s m p r a w m d s m p r a w m d p t h r e s m 2 s m μ p o b s m d p o b s m d 0 μ p r a w m d p r a w m d p t h r e s m where p cor m d p raw m d and p obs m d are the corrected raw simulated and observed precipitation on the d th day of the m th month p thres m is the wet day threshold of the raw model for the m th month sm is the scaling factor of the m th month and μ is the average value of the variables the qm method is able to correct the empirical cumulative probability distribution function pdf of the corrected precipitation as close as possible to the observations by establishing the transfer function through sometimes artificially corrupted future model projected trends cannon et al 2015 fang et al 2015 pastén zapata et al 2020 themeßl et al 2012 themeßl et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 in this paper we first used a smoothing spline to exclude noise that would be amplified in the correction and then corrected the precipitation in the reference and future periods huang 2019 the specific process is as follows gudmundsson et al 2012 3 x bc f x m where x m is the daily precipitation of the original output of cmip6 models in point wise f is the established transfer function in the reference period and x bc is the corrected daily precipitation of cmip6 models in point wise among them the transfer function of the reference period is established as follows 4 f e c d f m 1 x m 1 f ecdfo x o where x o f ecdfo are the observation data and its corresponding empirical cumulative pdf in the reference period and x m 1 f e c d f m 1 are the model data and its corresponding empirical cumulative pdf in the reference period applying the established transfer function to the future period we get 5 x bc f ecdfo 1 f e c d f m 2 x m 2 where x m 2 f c d f m 2 are the model data and its corresponding empirical cumulative pdf in the future period f ecdfo 1 is the inverse empirical cumulative pdf and x bc is the corrected model data in the future period taking bcc csm2 mr as an example the two above mentioned bias correction methods loci qm are carried out for the downscaled daily precipitation data from 1976 to 2005 the results are presented in table s3 as shown the qm approach is better than loci for several evaluation indexes of precipitation annual daily precipitation total precipitation in wet days median and 99th quantile of daily precipitation standard deviation mean absolute error root mean square error and correlation coefficient therefore we chose qm to correct the selected cmip6 model data 2 3 2 time spans for 1 5 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 c increases in global warming in order to eliminate the influence of interannual climate change on the results we processed a 30 year running mean of near surface air temperature data global historical 1850 2014a and future ssp245 ssp585 2015 2100a periods provided by six selected models king et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 we then compared these data to those of pre industrial levels 1850 1900a determining global warming for 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c under ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios at the time when the 30 year running mean of near surfa9 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c next we selected a central time of about 15 years before and after to form a 30 year temperature rise period which was used to calculate changes in extreme precipitation under different warming scenarios vautard et al 2014 fig s1 table s4 note that if the period before and after the time of warming 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c is much less than 15 years the time series is insufficient to reach the target warming in 2015 2100 for example if we determine 2023 as the time for global warming of 1 5 c using ssp585 of bcc csm2 mr there are only 8 years between 2015 and 2023 which is much less than 15 years therefore we think using such a short period to achieve warming of 1 5 c is insufficient we discuss every warming scenario based on every suitable model presented in table s4 for example the analysis of warming 1 5 c is based on bcc csm2 mr ssp245 miroc6 ssp245 ssp585 and mpi esm1 2 hr ssp585 2 3 3 statistical analysis based on multi model ensemble mme median results the robustness of the change of index was assessed by referring to the method used by dosio et al 2018 and yang et al 2018 that is the robustness is judged from the significance and agreement of the change in a comprehensive manner the change was considered robust if i the mme median result showed a statistically significant change for example by performing a two sample kolmogorov smirnov k s test to determine if independent random samples were drawn from the same underlying continuous population in each grid points for the reference period and the 3 0 c warming period we rejected the null hypothesis at the 5 significance level ii the signal to noise ratio the ratio of absolute value of the mme median change to the standard deviation among the members was greater than or equal to 1 and iii more than 80 of members agreed on its sign in order to present the difference in extreme risk between 2 0 and 3 0 c we used avoided impact ai to answer quantitatively which impacts could be avoided at a 2 0 c global warming world compared to 3 0 c li et al 2018 6 ai c 3 0 c 2 0 c 2 0 100 where c 3 0 and c 2 0 are the changes at 3 0 and 2 0 c warming levels compared to the reference period 1976 2005 respectively 3 results 3 1 evaluation of bias correction in representing historical period extreme precipitation compared with the observation the spatial pattern of extreme precipitation can be reasonably reproduced by the mme median results figs 2 s2 and s3 the cwd r5mm number of heavy rain days r10mm maximum1 day precipitation rx1day maximum 5 day precipitation rx5day prcptot total annual precipitation from heavy rain days r95p and total annual precipitation from very heavy rain days r99p decreased from southwest to northeast there were also two more wet centers over the north of west tienshan and the southwest of middle tienshan conversely the spatial pattern of cdd decreased from northeast to southwest fig 2 a c e figs s2a c e and figs s3a c e the spatial pattern of the above indices and the location of two more wet centers are well captured by the mme median results fig 2b d f figs s2 b d f and fig s3 b d f although overestimates and underestimates occur in cdd rx1day and rx5day in cwd prcptot r5mm r10mm r95p and r99p in the mme median results the overall relative error value is between 4 96 and 2 93 except for r99p fig s4 generally the mme median results not only relatively accurately reproduce the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation over the tmca but also reasonably imitate their magnitude therefore we employed the bias correction method to constrain future projections and then analyzed changes in precipitation extremes under different warming levels 3 2 changes in extreme precipitation under different warming levels compared with the reference period a robust change in the extreme precipitation across the tmca is expected for all warming levels there is an obvious increase in the fraction of areas with robust changes in extreme precipitation indices under 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c warming compared to a 1 5 c world fig 3 figs s5 s6 and table s5 compared to 1976 2005 cdd is projected to increase in western tmca with a maximum increase of about 10 days under 1 5 c 9 days under 2 0 c 12 days under 3 0 c and 16 days under 4 0 c scenarios it is projected to decrease in eastern part with the maximum decrease exceeding 18 days under 4 0 c fig 3a d spatial changes in cwd are opposite to those in cdd figs s5a d however the intensity rx1day and rx5day fig 3i l and figs s5i l prcptot figs s6a d r95p and r99p figs s6e l and frequency r5mm and r10mm fig 3e h and figs s5e h of extreme precipitation are projected to increase across the entire tmca region under all warming scenarios for example the mean of rx1day is projected to be about 0 93 mm for 1 5 c 1 23 mm for 2 0 c 2 03 mm for 3 0 c and 2 71 mm for 4 0 c warming the fraction of land facing a robust increase in rx1day is also projected to expand by 13 62 13 82 42 80 and 59 81 respectively fig 3i l table s5 in a 3 0 c warming scenario nearly 85 70 of land in the tmca will be affected by a robust increase of prcptot table s5 moreover compared with a 2 0 c increase an additional warming of 1 0 c leads to a marked increase of at least 25 93 mm in maximum prcptot over the entire tmca figs s6a d 3 3 changes in extreme precipitation in different subregions different subregions are expected to experience increased extreme precipitation under all warming levels as warming levels rise extreme precipitation in the subregions will become more intense and frequent especially in the western tienshan mountains figs 3 4 s5 and s6 for example the prcptot is projected to be 8 37 mm 19 69 mm 31 31 mm and 40 00 mm in 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c warming scenario in west tienshan mountains but only 1 94 mm 4 13 mm 8 04 mm and 11 93 mm in east tienshan mountains respectively fig 4 g additionally the fraction of land facing a robust change also increases with warming levels in a 1 5 c warming scenario nearly 12 57 of the land in west tienshan mountains will be affected by robust increases of rx1day this will increase to 72 13 under a 4 0 c warming scenario table s5 3 4 avoided impacts by limiting warming to 2 0 c instead of 3 0 c a substantial increase in extreme impacts would result from a 3 0 c rise in global temperature compared to a 2 0 c rise figs 5 6 and s7 in such a warming scenario extreme precipitation is projected to become more frequent r5mm and r10mm figs s7b and 7e and intense rx1day and rx5day figs s7c and 7f prcptot r95p and r99p figs s7g 7i compared to a rise of 2 0 c a further increase of 1 0 c would bring a marked increase of at least 8 04 mm and 1 26 d in mean prcptot and rx5day across the entire tmca respectively fig 6 a these changes would be even more extreme in west tienshan mountains with a global temperature rise of 2 0 c nearly 17 10 of the land in the tmca will be affected by a robust increase of r5mm however with a global temperature rise of 3 0 c the fraction of land affected would increase to 60 19 which means 43 09 would face significant changes just from an additional 1 0 c warming table s5 looking at the probability distribution functions of changes in extreme precipitation indices we can see a clear shift of distribution toward wetter conditions fig 5 the impacts that can be avoided from 2 0 c warming compared to 3 0 c are presented in fig 6b as shown a lower warming scenario prevents 62 84 153 77 of the changes in frequency intensity and duration of extreme precipitation east tienshan mountains in particular benefits from a 1 0 c lower warming scenario showing highly significant avoided impacts ranging from 69 49 to 240 25 4 summary and discussion observed global mean surface temperature has increased at an unprecedented rate for at least the past 2000 years compared with 1850 1900 it has risen 1 26 c as of 2020 ipcc ar6 which makes it very challenging to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to below 2 0 preferably to 1 5 c the tmca is vital to the further development of the entire central asian region and the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of china as it provides a large amount of water resources to meet the needs of local production living and ecology in addition the tmca is extraordinarily sensitive to global climate change with all this in mind and within the context of strong climate warming what changes will happen to the extreme precipitation to answer this urgent question we investigated changes in extreme precipitation for a range of warming levels 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c in the tmca by employing the multi model ensemble simulation from the downscaled and bias corrected cmip6 gcms we were mainly concerned with the robustness of changes in extreme precipitation indices and the impacts that may be avoided by limiting warming to 2 0 c instead of 3 0 c our main findings are summarized below the observationally constrained mme median results from cmip6 have reasonable performance in reproducing the spatial distribution and stimulating magnitude of extreme precipitation over the tmca the mme median captures the two wetter centers in the north of west tienshan and the southwest of middle tienshan furthermore in the magnitude stimulation for all extreme precipitation indices the relative error value does not exceed 4 96 except for r99p compared to 1976 2005 the intensity rx1day rx5day prcptot r95p and r99p and frequency r5mm and r10mm of extreme precipitation are projected to increase over the entire tmca region for all warming scenarios 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c this is fairly similar with europe where rainfall will be more frequent and intense with increased warming using the same definition of warming level dosio and fischer 2018 likewise projection for southeast asia ge et al 2019 south america almazroui et al 2021 central asia peng et al 2020 yao et al 2021b and china yang et al 2018 reveal that intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation is amplified represented with the same extreme indices meanwhile the fraction of land facing a robust change also increases with warming levels for example in a 1 5 c increase scenario nearly 2 32 of the land in the tmca will be affected by increases of rx5day usually indicating flooding which then increases to 9 18 50 05 58 55 in warming scenarios of 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 c respectively moreover this study demonstrated that an additional 1 0 c of warming will make a phenomenal difference over the tmca especially for more intensified extreme precipitation indices e g rx5day and r99p compared with rx1day and r95p in fact impacts in some areas of the tmca are projected to more than quintuple in a 2 0 c warming scenario nearly 9 18 of the land in the tmca will be affected by an increase of rx5day but this jumps to 50 05 about 5 5 times in a 3 0 c warming scenario in real terms the increase of only 1 0 c means that 40 87 of the land will experience extreme changes however limiting warming to 2 0 c does avoid a substantial increase in extreme risks our research shows that about 62 84 153 77 of the change in the frequency intensity and duration of extreme precipitation can be avoided in a scenario of 1 0 c less warming in terms of determining warming time we firstly identified the time when a 30 year running mean of each model under different scenarios ssp245 ssp585 would potentially reach global warming levels of 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c we then formed a 30 year period centered around these times to further quantify changes in extreme precipitation and impacts this approach called time sampling is commonly used in research as it removes model variability from temperature sensitivity to greenhouse gases and does not assume linear relationships between global temperature and local changes dosio and fischer 2018 james et al 2014 james et al 2017 vautard et al 2014 we determined that the warming times table s4 are generally in good agreement with those of the euro cordex downscaled from cmip5 dosio and fischer 2018 and cmip6 gao et al 2021 however we had to acknowledge that the warming levels of each gcms are different for the projected warming therefore the number of models involved in the calculation of extreme precipitation differs according to global warming levels e g warming of 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c for example ten models are available at global warming increases of 2 0 c in our study whereas only eight models are available at global warming increases of 3 0 c table s4 to some extent this may affect the robustness of changes in extreme precipitation considering that the determination of robustness is based on the model s ensemble size in addition there are still some uncertainties in the study the first one is uncertainties in the future climate change scenarios themselves the rough resolution of the gcms cannot directly provide climate elements information on a fine regional scale peng et al 2018 additionally the errors from referenced data bring uncertainties in the projection aphrodte data is challenging to simulate precipitation variations in complex terrain area even though the data is the highest resolution longest time series and most widely used data covering the asian region li et al 2020 moreover we have to realize that weather and climate extreme events do not occur in isolation and that the impact of related events in time and space is often disproportionately greater than that of a single hazard a or of the sum of them chen et al 2021 zscheischler et al 2018 ridder et al 2022 usually before the next shock multiple extreme events narrow the recovery window leading to a domino like cascade of impacts examples include drought heatwave concurrent drought and heatwave event alizadeh mohammad et al 2020 zscheischler and seneviratne sonia 2017 flood heatwave flood event followed by heatwave within the pre scribed temporal interval chen et al 2021 and other compound events ipcc 2012 therefore more efforts should be taken to the investigation of compound events including their temporal variations spatial patterns formation mechanisms projected changes and risk assessments in the arid central asian region special attentions should also be paid on the inconsistency of data and assessment framework credit

2988,the tienshan mountains is the main water source and ecological barrier in the central portion of the silk road economic belt a new economic development zone with the asia pacific economic circle to the east and the european economic circle to the west production living ecological activities in the arid central asia region are heavily dependent on water resources mainly recharged from melt and alpine precipitation hence reliable projections of changes in extreme precipitation under global warming are particularly important for the utilization and management of water resources based on the downscaled and bias corrected state of art global climate models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 we investigate changes in extreme precipitation over the tienshan mountains central asia tmca under different levels of global warming 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c we specifically assess the robustness of changes and the benefits of limiting warming to 2 0 c as opposed to 3 0 c compared with the reference period 1976 2005 a robust change in extreme precipitation across the tmca is expected for all warming levels and the fraction of land faced a robust change also increases with warming levels furthermore there would be a substantial rise in extreme impacts in the tmca when shifting from increases of 2 0 c to 3 0 c in a scenario involving a 1 0 c rise i e from 2 0 c to 3 0 c nearly 85 70 and 60 19 of the land in the tmca will be affected by a robust increase in annual total wet day precipitation prcptot and number of light rain days r5mm respectively in the same scenario areas affected by robust changes in duration indices consecutive dry days cdd and consecutive wet days cwd will likely be less than 11 59 limiting warming to 2 0 c instead of 3 0 c can avoid a marked increased impacts of about 62 84 153 77 of the change in frequency intensity and duration of extreme precipitation keywords extreme precipitation global warming avoided impact tienshan mountains data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction natural and socio economic systems are extremely sensitive and fragile to changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events as these events often cause floods landslides mudslides and other natural disasters donat et al 2016 fischer and knutti 2015 king et al 2017 seneviratne et al 2021 since the 1950s increases in the intensity frequency and amount of heavy precipitation events on global scale over a majority of land regions have been observed and projected that increases take place in most land regions at 1 5 c global warming high confidence 2 c global warming likely and 4 c global warming very likely seneviratne et al 2021 the increase in extreme precipitation is closely related to changes in global temperature donat et al 2016 the current rise in temperature can explain 18 of extreme precipitation changes if the temperature rises 2 c the proportion bumps up to 40 increasing nonlinearly with global warming fischer and knutti 2015 in order to reduce the impact of climate change resulting from global warming the international community has reached an agreement to control the level of global warming to within a maximum increase of 2 c while striving to control it at a lower level of 1 5 c unfccc 2015 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc was invited to release the special report on global warming of 1 5 c in 2018 which has caused more and more scholars to pay attention to projections of hazard and risk at different warming levels at global and regional scales especially with regard to changes in climate extremes ipcc 2018 previous studies found that extreme precipitation yang et al 2018 zhang and zhou 2020 concurrent drought and heatwave zhang et al 2019 and other extreme events will increase with warming and that limiting warming will reduce the impacts associated with climate extremes zhang et al 2018 however these studies mostly used global climate models gcms such as the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zou et al 2021 or regional climate models rcms such as the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment dosio and fischer 2018 ge et al 2019 these models are forced by representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rather than by shared socioeconomic pathway ssp scenarios specifically designed for the sixth ipcc assessment report ipcc ar6 in addition most previous studies adopted a global shi et al 2021 europe dosio and fischer 2018 australia king et al 2017 or southeast asian perspective ge et al 2019 whereas our work focuses on the tienshan mountains central asia tmca as well the earlier studies neglected to address changes in extreme precipitation at different warming levels or to investigate potential impacts caused by 3 0 c or higher warming for the tmca existing research related to precipitation is limited and most of it focuses on annual precipitation hu et al 2017 precipitation concentration yang et al 2020a yang et al 2020b and stationarity yao et al 2021a furthermore in terms of extreme precipitation most existing studies reflect changes in historical periods liu et al 2021 luo et al 2020 wang et al 2013 zou et al 2021 whereas few investigate future changes in extreme precipitation and how the impacts of these changes might potentially be avoided by limiting warming levels therefore it is imperative to explore variations in extreme precipitation under different warming levels in order to better deal with relevant water resources management to mitigate hazards and losses now and into the future king et al 2017 li et al 2020 zou et al 2021 based on downscaled and bias corrected cmip6 gcms this study investigates future changes in extreme precipitation at different warming levels 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c over the tmca we are mainly concerned with the robustness of changes in extreme precipitation indices and the avoided impacts accrued by limiting warming to 2 0 c rather than to 3 0 c 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the tmca is located in the hinterland of the eurasian continent far from any ocean the inland remoteness of the place makes it difficult for water vapor to reach it making it a highly arid region of the world fig 1 chen et al 2018b zou et al 2021 the tmca is characterized by a semi arid and arid climate with strong evaporation and little precipitation average annual precipitation amounts are less than 300 mm yet the lowland areas of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan in central asia are among the world s largest irrigated zones farinotti et al 2015 at the same time the tmca region has some of the most fully developed glacier mountains in the world with a total area of almost 13 566 6 km2 chen et al 2016 glaciers snow melt water in high mountains forest precipitation in middle mountains and bedrock fissure water in low mountains feed most of the area s rivers supporting the development of agriculture and the economy in central asia chen et al 2016 farinotti et al 2015 however the tmca is not only an area highly sensitive to global climate change it is also a hot spot for water cycle change chen et al 2016 over the past half century the average annual warming rate in the tmca 0 34 c decade has been higher than the global annual warming rate 0 12 c decade li et al 2017 this intense warming is bound to accelerate the water cycle aggravate extreme hydrological events and increase the challenge of dealing with changes in water resources across the entire central asian region chen et al 2016 li et al 2017 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 climate simulation data the cmip has evolved over five phases to become one of the key elements of climate science and an effective tool for assessing climate change eyring et al 2016 currently the cmip6 has released several new global climate models based on a combination of the ssp and the rcp to project future scenarios for climate change https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 these results were used to draft the ipcc ar6 gao et al 2021 guo et al 2021 ipcc 2019 thus far the one third model released by cmip6 shows higher equilibrium climate sensitivity than the cmip5 forster et al 2020 compared with the cmip5 for example the cmip6 model shows a general improvement in simulating extreme climate and related trends chen et al 2020 moreover cmip6 has been applied to issues concerning climate change and water resources assessment not only in central asia guo et al 2021 but also in the united states yuan et al 2021 and in regions affected by indian summer monsoons gusain et al 2020 based on the better models as determined in previous studies guo et al 2021 we preliminarily selected six models in cmip6 for our research these models were chosen to include both the historical period 1850 2014 and the ssp245 and ssp585 forcing scenarios during 2015 2100 all models use only the first realization r1i1p1f1 with variables including temperature and precipitation the schema is shown in table s1 2 2 2 gridded observed data given the scarcity of observation sites and the missing data from many meteorological stations since 1990 in the study area we used data from water resources project called aphrodite the project is jointly carried out by the research institute for human and nature and the meteorological research institute of the japan meteorological agency aphrodite provided us with a set of highly resolved daily grid precipitation data for monsoon asian the middle east and russia northern eurasia which we employed as for observation data yatagai et al 2012 yatagai et al 2008 https aphrodite st hirosakiu ac jp download the gridded fields of daily precipitation are defined by interpolating rain gauge observations obtained from meteorological and hydrological stations throughout the above regions in combination with the intelligent interpolation algorithm of a digital elevation model this gives the dataset more advantages than other grid data chen et al 2018a ge et al 2019 sohn et al 2012 so it is often employed to obtain observational data for evaluating the performance of global climate models gusain et al 2020 kim et al 2019 samuels et al 2018 yatagai et al 2012 yatagai et al 2008 specifically aphrodite has been utilized for extreme climate and water resource evaluations such as in central asia fang et al 2015 the eastern mediterranean samuels et al 2018 and the asian summer monsoon regions kim et al 2019 among others in this paper we selected aphro ma 025deg v1101 1951 2007 as our observation data and 1976 2005 as our reference period 2 2 3 extreme precipitation diagnosis in this study a total of nine extreme precipitation indices table s2 proposed by the international expert group on climate change detection and indicators etccdi crd are employed to investigate changes in extreme precipitation in the tmca under different global warming levels 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c for each index we calculate extreme precipitation indices for every grid point of each model 2 3 methods 2 3 1 downscaling and bias correction the resolution of the gcms is relatively coarse and should be used with caution in certain locations dosio and fischer 2018 yang et al 2018 to remedy these shortcomings we located the nearest grid point relative to the study area in each gcms and then employed the bias correction method to correct their biases for bias correction methods on precipitation local intensity scaling loci and quantile mapping qm were beneficial to applications related to extreme precipitation events compared to other well performing methods fang et al 2015 themeβι et al 2011 2012 the loci correction idea aims to construct a scaling factor and realize the correction of precipitation by judging the relationship between precipitation at a specific time and the wet day threshold the process is as follows fang et al 2015 1 p c o r m d 0 p r a w m d p t h r e s m p r a w m d s m p r a w m d p t h r e s m 2 s m μ p o b s m d p o b s m d 0 μ p r a w m d p r a w m d p t h r e s m where p cor m d p raw m d and p obs m d are the corrected raw simulated and observed precipitation on the d th day of the m th month p thres m is the wet day threshold of the raw model for the m th month sm is the scaling factor of the m th month and μ is the average value of the variables the qm method is able to correct the empirical cumulative probability distribution function pdf of the corrected precipitation as close as possible to the observations by establishing the transfer function through sometimes artificially corrupted future model projected trends cannon et al 2015 fang et al 2015 pastén zapata et al 2020 themeßl et al 2012 themeßl et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 in this paper we first used a smoothing spline to exclude noise that would be amplified in the correction and then corrected the precipitation in the reference and future periods huang 2019 the specific process is as follows gudmundsson et al 2012 3 x bc f x m where x m is the daily precipitation of the original output of cmip6 models in point wise f is the established transfer function in the reference period and x bc is the corrected daily precipitation of cmip6 models in point wise among them the transfer function of the reference period is established as follows 4 f e c d f m 1 x m 1 f ecdfo x o where x o f ecdfo are the observation data and its corresponding empirical cumulative pdf in the reference period and x m 1 f e c d f m 1 are the model data and its corresponding empirical cumulative pdf in the reference period applying the established transfer function to the future period we get 5 x bc f ecdfo 1 f e c d f m 2 x m 2 where x m 2 f c d f m 2 are the model data and its corresponding empirical cumulative pdf in the future period f ecdfo 1 is the inverse empirical cumulative pdf and x bc is the corrected model data in the future period taking bcc csm2 mr as an example the two above mentioned bias correction methods loci qm are carried out for the downscaled daily precipitation data from 1976 to 2005 the results are presented in table s3 as shown the qm approach is better than loci for several evaluation indexes of precipitation annual daily precipitation total precipitation in wet days median and 99th quantile of daily precipitation standard deviation mean absolute error root mean square error and correlation coefficient therefore we chose qm to correct the selected cmip6 model data 2 3 2 time spans for 1 5 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 c increases in global warming in order to eliminate the influence of interannual climate change on the results we processed a 30 year running mean of near surface air temperature data global historical 1850 2014a and future ssp245 ssp585 2015 2100a periods provided by six selected models king et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 we then compared these data to those of pre industrial levels 1850 1900a determining global warming for 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c under ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios at the time when the 30 year running mean of near surfa9 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c next we selected a central time of about 15 years before and after to form a 30 year temperature rise period which was used to calculate changes in extreme precipitation under different warming scenarios vautard et al 2014 fig s1 table s4 note that if the period before and after the time of warming 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c is much less than 15 years the time series is insufficient to reach the target warming in 2015 2100 for example if we determine 2023 as the time for global warming of 1 5 c using ssp585 of bcc csm2 mr there are only 8 years between 2015 and 2023 which is much less than 15 years therefore we think using such a short period to achieve warming of 1 5 c is insufficient we discuss every warming scenario based on every suitable model presented in table s4 for example the analysis of warming 1 5 c is based on bcc csm2 mr ssp245 miroc6 ssp245 ssp585 and mpi esm1 2 hr ssp585 2 3 3 statistical analysis based on multi model ensemble mme median results the robustness of the change of index was assessed by referring to the method used by dosio et al 2018 and yang et al 2018 that is the robustness is judged from the significance and agreement of the change in a comprehensive manner the change was considered robust if i the mme median result showed a statistically significant change for example by performing a two sample kolmogorov smirnov k s test to determine if independent random samples were drawn from the same underlying continuous population in each grid points for the reference period and the 3 0 c warming period we rejected the null hypothesis at the 5 significance level ii the signal to noise ratio the ratio of absolute value of the mme median change to the standard deviation among the members was greater than or equal to 1 and iii more than 80 of members agreed on its sign in order to present the difference in extreme risk between 2 0 and 3 0 c we used avoided impact ai to answer quantitatively which impacts could be avoided at a 2 0 c global warming world compared to 3 0 c li et al 2018 6 ai c 3 0 c 2 0 c 2 0 100 where c 3 0 and c 2 0 are the changes at 3 0 and 2 0 c warming levels compared to the reference period 1976 2005 respectively 3 results 3 1 evaluation of bias correction in representing historical period extreme precipitation compared with the observation the spatial pattern of extreme precipitation can be reasonably reproduced by the mme median results figs 2 s2 and s3 the cwd r5mm number of heavy rain days r10mm maximum1 day precipitation rx1day maximum 5 day precipitation rx5day prcptot total annual precipitation from heavy rain days r95p and total annual precipitation from very heavy rain days r99p decreased from southwest to northeast there were also two more wet centers over the north of west tienshan and the southwest of middle tienshan conversely the spatial pattern of cdd decreased from northeast to southwest fig 2 a c e figs s2a c e and figs s3a c e the spatial pattern of the above indices and the location of two more wet centers are well captured by the mme median results fig 2b d f figs s2 b d f and fig s3 b d f although overestimates and underestimates occur in cdd rx1day and rx5day in cwd prcptot r5mm r10mm r95p and r99p in the mme median results the overall relative error value is between 4 96 and 2 93 except for r99p fig s4 generally the mme median results not only relatively accurately reproduce the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation over the tmca but also reasonably imitate their magnitude therefore we employed the bias correction method to constrain future projections and then analyzed changes in precipitation extremes under different warming levels 3 2 changes in extreme precipitation under different warming levels compared with the reference period a robust change in the extreme precipitation across the tmca is expected for all warming levels there is an obvious increase in the fraction of areas with robust changes in extreme precipitation indices under 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c warming compared to a 1 5 c world fig 3 figs s5 s6 and table s5 compared to 1976 2005 cdd is projected to increase in western tmca with a maximum increase of about 10 days under 1 5 c 9 days under 2 0 c 12 days under 3 0 c and 16 days under 4 0 c scenarios it is projected to decrease in eastern part with the maximum decrease exceeding 18 days under 4 0 c fig 3a d spatial changes in cwd are opposite to those in cdd figs s5a d however the intensity rx1day and rx5day fig 3i l and figs s5i l prcptot figs s6a d r95p and r99p figs s6e l and frequency r5mm and r10mm fig 3e h and figs s5e h of extreme precipitation are projected to increase across the entire tmca region under all warming scenarios for example the mean of rx1day is projected to be about 0 93 mm for 1 5 c 1 23 mm for 2 0 c 2 03 mm for 3 0 c and 2 71 mm for 4 0 c warming the fraction of land facing a robust increase in rx1day is also projected to expand by 13 62 13 82 42 80 and 59 81 respectively fig 3i l table s5 in a 3 0 c warming scenario nearly 85 70 of land in the tmca will be affected by a robust increase of prcptot table s5 moreover compared with a 2 0 c increase an additional warming of 1 0 c leads to a marked increase of at least 25 93 mm in maximum prcptot over the entire tmca figs s6a d 3 3 changes in extreme precipitation in different subregions different subregions are expected to experience increased extreme precipitation under all warming levels as warming levels rise extreme precipitation in the subregions will become more intense and frequent especially in the western tienshan mountains figs 3 4 s5 and s6 for example the prcptot is projected to be 8 37 mm 19 69 mm 31 31 mm and 40 00 mm in 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c warming scenario in west tienshan mountains but only 1 94 mm 4 13 mm 8 04 mm and 11 93 mm in east tienshan mountains respectively fig 4 g additionally the fraction of land facing a robust change also increases with warming levels in a 1 5 c warming scenario nearly 12 57 of the land in west tienshan mountains will be affected by robust increases of rx1day this will increase to 72 13 under a 4 0 c warming scenario table s5 3 4 avoided impacts by limiting warming to 2 0 c instead of 3 0 c a substantial increase in extreme impacts would result from a 3 0 c rise in global temperature compared to a 2 0 c rise figs 5 6 and s7 in such a warming scenario extreme precipitation is projected to become more frequent r5mm and r10mm figs s7b and 7e and intense rx1day and rx5day figs s7c and 7f prcptot r95p and r99p figs s7g 7i compared to a rise of 2 0 c a further increase of 1 0 c would bring a marked increase of at least 8 04 mm and 1 26 d in mean prcptot and rx5day across the entire tmca respectively fig 6 a these changes would be even more extreme in west tienshan mountains with a global temperature rise of 2 0 c nearly 17 10 of the land in the tmca will be affected by a robust increase of r5mm however with a global temperature rise of 3 0 c the fraction of land affected would increase to 60 19 which means 43 09 would face significant changes just from an additional 1 0 c warming table s5 looking at the probability distribution functions of changes in extreme precipitation indices we can see a clear shift of distribution toward wetter conditions fig 5 the impacts that can be avoided from 2 0 c warming compared to 3 0 c are presented in fig 6b as shown a lower warming scenario prevents 62 84 153 77 of the changes in frequency intensity and duration of extreme precipitation east tienshan mountains in particular benefits from a 1 0 c lower warming scenario showing highly significant avoided impacts ranging from 69 49 to 240 25 4 summary and discussion observed global mean surface temperature has increased at an unprecedented rate for at least the past 2000 years compared with 1850 1900 it has risen 1 26 c as of 2020 ipcc ar6 which makes it very challenging to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to below 2 0 preferably to 1 5 c the tmca is vital to the further development of the entire central asian region and the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of china as it provides a large amount of water resources to meet the needs of local production living and ecology in addition the tmca is extraordinarily sensitive to global climate change with all this in mind and within the context of strong climate warming what changes will happen to the extreme precipitation to answer this urgent question we investigated changes in extreme precipitation for a range of warming levels 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c in the tmca by employing the multi model ensemble simulation from the downscaled and bias corrected cmip6 gcms we were mainly concerned with the robustness of changes in extreme precipitation indices and the impacts that may be avoided by limiting warming to 2 0 c instead of 3 0 c our main findings are summarized below the observationally constrained mme median results from cmip6 have reasonable performance in reproducing the spatial distribution and stimulating magnitude of extreme precipitation over the tmca the mme median captures the two wetter centers in the north of west tienshan and the southwest of middle tienshan furthermore in the magnitude stimulation for all extreme precipitation indices the relative error value does not exceed 4 96 except for r99p compared to 1976 2005 the intensity rx1day rx5day prcptot r95p and r99p and frequency r5mm and r10mm of extreme precipitation are projected to increase over the entire tmca region for all warming scenarios 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c this is fairly similar with europe where rainfall will be more frequent and intense with increased warming using the same definition of warming level dosio and fischer 2018 likewise projection for southeast asia ge et al 2019 south america almazroui et al 2021 central asia peng et al 2020 yao et al 2021b and china yang et al 2018 reveal that intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation is amplified represented with the same extreme indices meanwhile the fraction of land facing a robust change also increases with warming levels for example in a 1 5 c increase scenario nearly 2 32 of the land in the tmca will be affected by increases of rx5day usually indicating flooding which then increases to 9 18 50 05 58 55 in warming scenarios of 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 c respectively moreover this study demonstrated that an additional 1 0 c of warming will make a phenomenal difference over the tmca especially for more intensified extreme precipitation indices e g rx5day and r99p compared with rx1day and r95p in fact impacts in some areas of the tmca are projected to more than quintuple in a 2 0 c warming scenario nearly 9 18 of the land in the tmca will be affected by an increase of rx5day but this jumps to 50 05 about 5 5 times in a 3 0 c warming scenario in real terms the increase of only 1 0 c means that 40 87 of the land will experience extreme changes however limiting warming to 2 0 c does avoid a substantial increase in extreme risks our research shows that about 62 84 153 77 of the change in the frequency intensity and duration of extreme precipitation can be avoided in a scenario of 1 0 c less warming in terms of determining warming time we firstly identified the time when a 30 year running mean of each model under different scenarios ssp245 ssp585 would potentially reach global warming levels of 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c we then formed a 30 year period centered around these times to further quantify changes in extreme precipitation and impacts this approach called time sampling is commonly used in research as it removes model variability from temperature sensitivity to greenhouse gases and does not assume linear relationships between global temperature and local changes dosio and fischer 2018 james et al 2014 james et al 2017 vautard et al 2014 we determined that the warming times table s4 are generally in good agreement with those of the euro cordex downscaled from cmip5 dosio and fischer 2018 and cmip6 gao et al 2021 however we had to acknowledge that the warming levels of each gcms are different for the projected warming therefore the number of models involved in the calculation of extreme precipitation differs according to global warming levels e g warming of 1 5 c 2 0 c 3 0 c and 4 0 c for example ten models are available at global warming increases of 2 0 c in our study whereas only eight models are available at global warming increases of 3 0 c table s4 to some extent this may affect the robustness of changes in extreme precipitation considering that the determination of robustness is based on the model s ensemble size in addition there are still some uncertainties in the study the first one is uncertainties in the future climate change scenarios themselves the rough resolution of the gcms cannot directly provide climate elements information on a fine regional scale peng et al 2018 additionally the errors from referenced data bring uncertainties in the projection aphrodte data is challenging to simulate precipitation variations in complex terrain area even though the data is the highest resolution longest time series and most widely used data covering the asian region li et al 2020 moreover we have to realize that weather and climate extreme events do not occur in isolation and that the impact of related events in time and space is often disproportionately greater than that of a single hazard a or of the sum of them chen et al 2021 zscheischler et al 2018 ridder et al 2022 usually before the next shock multiple extreme events narrow the recovery window leading to a domino like cascade of impacts examples include drought heatwave concurrent drought and heatwave event alizadeh mohammad et al 2020 zscheischler and seneviratne sonia 2017 flood heatwave flood event followed by heatwave within the pre scribed temporal interval chen et al 2021 and other compound events ipcc 2012 therefore more efforts should be taken to the investigation of compound events including their temporal variations spatial patterns formation mechanisms projected changes and risk assessments in the arid central asian region special attentions should also be paid on the inconsistency of data and assessment framework credit

2989,understanding hillslope erosion processes is important for the development of physically based erosion prediction models however quantitative information about the successive development of interrill rill ephemeral gully erosion on hillslopes is still rare in this study rare earth elements rees were employed as tracers to monitor the successive development of different erosion processes on a hillslope ten different ree oxides were individually mixed with cultivated loessial soil from farmland on the loess plateau of china the ten tagged soils were packed in ten layers into a flume 5 m in length 1 m in width and 0 7 m in depth with a 20 gradient simulated rainfall events with natural rainstorm intensities of 60 and 90 mm h 1 were conducted and each rainfall intensity event contained three subevents that lasted for 135 mm rainfall depth for each subevent the runoff and sediments for each test were collected at the outlet of the flume at 4 5 minute and 3 minute intervals respectively the flow velocity flow depth and width and depth of the main channel were also synchronously measured the results showed that the hillslope erosion went through five evolutionary stages interrill erosion rill development stabilized rill ephemeral gully development and stabilized ephemeral gully these stages were quantitatively identified according to the changing contribution rates of the interrill rill and ephemeral gully areas the channel width always developed faster than the depth at both the 60 mm h 1 and 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the hydrological parameters could greatly explain the channel evolution and particle size changes a larger flow power of 90 mm h 1 intensified the channel morphology evolution in the early development stage the friction coefficient finally remained steady and the w d ratio eventually approached a stable value of approximately 2 in the stabilized ephemeral gully stage selective erosion occurred in the transportation processes were gradually weakened due to rapid increase of flow power and the overall detachment of the large clods in the channel as manifested by particle size distribution in sediments approaching primary

land degradation and grain reduction problems globally wu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 understanding erosion processes on hillslopes involving interrill or sheets rill and ephemeral gully erosion is essential for the development of physically based erosion prediction models gordon et al 2007 jetten et al 2003 porto et al 2014 poesen 2018 taguas et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 interrill erosion generally occurs from the upper 1 cm of soil caused by two subprocesses of detachment and transport by raindrop splash and sheet flow greenwood 2012 liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2018a 2019a the inhomogeneous properties of surface soil and raindrop hitting lead to the appearance of small pits and then accumulated runoff induces the development of rills rills consist of the development of numerous closely spaced channels by concentrated flow whose width and depth are usually smaller than 20 cm and 30 cm respectively kinnell 2001 foster 1986 qin et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 when rills develop due to the increase in concentrated flow depth velocity and shear stress compared with interrill erosion the sediment yield can be significantly increased liu et al 2011 rill morphology determines where flow accumulates and scours and it also contributes to the uncertainty and complexity of subprocesses of rill development bingner et al 2016 wang 1998 divided rill development into four stages i downwards incision and horizontal development along the moist periphery of rill ii local erosion from a very steep slope of rill iii collapses of rill walls and iv lateral migrations of rill qin et al 2018 suggested that the subprocesses of rill development include head cutting advance bed incision and sidewall expansion which subprocesses occur consecutively or concurrently and interact with each other bennett et al 2000 bingner et al 2016 mancilla et al 2005 nafchi et al 2021 huo et al 2011 indicated that the development processes of rills can be summarized as five stages knickpoints head cut extension intermittent rill continuous rill and rill networks adequate data have led to the development of a solid foundation to study interrill rill processes and their mechanism in detail in addition to interrills and rills ephemeral gullies are important sediment sources on hillslopes casalí et al 1999 poesen et al 2003 zhang et al 2007 moges and holden 2008 liu et al 2021 ephemeral gullies are defined as successive channels of various sizes formed by concentrated flow that can be easily destroyed by normal tillage and can be reformed again in the same location by additional runoff events capra et al 2009 oostwoud wijdenes et al 2000 soil science society of america 2008 which are larger than rills but smaller than permanent gullies poesen et al 2003 2010 the depth of ephemeral gullies generally varies between 20 cm but occasionally exceeds 50 cm gong et al 2011 zheng et al 2017 liu et al 2021 the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service reported that ephemeral gullies typically contributed 30 to 100 of the total soil loss in actively eroding areas in the u s bennett et al 2000 usda 2010 on the loess plateau of china it accounts for 30 to 90 of the total soil loss cheng et al 2007 zheng et al 2017 the ephemeral gully erosion process was divided into early middle and late stages zhu 1956 casalí et al 2000 identified ephemeral gully erosion processes as the formation and migration of headcuts erosion and deposition in the channel bed and channel bank erosion and sloughing by measuring gully morphology dong et al 2015 estimated the eroded soil volume by using sediment concentration to determine the development of ephemeral gullies in a series of flume experiments up to date research on ephemeral gully erosion is still limited due to its complex processes and the limitations of research methods in addition previous studies mainly focused on individual or partially continuous processes for interrill rill or gully erosion separately liu et al 2021 the successive erosion processes and sediment contributions of interrills rills and ephemeral gullies to slope erosion have never been monitored and distinguished quantitatively the sediment tracking technique which employs existing properties of soil or deliberately adds artificial substances to soil as tracers showed its potential to study soil erosion quantitatively zhang et al 2018b radionuclides such as berylium 7 burch et al 1988 yang et al 2013 caesium 137 walling and quine 1991 lu and higgitt 2000 and lead 210 he and walling 1996 walling et al 2003 are good tracers for estimating spatial soil erosion rate distributions and soil erosion processes a single tracer agent is useful for estimating spatial soil erosion rates and patterns but fails to provide insights into multiple sediment sources in soil erosion processes guzmán et al 2013 zhang 2015 zhang et al 2019b rare earth elements rees which are the 15 elements of the lanthanide series yttrium and scandium with similar chemical and physical properties are widely used to trace soil erosion processes and distinguish sediment sources as artificial substances deliberately added to soil liu et al 2004 liu et al 2016a 2016b xiao et al 2017a zhang et al 2018b the aims of this study were to i partition the contributions of interrill rill and ephemeral gully erosion during simulated rainstorms under hillslope conditions ii describe the changes in hydrological parameters channel morphological features and sediment particle size distributions during different stages of gully development and iii assess the potential of applying rees as tracers to monitor the development of ephemeral gullies 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and ree oxide powders test soil was collected from the upper 20 cm layer of cultivated land in ansai county 36 30 37 19 n 108 05 109 26 e shaanxi province the soil particle composition was 9 1 clay 0 002 mm 17 3 silt 0 002 0 02 mm and 73 6 sand 0 02 2 mm while the soil organic matter content was 0 77 g kg 1 and the ph was 7 95 the soil texture was sandy loam classified using an international soil taxonomy classification encyclopedia of chinese agriculture 1996 the soil was air dried and passed through a 5 mm sieve to facilitate the removal of gravels plant roots and other debris ten different kinds of ree oxide powders eu2o3 yb2o3 tb4o7 sm2o3 ho2o3 ceo2 la2o3 nd2o3 dy2o3 and tm2o3 were prepared for this experiment based on their cost amount to be applied and susceptibility to detection liu et al 2016a the physical and chemical properties of the selected ree oxide powders are shown in table 1 to ensure that a small quantity of rees could be tightly and evenly bound to the soil each tracer was initially uniformly mixed with a small amount of soil sample and then more soil was added and mixed this step was repeated several times to obtain the predetermined ree concentrations 2 2 experimental setup the rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in the artificial rainfall simulation hall of the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau in yangling shannxi province a down sprinkler rainfall simulator system to simulate raindrops was employed fig 1 a this system consisted of 56 groups of nozzles arranged in a parallelogram with 2 4 m spacing each group was composed of three nozzles with diameters of 0 25 in 0 5 in and 0 75 in forming an equilateral triangle with 12 cm on each side the rainfall simulator system could be set to any rainfall intensity ranging from 30 to 350 mm h 1 by adjusting the nozzle aperture size and water pressure and a falling height 18 m above the ground ensured that the majority of raindrops attained terminal velocity the rainfall coverage area was 27 m by 18 m with a more than 80 distribution uniformity of rainfall he et al 2014 shen et al 2015 a slope adjustable metal flume 5 m in length 1 m in width and 0 7 m in depth with drainage holes 2 cm aperture at the bottom was used in this study the slope gradient of the flume ranged from 0 to 35 with 1 increments a collecting device was installed on the flume outlet to collect the runoff and sediment samples fig 1b 2 3 experimental design according to the instantaneous rainfall intensity standard of erosive rainfall i10 1 055 mm min 1 and i5 1 520 mm min 1 approximately 51 1 mm h 1 and 91 2 mm h 1 respectively on the loess plateau zhou and wang 1987 two typical rainfall intensities of rainstorms were designed 60 mm h 1 and 90 mm h 1 ephemeral gullies are widely distributed on hillslopes with slope gradients from 15 to 35 on the loess plateau thus a moderate slope of 20 was designed cheng et al 2007 additionally to simulate successive development processes of soil erosion interrill to rill to ephemeral gully three subevents with an interval of 24 h i e 1st to 3rd rainfall subevent were designed under each rainfall intensity a total rainfall of 135 mm was maintained for each subevent and rainfall durations were 135 min for 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and 90 min for 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensity 2 4 soil bed preparation according to the critical depth of interrill rill and ephemeral gully the topsoil layer 0 to 1 cm depth was considered to be the source of interrill erosion the layer at 2 to 20 cm depth contributed to rill erosion and the layer at 20 to 50 cm depth contributed to ephemeral gully erosion the ree tagged soils were packed into the flume layer by layer fig 2 soil packing was carried out layer by layer to achieve the desired uniform mean bulk density to simulate the appearance of plough pans the bulk densities in the upper 20 cm and underneath 30 cm were adjusted to 1 05 and 1 35 g cm 3 respectively the bottom of the flume bed was perforated and covered with a 20 cm thick sand layer to facilitate the free drainage of percolating soil water during packing the soil was gradually wetted using a sprayer to saturation to maintain consistent soil moisture on the soil surface finally the filled flume was covered by a plastic sheet and then left for 24 h without disturbance to enhance the binding of the rees with the soil particles 2 5 experimental procedure prior to the experiment rainfall intensity was calibrated to reach designed rainfall intensity with uniformity greater than 90 next the plastic sheet was removed to carry out the rainfall experiment once runoff occurred runoff and sediments were collected at the outlet of the flume using plastic containers with intervals of 4 5 min and 3 min for 60 mm h 1 and 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensities respectively additionally the flow velocity was recorded by the dyeing method with potassium permanganate and the flow depth was measured using a steel ruler when erosion channels formed the width and depth of the main channel were also measured using tape at intervals 0 5 m synchronously at the end of each subevent the flume was covered with a plastic sheet to minimize water evaporation and left undisturbed for 24 h until the next rainfall subevent then the volume of water in each container was measured and the sediments were air dried and weighed the rainfall experiment was repeated three times 2 6 laboratory analyses the soil organic matter content was determined by the potassium dichromate oxidation external heating method liu 1996 and the ph was measured by a rex electric chemical phs 3e precision acidity meter shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd china rees in the soil and sediment were extracted according to the following steps liu et al 2016a i sediments were crushed and sieved to obtain a 50 g air dried sample through a 0 15 mm sieve ii a 25 mg subsample was placed into a 50 ml cylindrical flask iii 0 5 ml of hno3 68 by weight and 1 ml hf 48 by weight were added to the flask and sealed iv the flask was heated to 185 c in an oven for 24 h v after cooling to room temperature the open flask was heated at 130 c on a hot plate until nearly dry vi 1 ml of hno3 was added and then heated again repeating step v until nearly dry vii steps i iv v and vi were repeated viii 5 ml of hno3 was added followed by heating of the sealed flask at 130 c in an oven for 3 h ix the flask was cooled and the remaining suspension was transferred to a 50 ml volumetric flask and enough deionized water 18 mω cm 1 was added to make up the volume to 50 ml and x the suspension was mixed and then transferred to a 10 ml polyethylene centrifuge tube and centrifuged to obtain clear extracts two replicates were made for each sediment sample inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry x series 2 icp ms thermo fisher scientific usa was used to analyse the ree concentration each sample was diluted as needed a stock internal standard solution containing rhodium rh and rhenium re 10 μg l 1 was added to each sample and three separate measurements were made for each sample the particle size distributions psds of the sediment samples were measured using a malvern mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction device malvern instruments ltd uk the primary psd of soil the initial undispersed psd with aggregates and soil particles before rainfall was compared with the effective psd and ultimate psd of sediments martínez mena et al 2002 wang and shi 2015 the sediment samples used for effective psd were undispersed after rainfall and contained aggregates the samples for ultimate psd were dispersed after rainfall which were pretreated with hydrogen peroxide to remove organic matter and chemically dispersed using sodium hexametaphosphate prior to analysis the difference between the effective and ultimate psds demonstrated that the sediments were composed of primary and aggregate particles the proportions of the effective and ultimate particle sizes e u ratios could indicate how the different fractions were eroded and transported by the flow 2 7 data analyses according to zhang et al 2017 the mass of soil loss from layer j j 1 2 3 10 in the flume was calculated by using eq 1 1 w j r j b j η c j w where wj is the mass of sediments in layer j kg rj is the actual measured concentration of rees in layer j of the sediment samples mg kg 1 bj is the background concentration of rees in layer j mg kg 1 w is the mass of the sediment samples kg cj is the applied concentration of rees in layer j mg kg 1 and η is an enrichment factor for fine particles which is defined as a dimensionless ratio of the percentage finer in the sediment to that in the original soil the contribution of each section rj and the error σ were calculated by using eqs 2 and 3 2 r j w j 1 n w j 100 3 σ 1 1 n w j w 100 flow power and friction coefficient were optimal hydraulic parameter for describing soil detachment and could be used to better explain the channel evolution and particle size changes during the channel development liu et al 2010 2019 xiao et al 2017b therefore soil detachment was described by shear stress τ n m 2 and flow power ω n m 1 s 1 xiao et al 2017b 4 τ ρ g r s 5 ω τ v where ρ is the liquid density kg m 3 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 r is the hydraulic radius m s is the effective hillslope gradient sin slope angle and v is the flow velocity after amendment m s 1 the friction coefficient f was calculated using the approach reported in liu et al 2019 6 f 8 g r s v 2 3 results 3 1 sediment yield the sediment yielded from different tracer layers is shown in fig 3 at two rainfall intensities 60 and 90 mm h 1 the top six and seven layers were eroded in the first 135 and 90 min and the lower four and three layers were eroded during the second 135 and 90 min respectively the soil erosion generated layer by layer indicated that the rill or ephemeral gully channel bed baseline gradually incised more deeply into the soil profile and the incision speed was faster for the higher rainfall intensity 90 mm h 1 during the three rainfall subevents the rainfall intensity affected the changing trend of sediment mass from different tracer layers for the first subevent the erosion of the top six layers increased with fluctuations in the early stage and then remained stable at the final stage for the 60 mm h 1 rainfall on the other hand the sediment yield of the top seven layers always showed a continuous increasing trend for the 90 mm h 1 rainfall the sediment yield from each layer was markedly enhanced at two rainfall intensities during the second subevent for the third subevent the sediment mass of the majority of layers increased at 60 mm h 1 rainfall but remained stable at 90 mm h 1 rainfall it should be pointed out that the densities of the broken line in the three rainfall subevents varied which could be explained by the extent of channel development compared with the total sediment yield the relative errors of the sediment yield calculated by using rees as tracers were 15 for all rainfall events table 2 3 2 contribution rate fig 4 shows the changing contribution rates of interrill rill and ephemeral gully erosion to the total sediment yield during successive rainfall events which were similar at the two rainfall intensities at 60 mm h 1 and 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the contribution rate of interrill erosion drastically decreased in the first 45 mins and 30 mins respectively and then gradually declined to nearly zero in 45 270 mins and 30 90 mins respectively the rill erosion quickly increased and slowly decreased to a stable state with some variabilities at approximately 90 mins and 72 mins respectively ephemeral gully erosion occurred at approximately 72 mins and 30 mins at rainfall intensities of 60 and 90 mm h 1 respectively then the ephemeral gully erosion increased sharply and its contribution rate exceeded that of rill erosion according to the above changing sediment contribution rate there were grounds to identify the five stages of hillslope erosion as interrill erosion rill development stabilized rill ephemeral gully development and stabilized ephemeral gully the contribution rate of interrill erosion to total erosion was larger than 20 and an inflection point appeared here the contribution rate of rill erosion appeared and rapidly developed close to 70 which was defined as the rill development stage then the contribution rate decreased slowly and tended to stabilize which was named the stabilized rill stage the development of the ephemeral gully was similar to that of the rill stage and the overlap of the two stages emphasized that the ephemeral gully development stage and stabilized rill stage were concomitant the stabilized ephemeral gully stage was identified when the contribution rate of ephemeral gully erosion exceeded that of the rill stage at 60 mm h 1 rainfall the ephemeral gully development stage still showed a continuous occurrence until the end of the rainfall event and the stabilized ephemeral gully stage did not appear 3 3 development of channel width and depth changes in the main channel width and depth are shown in fig 5 the channel width increased more rapidly than the channel depth and was greater at the 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensity than at the 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity the change in the width depth w d ratio showed a large instability in two rainfall events but the final values under both rainfall intensities approached approximately 2 at the 60 mm h 1 intensity the w d ratio increased to a peak value and then decreased rapidly during the rill development stage then it showed a rapid increase during the ephemeral gully development stage at approximately 90 mins of the experiment and finally stabilized with fluctuations until the end of rainfall at 90 mm h 1 intensity the w d ratio increased with fluctuations during both rill development and stabilized rill stages then fluctuated during the ephemeral gully development stage and finally stabilized in the final stage 3 4 hydraulic parameters both the flow power and friction coefficient changed with rainfall duration in power functions at different erosion stages of two rainfall events fig 6 at 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity hydraulic parameters showed a certain discontinuity in the rainfall subevent than at 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensity which could be attributed to the relatively more infiltration at light rainfall intensity the flow power showed greater continuity at 90 mm h 1 than at 60 mm h 1 and the slope of the fitting functions gradually tended to be steady under both rainfall intensities the values of the friction coefficient were generally lower during heavy rainfall intensity than during light rainfall intensity at the 90 mm h 1 event the friction coefficient was large at the first and second stages and then remained steady at a high level however during the 60 mm h 1 event the friction coefficient only increased to a peak value rapidly at the third stage and then decreased slowly towards a stable state after 240 mins of the fourth stage 3 5 particle size distribution psd the mean particle size distributions of the sediment samples in the whole rainfall period are shown in fig 7 there was a similar trend after the runs at the two rainfall intensities compared with the primary psd of the original soil the percentages of effective and ultimate particles of different sizes were lower except for the 0 02 0 05 mm fraction which could be attributed to the high transportation percentage of this fraction in the effective and ultimate psds the fractions of 0 02 0 05 mm and 0 002 mm accounted for maximum approximately 40 and minimum approximately 10 proportions of the total psd respectively however there were more fine particles in the ultimate psd than in the effective psd and the coarse particles had the opposite trend the e u ratios of the 0 002 mm and 0 002 0 02 mm fractions were smaller than 1 the 0 02 0 05 mm fraction was close to 1 and the greater than 0 05 mm fraction was larger than 1 fig 8 additionally the e u ratios of all fractions gradually approached 1 at rainfall intensities of 90 mm h 1 and 60 mm h 1 4 discussion 4 1 successive hillslope erosion processes the successive erosion processes layer by layer along the vertical profile were monitored by using rees as tracers in our study which provided quantitative information on the dynamic variations in different erosion sources this is different from other studies that focused on subprocesses including head cutting advance bed incision and sidewall expansion bennett et al 2000 bingner et al 2016 huo et al 2011 mancilla et al 2005 qin et al 2018 in the interrill stage sediment from the eu layer was eroded quickly which could be attributed to the increasing flow power fig 6 due to the formation of crust and concomitant reduction in the infiltration rate bodnár and hulshof 2006 the sediment contribution of the eu layer rapidly decreased while the channel rapidly developed govers and poesen 1998 reported that the relative importance of interrill erosion decreased with time zhang et al 2018b stated that energy used for soil detachment would not be available for sediment transport under finite flow energy conditions in addition it is important to note that interrill erosion is defined as erosion from the top layer meyer et al 1975 song et al 2003 wang et al 2020 and if all of the existing top layers were eroded then interrill erosion would occur on the next layer however in this study the top layer remained until rainfall ended fig 9 furthermore the channel width always lower than 80 cm also indicated the presence of an initial interrill layer fig 5 therefore it was inferred with confidence that the requirement of the initial interrill layer described the experimental design would always exist during rainfall in the rill development stage the development of rills could be directly associated with the increasing concentrated flow that appeared from the yb layer poesen et al 2003 this resulted in rapid incision of the rill bed and led to an obvious increase in sediment yield from the yb tb ho and sm layers qin et al 2017 wells et al 2010 in the stabilized rill stage the sediment yield from the yb to sm layers remained unchanged additionally the ephemeral gully development stage appeared and the initial ephemeral gully took place from the ce layer fluctuations in sediment yield from the flume could be attributed to the episodic collapse of channel banks and the blocking of channel beds which was the path of concentrated flow lentz et al 1993 finally the stabilized ephemeral gully stage arose with prominent sediment yield below the ce layer 4 2 evolution of channel morphological features many literatures indicated that the channel width was larger than depth in field casalí et al 2006 nachtergaele et al 2001 wells et al 2016 suggested that the channel was incised by 0 046 m and widened by 0 077 m during study at the north mississippi branch meanwhile the mean width of both the catchments and the ephemeral gullies was 2 2 6 times than mean depth in sicily italy ollobarren et al 2016 in northwest china zhang et al 2007 found that the gullies had large width depth ratio therefore it was reasonable to believe that the channel width developed faster than the depth fig 5 the larger flow power of 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensified the channel morphology evolution in the early stage fig 6 at the ephemeral gully development stage incision and expansion of the channel further increased with the accumulated deeper and faster concentrated flow than that in rills which improved the total sediment transport efficiency casalí et al 2009 li et al 2016 mancilla et al 2005 additionally due to the limitation of a less erodible layer with a larger bulk density and the blocking of channel beds by collapsing clods the channel bank expanded rapidly bingner et al 2016 qin et al 2018 wells et al 2013 which resulted in the channel width developing faster than depth at stage iv fig 5 for the stabilized ephemeral gully stage the friction coefficient remained steady fig 6 and the w d ratio likewise reached a stable value approaching approximately 2 yang et al 1981 reported that the minimum energy dissipation rate produced a constant width depth ratio of 2 and the channels may have ultimately become stable the narrow and deep channel would likely collapse on erodible banks while the wide and shallow channel may experience localized flow concentration with associated bed erosion and narrowing 4 3 particle size distribution selective sediment transportation could be described by different particle size distributions before and after rainfall fig 7 young 1980 suggested that the erosion process is selective with particles in the silt size range being eroded more easily than clay or sand size particles wang and shi 2015 indicated that the particles accounting for the dominant percentage in the original soil may also be abundant in sediments if the erosive forces were large enough additionally under the impacts of raindrops and flow scouring some fine particles could stick to each other and large clods could be collapsed and dispersed this revealed the reason for the difference between the effective and ultimate psds shi et al 2017 the e u ratio was helpful for understanding the mechanisms of sediment detachment and transportation processes during rainfall events at the initial stage due to the impacts of raindrops and surface flow many fine particles and unstable aggregates were transported which caused a great difference between the effective and ultimate particles zhang et al 2018b when rills developed the surface flow concentrated into channels forming more efficient and higher energy flows that could transport an increasing number of aggregates jiang et al 2018 then the fine particle selectivity of rill erosion decreased compared with interrill erosion shi et al 2012b additionally compared with the 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity the rapid increase in flow power resulted in more primary particles being transported e u ratios close to 1 at the 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensity at the ephemeral gully erosion stage more sidewall collapsing occurred with a higher w d ratio than at the rill erosion stage the large clods in the channel led to a higher friction coefficient and lower disintegration and transport of aggregates fig 6 finally the e u ratios gradually approached 1 shi et al 2012a suggested that large sized particles are increasingly important in sediment transport after channel development on hillslopes additionally the gradual weakening of selective erosion processes implied that the changes in particle size distribution might be an important basis for analysing ratios of transportation and deposition in different erosion types bingner et al 2015 5 conclusions this study showed the potential feasibility of using ten kinds of ree tracers to quantify the different stages to reveal the importance of monitoring successive erosional processes from the interrill to rill to ephemeral gully stages and to distinguish the contribution of each erosion type the results provided detailed data on changes in sediment load channel morphology hydraulic parameters and particle size distribution during channel evolution and successive erosion patterns that was expected to improve the accuracy of estimation on hillslope erosion processes by adjusting the algorithms related to peak discharge and total runoff volume of each time step in annagnps model in the future the various conditions will be considered in the experimental design i e multiple slopes inflow area and soil texture to obtain more detailed information on the successive erosion processes and a wider flume with upslope inflow will be used to simulate some field gullies more similarly in particular the hydrological processes and sediment concentrations at different development stages and locations of ephemeral gullies will be examined to further clarify the driving force mechanisms credit authorship contribution statement hongqiang shi

2989,understanding hillslope erosion processes is important for the development of physically based erosion prediction models however quantitative information about the successive development of interrill rill ephemeral gully erosion on hillslopes is still rare in this study rare earth elements rees were employed as tracers to monitor the successive development of different erosion processes on a hillslope ten different ree oxides were individually mixed with cultivated loessial soil from farmland on the loess plateau of china the ten tagged soils were packed in ten layers into a flume 5 m in length 1 m in width and 0 7 m in depth with a 20 gradient simulated rainfall events with natural rainstorm intensities of 60 and 90 mm h 1 were conducted and each rainfall intensity event contained three subevents that lasted for 135 mm rainfall depth for each subevent the runoff and sediments for each test were collected at the outlet of the flume at 4 5 minute and 3 minute intervals respectively the flow velocity flow depth and width and depth of the main channel were also synchronously measured the results showed that the hillslope erosion went through five evolutionary stages interrill erosion rill development stabilized rill ephemeral gully development and stabilized ephemeral gully these stages were quantitatively identified according to the changing contribution rates of the interrill rill and ephemeral gully areas the channel width always developed faster than the depth at both the 60 mm h 1 and 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the hydrological parameters could greatly explain the channel evolution and particle size changes a larger flow power of 90 mm h 1 intensified the channel morphology evolution in the early development stage the friction coefficient finally remained steady and the w d ratio eventually approached a stable value of approximately 2 in the stabilized ephemeral gully stage selective erosion occurred in the transportation processes were gradually weakened due to rapid increase of flow power and the overall detachment of the large clods in the channel as manifested by particle size distribution in sediments approaching primary

land degradation and grain reduction problems globally wu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 understanding erosion processes on hillslopes involving interrill or sheets rill and ephemeral gully erosion is essential for the development of physically based erosion prediction models gordon et al 2007 jetten et al 2003 porto et al 2014 poesen 2018 taguas et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 interrill erosion generally occurs from the upper 1 cm of soil caused by two subprocesses of detachment and transport by raindrop splash and sheet flow greenwood 2012 liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2018a 2019a the inhomogeneous properties of surface soil and raindrop hitting lead to the appearance of small pits and then accumulated runoff induces the development of rills rills consist of the development of numerous closely spaced channels by concentrated flow whose width and depth are usually smaller than 20 cm and 30 cm respectively kinnell 2001 foster 1986 qin et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 when rills develop due to the increase in concentrated flow depth velocity and shear stress compared with interrill erosion the sediment yield can be significantly increased liu et al 2011 rill morphology determines where flow accumulates and scours and it also contributes to the uncertainty and complexity of subprocesses of rill development bingner et al 2016 wang 1998 divided rill development into four stages i downwards incision and horizontal development along the moist periphery of rill ii local erosion from a very steep slope of rill iii collapses of rill walls and iv lateral migrations of rill qin et al 2018 suggested that the subprocesses of rill development include head cutting advance bed incision and sidewall expansion which subprocesses occur consecutively or concurrently and interact with each other bennett et al 2000 bingner et al 2016 mancilla et al 2005 nafchi et al 2021 huo et al 2011 indicated that the development processes of rills can be summarized as five stages knickpoints head cut extension intermittent rill continuous rill and rill networks adequate data have led to the development of a solid foundation to study interrill rill processes and their mechanism in detail in addition to interrills and rills ephemeral gullies are important sediment sources on hillslopes casalí et al 1999 poesen et al 2003 zhang et al 2007 moges and holden 2008 liu et al 2021 ephemeral gullies are defined as successive channels of various sizes formed by concentrated flow that can be easily destroyed by normal tillage and can be reformed again in the same location by additional runoff events capra et al 2009 oostwoud wijdenes et al 2000 soil science society of america 2008 which are larger than rills but smaller than permanent gullies poesen et al 2003 2010 the depth of ephemeral gullies generally varies between 20 cm but occasionally exceeds 50 cm gong et al 2011 zheng et al 2017 liu et al 2021 the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service reported that ephemeral gullies typically contributed 30 to 100 of the total soil loss in actively eroding areas in the u s bennett et al 2000 usda 2010 on the loess plateau of china it accounts for 30 to 90 of the total soil loss cheng et al 2007 zheng et al 2017 the ephemeral gully erosion process was divided into early middle and late stages zhu 1956 casalí et al 2000 identified ephemeral gully erosion processes as the formation and migration of headcuts erosion and deposition in the channel bed and channel bank erosion and sloughing by measuring gully morphology dong et al 2015 estimated the eroded soil volume by using sediment concentration to determine the development of ephemeral gullies in a series of flume experiments up to date research on ephemeral gully erosion is still limited due to its complex processes and the limitations of research methods in addition previous studies mainly focused on individual or partially continuous processes for interrill rill or gully erosion separately liu et al 2021 the successive erosion processes and sediment contributions of interrills rills and ephemeral gullies to slope erosion have never been monitored and distinguished quantitatively the sediment tracking technique which employs existing properties of soil or deliberately adds artificial substances to soil as tracers showed its potential to study soil erosion quantitatively zhang et al 2018b radionuclides such as berylium 7 burch et al 1988 yang et al 2013 caesium 137 walling and quine 1991 lu and higgitt 2000 and lead 210 he and walling 1996 walling et al 2003 are good tracers for estimating spatial soil erosion rate distributions and soil erosion processes a single tracer agent is useful for estimating spatial soil erosion rates and patterns but fails to provide insights into multiple sediment sources in soil erosion processes guzmán et al 2013 zhang 2015 zhang et al 2019b rare earth elements rees which are the 15 elements of the lanthanide series yttrium and scandium with similar chemical and physical properties are widely used to trace soil erosion processes and distinguish sediment sources as artificial substances deliberately added to soil liu et al 2004 liu et al 2016a 2016b xiao et al 2017a zhang et al 2018b the aims of this study were to i partition the contributions of interrill rill and ephemeral gully erosion during simulated rainstorms under hillslope conditions ii describe the changes in hydrological parameters channel morphological features and sediment particle size distributions during different stages of gully development and iii assess the potential of applying rees as tracers to monitor the development of ephemeral gullies 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and ree oxide powders test soil was collected from the upper 20 cm layer of cultivated land in ansai county 36 30 37 19 n 108 05 109 26 e shaanxi province the soil particle composition was 9 1 clay 0 002 mm 17 3 silt 0 002 0 02 mm and 73 6 sand 0 02 2 mm while the soil organic matter content was 0 77 g kg 1 and the ph was 7 95 the soil texture was sandy loam classified using an international soil taxonomy classification encyclopedia of chinese agriculture 1996 the soil was air dried and passed through a 5 mm sieve to facilitate the removal of gravels plant roots and other debris ten different kinds of ree oxide powders eu2o3 yb2o3 tb4o7 sm2o3 ho2o3 ceo2 la2o3 nd2o3 dy2o3 and tm2o3 were prepared for this experiment based on their cost amount to be applied and susceptibility to detection liu et al 2016a the physical and chemical properties of the selected ree oxide powders are shown in table 1 to ensure that a small quantity of rees could be tightly and evenly bound to the soil each tracer was initially uniformly mixed with a small amount of soil sample and then more soil was added and mixed this step was repeated several times to obtain the predetermined ree concentrations 2 2 experimental setup the rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in the artificial rainfall simulation hall of the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau in yangling shannxi province a down sprinkler rainfall simulator system to simulate raindrops was employed fig 1 a this system consisted of 56 groups of nozzles arranged in a parallelogram with 2 4 m spacing each group was composed of three nozzles with diameters of 0 25 in 0 5 in and 0 75 in forming an equilateral triangle with 12 cm on each side the rainfall simulator system could be set to any rainfall intensity ranging from 30 to 350 mm h 1 by adjusting the nozzle aperture size and water pressure and a falling height 18 m above the ground ensured that the majority of raindrops attained terminal velocity the rainfall coverage area was 27 m by 18 m with a more than 80 distribution uniformity of rainfall he et al 2014 shen et al 2015 a slope adjustable metal flume 5 m in length 1 m in width and 0 7 m in depth with drainage holes 2 cm aperture at the bottom was used in this study the slope gradient of the flume ranged from 0 to 35 with 1 increments a collecting device was installed on the flume outlet to collect the runoff and sediment samples fig 1b 2 3 experimental design according to the instantaneous rainfall intensity standard of erosive rainfall i10 1 055 mm min 1 and i5 1 520 mm min 1 approximately 51 1 mm h 1 and 91 2 mm h 1 respectively on the loess plateau zhou and wang 1987 two typical rainfall intensities of rainstorms were designed 60 mm h 1 and 90 mm h 1 ephemeral gullies are widely distributed on hillslopes with slope gradients from 15 to 35 on the loess plateau thus a moderate slope of 20 was designed cheng et al 2007 additionally to simulate successive development processes of soil erosion interrill to rill to ephemeral gully three subevents with an interval of 24 h i e 1st to 3rd rainfall subevent were designed under each rainfall intensity a total rainfall of 135 mm was maintained for each subevent and rainfall durations were 135 min for 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and 90 min for 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensity 2 4 soil bed preparation according to the critical depth of interrill rill and ephemeral gully the topsoil layer 0 to 1 cm depth was considered to be the source of interrill erosion the layer at 2 to 20 cm depth contributed to rill erosion and the layer at 20 to 50 cm depth contributed to ephemeral gully erosion the ree tagged soils were packed into the flume layer by layer fig 2 soil packing was carried out layer by layer to achieve the desired uniform mean bulk density to simulate the appearance of plough pans the bulk densities in the upper 20 cm and underneath 30 cm were adjusted to 1 05 and 1 35 g cm 3 respectively the bottom of the flume bed was perforated and covered with a 20 cm thick sand layer to facilitate the free drainage of percolating soil water during packing the soil was gradually wetted using a sprayer to saturation to maintain consistent soil moisture on the soil surface finally the filled flume was covered by a plastic sheet and then left for 24 h without disturbance to enhance the binding of the rees with the soil particles 2 5 experimental procedure prior to the experiment rainfall intensity was calibrated to reach designed rainfall intensity with uniformity greater than 90 next the plastic sheet was removed to carry out the rainfall experiment once runoff occurred runoff and sediments were collected at the outlet of the flume using plastic containers with intervals of 4 5 min and 3 min for 60 mm h 1 and 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensities respectively additionally the flow velocity was recorded by the dyeing method with potassium permanganate and the flow depth was measured using a steel ruler when erosion channels formed the width and depth of the main channel were also measured using tape at intervals 0 5 m synchronously at the end of each subevent the flume was covered with a plastic sheet to minimize water evaporation and left undisturbed for 24 h until the next rainfall subevent then the volume of water in each container was measured and the sediments were air dried and weighed the rainfall experiment was repeated three times 2 6 laboratory analyses the soil organic matter content was determined by the potassium dichromate oxidation external heating method liu 1996 and the ph was measured by a rex electric chemical phs 3e precision acidity meter shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd china rees in the soil and sediment were extracted according to the following steps liu et al 2016a i sediments were crushed and sieved to obtain a 50 g air dried sample through a 0 15 mm sieve ii a 25 mg subsample was placed into a 50 ml cylindrical flask iii 0 5 ml of hno3 68 by weight and 1 ml hf 48 by weight were added to the flask and sealed iv the flask was heated to 185 c in an oven for 24 h v after cooling to room temperature the open flask was heated at 130 c on a hot plate until nearly dry vi 1 ml of hno3 was added and then heated again repeating step v until nearly dry vii steps i iv v and vi were repeated viii 5 ml of hno3 was added followed by heating of the sealed flask at 130 c in an oven for 3 h ix the flask was cooled and the remaining suspension was transferred to a 50 ml volumetric flask and enough deionized water 18 mω cm 1 was added to make up the volume to 50 ml and x the suspension was mixed and then transferred to a 10 ml polyethylene centrifuge tube and centrifuged to obtain clear extracts two replicates were made for each sediment sample inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry x series 2 icp ms thermo fisher scientific usa was used to analyse the ree concentration each sample was diluted as needed a stock internal standard solution containing rhodium rh and rhenium re 10 μg l 1 was added to each sample and three separate measurements were made for each sample the particle size distributions psds of the sediment samples were measured using a malvern mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction device malvern instruments ltd uk the primary psd of soil the initial undispersed psd with aggregates and soil particles before rainfall was compared with the effective psd and ultimate psd of sediments martínez mena et al 2002 wang and shi 2015 the sediment samples used for effective psd were undispersed after rainfall and contained aggregates the samples for ultimate psd were dispersed after rainfall which were pretreated with hydrogen peroxide to remove organic matter and chemically dispersed using sodium hexametaphosphate prior to analysis the difference between the effective and ultimate psds demonstrated that the sediments were composed of primary and aggregate particles the proportions of the effective and ultimate particle sizes e u ratios could indicate how the different fractions were eroded and transported by the flow 2 7 data analyses according to zhang et al 2017 the mass of soil loss from layer j j 1 2 3 10 in the flume was calculated by using eq 1 1 w j r j b j η c j w where wj is the mass of sediments in layer j kg rj is the actual measured concentration of rees in layer j of the sediment samples mg kg 1 bj is the background concentration of rees in layer j mg kg 1 w is the mass of the sediment samples kg cj is the applied concentration of rees in layer j mg kg 1 and η is an enrichment factor for fine particles which is defined as a dimensionless ratio of the percentage finer in the sediment to that in the original soil the contribution of each section rj and the error σ were calculated by using eqs 2 and 3 2 r j w j 1 n w j 100 3 σ 1 1 n w j w 100 flow power and friction coefficient were optimal hydraulic parameter for describing soil detachment and could be used to better explain the channel evolution and particle size changes during the channel development liu et al 2010 2019 xiao et al 2017b therefore soil detachment was described by shear stress τ n m 2 and flow power ω n m 1 s 1 xiao et al 2017b 4 τ ρ g r s 5 ω τ v where ρ is the liquid density kg m 3 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 r is the hydraulic radius m s is the effective hillslope gradient sin slope angle and v is the flow velocity after amendment m s 1 the friction coefficient f was calculated using the approach reported in liu et al 2019 6 f 8 g r s v 2 3 results 3 1 sediment yield the sediment yielded from different tracer layers is shown in fig 3 at two rainfall intensities 60 and 90 mm h 1 the top six and seven layers were eroded in the first 135 and 90 min and the lower four and three layers were eroded during the second 135 and 90 min respectively the soil erosion generated layer by layer indicated that the rill or ephemeral gully channel bed baseline gradually incised more deeply into the soil profile and the incision speed was faster for the higher rainfall intensity 90 mm h 1 during the three rainfall subevents the rainfall intensity affected the changing trend of sediment mass from different tracer layers for the first subevent the erosion of the top six layers increased with fluctuations in the early stage and then remained stable at the final stage for the 60 mm h 1 rainfall on the other hand the sediment yield of the top seven layers always showed a continuous increasing trend for the 90 mm h 1 rainfall the sediment yield from each layer was markedly enhanced at two rainfall intensities during the second subevent for the third subevent the sediment mass of the majority of layers increased at 60 mm h 1 rainfall but remained stable at 90 mm h 1 rainfall it should be pointed out that the densities of the broken line in the three rainfall subevents varied which could be explained by the extent of channel development compared with the total sediment yield the relative errors of the sediment yield calculated by using rees as tracers were 15 for all rainfall events table 2 3 2 contribution rate fig 4 shows the changing contribution rates of interrill rill and ephemeral gully erosion to the total sediment yield during successive rainfall events which were similar at the two rainfall intensities at 60 mm h 1 and 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the contribution rate of interrill erosion drastically decreased in the first 45 mins and 30 mins respectively and then gradually declined to nearly zero in 45 270 mins and 30 90 mins respectively the rill erosion quickly increased and slowly decreased to a stable state with some variabilities at approximately 90 mins and 72 mins respectively ephemeral gully erosion occurred at approximately 72 mins and 30 mins at rainfall intensities of 60 and 90 mm h 1 respectively then the ephemeral gully erosion increased sharply and its contribution rate exceeded that of rill erosion according to the above changing sediment contribution rate there were grounds to identify the five stages of hillslope erosion as interrill erosion rill development stabilized rill ephemeral gully development and stabilized ephemeral gully the contribution rate of interrill erosion to total erosion was larger than 20 and an inflection point appeared here the contribution rate of rill erosion appeared and rapidly developed close to 70 which was defined as the rill development stage then the contribution rate decreased slowly and tended to stabilize which was named the stabilized rill stage the development of the ephemeral gully was similar to that of the rill stage and the overlap of the two stages emphasized that the ephemeral gully development stage and stabilized rill stage were concomitant the stabilized ephemeral gully stage was identified when the contribution rate of ephemeral gully erosion exceeded that of the rill stage at 60 mm h 1 rainfall the ephemeral gully development stage still showed a continuous occurrence until the end of the rainfall event and the stabilized ephemeral gully stage did not appear 3 3 development of channel width and depth changes in the main channel width and depth are shown in fig 5 the channel width increased more rapidly than the channel depth and was greater at the 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensity than at the 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity the change in the width depth w d ratio showed a large instability in two rainfall events but the final values under both rainfall intensities approached approximately 2 at the 60 mm h 1 intensity the w d ratio increased to a peak value and then decreased rapidly during the rill development stage then it showed a rapid increase during the ephemeral gully development stage at approximately 90 mins of the experiment and finally stabilized with fluctuations until the end of rainfall at 90 mm h 1 intensity the w d ratio increased with fluctuations during both rill development and stabilized rill stages then fluctuated during the ephemeral gully development stage and finally stabilized in the final stage 3 4 hydraulic parameters both the flow power and friction coefficient changed with rainfall duration in power functions at different erosion stages of two rainfall events fig 6 at 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity hydraulic parameters showed a certain discontinuity in the rainfall subevent than at 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensity which could be attributed to the relatively more infiltration at light rainfall intensity the flow power showed greater continuity at 90 mm h 1 than at 60 mm h 1 and the slope of the fitting functions gradually tended to be steady under both rainfall intensities the values of the friction coefficient were generally lower during heavy rainfall intensity than during light rainfall intensity at the 90 mm h 1 event the friction coefficient was large at the first and second stages and then remained steady at a high level however during the 60 mm h 1 event the friction coefficient only increased to a peak value rapidly at the third stage and then decreased slowly towards a stable state after 240 mins of the fourth stage 3 5 particle size distribution psd the mean particle size distributions of the sediment samples in the whole rainfall period are shown in fig 7 there was a similar trend after the runs at the two rainfall intensities compared with the primary psd of the original soil the percentages of effective and ultimate particles of different sizes were lower except for the 0 02 0 05 mm fraction which could be attributed to the high transportation percentage of this fraction in the effective and ultimate psds the fractions of 0 02 0 05 mm and 0 002 mm accounted for maximum approximately 40 and minimum approximately 10 proportions of the total psd respectively however there were more fine particles in the ultimate psd than in the effective psd and the coarse particles had the opposite trend the e u ratios of the 0 002 mm and 0 002 0 02 mm fractions were smaller than 1 the 0 02 0 05 mm fraction was close to 1 and the greater than 0 05 mm fraction was larger than 1 fig 8 additionally the e u ratios of all fractions gradually approached 1 at rainfall intensities of 90 mm h 1 and 60 mm h 1 4 discussion 4 1 successive hillslope erosion processes the successive erosion processes layer by layer along the vertical profile were monitored by using rees as tracers in our study which provided quantitative information on the dynamic variations in different erosion sources this is different from other studies that focused on subprocesses including head cutting advance bed incision and sidewall expansion bennett et al 2000 bingner et al 2016 huo et al 2011 mancilla et al 2005 qin et al 2018 in the interrill stage sediment from the eu layer was eroded quickly which could be attributed to the increasing flow power fig 6 due to the formation of crust and concomitant reduction in the infiltration rate bodnár and hulshof 2006 the sediment contribution of the eu layer rapidly decreased while the channel rapidly developed govers and poesen 1998 reported that the relative importance of interrill erosion decreased with time zhang et al 2018b stated that energy used for soil detachment would not be available for sediment transport under finite flow energy conditions in addition it is important to note that interrill erosion is defined as erosion from the top layer meyer et al 1975 song et al 2003 wang et al 2020 and if all of the existing top layers were eroded then interrill erosion would occur on the next layer however in this study the top layer remained until rainfall ended fig 9 furthermore the channel width always lower than 80 cm also indicated the presence of an initial interrill layer fig 5 therefore it was inferred with confidence that the requirement of the initial interrill layer described the experimental design would always exist during rainfall in the rill development stage the development of rills could be directly associated with the increasing concentrated flow that appeared from the yb layer poesen et al 2003 this resulted in rapid incision of the rill bed and led to an obvious increase in sediment yield from the yb tb ho and sm layers qin et al 2017 wells et al 2010 in the stabilized rill stage the sediment yield from the yb to sm layers remained unchanged additionally the ephemeral gully development stage appeared and the initial ephemeral gully took place from the ce layer fluctuations in sediment yield from the flume could be attributed to the episodic collapse of channel banks and the blocking of channel beds which was the path of concentrated flow lentz et al 1993 finally the stabilized ephemeral gully stage arose with prominent sediment yield below the ce layer 4 2 evolution of channel morphological features many literatures indicated that the channel width was larger than depth in field casalí et al 2006 nachtergaele et al 2001 wells et al 2016 suggested that the channel was incised by 0 046 m and widened by 0 077 m during study at the north mississippi branch meanwhile the mean width of both the catchments and the ephemeral gullies was 2 2 6 times than mean depth in sicily italy ollobarren et al 2016 in northwest china zhang et al 2007 found that the gullies had large width depth ratio therefore it was reasonable to believe that the channel width developed faster than the depth fig 5 the larger flow power of 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensified the channel morphology evolution in the early stage fig 6 at the ephemeral gully development stage incision and expansion of the channel further increased with the accumulated deeper and faster concentrated flow than that in rills which improved the total sediment transport efficiency casalí et al 2009 li et al 2016 mancilla et al 2005 additionally due to the limitation of a less erodible layer with a larger bulk density and the blocking of channel beds by collapsing clods the channel bank expanded rapidly bingner et al 2016 qin et al 2018 wells et al 2013 which resulted in the channel width developing faster than depth at stage iv fig 5 for the stabilized ephemeral gully stage the friction coefficient remained steady fig 6 and the w d ratio likewise reached a stable value approaching approximately 2 yang et al 1981 reported that the minimum energy dissipation rate produced a constant width depth ratio of 2 and the channels may have ultimately become stable the narrow and deep channel would likely collapse on erodible banks while the wide and shallow channel may experience localized flow concentration with associated bed erosion and narrowing 4 3 particle size distribution selective sediment transportation could be described by different particle size distributions before and after rainfall fig 7 young 1980 suggested that the erosion process is selective with particles in the silt size range being eroded more easily than clay or sand size particles wang and shi 2015 indicated that the particles accounting for the dominant percentage in the original soil may also be abundant in sediments if the erosive forces were large enough additionally under the impacts of raindrops and flow scouring some fine particles could stick to each other and large clods could be collapsed and dispersed this revealed the reason for the difference between the effective and ultimate psds shi et al 2017 the e u ratio was helpful for understanding the mechanisms of sediment detachment and transportation processes during rainfall events at the initial stage due to the impacts of raindrops and surface flow many fine particles and unstable aggregates were transported which caused a great difference between the effective and ultimate particles zhang et al 2018b when rills developed the surface flow concentrated into channels forming more efficient and higher energy flows that could transport an increasing number of aggregates jiang et al 2018 then the fine particle selectivity of rill erosion decreased compared with interrill erosion shi et al 2012b additionally compared with the 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity the rapid increase in flow power resulted in more primary particles being transported e u ratios close to 1 at the 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensity at the ephemeral gully erosion stage more sidewall collapsing occurred with a higher w d ratio than at the rill erosion stage the large clods in the channel led to a higher friction coefficient and lower disintegration and transport of aggregates fig 6 finally the e u ratios gradually approached 1 shi et al 2012a suggested that large sized particles are increasingly important in sediment transport after channel development on hillslopes additionally the gradual weakening of selective erosion processes implied that the changes in particle size distribution might be an important basis for analysing ratios of transportation and deposition in different erosion types bingner et al 2015 5 conclusions this study showed the potential feasibility of using ten kinds of ree tracers to quantify the different stages to reveal the importance of monitoring successive erosional processes from the interrill to rill to ephemeral gully stages and to distinguish the contribution of each erosion type the results provided detailed data on changes in sediment load channel morphology hydraulic parameters and particle size distribution during channel evolution and successive erosion patterns that was expected to improve the accuracy of estimation on hillslope erosion processes by adjusting the algorithms related to peak discharge and total runoff volume of each time step in annagnps model in the future the various conditions will be considered in the experimental design i e multiple slopes inflow area and soil texture to obtain more detailed information on the successive erosion processes and a wider flume with upslope inflow will be used to simulate some field gullies more similarly in particular the hydrological processes and sediment concentrations at different development stages and locations of ephemeral gullies will be examined to further clarify the driving force mechanisms credit authorship contribution statement hongqiang shi
