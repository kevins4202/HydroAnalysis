20140,central asia is characterized by a continental climate and a pronounced inter annual variability of precipitation and discharge in the past hydro climatological droughts led to serious water shortages resulting in crop shortfalls significant economic loss and inter state political tensions robust forecasts of anomalous climatic and hydrological conditions may reduce regional vulnerability to hydro climatic extremes and thus can serve as a scientific basis for national and trans national water management based on a synthesis of international literature and on our decadal long experience in the region we systematically review the scientific progress in seasonal forecasting and evaluate the potential for a scientifically informed water management additionally we discuss to what extent the scientific progress meets the requirements of stakeholders and reveal major obstacles for a sustainable knowledge transfer our review shows that exceptionally skillful discharge forecasts for the agricultural relevant vegetation season can be derived by means of statistical models taking remote sensing based estimations of the snow coverage in the central asian mountain regions as independent covariates the consideration of global climate indices in particular el niño allows to extend the forecast lead times however decision makers are often not aware of the scientific progress and its implications for improved water management despite the continuous international effort with regard to knowledge transfer and capacity development modernization at central asian water management institutions is proceeding slowly a continuous engagement in the field of capacity development and knowledge dissemination at various institutional levels including academia forecast centers and water management institutions appears necessary in order to stimulate a multi disciplinary network and to support a sustainable regional collaboration in the water sector 1 introduction central asia comprising the five former soviet countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan tajikistan turkmenistan and afghanistan fig 1 a is frequently referred to as a prime example of inadequate water management and thus has been in the spotlight of the international water science and management community during recent decades 1 4 the region covers the two endorphic river basins of syrdarya and amudarya draining to the aral sea due to the continental climate central asia is characterized by water scarcity and a pronounced seasonal and inter annual variability of precipitation 5 9 water resources in central asia are mainly formed in the high mountain regions of tien shan pamir and hindukush where cold season nov mar temperatures remain below zero and precipitation sums exceed 500 mm which represents more than 50 of the annual precipitation amount fig 1 b c d in contrast arid to semi arid conditions prevail in the central asian plains throughout the year i e evaporation distinctly exceeds the annual precipitation amounts since winter and spring precipitation falls predominantly as snow and is released to the rivers during summer the mountain regions act as a water storage for the summer months and are often referred to as water towers 10 13 the headwater catchments of the central asian rivers are characterized by a distinct seasonal cycle with discharge maxima during the summer season fig 1e summer runoff is controlled by snow and glacier melt 14 16 which is responsible for up to 50 of the seasonal discharge in glacierized catchments 11 17 a significant contribution of groundwater to summer discharge has also been estimated while the contribution of summer rainfall has been found to be below 20 hill et al 17 show that groundwater recharge is strongly dominated by meltwater resources which underlines the importance of the central asian winter climate for water availability and surface runoff during the subsequent vegetation period the mountainous countries in particular kyrgyzstan and tajikistan are located in the zone of water generation while kazakhstan uzbekistan and turkmenistan rely on water supply from upstream this unique physio geographic and hydrologic setting raises challenges in the field of trans boundary water management and regional political cooperation throughout the region water provides valuable input to households farming and for food security in rural areas in the downstream countries uzbekistan turkmenistan and kazakhstan the cultivation of water demanding crops cotton rice wheat is of great importance for the national economies 18 19 however the upstream countries kyrgyzstan and tajikistan increasingly use the water for hydropower production in winter which leads to reduced water supply during summer season 20 21 plans for an expansion of hydropower production in the head water catchments of amudarya are currently discussed in afghanistan 22 this competitive system is often referred to as water food energy nexus 23 the unbalanced water demand and the inefficient water use form the core of the water problem in central asia 24 the inter annual variability of water availability is challenging and impedes long term planning in regional water management the prolonged drought from 1999 to 2001 as well as the drought event of 2007 2008 had far reaching consequences such as region wide crop failure loss of livestock breakdown of hydropower electricity production and an increase in diseases 5 25 likewise climate induced refugee movements and trans national conflicts on water allocation and management have been reported 5 25 26 with a view to climate change and population growth these water related challenges might exacerbate in future 10 27 during recent years several international projects among others the german water initiative for central asia berlin process have been supporting sustainable water management strategies in central asia and called for an improved trans national cooperation in the water sector the elaboration and implementation of an integrated water resource management plan for central asian catchments i e for the rivers syrdarya and amudarya has been in the focus of the international effort 28 however decision making processes at different levels require robust information on the quantity of available water resources 29 thus the quantification of water resources in the high mountain regions is an important prerequisite for trans national and trans sectoral negotiations on water allocation for instance robust hydro climatological predictions enable an improved management of water reservoirs and can reduce the risk of trans national conflicts furthermore a precise seasonal and sub seasonal forecast of summer water availability is required for the prediction of agricultural yields and in order to adapt the national agricultural strategies to anomalous hydro climatic conditions based on a thorough review of international literature and our experience in the region we summarize the current understanding of hydrological and atmospheric processes resulting in inter annual variations of water availability in central asia we systematically review the recent scientific progress in the field of discharge and precipitation forecasting section 2 and assess the potential of seasonal forecasting applications for a scientifically informed water management section 3 we address the question to what extent the scientific progress meets the requirements of stakeholders and reveal the major obstacles for a sustainable knowledge transfer and a fruitful collaboration between the international scientific community and regional water management institutions section 4 finally we elaborate potential solutions for an improved scientific cooperation in the field of water research and management in central asia 2 scientific progress in seasonal forecasting the regional hydrology of central asia is closely linked to annual cycle of the major atmospheric circulation modes over eurasia which influence the regional climate and interact with the expressed topography central asia is influenced by both temperate and sub tropical circulation regimes however their influence varies throughout the year particularly the prevailing westerly winds have been identified as an important moisture source as they control the tracks of extra tropical disturbances from the atlantic and the mediterranean sea into the continental region of central asia 6 7 30 31 mariotti 8 illustrates that a northward current over the arabian countries transports tropical air masses from the arabian gulf into central asia and represents an important additional moisture source the southern parts of central asia particularly the windward slopes of the karakoram and hindukush mountain ranges receive high amounts of winter precipitation djf which reaches up to 60 of the total annual sum böhner 2006 32 33 during spring the zone of maximum precipitation migrates northward reaches the pamirs in march and continues to tien shan in april may 32 34 during winter and spring season high precipitation amounts result in a substantial accumulation of snow in the mountain regions 9 11 13 in march and april the snowmelt period starts and the stream flow increases instantly fig 1 e during late summer the role of glacier melt increases 11 16 while the amudarya headwater catchment receives a precipitation maximum in winter and spring which leads to a clear temporal separation of the snow accumulation and the peak discharge period the headwater catchment of syrdarya naryn see fig 1a is additionally influenced by summer precipitation based on a conceptual temperature index model armstrong et al 35 quantify the contribution of snow melt for the annual discharge of sydarya and amudarya to 72 and 65 respectively based on remote sensing derived snow cover observations dietz et al 36 and tang et al 37 show that snow cover duration and snow cover area over central asia are subjected to a large seasonal and inter annual variability the variability and change of the snow cover characteristics in the high mountain regions have been shown to directly affect the hydrological regimes of the central asian rivers 16 38 2 1 seasonal discharge forecasts seasonal discharge forecasts for the summer period in central asia are in general rely on the fact that water resources are accumulated during winter season in the high elevations of the tien shan and pamir mountain ranges and are released during the subsequent vegetation period the comparatively small contribution of summer precipitation is generally neglected the concept of a temporal separation of water accumulation and release has already been well acknowledged by soviet water managers in the 1960s when regular field expeditions and helicopter flights were conducted to assess the snow accumulation 39 40 while traditional forecasting techniques were largely based on the subjective evaluation of point scale snow cover information under consideration of lookup tables quantitative models including physically based hydrological models and statistical approaches emerged during recent decades borovikova et al 41 applied the conceptual hydrological model aishf automated information system for hydrological forecasts for the short term and seasonal runoff forecast in the amudarya basin they simulate snow fall as a function of average precipitation and its elevational dependence and assess snow accumulation as the balance between the income and the temperature dependent loss of solid precipitation during the winter season in a forecast mode glacier and snow melt are simulated based on meteorological data from analogue years due to the high data requirements of physically based models the majority of recent studies applies statistical forecasting techniques which are less data demanding these utilize the relationship between winter precipitation temperature or snow accumulation as an indicator of catchment wetness and the mean river discharge during the subsequent summer season traditionally central asian water management institutions rely in their forecasts on hydro meteorological observations from representative monitoring stations however the hydro meteorological network in central asia degraded significantly during the economic crises of the 1990s 42 although the national hydro meteorological services with substantial support by international organizations made progress in re establishing the monitoring network during recent years 43 previous programs by worldbank swiss federal office for foreign economic affairs swiss development cooperation and usaid the analysis of the spatial and temporal climate variability at the regional scale based on station data remains challenging further in situ observations are often not readily exchanged between central asian water management institutions due to regional data protection laws and interstate political tensions which leads to difficulties especially in trans national catchment areas 41 nowadays freely available and spatially complete data sets derived from climate modelling and remote sensing can enable a cross border assessment of water availability for syrdarya 85 of the inter annual variability of summer discharge could be explained by a linear regression taking the catchment average precipitation sum during the preceding december april period as an independent covariate based on era 15 reanalysis schär et al 2004 for amudarya the explained variance amounted to 25 only possibly due to a lower quality of the era 15 precipitation data set over southern central asia a stronger influence of glacier melt or water abstraction for irrigation purposes dirren 44 re evaluate the potential of reanalysis data for seasonal runoff forecasting based on the era 40 reanalysis and found a significantly improved skill for the amudarya basin similarly barlow and tippett 45 investigated the potential the ncep ncar reanalysis to derive skillful runoff forecasts for the summer season seasonal mean discharge time series from 24 gauges in the aral sea basin were related to cold season november march precipitation fields by means of a canonical correlation analysis particularly for gauges in the syrdarya basin an explained variance of 20 to 50 could be attained recently the value of remote sensing based observations of winter precipitation and snow cover for seasonal forecasting applications has been emphasized dixon and wilby 46 demonstrated the skill of trmm precipitation estimates during the cold season october to march to explain 65 of the inter annual discharge variability between 1999 and 2010 by a univariate forecast model the integration of temperature and antecedent discharge further improved the forecasting skill pertzinger et al 47 and baumgartner et al 48 show that noaa avhrr snow cover observations could capture 86 of the seasonal inflow variability into the charvak reservoir in uzbekistan nowadays fully automated tools for image acquisition and processing including cloud removal reached the operational level 49 51 resulting in spatially coherent snow cover information apel et al 52 utilized cloud eliminated snow cover data along with station based observations of precipitation temperature and antecedent discharge in winter and spring to predict mean warm season april september discharge in 13 central asian basins with catchment areas ranging from 240 to 290 000 km2 the predictor set was extended by multi monthly means of the individual predictors as well as composites of the predictors in order to account for non linear statistical relations and predictor interactions the results indicate a high predictive skill of the employed predictors already in january with explained variance of 60 80 for most of the catchments and a continuous improvement of the forecast during the spring season with explained variance of 80 90 in april snow cover related predictors have been shown to be particularly powerful for most catchments recently aiming at a higher temporal resolution of the discharge forecasts e g at monthly scale the potential of elevation restricted snow cover information for sub seasonal forecasting purposes has been evaluated gafurov et al 51 show that snow cover dynamics in different elevation bands serve as skillful predictors for the prediction of mean monthly discharge during the early summer season in late summer when glacier melt dominates the runoff generation the predictive power of snow cover decreases significantly although the availability of remote sensing based observations of precipitation and snow cover is still limited to a short period and some of the employed algorithms might be susceptible to overfitting due to the high number of potential predictor combinations the review emphasizes the added value of modern earth observation techniques in the field of seasonal hydrological forecasting meanwhile new products derived from passive or active microwave remote sensing facilitate an assessment of the snow water equivalent swe at a 25 km horizontal resolution and have been successfully evaluated for the nothern hemisphere 53 54 likewise remote sensing based observations of the gravity field have been shown to be of great potential for the estimation of the natural water storage variability at the regional scale as they represent an expression of the integrated water storage change on and below the earth surface including swe glaciation soil moisture and groundwater 55 56 based on data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace 2002 2017 apel et al 57 show that gravimetric variations during the winter season serve as skillful predictors for warm season discharge predictions in large river basins such as amudarya no significant forecast improvement could be detected at smaller scale fig 2 provides a schematic summary of the major predictor variables and the skill of frequently applied multi linear forecasting techniques for the central asian headwater catchments of amudarya and naryn composite maps fig 2 a b c suggest that vegetation periods with above average streamflow are preceded by higher precipitation sums and temperatures in winter and higher snow coverage in april correlations between the employed predictor variables and april september discharge are consistently positive and mostly significant particularly for the amudarya catchment which is characterized by a clear temporal separation of the high precipitation and the high discharge period see fig 1 82 of the inter annual variance of mean seasonal discharge in the amudarya catchment can be explained by a simple linear regression model taking november march catchment average precipitation sums and temperature means march snow cover fraction and antecedent discharge as independent variables for naryn where summer precipitation constitutes a relevant portion of the annual sum the forecast skill is lower explained variance 0 56 but still highly significant 2 2 seasonal forecast of winter precipitation for the estimation of summer discharge in central asia predictors are required that represent the state of water resources in high elevation headwater catchments however these do not emerge before late spring and thus enable a forecast of summer runoff anomalies only a few months in advance in order to extent the lead time of discharge predictions robust climatic forecasts are required that allow predicting precipitation amounts and snow conditions during the winter season seasonal climate forecasts for the entire globe based on dynamical atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms are operationally provided by few meteorological research centres 58 these models utilize the fundamental fluid dynamic equations and enable the prediction of large scale climate conditions at various temporal scales 59 60 best results of dynamical climate forecasts are usually found in the tropics where large scale wind fields and associated moisture fluxes are strongly influenced by sea surface temperature anomalies 60 62 weisheimer and palmer 63 test the reliability of the ecmwf system4 seasonal forecast ensemble on a coarse global grid and rate the performance from 1 dangerous misleading to 5 perfect their results prove a high skill of the ecmwf model for the forecast of winter precipitation in central asia particularly for the prediction of droughts due to their high computing requirements aogcm based seasonal forecast models are rarely applied in hydro meteorological and environmental offices particularly in developing and transition countries statistical forecasting techniques represent a less computation intensive alternative however they require a profound understanding of hydro climatic variations associated large scale atmospheric processes and their driving mechanisms in order to identify relevant predictor variables previous studies show that both tropical and westerly circulation modes simultaneously influence the central asian climate particularly during the moist winter and spring seasons weather types over central asia have been shown to represent a regional expression and superposition of tropical and extratropical circulation features that propagate into the target domain from western and southern directions respectively 64 schiemann et al 65 and schiemann et al 7 illustrate that hydro climatic conditions over central asia are strongly influenced by the location and strength of the westerly jet stream gerlitz et al 64 show that positive precipitation anomalies over central asia are frequently associated with the formation of a rossby trough which is usually well developed during the simultaneous positive state of the north atlantic oscillation and the east atlantic western russia pattern significant correlations of winter precipitation sums have been detected with well known euro atlantic circulation modes such as the north atlantic arctic oscillation nao ao and the east atlantic ea scandinavian sca polar eurasian pol eur and east atlantic western russia ea wr patterns 6 30 31 66 various studies illustrate that variations of the el niño southern oscillation alter the intensity of tropical moisture fluxes into central and south asia 6 42 44 67 the el niño warm phase is associated with persistent positive pressure anomalies over the western indian ocean resulting in intensified south westerly moisture supply barlow et al 68 argue that especially the sea surface temperature sst of the indopacific warmpool influences the regional circulation and associated precipitation anomalies over south west asia la niña conditions are shown to promote an anticyclonic anomaly over central asia resulting in precipitation suppressing subsidence syed et al 10 and syed et al 30 show that enhanced winter rainfall over afghanistan pakistan tajikistan and uzbekistan is triggered by el niño and intensified westerlies during the positive phase of nao bastos et al 69 conclude that moisture fluxes into central asia are controlled by a combined influence of the nao and the ea pattern as enso is characterized by a low frequency variability and usually shows a seasonally persistent behavior the potential of enso related indices for seasonal winter and spring precipitation forecasts has been emphasized for central asia severe droughts e g 1989 1999 2001 and 2008 have been shown to a at least partially triggered by la niña conditions 5 28 64 68 in general due to the dominant influence of westerly wave tracks their embedded synoptic features and associated moisture fluxes the skill of statistically based seasonal precipitation forecast models is rather low in extratropical regions particularly the prediction of regional wave tracks that determine the strength and position of the jet stream remains a challenge for both dynamical and statistical forecasting approaches gerlitz et al 32 developed a random forest based machine learning algorithm applied to global sst and climate reanalysis fields to forecast precipitation anomalies in central asia at monthly and seasonal scales although the model identified several predictors that are related to the northern hemispheric circulation characteristics the explained variance of the model only slightly exceeds the skill of the enso based forecast hartmann et al 19 hartmann et al 70 kundzewicz et al 61 tested various predictors including tropical and extratropical sst anomalies and pressure modes for their skill in explaining monthly precipitation anomalies in the western chinese tarim basin their results suggest an exceptional skill of sst anomalies in the black sea and pressure anomalies in the core region of the siberian high which might indicate a dynamical modification of the winter circulation over central asia by varying initial and lateral boundary conditions however their validation strategy focusses on monthly precipitation anomalies and the skill drops significantly for the seasonal scale which suggests an overfit of the statistical model due to a shifted seasonal cycle of predictor and predictant variables various studies investigate the predictability of the large scale eurasian winter climate particularly with regard to variations of the arctic north atlantic oscillation ao nao auspicious progress has been made by considering snow cover anomalies in october as a predictor variable for the mean state of the arctic oscillation and associated climate anomalies during subsequent winter 71 72 both observational and modeling studies indicate that enhanced snow cover over eurasia in october increases the surface albedo and triggers an early and strong formation of the siberian high 73 74 the consequential pressure gradient between siberia and the eastern arctic provokes the formation of a persistent wave pattern that propagates into the upper troposphere and results in a weakened stratospheric polar vortex 75 76 a subsequent downward propagation of wave activity triggers the development of a negative nao ao on the contrary reduced snow cover over eurasia provokes a strong zonal and positive nao ao conditions cohen et al 71 illustrate that eurasian snow cover in october serves as a skillful covariate for the prediction of winter temperature for large parts of the northern hemisphere gerlitz et al 6 23 show that the eurasian snow cover extent in october influences the regional circulation over central asia during winter season due to cascading processes at different spatial scales at a regional scale the positive state of ao nao during winter season favors the formation of a stationary rossby trough over central asia which is associated with a southward shift of the westerly jet stream and strongly positive precipitation anomalies while the negative ao state favors dry conditions finally the quasi biennial oscillation qbo a dominant and well predictable mode of variability in the tropical stratosphere has been identified as a potential predictor for the winter state of ao nao 65 77 78 observations show that the positive phase of qbo is associated with a stronger and zonal oriented polar vortex which favors the development of a positive ao negative correlations between the qbo index and sea level pressure during winter have been detected for large parts of eurasia including central asia 77 recently gerlitz et al 6 analyzed the predictive potential of various covariates including indo pacific sst anomalies eurasian snow cover indices and northern hemispheric circulation modes in october for forecasting cold season nov mar precipitation anomalies in central asian sub regions by means of a multi variate linear regression approach moderate forecast skills could be achieved for two sub regions covering uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and southern kazakhstan region 1 and iran afghanistan tajikistan and northern pakistan region 2 for the period 1979 to 2017 while enso has been identified as the predominant predictor for both regions the eurasian snow cover extent in october and the scandinavian pattern have been shown to improve the forecasting skill for region 1 for region 2 the scandinavian pattern and the quasi biennial oscillation have been identified as skillful predictor variables the results are exemplarily presented in fig 3 composite maps of ssts fig 3 a indicate a strong forcing of precipitation anomalies by variations of the el niño southern oscillation for both regions which is also manifested in highly significant correlations r 0 4 fig 3 c between the regional average standardized precipitation index spi guttman 18 and the enso4 index further positive precipitation anomalies are preceded by pressure anomalies that resemble the scandinavian pattern bueh and nakamura 79 show that sca is characterized by a stationary behavior and a frequent reestablishment which leads to a modification of northern hemispheric temperature and precipitation patterns at the seasonal scale gastineau et al 80 and bueh and nakamura 79 further illustrate that snow cover variations over eurasia are driven by sca and its downstream wave tracks to a large extent a statistically significant influence of siberian snow cover on regional precipitation anomalies has been detected for region 1 only although the results of the statistical model do not allow forecasting precipitation anomalies with high accuracy and large prediction intervals reflect the high uncertainty of climate predictions they distinctly exceed the climatological forecast i e the assumption of the climatological mean particularly drought events e g in 1999 2001 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 are well reproduced by the statistical model see fig 3 f which implies its potential for early warning applications based on the summarized studies we propose a two tier forecasting approach at central asian water management institutions that includes a seasonal climate outlook and a hydrological prediction schematically presented in fig 4 based on the state of enso eurasian snow cover sca and qbo a preliminary forecast of cold season precipitation anomalies and the associated accumulation of snow in central asian high mountain regions appears feasible by october although the forecast is subjected to large uncertainties and robust predictions are only achieved at the regional scale it enables a first assessment of the hydrological drought risk in the following vegetation period in march april when the snow accumulation period ends statistically based discharge forecasting approaches using remote sensing observations of snow cover and climate reanalysis appear to be highly suitable for practical applications 3 application of seasonal forecasting for water management in central asia the rural economies of central asia are vulnerable to hydrological extremes particularly to summer droughts but also to floods mudflows and landslides during the snow melt season 81 82 this vulnerability has been recognized already during the soviet past and substantial effort had been made to promote scientifically informed decision making in the water sector regular snow monitoring campaigns were already undertaken in the late 1960s 39 40 in the 1980s when frequent droughts significantly affected the agricultural productivity and thus the regional economy semi quantitative seasonal forecasts of water availability were operationally provided by the central asian hydromet service in tashkent 83 these forecasts were based on analogue years and look up tables and at that time met modern scientific standards the centralized political system of the former soviet union allowed to easily integrate forecast information into regional water management strategies the soviet ministry of water resources in moscow in cooperation with regional water management authorities in central asian republics defined the monthly release quotas from larger reservoirs and adjusted the agricultural strategies based on the expected discharge of amudarya and syrdarya 83 while the upstream republics kyrgyzstan and tajikistan were forced to ensure the water provision for agricultural production in the arid lowlands kazakhstan uzbekistan and turkmenistan delivered fossil resources especially coal and gas and secured the energy supply in the mountainous regions 21 84 85 after the independence of the central asian republics and the associated transition towards market oriented economies conflicting interests in the field of water management emerged nowadays the catchments of the major central asian rivers are trans national and cover diverse economic and social settings which leads to a significant increase of the number of stakeholders in the water sector the consequential challenges to trans national and cross sectoral cooperation have been widely debated in literature 12 21 84 85 and are discussed by sehring 85 in this special issue the application of scientifically informed decision making has become much more complex under the altered political and economic conditions the national hydro meteorological service centers established after independence are responsible for the systematic survey and the provision of hydrological and climatic information their official tasks comprise the maintenance of the national hydro meteorological monitoring networks the preparation of short term weather forecasts and the elaboration of seasonal hydrological forecasts for the vegetation period 37 86 in the framework of the regional research network central asian water www cawa project net the seasonal forecasting techniques and strategies at the five national hydro meteorological services were surveyed and their requirements were evaluated in 2014 while the national forecasting experts were not aware of the opportunities of seasonal climate predictions under consideration of global teleconnections seasonal discharge forecasts were considered as priority tasks seasonal forecasts of summer discharge are operationally conducted in january and adjusted at a monthly scale final forecasts of water availability are provided at the end of march i e just before the start of the vegetation season 52 the survey revealed that the forecasting departments rely on outdated infrastructure and techniques and suffer from the degradation of the hydro meteorological monitoring network during the economic crises of the 1990 s although a modernization is in progress at all national centers the relevant hydro meteorological observations are frequently available in paper format only 29 87 and seasonal forecasts are often based on analogue methods such as look up tables scatter plots and snowmelt runoff modelling fed by scarce observations an urgent need for an improvement of the forecast accuracy and an extension of lead times has been emphasized by the regional experts however the capacity of regional universities and research institutions in the field of model development and applied statistics is fairly limited resulting in a reluctance of methodological innovation and a lack of ambitious visions 37 87 in general the national services lack of a systematic framework for the generation storage and provision of data 29 87 which impedes the exchange of information and the implementation of modern forecasting approaches seasonal discharge predictions are communicated to national water management authorities only for instance in uzbekistan discharge estimations are used by the ministry of agriculture in order to adjust the national cultivation strategies likewise the uzbek ministry of emergency situations requested snow cover maps in the past and estimated the risk of floods landslides and avalanches based on the provided information personal communication with baumgartner mfb geoconsulting gmbh world bank project saving the aral sea sub project improvement of the infrastructure at the hydro meteorological services in central asia 1996 2005 to date seasonal forecasts are not provided to the media or published online to the author s knowledge non governmental stakeholders such as water reservoir managers farmers or private companies do not have direct access to hydrologically relevant data and information although trans national organizations which are responsible for the negotiation of water allocation quotas in particular the interstate commission for water coordination in central asia icwc and the water basin organizations of syrdarya and amudarya wbo have access to seasonal discharge predictions their decision making processes remain intransparent and most likely do not sufficiently incorporate seasonal forecasts remarkably predictable water shortages have led to breaches of bilateral water allocation treaties in the past e g during the la nina year 2008 resulting in political tensions that could have been potentially avoided under consideration of hydro climatological information 88 83 success stories from various regions 47 89 93 highlight that progress in the field of scientifically informed water and climate impact management requires the establishment of an interdisciplinary and trans sectoral stakeholder network including scientists forecasting experts political decision makers and affected stakeholders such knowledge systems represent an important prerequisite for a sustainable cooperation since they allow a continuous evaluation of the actual user demands and a corresponding adjustment of forecasting techniques and communication strategies particularly the development of secondary user tailored products e g targeting at agricultural yield estimations or hazard and risk assessments has been shown to significantly increase the societal benefit of seasonal forecasting applications however stakeholder networks require a robust institutional basis including boundary organizations that connect experts practitioners and decision makers although the trans national structure in particularly the icwc and its advisory board the scientific information center sic appear suitable for strengthening the connection between science and political action the institutional mandates and responsibilities are only vaguely defined 21 94 the institutional ambiguities at both local and regional scales and the underdeveloped information channels make it difficult for the hydro meteorological centers to introduce their forecasts to a broader circle of users and thus to further contribute to sustainable water management overall the outreach of the seasonal discharge forecasts remains far below its potential especially in the field of trans national and trans sectoral water management urgent improvements are required with regard to the applied forecasting techniques and the underlying data particularly in view of global warming which will likely enhance the risk of hydro meteorological extreme events in central asia the hydro meteorological centers will have to respond quickly to changing user needs therefore scientifically and technically well trained and self reliant employees are needed who are not yet sufficiently available to the national services 4 linking science and action opportunities and obstacles for knowledge dissemination and capacity development during the last three decades various projects all aiming at a sustainable and scientifically sound development of water management strategies in central asia have been implemented by international organizations 11 however only some of them excelled through a long term commitment several international activities explicitly accentuated the potential of seasonal forecasting applications and early warning for instance the world bank initiated the aral sea basin program which targeted at a scientifically robust basis for trans national water management in central asia already in 1992 95 96 in cooperation with the swiss aral sea project 1996 2005 the potential of earth observation technologies for the forecast of water resources has been analyzed and regular trainings have been provided 48 97 the utilization of modern geo information techniques has been established at all five central asian hydromet services personal communication with baumgartner since 2011 the world bank in cooperation with un agencies and the world meteorological organization has been supporting the national hydro meteorological services in the framework of the central asia hydrometeorology modernization project cahmp targeting at an improvement of monitoring infrastructure and early warning capacities 98 the german federal foreign office has been supporting a collaboration of the german and the central asian scientific community since 2008 the regional research network central asian water cawa has been led by the gfz german centre for geosciences and since 2014 particularly focused on developing hydro climatic forecasting techniques and encouraging their use in the field of regional water management fully automated tools for the remote sensing based monitoring of snow cover the forecast of summer discharge and the prediction of winter precipitation have been developed partially in cooperation with regional experts and provided to the respective departments 23 51 52 various on the job trainings have been provided to forecasting experts at the national hydro meteorological services the trainings were designed as regional workshops with participants from all central asian services and thus additionally served as a trans national networking platform aiming at a strengthened regional cohesion while some progress has been made e g the snow cover monitoring tool modsnow is nowadays in operational use at all five services and an exchange of hydro meteorological data appears to be possible under certain circumstances the modernization process remains slow and is characterized by setbacks despite the decadal long international engagement in the field of technical cooperation the use of modern data sets and advanced statistical techniques is not yet integrated in the institutional workflows in a sustainable manner this clearly indicates that successful capacity development requires a long term commitment and continuous coordinated effort however the institutional structures and the insufficient technical education of the regional experts represent further obstacles in general technical trainings address individual employees however high skilled experts frequently leave the hydro meteorological services after short time due to hierarchical institutional structures low salaries and unclear promotion perspectives 29 87 others are promoted to higher positions with larger administrative but limited technical responsibility this brain drain effect makes regional capacity development a bottomless pit and calls for the establishment of transparent career pathways and mechanisms that support an internal knowledge transfer and a sustainable institutional learning the same applies in principle to stakeholder organizations in the fields of integrated water resource management agricultural planning or risk assessment institutions at national and trans national levels are frequently not aware of the opportunities and societal benefits of seasonal hydro meteorological forecasts and multi disciplinary or cross sectoral networks are not yet well established thus a better communication of the climate related vulnerability and the skill of modern forecasting techniques appears overdue in this regard science can contribute by developing user specific forecasting products that do not only include rather abstract hydro climatic parameters but directly address the associated risk e g the mismatch in the spatial scales between regional precipitation predictions and the planning horizons of water managers usually at catchment scale leads to challenges in promoting the utilization of forecasting results 99 user tailored forecasts that directly relate expected precipitation anomalies to the likelihood of crop shortfalls and the associated financial risk will certainly better meet the user requirements in any case it is strongly recommended to strengthen the regional stakeholder networks in the water sector possibly under direction of the national hydro meteorological services in order to stimulate the demand for hydro meteorological information and thus to improve the outreach of seasonal climatic and hydrological predictions besides of its direct benefits for scientifically based water management an increasing demand for hydro climatological information may additionally encourage a structural change at the national hydro meteorological services while modernization so far has been mainly driven by technological developments an increase and diversification of user requirements will likely stimulate leadership visions and may contribute to the development of the national centers towards client oriented hydro meteorological services it should be noted however that a sustainable change of institutional structures cannot be achieved by science alone but requires a long term collaboration with international and regional organizations in the field of policy advice and international cooperation it also calls for openness and readiness for transformation at the political level and respective governmental bodies finally in order to archive a long term improvement of the capacity of young professionals a stronger integration of modern methodological and scientific competencies e g remote sensing statistics programming into the water and climate related curricula at the local universities is urgently needed our experience has shown that a sustainable transfer of scientific knowledge into decision making processes requires the involvement of the young generation that will shape the future practice in the field of water management recently e g the german kazakh university gku established a course program on integrated water resource management that although so far with international support offers regular courses in the field of statistics geo information techniques and hydrological modelling a long term involvement of the international scientific community appears necessary to ensure a sustainable transfer of general scientific competences and cutting edge technologies to support their application in the field of water management in central asia 5 summary and discussion all five central asian countries face water related challenges that directly or indirectly effect the regional economic development the political stability and the ecological balance robust seasonal forecasts and quantitative estimates of the available water resources in general have the potential to improve the regional water management especially in transboundary catchments during recent decades accurate techniques for the seasonal prediction of regional climatic conditions and water availability have been developed and their potential for scientifically informed decision making in the water sector has been demonstrated particularly the forecast of discharge anomalies during the vegetation season based on the wintertime accumulation of snow in the high mountain regions has been shown to be exceptionally skillful nowadays remote sensing derived data sets offer opportunities for an improved assessment of water resources and thus for the operational implementation of hydrological forecasting routines in trans national catchments likewise due to the predominant influence of enso the central asian winter climate has been shown to be predictable to some extent although seasonal climate predictions are subjected to large uncertainties they enable an assessment of the hydrological drought risk during the vegetation season already in preceding autumn and thus facilitate long term planning in agriculture and trans national water management in summary the well acknowledged vulnerability of the regional economies to water shortages in combination with the scientific progress in the field of seasonal forecasting clearly suggests a stronger integration of hydro climatic information into decision making processes at both local and trans national levels however despite the scientific progress and the continuous international effort with regard to knowledge transfer and regional capacity development central asian water management institutes still rely on outdated forecasting techniques and modernization is proceeding slowly to date the national hydro meteorological services do not fully meet the requirements of potential user groups and the dissemination of their seasonal forecasts is rather limited although the technical cooperation between the international scientific community and the national hydro meteorological services in central asia has been successfully established during the last decades the newly acquired knowledge is not yet sustainably incorporated into institutional workflows particularly institutional structures often impede sustainable institutional learning and knowledge anchoring over longer times furthermore decision makers in the field of water management e g reservoir managers farmers water basin organizations at local or trans national scales are frequently not aware of the scientific progress and its implication for an improvement of water management thus the demand for robust hydrological and climatic predictions is limited and the integration of modern scientific knowledge into water policy and decision making remains challenging while academic studies on the use of seasonal forecasts for informed decision making in the water sector are rare a significant number of scholars examined the role of scientific information for the implementation of an integrated water resource management 12 84 100 and evaluated the success of international capacity development campaigns dedabaev 2016 most studies indicate that limited institutional reforms hinder the development of a sustainable water management especially since the prevailing state centric top down management systems contradict local ownership and responsibility at the local scale 84 91 100 dadabaev 72 emphasizes the importance of regional trust and openness with regard to data and knowledge exchange for the successful adoption of iwrm and demonstrate that international efforts are currently restricted to individual capacity development at the local or national scale just like in the field of seasonal forecasting data scarcity capacity deficits and inefficient governance structures including limited institutional funding and insufficient transboundary cooperation have been stressed as major challenges for the implementation of irwm in central asia 22 91 101 against this background a continuous and coordinated effort in the field of capacity development and knowledge dissemination at various institutional levels appears necessary to communicate potential of seasonal forecasts for an improved water management we highly recommend to involve young academics technical experts at the national hydro meteorological services as well as an expanded circle of stakeholders and user groups in order to stimulate a multi disciplinary network and to support a sustainable regional collaboration in the water sector such effort cannot be achieved by the science alone but requires a long term collaboration with international think tanks and global policy organizations currently a fresh political wind is blowing in central asia and regional collaboration has been recognized as an important basis for sustainable economic development particularly uzbekistan is promoting a stronger regional integration and recently suggested the establishment of an international innovation center for the aral sea basin targeting at sustainable water governance and societal stability through innovative research and technology 56 kyrgyzstan is currently establishing a national water information system allowing access to water related data and information including seasonal discharge forecasts and water allocation at the local scale 102 technical and scientific innovation in water management is more and more recognized as a joint central asian challenge and has the potential to stimulate the regional political integration the continuation of the international scientific effort in the field of seasonal forecasting and knowledge dissemination can certainly strengthen this process credit authorship contribution statement lars gerlitz conceptualization data curation formal analysis methodology

20140,central asia is characterized by a continental climate and a pronounced inter annual variability of precipitation and discharge in the past hydro climatological droughts led to serious water shortages resulting in crop shortfalls significant economic loss and inter state political tensions robust forecasts of anomalous climatic and hydrological conditions may reduce regional vulnerability to hydro climatic extremes and thus can serve as a scientific basis for national and trans national water management based on a synthesis of international literature and on our decadal long experience in the region we systematically review the scientific progress in seasonal forecasting and evaluate the potential for a scientifically informed water management additionally we discuss to what extent the scientific progress meets the requirements of stakeholders and reveal major obstacles for a sustainable knowledge transfer our review shows that exceptionally skillful discharge forecasts for the agricultural relevant vegetation season can be derived by means of statistical models taking remote sensing based estimations of the snow coverage in the central asian mountain regions as independent covariates the consideration of global climate indices in particular el niño allows to extend the forecast lead times however decision makers are often not aware of the scientific progress and its implications for improved water management despite the continuous international effort with regard to knowledge transfer and capacity development modernization at central asian water management institutions is proceeding slowly a continuous engagement in the field of capacity development and knowledge dissemination at various institutional levels including academia forecast centers and water management institutions appears necessary in order to stimulate a multi disciplinary network and to support a sustainable regional collaboration in the water sector 1 introduction central asia comprising the five former soviet countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan tajikistan turkmenistan and afghanistan fig 1 a is frequently referred to as a prime example of inadequate water management and thus has been in the spotlight of the international water science and management community during recent decades 1 4 the region covers the two endorphic river basins of syrdarya and amudarya draining to the aral sea due to the continental climate central asia is characterized by water scarcity and a pronounced seasonal and inter annual variability of precipitation 5 9 water resources in central asia are mainly formed in the high mountain regions of tien shan pamir and hindukush where cold season nov mar temperatures remain below zero and precipitation sums exceed 500 mm which represents more than 50 of the annual precipitation amount fig 1 b c d in contrast arid to semi arid conditions prevail in the central asian plains throughout the year i e evaporation distinctly exceeds the annual precipitation amounts since winter and spring precipitation falls predominantly as snow and is released to the rivers during summer the mountain regions act as a water storage for the summer months and are often referred to as water towers 10 13 the headwater catchments of the central asian rivers are characterized by a distinct seasonal cycle with discharge maxima during the summer season fig 1e summer runoff is controlled by snow and glacier melt 14 16 which is responsible for up to 50 of the seasonal discharge in glacierized catchments 11 17 a significant contribution of groundwater to summer discharge has also been estimated while the contribution of summer rainfall has been found to be below 20 hill et al 17 show that groundwater recharge is strongly dominated by meltwater resources which underlines the importance of the central asian winter climate for water availability and surface runoff during the subsequent vegetation period the mountainous countries in particular kyrgyzstan and tajikistan are located in the zone of water generation while kazakhstan uzbekistan and turkmenistan rely on water supply from upstream this unique physio geographic and hydrologic setting raises challenges in the field of trans boundary water management and regional political cooperation throughout the region water provides valuable input to households farming and for food security in rural areas in the downstream countries uzbekistan turkmenistan and kazakhstan the cultivation of water demanding crops cotton rice wheat is of great importance for the national economies 18 19 however the upstream countries kyrgyzstan and tajikistan increasingly use the water for hydropower production in winter which leads to reduced water supply during summer season 20 21 plans for an expansion of hydropower production in the head water catchments of amudarya are currently discussed in afghanistan 22 this competitive system is often referred to as water food energy nexus 23 the unbalanced water demand and the inefficient water use form the core of the water problem in central asia 24 the inter annual variability of water availability is challenging and impedes long term planning in regional water management the prolonged drought from 1999 to 2001 as well as the drought event of 2007 2008 had far reaching consequences such as region wide crop failure loss of livestock breakdown of hydropower electricity production and an increase in diseases 5 25 likewise climate induced refugee movements and trans national conflicts on water allocation and management have been reported 5 25 26 with a view to climate change and population growth these water related challenges might exacerbate in future 10 27 during recent years several international projects among others the german water initiative for central asia berlin process have been supporting sustainable water management strategies in central asia and called for an improved trans national cooperation in the water sector the elaboration and implementation of an integrated water resource management plan for central asian catchments i e for the rivers syrdarya and amudarya has been in the focus of the international effort 28 however decision making processes at different levels require robust information on the quantity of available water resources 29 thus the quantification of water resources in the high mountain regions is an important prerequisite for trans national and trans sectoral negotiations on water allocation for instance robust hydro climatological predictions enable an improved management of water reservoirs and can reduce the risk of trans national conflicts furthermore a precise seasonal and sub seasonal forecast of summer water availability is required for the prediction of agricultural yields and in order to adapt the national agricultural strategies to anomalous hydro climatic conditions based on a thorough review of international literature and our experience in the region we summarize the current understanding of hydrological and atmospheric processes resulting in inter annual variations of water availability in central asia we systematically review the recent scientific progress in the field of discharge and precipitation forecasting section 2 and assess the potential of seasonal forecasting applications for a scientifically informed water management section 3 we address the question to what extent the scientific progress meets the requirements of stakeholders and reveal the major obstacles for a sustainable knowledge transfer and a fruitful collaboration between the international scientific community and regional water management institutions section 4 finally we elaborate potential solutions for an improved scientific cooperation in the field of water research and management in central asia 2 scientific progress in seasonal forecasting the regional hydrology of central asia is closely linked to annual cycle of the major atmospheric circulation modes over eurasia which influence the regional climate and interact with the expressed topography central asia is influenced by both temperate and sub tropical circulation regimes however their influence varies throughout the year particularly the prevailing westerly winds have been identified as an important moisture source as they control the tracks of extra tropical disturbances from the atlantic and the mediterranean sea into the continental region of central asia 6 7 30 31 mariotti 8 illustrates that a northward current over the arabian countries transports tropical air masses from the arabian gulf into central asia and represents an important additional moisture source the southern parts of central asia particularly the windward slopes of the karakoram and hindukush mountain ranges receive high amounts of winter precipitation djf which reaches up to 60 of the total annual sum böhner 2006 32 33 during spring the zone of maximum precipitation migrates northward reaches the pamirs in march and continues to tien shan in april may 32 34 during winter and spring season high precipitation amounts result in a substantial accumulation of snow in the mountain regions 9 11 13 in march and april the snowmelt period starts and the stream flow increases instantly fig 1 e during late summer the role of glacier melt increases 11 16 while the amudarya headwater catchment receives a precipitation maximum in winter and spring which leads to a clear temporal separation of the snow accumulation and the peak discharge period the headwater catchment of syrdarya naryn see fig 1a is additionally influenced by summer precipitation based on a conceptual temperature index model armstrong et al 35 quantify the contribution of snow melt for the annual discharge of sydarya and amudarya to 72 and 65 respectively based on remote sensing derived snow cover observations dietz et al 36 and tang et al 37 show that snow cover duration and snow cover area over central asia are subjected to a large seasonal and inter annual variability the variability and change of the snow cover characteristics in the high mountain regions have been shown to directly affect the hydrological regimes of the central asian rivers 16 38 2 1 seasonal discharge forecasts seasonal discharge forecasts for the summer period in central asia are in general rely on the fact that water resources are accumulated during winter season in the high elevations of the tien shan and pamir mountain ranges and are released during the subsequent vegetation period the comparatively small contribution of summer precipitation is generally neglected the concept of a temporal separation of water accumulation and release has already been well acknowledged by soviet water managers in the 1960s when regular field expeditions and helicopter flights were conducted to assess the snow accumulation 39 40 while traditional forecasting techniques were largely based on the subjective evaluation of point scale snow cover information under consideration of lookup tables quantitative models including physically based hydrological models and statistical approaches emerged during recent decades borovikova et al 41 applied the conceptual hydrological model aishf automated information system for hydrological forecasts for the short term and seasonal runoff forecast in the amudarya basin they simulate snow fall as a function of average precipitation and its elevational dependence and assess snow accumulation as the balance between the income and the temperature dependent loss of solid precipitation during the winter season in a forecast mode glacier and snow melt are simulated based on meteorological data from analogue years due to the high data requirements of physically based models the majority of recent studies applies statistical forecasting techniques which are less data demanding these utilize the relationship between winter precipitation temperature or snow accumulation as an indicator of catchment wetness and the mean river discharge during the subsequent summer season traditionally central asian water management institutions rely in their forecasts on hydro meteorological observations from representative monitoring stations however the hydro meteorological network in central asia degraded significantly during the economic crises of the 1990s 42 although the national hydro meteorological services with substantial support by international organizations made progress in re establishing the monitoring network during recent years 43 previous programs by worldbank swiss federal office for foreign economic affairs swiss development cooperation and usaid the analysis of the spatial and temporal climate variability at the regional scale based on station data remains challenging further in situ observations are often not readily exchanged between central asian water management institutions due to regional data protection laws and interstate political tensions which leads to difficulties especially in trans national catchment areas 41 nowadays freely available and spatially complete data sets derived from climate modelling and remote sensing can enable a cross border assessment of water availability for syrdarya 85 of the inter annual variability of summer discharge could be explained by a linear regression taking the catchment average precipitation sum during the preceding december april period as an independent covariate based on era 15 reanalysis schär et al 2004 for amudarya the explained variance amounted to 25 only possibly due to a lower quality of the era 15 precipitation data set over southern central asia a stronger influence of glacier melt or water abstraction for irrigation purposes dirren 44 re evaluate the potential of reanalysis data for seasonal runoff forecasting based on the era 40 reanalysis and found a significantly improved skill for the amudarya basin similarly barlow and tippett 45 investigated the potential the ncep ncar reanalysis to derive skillful runoff forecasts for the summer season seasonal mean discharge time series from 24 gauges in the aral sea basin were related to cold season november march precipitation fields by means of a canonical correlation analysis particularly for gauges in the syrdarya basin an explained variance of 20 to 50 could be attained recently the value of remote sensing based observations of winter precipitation and snow cover for seasonal forecasting applications has been emphasized dixon and wilby 46 demonstrated the skill of trmm precipitation estimates during the cold season october to march to explain 65 of the inter annual discharge variability between 1999 and 2010 by a univariate forecast model the integration of temperature and antecedent discharge further improved the forecasting skill pertzinger et al 47 and baumgartner et al 48 show that noaa avhrr snow cover observations could capture 86 of the seasonal inflow variability into the charvak reservoir in uzbekistan nowadays fully automated tools for image acquisition and processing including cloud removal reached the operational level 49 51 resulting in spatially coherent snow cover information apel et al 52 utilized cloud eliminated snow cover data along with station based observations of precipitation temperature and antecedent discharge in winter and spring to predict mean warm season april september discharge in 13 central asian basins with catchment areas ranging from 240 to 290 000 km2 the predictor set was extended by multi monthly means of the individual predictors as well as composites of the predictors in order to account for non linear statistical relations and predictor interactions the results indicate a high predictive skill of the employed predictors already in january with explained variance of 60 80 for most of the catchments and a continuous improvement of the forecast during the spring season with explained variance of 80 90 in april snow cover related predictors have been shown to be particularly powerful for most catchments recently aiming at a higher temporal resolution of the discharge forecasts e g at monthly scale the potential of elevation restricted snow cover information for sub seasonal forecasting purposes has been evaluated gafurov et al 51 show that snow cover dynamics in different elevation bands serve as skillful predictors for the prediction of mean monthly discharge during the early summer season in late summer when glacier melt dominates the runoff generation the predictive power of snow cover decreases significantly although the availability of remote sensing based observations of precipitation and snow cover is still limited to a short period and some of the employed algorithms might be susceptible to overfitting due to the high number of potential predictor combinations the review emphasizes the added value of modern earth observation techniques in the field of seasonal hydrological forecasting meanwhile new products derived from passive or active microwave remote sensing facilitate an assessment of the snow water equivalent swe at a 25 km horizontal resolution and have been successfully evaluated for the nothern hemisphere 53 54 likewise remote sensing based observations of the gravity field have been shown to be of great potential for the estimation of the natural water storage variability at the regional scale as they represent an expression of the integrated water storage change on and below the earth surface including swe glaciation soil moisture and groundwater 55 56 based on data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace 2002 2017 apel et al 57 show that gravimetric variations during the winter season serve as skillful predictors for warm season discharge predictions in large river basins such as amudarya no significant forecast improvement could be detected at smaller scale fig 2 provides a schematic summary of the major predictor variables and the skill of frequently applied multi linear forecasting techniques for the central asian headwater catchments of amudarya and naryn composite maps fig 2 a b c suggest that vegetation periods with above average streamflow are preceded by higher precipitation sums and temperatures in winter and higher snow coverage in april correlations between the employed predictor variables and april september discharge are consistently positive and mostly significant particularly for the amudarya catchment which is characterized by a clear temporal separation of the high precipitation and the high discharge period see fig 1 82 of the inter annual variance of mean seasonal discharge in the amudarya catchment can be explained by a simple linear regression model taking november march catchment average precipitation sums and temperature means march snow cover fraction and antecedent discharge as independent variables for naryn where summer precipitation constitutes a relevant portion of the annual sum the forecast skill is lower explained variance 0 56 but still highly significant 2 2 seasonal forecast of winter precipitation for the estimation of summer discharge in central asia predictors are required that represent the state of water resources in high elevation headwater catchments however these do not emerge before late spring and thus enable a forecast of summer runoff anomalies only a few months in advance in order to extent the lead time of discharge predictions robust climatic forecasts are required that allow predicting precipitation amounts and snow conditions during the winter season seasonal climate forecasts for the entire globe based on dynamical atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms are operationally provided by few meteorological research centres 58 these models utilize the fundamental fluid dynamic equations and enable the prediction of large scale climate conditions at various temporal scales 59 60 best results of dynamical climate forecasts are usually found in the tropics where large scale wind fields and associated moisture fluxes are strongly influenced by sea surface temperature anomalies 60 62 weisheimer and palmer 63 test the reliability of the ecmwf system4 seasonal forecast ensemble on a coarse global grid and rate the performance from 1 dangerous misleading to 5 perfect their results prove a high skill of the ecmwf model for the forecast of winter precipitation in central asia particularly for the prediction of droughts due to their high computing requirements aogcm based seasonal forecast models are rarely applied in hydro meteorological and environmental offices particularly in developing and transition countries statistical forecasting techniques represent a less computation intensive alternative however they require a profound understanding of hydro climatic variations associated large scale atmospheric processes and their driving mechanisms in order to identify relevant predictor variables previous studies show that both tropical and westerly circulation modes simultaneously influence the central asian climate particularly during the moist winter and spring seasons weather types over central asia have been shown to represent a regional expression and superposition of tropical and extratropical circulation features that propagate into the target domain from western and southern directions respectively 64 schiemann et al 65 and schiemann et al 7 illustrate that hydro climatic conditions over central asia are strongly influenced by the location and strength of the westerly jet stream gerlitz et al 64 show that positive precipitation anomalies over central asia are frequently associated with the formation of a rossby trough which is usually well developed during the simultaneous positive state of the north atlantic oscillation and the east atlantic western russia pattern significant correlations of winter precipitation sums have been detected with well known euro atlantic circulation modes such as the north atlantic arctic oscillation nao ao and the east atlantic ea scandinavian sca polar eurasian pol eur and east atlantic western russia ea wr patterns 6 30 31 66 various studies illustrate that variations of the el niño southern oscillation alter the intensity of tropical moisture fluxes into central and south asia 6 42 44 67 the el niño warm phase is associated with persistent positive pressure anomalies over the western indian ocean resulting in intensified south westerly moisture supply barlow et al 68 argue that especially the sea surface temperature sst of the indopacific warmpool influences the regional circulation and associated precipitation anomalies over south west asia la niña conditions are shown to promote an anticyclonic anomaly over central asia resulting in precipitation suppressing subsidence syed et al 10 and syed et al 30 show that enhanced winter rainfall over afghanistan pakistan tajikistan and uzbekistan is triggered by el niño and intensified westerlies during the positive phase of nao bastos et al 69 conclude that moisture fluxes into central asia are controlled by a combined influence of the nao and the ea pattern as enso is characterized by a low frequency variability and usually shows a seasonally persistent behavior the potential of enso related indices for seasonal winter and spring precipitation forecasts has been emphasized for central asia severe droughts e g 1989 1999 2001 and 2008 have been shown to a at least partially triggered by la niña conditions 5 28 64 68 in general due to the dominant influence of westerly wave tracks their embedded synoptic features and associated moisture fluxes the skill of statistically based seasonal precipitation forecast models is rather low in extratropical regions particularly the prediction of regional wave tracks that determine the strength and position of the jet stream remains a challenge for both dynamical and statistical forecasting approaches gerlitz et al 32 developed a random forest based machine learning algorithm applied to global sst and climate reanalysis fields to forecast precipitation anomalies in central asia at monthly and seasonal scales although the model identified several predictors that are related to the northern hemispheric circulation characteristics the explained variance of the model only slightly exceeds the skill of the enso based forecast hartmann et al 19 hartmann et al 70 kundzewicz et al 61 tested various predictors including tropical and extratropical sst anomalies and pressure modes for their skill in explaining monthly precipitation anomalies in the western chinese tarim basin their results suggest an exceptional skill of sst anomalies in the black sea and pressure anomalies in the core region of the siberian high which might indicate a dynamical modification of the winter circulation over central asia by varying initial and lateral boundary conditions however their validation strategy focusses on monthly precipitation anomalies and the skill drops significantly for the seasonal scale which suggests an overfit of the statistical model due to a shifted seasonal cycle of predictor and predictant variables various studies investigate the predictability of the large scale eurasian winter climate particularly with regard to variations of the arctic north atlantic oscillation ao nao auspicious progress has been made by considering snow cover anomalies in october as a predictor variable for the mean state of the arctic oscillation and associated climate anomalies during subsequent winter 71 72 both observational and modeling studies indicate that enhanced snow cover over eurasia in october increases the surface albedo and triggers an early and strong formation of the siberian high 73 74 the consequential pressure gradient between siberia and the eastern arctic provokes the formation of a persistent wave pattern that propagates into the upper troposphere and results in a weakened stratospheric polar vortex 75 76 a subsequent downward propagation of wave activity triggers the development of a negative nao ao on the contrary reduced snow cover over eurasia provokes a strong zonal and positive nao ao conditions cohen et al 71 illustrate that eurasian snow cover in october serves as a skillful covariate for the prediction of winter temperature for large parts of the northern hemisphere gerlitz et al 6 23 show that the eurasian snow cover extent in october influences the regional circulation over central asia during winter season due to cascading processes at different spatial scales at a regional scale the positive state of ao nao during winter season favors the formation of a stationary rossby trough over central asia which is associated with a southward shift of the westerly jet stream and strongly positive precipitation anomalies while the negative ao state favors dry conditions finally the quasi biennial oscillation qbo a dominant and well predictable mode of variability in the tropical stratosphere has been identified as a potential predictor for the winter state of ao nao 65 77 78 observations show that the positive phase of qbo is associated with a stronger and zonal oriented polar vortex which favors the development of a positive ao negative correlations between the qbo index and sea level pressure during winter have been detected for large parts of eurasia including central asia 77 recently gerlitz et al 6 analyzed the predictive potential of various covariates including indo pacific sst anomalies eurasian snow cover indices and northern hemispheric circulation modes in october for forecasting cold season nov mar precipitation anomalies in central asian sub regions by means of a multi variate linear regression approach moderate forecast skills could be achieved for two sub regions covering uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and southern kazakhstan region 1 and iran afghanistan tajikistan and northern pakistan region 2 for the period 1979 to 2017 while enso has been identified as the predominant predictor for both regions the eurasian snow cover extent in october and the scandinavian pattern have been shown to improve the forecasting skill for region 1 for region 2 the scandinavian pattern and the quasi biennial oscillation have been identified as skillful predictor variables the results are exemplarily presented in fig 3 composite maps of ssts fig 3 a indicate a strong forcing of precipitation anomalies by variations of the el niño southern oscillation for both regions which is also manifested in highly significant correlations r 0 4 fig 3 c between the regional average standardized precipitation index spi guttman 18 and the enso4 index further positive precipitation anomalies are preceded by pressure anomalies that resemble the scandinavian pattern bueh and nakamura 79 show that sca is characterized by a stationary behavior and a frequent reestablishment which leads to a modification of northern hemispheric temperature and precipitation patterns at the seasonal scale gastineau et al 80 and bueh and nakamura 79 further illustrate that snow cover variations over eurasia are driven by sca and its downstream wave tracks to a large extent a statistically significant influence of siberian snow cover on regional precipitation anomalies has been detected for region 1 only although the results of the statistical model do not allow forecasting precipitation anomalies with high accuracy and large prediction intervals reflect the high uncertainty of climate predictions they distinctly exceed the climatological forecast i e the assumption of the climatological mean particularly drought events e g in 1999 2001 2007 2008 and 2011 2012 are well reproduced by the statistical model see fig 3 f which implies its potential for early warning applications based on the summarized studies we propose a two tier forecasting approach at central asian water management institutions that includes a seasonal climate outlook and a hydrological prediction schematically presented in fig 4 based on the state of enso eurasian snow cover sca and qbo a preliminary forecast of cold season precipitation anomalies and the associated accumulation of snow in central asian high mountain regions appears feasible by october although the forecast is subjected to large uncertainties and robust predictions are only achieved at the regional scale it enables a first assessment of the hydrological drought risk in the following vegetation period in march april when the snow accumulation period ends statistically based discharge forecasting approaches using remote sensing observations of snow cover and climate reanalysis appear to be highly suitable for practical applications 3 application of seasonal forecasting for water management in central asia the rural economies of central asia are vulnerable to hydrological extremes particularly to summer droughts but also to floods mudflows and landslides during the snow melt season 81 82 this vulnerability has been recognized already during the soviet past and substantial effort had been made to promote scientifically informed decision making in the water sector regular snow monitoring campaigns were already undertaken in the late 1960s 39 40 in the 1980s when frequent droughts significantly affected the agricultural productivity and thus the regional economy semi quantitative seasonal forecasts of water availability were operationally provided by the central asian hydromet service in tashkent 83 these forecasts were based on analogue years and look up tables and at that time met modern scientific standards the centralized political system of the former soviet union allowed to easily integrate forecast information into regional water management strategies the soviet ministry of water resources in moscow in cooperation with regional water management authorities in central asian republics defined the monthly release quotas from larger reservoirs and adjusted the agricultural strategies based on the expected discharge of amudarya and syrdarya 83 while the upstream republics kyrgyzstan and tajikistan were forced to ensure the water provision for agricultural production in the arid lowlands kazakhstan uzbekistan and turkmenistan delivered fossil resources especially coal and gas and secured the energy supply in the mountainous regions 21 84 85 after the independence of the central asian republics and the associated transition towards market oriented economies conflicting interests in the field of water management emerged nowadays the catchments of the major central asian rivers are trans national and cover diverse economic and social settings which leads to a significant increase of the number of stakeholders in the water sector the consequential challenges to trans national and cross sectoral cooperation have been widely debated in literature 12 21 84 85 and are discussed by sehring 85 in this special issue the application of scientifically informed decision making has become much more complex under the altered political and economic conditions the national hydro meteorological service centers established after independence are responsible for the systematic survey and the provision of hydrological and climatic information their official tasks comprise the maintenance of the national hydro meteorological monitoring networks the preparation of short term weather forecasts and the elaboration of seasonal hydrological forecasts for the vegetation period 37 86 in the framework of the regional research network central asian water www cawa project net the seasonal forecasting techniques and strategies at the five national hydro meteorological services were surveyed and their requirements were evaluated in 2014 while the national forecasting experts were not aware of the opportunities of seasonal climate predictions under consideration of global teleconnections seasonal discharge forecasts were considered as priority tasks seasonal forecasts of summer discharge are operationally conducted in january and adjusted at a monthly scale final forecasts of water availability are provided at the end of march i e just before the start of the vegetation season 52 the survey revealed that the forecasting departments rely on outdated infrastructure and techniques and suffer from the degradation of the hydro meteorological monitoring network during the economic crises of the 1990 s although a modernization is in progress at all national centers the relevant hydro meteorological observations are frequently available in paper format only 29 87 and seasonal forecasts are often based on analogue methods such as look up tables scatter plots and snowmelt runoff modelling fed by scarce observations an urgent need for an improvement of the forecast accuracy and an extension of lead times has been emphasized by the regional experts however the capacity of regional universities and research institutions in the field of model development and applied statistics is fairly limited resulting in a reluctance of methodological innovation and a lack of ambitious visions 37 87 in general the national services lack of a systematic framework for the generation storage and provision of data 29 87 which impedes the exchange of information and the implementation of modern forecasting approaches seasonal discharge predictions are communicated to national water management authorities only for instance in uzbekistan discharge estimations are used by the ministry of agriculture in order to adjust the national cultivation strategies likewise the uzbek ministry of emergency situations requested snow cover maps in the past and estimated the risk of floods landslides and avalanches based on the provided information personal communication with baumgartner mfb geoconsulting gmbh world bank project saving the aral sea sub project improvement of the infrastructure at the hydro meteorological services in central asia 1996 2005 to date seasonal forecasts are not provided to the media or published online to the author s knowledge non governmental stakeholders such as water reservoir managers farmers or private companies do not have direct access to hydrologically relevant data and information although trans national organizations which are responsible for the negotiation of water allocation quotas in particular the interstate commission for water coordination in central asia icwc and the water basin organizations of syrdarya and amudarya wbo have access to seasonal discharge predictions their decision making processes remain intransparent and most likely do not sufficiently incorporate seasonal forecasts remarkably predictable water shortages have led to breaches of bilateral water allocation treaties in the past e g during the la nina year 2008 resulting in political tensions that could have been potentially avoided under consideration of hydro climatological information 88 83 success stories from various regions 47 89 93 highlight that progress in the field of scientifically informed water and climate impact management requires the establishment of an interdisciplinary and trans sectoral stakeholder network including scientists forecasting experts political decision makers and affected stakeholders such knowledge systems represent an important prerequisite for a sustainable cooperation since they allow a continuous evaluation of the actual user demands and a corresponding adjustment of forecasting techniques and communication strategies particularly the development of secondary user tailored products e g targeting at agricultural yield estimations or hazard and risk assessments has been shown to significantly increase the societal benefit of seasonal forecasting applications however stakeholder networks require a robust institutional basis including boundary organizations that connect experts practitioners and decision makers although the trans national structure in particularly the icwc and its advisory board the scientific information center sic appear suitable for strengthening the connection between science and political action the institutional mandates and responsibilities are only vaguely defined 21 94 the institutional ambiguities at both local and regional scales and the underdeveloped information channels make it difficult for the hydro meteorological centers to introduce their forecasts to a broader circle of users and thus to further contribute to sustainable water management overall the outreach of the seasonal discharge forecasts remains far below its potential especially in the field of trans national and trans sectoral water management urgent improvements are required with regard to the applied forecasting techniques and the underlying data particularly in view of global warming which will likely enhance the risk of hydro meteorological extreme events in central asia the hydro meteorological centers will have to respond quickly to changing user needs therefore scientifically and technically well trained and self reliant employees are needed who are not yet sufficiently available to the national services 4 linking science and action opportunities and obstacles for knowledge dissemination and capacity development during the last three decades various projects all aiming at a sustainable and scientifically sound development of water management strategies in central asia have been implemented by international organizations 11 however only some of them excelled through a long term commitment several international activities explicitly accentuated the potential of seasonal forecasting applications and early warning for instance the world bank initiated the aral sea basin program which targeted at a scientifically robust basis for trans national water management in central asia already in 1992 95 96 in cooperation with the swiss aral sea project 1996 2005 the potential of earth observation technologies for the forecast of water resources has been analyzed and regular trainings have been provided 48 97 the utilization of modern geo information techniques has been established at all five central asian hydromet services personal communication with baumgartner since 2011 the world bank in cooperation with un agencies and the world meteorological organization has been supporting the national hydro meteorological services in the framework of the central asia hydrometeorology modernization project cahmp targeting at an improvement of monitoring infrastructure and early warning capacities 98 the german federal foreign office has been supporting a collaboration of the german and the central asian scientific community since 2008 the regional research network central asian water cawa has been led by the gfz german centre for geosciences and since 2014 particularly focused on developing hydro climatic forecasting techniques and encouraging their use in the field of regional water management fully automated tools for the remote sensing based monitoring of snow cover the forecast of summer discharge and the prediction of winter precipitation have been developed partially in cooperation with regional experts and provided to the respective departments 23 51 52 various on the job trainings have been provided to forecasting experts at the national hydro meteorological services the trainings were designed as regional workshops with participants from all central asian services and thus additionally served as a trans national networking platform aiming at a strengthened regional cohesion while some progress has been made e g the snow cover monitoring tool modsnow is nowadays in operational use at all five services and an exchange of hydro meteorological data appears to be possible under certain circumstances the modernization process remains slow and is characterized by setbacks despite the decadal long international engagement in the field of technical cooperation the use of modern data sets and advanced statistical techniques is not yet integrated in the institutional workflows in a sustainable manner this clearly indicates that successful capacity development requires a long term commitment and continuous coordinated effort however the institutional structures and the insufficient technical education of the regional experts represent further obstacles in general technical trainings address individual employees however high skilled experts frequently leave the hydro meteorological services after short time due to hierarchical institutional structures low salaries and unclear promotion perspectives 29 87 others are promoted to higher positions with larger administrative but limited technical responsibility this brain drain effect makes regional capacity development a bottomless pit and calls for the establishment of transparent career pathways and mechanisms that support an internal knowledge transfer and a sustainable institutional learning the same applies in principle to stakeholder organizations in the fields of integrated water resource management agricultural planning or risk assessment institutions at national and trans national levels are frequently not aware of the opportunities and societal benefits of seasonal hydro meteorological forecasts and multi disciplinary or cross sectoral networks are not yet well established thus a better communication of the climate related vulnerability and the skill of modern forecasting techniques appears overdue in this regard science can contribute by developing user specific forecasting products that do not only include rather abstract hydro climatic parameters but directly address the associated risk e g the mismatch in the spatial scales between regional precipitation predictions and the planning horizons of water managers usually at catchment scale leads to challenges in promoting the utilization of forecasting results 99 user tailored forecasts that directly relate expected precipitation anomalies to the likelihood of crop shortfalls and the associated financial risk will certainly better meet the user requirements in any case it is strongly recommended to strengthen the regional stakeholder networks in the water sector possibly under direction of the national hydro meteorological services in order to stimulate the demand for hydro meteorological information and thus to improve the outreach of seasonal climatic and hydrological predictions besides of its direct benefits for scientifically based water management an increasing demand for hydro climatological information may additionally encourage a structural change at the national hydro meteorological services while modernization so far has been mainly driven by technological developments an increase and diversification of user requirements will likely stimulate leadership visions and may contribute to the development of the national centers towards client oriented hydro meteorological services it should be noted however that a sustainable change of institutional structures cannot be achieved by science alone but requires a long term collaboration with international and regional organizations in the field of policy advice and international cooperation it also calls for openness and readiness for transformation at the political level and respective governmental bodies finally in order to archive a long term improvement of the capacity of young professionals a stronger integration of modern methodological and scientific competencies e g remote sensing statistics programming into the water and climate related curricula at the local universities is urgently needed our experience has shown that a sustainable transfer of scientific knowledge into decision making processes requires the involvement of the young generation that will shape the future practice in the field of water management recently e g the german kazakh university gku established a course program on integrated water resource management that although so far with international support offers regular courses in the field of statistics geo information techniques and hydrological modelling a long term involvement of the international scientific community appears necessary to ensure a sustainable transfer of general scientific competences and cutting edge technologies to support their application in the field of water management in central asia 5 summary and discussion all five central asian countries face water related challenges that directly or indirectly effect the regional economic development the political stability and the ecological balance robust seasonal forecasts and quantitative estimates of the available water resources in general have the potential to improve the regional water management especially in transboundary catchments during recent decades accurate techniques for the seasonal prediction of regional climatic conditions and water availability have been developed and their potential for scientifically informed decision making in the water sector has been demonstrated particularly the forecast of discharge anomalies during the vegetation season based on the wintertime accumulation of snow in the high mountain regions has been shown to be exceptionally skillful nowadays remote sensing derived data sets offer opportunities for an improved assessment of water resources and thus for the operational implementation of hydrological forecasting routines in trans national catchments likewise due to the predominant influence of enso the central asian winter climate has been shown to be predictable to some extent although seasonal climate predictions are subjected to large uncertainties they enable an assessment of the hydrological drought risk during the vegetation season already in preceding autumn and thus facilitate long term planning in agriculture and trans national water management in summary the well acknowledged vulnerability of the regional economies to water shortages in combination with the scientific progress in the field of seasonal forecasting clearly suggests a stronger integration of hydro climatic information into decision making processes at both local and trans national levels however despite the scientific progress and the continuous international effort with regard to knowledge transfer and regional capacity development central asian water management institutes still rely on outdated forecasting techniques and modernization is proceeding slowly to date the national hydro meteorological services do not fully meet the requirements of potential user groups and the dissemination of their seasonal forecasts is rather limited although the technical cooperation between the international scientific community and the national hydro meteorological services in central asia has been successfully established during the last decades the newly acquired knowledge is not yet sustainably incorporated into institutional workflows particularly institutional structures often impede sustainable institutional learning and knowledge anchoring over longer times furthermore decision makers in the field of water management e g reservoir managers farmers water basin organizations at local or trans national scales are frequently not aware of the scientific progress and its implication for an improvement of water management thus the demand for robust hydrological and climatic predictions is limited and the integration of modern scientific knowledge into water policy and decision making remains challenging while academic studies on the use of seasonal forecasts for informed decision making in the water sector are rare a significant number of scholars examined the role of scientific information for the implementation of an integrated water resource management 12 84 100 and evaluated the success of international capacity development campaigns dedabaev 2016 most studies indicate that limited institutional reforms hinder the development of a sustainable water management especially since the prevailing state centric top down management systems contradict local ownership and responsibility at the local scale 84 91 100 dadabaev 72 emphasizes the importance of regional trust and openness with regard to data and knowledge exchange for the successful adoption of iwrm and demonstrate that international efforts are currently restricted to individual capacity development at the local or national scale just like in the field of seasonal forecasting data scarcity capacity deficits and inefficient governance structures including limited institutional funding and insufficient transboundary cooperation have been stressed as major challenges for the implementation of irwm in central asia 22 91 101 against this background a continuous and coordinated effort in the field of capacity development and knowledge dissemination at various institutional levels appears necessary to communicate potential of seasonal forecasts for an improved water management we highly recommend to involve young academics technical experts at the national hydro meteorological services as well as an expanded circle of stakeholders and user groups in order to stimulate a multi disciplinary network and to support a sustainable regional collaboration in the water sector such effort cannot be achieved by the science alone but requires a long term collaboration with international think tanks and global policy organizations currently a fresh political wind is blowing in central asia and regional collaboration has been recognized as an important basis for sustainable economic development particularly uzbekistan is promoting a stronger regional integration and recently suggested the establishment of an international innovation center for the aral sea basin targeting at sustainable water governance and societal stability through innovative research and technology 56 kyrgyzstan is currently establishing a national water information system allowing access to water related data and information including seasonal discharge forecasts and water allocation at the local scale 102 technical and scientific innovation in water management is more and more recognized as a joint central asian challenge and has the potential to stimulate the regional political integration the continuation of the international scientific effort in the field of seasonal forecasting and knowledge dissemination can certainly strengthen this process credit authorship contribution statement lars gerlitz conceptualization data curation formal analysis methodology

20141,we reviewed the nature range and extent of literature on drinking water and human health outcomes in the context of climate change in the circumpolar north we used a systematic process to identify and synthesize articles while the number of climate water health articles increased recently this topic remains under studied despite the transformational changes that the circumpolar north has already experienced due to climate change of the climate focused articles most considered climate change to a major extent and discussed waterborne infections research examining and evaluating adaptation options and future impacts at the climate water health nexus is absent in the circumpolar north responding to this research gap should become a top priority for research given the urgent need for this evidence to inform climate change policies actions and interventions keywords water security human health climate change climate change adaptation circumpolar north arctic 1 introduction the arctic is experiencing the fastest warming on the planet 1 2 resulting in transformational changes to water systems with important implications for human health 1 the circumpolar north landscape is characterized by vast low lying permafrost areas which limit surface water drainage creating shallow lakes ponds streams and wetlands 1 3 climate change continues to impact these water systems including water quantity and quality impacts examples of climate change impacts on water quantity include changes due to melting glaciers changing seasonal precipitation increasing river flows and increasing groundwater contributions to these flows thawing permafrost that impacts groundwater flow into streams and rivers and increasing evapotranspiration 1 4 6 changes in surface water quantity varies regionally across the circumpolar north for instance lakes in continuous permafrost zones have increased in size and number and are projected to continue to increase in area by over 50 by 2100 under rcp8 5 however lakes in some discontinuous permafrost zones have decreased or disappeared 1 4 in terms of climate change impacts on water quality lowland areas have been flooded with salty ocean water during storms chemical contaminants that were stored in the environment are being released into water sources permafrost thaw and erosion have increased water turbidity runoff has decreased in non glacial watersheds and winter river discharge has increased in other regions water temperatures have increased and the occurrence and or emergence of microbial contaminants has increased 1 4 6 8 these climate change impacts on circumpolar water systems have important impacts on drinking water availability and safety for northern residents 1 9 11 especially since most circumpolar communities rely on surface water for drinking water 12 these climate change risks to drinking water are compounded by existing water treatment infrastructure challenges related to extremely cold climates rural and remote locations of many communities often relatively smaller population sizes than southern locales and often limited resources 6 10 13 14 as such in many communities in the circumpolar north surface water often undergoes basic primary treatment e g chlorination and is either piped under or above ground to houses or is trucked to houses as such heavy rainfall rapid snowmelt and high impact weather events as well as climate related events that increase water turbidity can overwhelm water treatment infrastructure that is intended to protect public health 4 14 15 furthermore while most northern residents have access to treated tap water the practice of drinking untreated water e g from lakes ponds rivers melted snow or ice in the circumpolar north is not uncommon 10 13 16 17 this practice is particularly prevalent when northern residents are on the land visiting cabins hunting fishing trapping and gathering 10 16 18 in addition many northern indigenous peoples prefer untreated water over treated drinking water which often stems from personal and cultural preferences and norms 17 19 20 as such some households collect untreated water in containers and bring it back to the community for later consumption 10 16 17 21 22 the safety of this practice is increasingly challenged by intensified environmental change in hydrological systems increased turbidity and increased and or emergence of microbial and chemical contaminants 10 11 14 these direct and indirect climate change impacts on drinking water quantity and safety have important implications for waterborne diseases drinking bathing washing or eating food exposed to contaminated water can result in waterborne diseases and outbreaks that range from mild and self limiting to life threatening illnesses climate change is anticipated to exacerbate an already high burden of waterborne disease in the circumpolar north 4 14 23 24 indeed some of the highest rates of self reported acute gastrointestinal illness in the global literature occur in the circumpolar north with drinking water identified as a risk factor 14 25 27 while narrative reviews have synthesized information about climate change and northern water systems 3 northern water systems and waterborne disease 28 or global water systems and health 29 fewer reviews have examined where these topics intersect therefore considering the often transformational climate change impacts on water systems the vulnerability of drinking water to climate change and the existing high burden of waterborne disease in the circumpolar north this literature review examined trends in the nature range and extent of published literature on drinking water and human health outcomes in the context of climate change in the circumpolar north 2 methods a scoping review approach was used to systematically and transparently identify select and synthesize articles using replicable methods 30 31 scoping review methods are used to examine trends in the extent range and nature of published literature particularly when the evidence base is emerging large complex and or heterogeneous in nature scoping review methods are particularly useful in quantitatively mapping broad topic areas to identify gaps in research clarify concepts and report on the types of evidence available to inform practice 31 the scoping review approach included four steps i identifying the research question ii systematically identifying and selecting relevant articles iii extracting and charting information from each article and iv summarizing analysing and reporting results 32 33 2 1 search strategy a search string was developed in consultation with a research librarian at the university of guelph the search string included terms for drinking water human health and the circumpolar north table 1 the search string was used to search pubmed and web of science aggregator databases the initial search was conducted on january 9 2017 and updated on january 14 2019 to confirm the sensitivity of our search strategy two journals journal of water and health and international journal of circumpolar health were hand searched for relevant articles the searches were restricted to articles published this century january 1 2000 to december 31 2018 but were not restricted by language citations were downloaded to mendeley elsevier amsterdam netherlands reference manager where duplicate citations were removed then citations were exported to distillersr evidence partners ottawa canada to facilitate article screening and data extraction 2 2 inclusion criteria inclusion criteria were developed a priori articles were eligible for inclusion if they described primary secondary research that examined drinking water and human health in the circumpolar north and were published this century 2000 2018 fig 1 for the purposes of this review drinking water included reference to any source of fresh water used for drinking human health outcomes included relevance to physical mental and or social health the circumpolar north included countries identified by the university of the arctic 34 within these countries specific cities regions and communities were chosen according to the arctic or subarctic köppen geiger climate classification system 35 2 3 article selection process a two stage process was used to select relevant articles appendix a in the first stage the title and abstract of each article was reviewed for relevance based on inclusion criteria using a stacked screening form titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer and a second independent reviewer confirmed the exclusion of the article then potentially relevant articles proceeded to the second stage of review where the full text of the article was reviewed for relevance by two independent reviewers disagreements between reviewers were resolved via consensus the level of agreement between reviewers was evaluated using cohen s kappa value 36 2 4 analysis our analysis focused on charting and mapping overarching trends in the climate water and health literature in the circumpolar north specifically our analysis was comprised of two steps first we examined the extent to which climate change is considered in the broader water and health literature in the circumpolar north results presented in section 3 1 as such articles did not have to include climate change content to be included in this review this enabled us to calculate the proportion of water and health related articles that included climate change considerations in the literature base i e number of articles with climate change considerations divided by the number of all water and health related articles in the circumpolar north and how these proportions changed over time by region and other attributes second the articles that included climate change considerations were examined in depth results presented in section 3 2 articles were categorized as explicitly considering climate change to a major extent if climate change or global warming was included in the title objectives methods and or results of the paper articles were categorized as explicitly considering climate change to a minor extent if climate change or global warming were included in the introduction and or discussion but not incorporated into the objectives or methodology of the study finally articles were categorized as implicitly considering climate change if climate related or sensitive factors e g shifts in seasonal patterns and temperature were discussed without explicit use of the terms climate change or global warming to facilitate this analysis a data extraction form appendix b was created and used to obtain information from each article using distillersr for literature reviews only the research topics were recorded for primary research articles extracted data were analysed using descriptive statistics including chi square tests and logistic regressions analyses were conducted using stata 13 1 statacorp college station tx usa and graphs were generated using microsoft excel 2016 microsoft corporation redmond wa usa 3 results the initial search identified 6 826 articles after screening 74 articles met the inclusion criteria and were analysed fig 2 the level of agreement between reviewers was good 36 with a cohen s kappa statistic of κ 0 83 for first level screening and κ 0 75 for second level screening 3 1 to what extent is climate change covered in the water and health literature 3 1 1 one third of water and health articles considered climate change of the 74 articles on water and health in the circumpolar north approximately one third n 25 articles 33 8 of the articles assessed or made reference to climate change table 2 with a higher number of climate focused articles published in more recent years fig 3 there was no clear trend in the proportion of water and health articles that considered climate change over time however the proportions were highest from 2015 to 2018 there were seven literature reviews and 67 primary research articles of the literature reviews about water and health in the circumpolar north all but one article considered climate change n 6 7 articles of the 67 primary research articles that examined water and health 19 considered climate change 28 4 while the water and health literature was dominated by quantitative research methods n 51 articles 76 1 the articles relating to climate change were more evenly distributed among study designs fig 3 in primary research articles methodological approach was associated with whether the article examined climate change qualitative studies had 10 98 times greater odds of considering climate change compared to quantitative studies p 0 01 of the articles that considered climate change 31 6 used participatory methods n 6 articles however participatory methods were not used in any of the articles that did not consider climate change fig 4 3 1 2 the main foci of articles varied by country and locale while most of the water and health research was conducted in finland n 20 74 articles 27 0 only one of these articles considered climate change n 1 20 articles 5 0 canada had the second highest number of water and health articles n 18 74 articles 24 3 however in contrast to finland most of the articles describing research in canada considered climate change n 13 18 articles 72 2 fig 3 the proportions of water and health research that examined climate change was similar in the usa n 5 11 45 5 of articles investigated climate change and iceland n 3 6 50 0 of articles investigated climate change the location of water and health primary research were somewhat evenly distributed among cities n 14 articles 20 9 large towns 25 articles 37 3 rural locations n 25 articles 37 3 and or remote locations n 19 articles 28 4 of these articles however most climate change research took place in rural n 15 25 articles 60 and remote n 13 articles 68 4 communities and very little climate change research took place in cities n 2 articles 14 3 and or large towns n 4 articles 16 0 fig 3 3 1 3 water source contaminants and health outcomes varied by articles that did and did not consider climate change water and health articles most commonly examined tap water n 23 articles and surface water n 11 articles similarly articles that considered climate change also most commonly examined tap water n 11 articles and surface water n 11 articles appendix c few articles examined trucked water meltwater and water in storage tanks however the proportion of these articles that considered climate change was high of the five articles that examined trucked water four considered climate change 80 0 of the seven articles that examined meltwater five considered climate change 71 4 and of the 11 articles that examined water in storage tanks in homes seven considered climate change 63 6 metals metalloids and other elements were most commonly examined in water and health articles n 25 articles however few of these articles considered climate change n 3 25 articles 12 bacteria n 17 articles and parasites n 10 articles were often the focus of water and health articles and climate change was considered in some of these articles n 5 17 articles examined bacteria and considered climate change 4 10 articles examined parasites and considered climate change while 12 water and health articles examined viruses in water only one of these articles considered climate change most water and health articles collected data on human health n 48 articles of which only 12 considered climate change n 12 48 articles 25 many water and health articles examined waterborne disease outbreaks n 16 articles however very few of these considered climate change n 3 16 articles 18 8 3 2 what is the nature of climate change considerations in water and health literature 3 2 1 many articles considered climate change to a major extent while 25 articles considered climate change in some capacity the degree to which it was considered and or evaluated varied greatly within the literature table 2 approximately half of the articles n 12 articles 48 0 considered climate change to a major extent while ten articles 40 0 considered climate change explicitly to a minor extent and three articles 12 0 made implicit references to climate change for instance some articles included climate change in the study goals data collection and analysis explicitly considered to a major extent 11 13 14 19 37 41 while others discussed their results in the context of climate change explicitly considered to a minor extent 21 22 25 26 38 40 43 46 48 49 other articles considered climate change implicitly for instance articles examined associationsbetween waterborne outbreaks and precipitation 42 mentioned the links between medical ecological socioeconomic and climatic factors 47 and referenced a rapidly changing arctic environment 20 3 2 2 few articles empirically associated water health with climate change few articles n 6 24 0 empirically evaluated associations of water and or health with climate change of the studies that did evaluate an association three articles did so via qualitative methodologies one article used quantitative methodologies and two articles utilized a mixed methods qualitative and quantitative approach for example studies used interviews 11 13 19 41 and participatory methods 11 13 to record indigenous knowledge and other observations related to climate change impacts on drinking water and health other studies used surveys 11 37 hospital records 14 and water sampling 13 14 to understand the climate water health nexus 3 2 3 health implications of both water quality and quantity was assessed in the context of climate change of the articles that considered climate change most addressed relationships between water quality and health n 17 25 articles 70 8 of these articles the most commonly described issues included infectious waterborne illnesses n 13 17 articles 76 5 some of these articles collected health data on illnesses including cryptosporidiosis n 3 13 20 40 giardiasis n 1 20 norovirus n 1 42 and all cause acute gastrointestinal illness n 7 13 14 21 26 27 few articles that considered climate change described chemical contaminants n 4 17 articles 23 5 these chemicals included non microbiological contaminants such as metals metalloids and other elements n 3 40 43 46 and pesticides n 1 43 water quantity impacts on health were considered in six climate change articles n 6 24 0 11 13 19 37 40 41 for instance some articles documented indigenous knowledge related to observed declines in drinking water quantity related to reduced snow warmer temperatures and loss of groundwater aquifers 11 13 37 indigenous knowledge related to observations of decreased water quantity linked to health impacts were also documented in some studies 11 13 41 3 2 4 remote populations indigenous peoples and age were most commonly described as factors influencing vulnerability to climate change many articles identified remote populations n 14 articles 56 indigenous peoples n 13 articles 52 and age n 5 articles 20 as factors that contribute to climate change vulnerability for example articles described increased vulnerability to climate change due to the close relationships that many indigenous peoples have with the environment 11 13 water treatment infrastructure challenges in remote locations 38 40 high gastrointestinal illness rates among infants children and the elderly 19 and concerns about water access and health impacts on children and elders 41 fewer articles however identified public health service access n 3 articles 12 gender n 2 articles 8 and the economy n 2 articles 8 as factors that influence climate change vulnerability 3 2 5 examining climate change adaptation was rare of articles that considered climate change only seven explicitly mentioned climate change adaptation n 7 25 28 0 only two primary research articles collected data on climate change adaptations n 2 19 10 5 13 37 which included forums for sharing strategies and innovations for climate change adaptation 37 as well as environmental monitoring 13 3 2 6 no articles quantitatively projected future climate change impacts on water no articles quantitatively projected future climate change impacts on water two articles however did capture qualitative data on concern for future impacts on climate change based on indigenous knowledge 11 41 for instance one article documented concern over how observed climate related environmental changes could compromise the safety of drinking water in the future based on inuit knowledge 11 while few articles projected future climate change impacts the majority of primary research articles did mention future implications of climate change in the introduction and or discussion sections of the paper n 11 19 57 9 for example articles called for further research on future climate change impacts 25 discussed results in the context of future climate change 14 22 and mentioned future climate change projections in the introduction and or discussion sections of the article 19 49 4 discussion while the number of climate change water and health articles has increased relatively recently research on this topic remains nascent despite the risks posed by climate change indeed only 25 of the 74 included articles implicitly or explicitly mentioned climate change of which only 12 articles considered climate change in depth and explicitly and only 6 articles collected data on climate variables e g temperature over time a variety of different water sources were examined in articles capturing the range and variety of drinking water sources that northern residents utilize including surface and ground water treated and untreated tap water and meltwater from snow ice and icebergs while the consideration of populations vulnerable to climate change impacts on drinking water was not in depth indigenous peoples rural populations and children and elderly were most commonly mentioned as potentially vulnerable while most water and health research was conducted in finland and canada articles focusing on climate change were rare in finland but more frequent in canada this finding highlights an opportunity for increased climate water health research in finland and elsewhere in the arctic indeed given the demonstrated high level of water and health research capacity in finland there are clear opportunities to develop a stream of water and health research that encompasses addresses and responds to climate change threats in this country water and health research in norway sweden iceland russia and greenland infrequently considered climate change creating a large gap in understanding in a region experiencing the fastest warming on the planet with vulnerable drinking water sources 1 50 52 northern canada and alaska usa had the most water and health articles that considered climate change however most of this research only mentioned climate change with very few articles empirically examining climate change impacts or risks water and health research spanned urban rural and remote settings however water and health research that considered climate change was concentrated in rural and remote settings this finding could reflect the heightened vulnerability of rural and remote systems to climate change impacts on drinking water 1 4 12 for instance many rural and remote communities rely on surface water for drinking but the water treatment systems often provide only basic water treatment e g chlorination 12 without more advanced treatment options e g filtration uv treatment coagulation flocculation and sedimentation etc surface water can be vulnerable to heavy rainfall and rapid snowmelt that can increase runoff and turbidity as well as by seasonal and long term changes in water quality all of which can potentially overwhelm water treatment facilities 53 54 furthermore climate change impacts on water distribution systems in rural and remote areas can interrupt water provision for community members 12 for instance permafrost thaw can damage water distribution infrastructure high impact weather events can interrupt trucked water service to homes and water storage tanks in homes can be insufficiently designed and maintained for climate related changes in water quality among other impacts 12 13 urban centres are also vulnerable to climate change impacts on drinking water globally it is clear that even major metropolitan cities in high income countries have water treatment and distribution infrastructure that is vulnerable to climate change 53 58 urban centres in the circumpolar north are indeed also vulnerable to climate change impacts on drinking water 12 52 59 given most people in the circumpolar north reside in urban centres this presents an important and under studied climate change risk water and health research that considered climate change included articles focused on microbial contamination of drinking water and consequent health impacts this topic of research is particularly important given the high baseline level of acute gastrointestinal illness in the circumpolar north 14 25 27 which is anticipated to be exacerbated by climate change 1 indeed finland and sweden have already reported increased waterborne disease in the past decade and waterborne illness has been reported as an important climate change concern in norway and sweden 52 the breadth of infectious waterborne pathogens however has not been investigated sufficiently in cold climates in general and even less so in the context of climate change studies focusing on specific species of parasites bacteria and viruses in the context of climate change remains erratic sporadic and patchy water and health research was dominated by articles about chemical contaminants however this focus was rare in articles that considered climate change this research gap is detrimental given the uncertainty risk and adverse consequences of chemical contaminants contaminating drinking water sources due to climate change persistent contaminants are already found throughout northern ecosystems as a result of local sources e g mining pesticide use as well as transport from lower latitudes through air water and terrestrial routes 60 climate change is expected to exacerbate these existing chemical contaminant risks in the circumpolar north 61 64 accelerated temperature rise and the subsequent melting of glaciers snow and ice can enhance transport of chemical contaminants and airborne chemical contaminants that have been deposited onto glaciers and trapped in the ice may be deposited into glacier fed lakes and waterbodies increasing exposure to humans and wildlife 65 given this climate change risk further research is warranted while adaptation was frequently mentioned in the introduction and discussion sections of papers articles examining climate change adaptation options were rare this research gap has critical implications for planning policy and programming related to water health and or climate change in the circumpolar north examining the range nature efficacy efficiency and relevance of adaptation options are important in any region 66 but is particularly critical for the circumpolar north 67 given the important differences in cold climate culture livelihoods and resources available compared to other more southern locales 10 12 13 16 17 while adaptation options have not been evaluated more generally the health and climate change literature emphasizes the need for community based monitoring of water systems the integration of water and health monitoring the development of climate water and health metrics that matter locally and culturally and the inclusion and or prioritization of indigenous knowledge in monitoring and decision making in the circumpolar north 5 13 24 37 67 72 both water quality and quantity were investigated in the context of health outcomes and current and historic impacts of climate change on water and health were considered understanding how future climate change will impact human society has become a critical area of research 73 74 including in climate water health research e g 75 77 however no

20141,we reviewed the nature range and extent of literature on drinking water and human health outcomes in the context of climate change in the circumpolar north we used a systematic process to identify and synthesize articles while the number of climate water health articles increased recently this topic remains under studied despite the transformational changes that the circumpolar north has already experienced due to climate change of the climate focused articles most considered climate change to a major extent and discussed waterborne infections research examining and evaluating adaptation options and future impacts at the climate water health nexus is absent in the circumpolar north responding to this research gap should become a top priority for research given the urgent need for this evidence to inform climate change policies actions and interventions keywords water security human health climate change climate change adaptation circumpolar north arctic 1 introduction the arctic is experiencing the fastest warming on the planet 1 2 resulting in transformational changes to water systems with important implications for human health 1 the circumpolar north landscape is characterized by vast low lying permafrost areas which limit surface water drainage creating shallow lakes ponds streams and wetlands 1 3 climate change continues to impact these water systems including water quantity and quality impacts examples of climate change impacts on water quantity include changes due to melting glaciers changing seasonal precipitation increasing river flows and increasing groundwater contributions to these flows thawing permafrost that impacts groundwater flow into streams and rivers and increasing evapotranspiration 1 4 6 changes in surface water quantity varies regionally across the circumpolar north for instance lakes in continuous permafrost zones have increased in size and number and are projected to continue to increase in area by over 50 by 2100 under rcp8 5 however lakes in some discontinuous permafrost zones have decreased or disappeared 1 4 in terms of climate change impacts on water quality lowland areas have been flooded with salty ocean water during storms chemical contaminants that were stored in the environment are being released into water sources permafrost thaw and erosion have increased water turbidity runoff has decreased in non glacial watersheds and winter river discharge has increased in other regions water temperatures have increased and the occurrence and or emergence of microbial contaminants has increased 1 4 6 8 these climate change impacts on circumpolar water systems have important impacts on drinking water availability and safety for northern residents 1 9 11 especially since most circumpolar communities rely on surface water for drinking water 12 these climate change risks to drinking water are compounded by existing water treatment infrastructure challenges related to extremely cold climates rural and remote locations of many communities often relatively smaller population sizes than southern locales and often limited resources 6 10 13 14 as such in many communities in the circumpolar north surface water often undergoes basic primary treatment e g chlorination and is either piped under or above ground to houses or is trucked to houses as such heavy rainfall rapid snowmelt and high impact weather events as well as climate related events that increase water turbidity can overwhelm water treatment infrastructure that is intended to protect public health 4 14 15 furthermore while most northern residents have access to treated tap water the practice of drinking untreated water e g from lakes ponds rivers melted snow or ice in the circumpolar north is not uncommon 10 13 16 17 this practice is particularly prevalent when northern residents are on the land visiting cabins hunting fishing trapping and gathering 10 16 18 in addition many northern indigenous peoples prefer untreated water over treated drinking water which often stems from personal and cultural preferences and norms 17 19 20 as such some households collect untreated water in containers and bring it back to the community for later consumption 10 16 17 21 22 the safety of this practice is increasingly challenged by intensified environmental change in hydrological systems increased turbidity and increased and or emergence of microbial and chemical contaminants 10 11 14 these direct and indirect climate change impacts on drinking water quantity and safety have important implications for waterborne diseases drinking bathing washing or eating food exposed to contaminated water can result in waterborne diseases and outbreaks that range from mild and self limiting to life threatening illnesses climate change is anticipated to exacerbate an already high burden of waterborne disease in the circumpolar north 4 14 23 24 indeed some of the highest rates of self reported acute gastrointestinal illness in the global literature occur in the circumpolar north with drinking water identified as a risk factor 14 25 27 while narrative reviews have synthesized information about climate change and northern water systems 3 northern water systems and waterborne disease 28 or global water systems and health 29 fewer reviews have examined where these topics intersect therefore considering the often transformational climate change impacts on water systems the vulnerability of drinking water to climate change and the existing high burden of waterborne disease in the circumpolar north this literature review examined trends in the nature range and extent of published literature on drinking water and human health outcomes in the context of climate change in the circumpolar north 2 methods a scoping review approach was used to systematically and transparently identify select and synthesize articles using replicable methods 30 31 scoping review methods are used to examine trends in the extent range and nature of published literature particularly when the evidence base is emerging large complex and or heterogeneous in nature scoping review methods are particularly useful in quantitatively mapping broad topic areas to identify gaps in research clarify concepts and report on the types of evidence available to inform practice 31 the scoping review approach included four steps i identifying the research question ii systematically identifying and selecting relevant articles iii extracting and charting information from each article and iv summarizing analysing and reporting results 32 33 2 1 search strategy a search string was developed in consultation with a research librarian at the university of guelph the search string included terms for drinking water human health and the circumpolar north table 1 the search string was used to search pubmed and web of science aggregator databases the initial search was conducted on january 9 2017 and updated on january 14 2019 to confirm the sensitivity of our search strategy two journals journal of water and health and international journal of circumpolar health were hand searched for relevant articles the searches were restricted to articles published this century january 1 2000 to december 31 2018 but were not restricted by language citations were downloaded to mendeley elsevier amsterdam netherlands reference manager where duplicate citations were removed then citations were exported to distillersr evidence partners ottawa canada to facilitate article screening and data extraction 2 2 inclusion criteria inclusion criteria were developed a priori articles were eligible for inclusion if they described primary secondary research that examined drinking water and human health in the circumpolar north and were published this century 2000 2018 fig 1 for the purposes of this review drinking water included reference to any source of fresh water used for drinking human health outcomes included relevance to physical mental and or social health the circumpolar north included countries identified by the university of the arctic 34 within these countries specific cities regions and communities were chosen according to the arctic or subarctic köppen geiger climate classification system 35 2 3 article selection process a two stage process was used to select relevant articles appendix a in the first stage the title and abstract of each article was reviewed for relevance based on inclusion criteria using a stacked screening form titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer and a second independent reviewer confirmed the exclusion of the article then potentially relevant articles proceeded to the second stage of review where the full text of the article was reviewed for relevance by two independent reviewers disagreements between reviewers were resolved via consensus the level of agreement between reviewers was evaluated using cohen s kappa value 36 2 4 analysis our analysis focused on charting and mapping overarching trends in the climate water and health literature in the circumpolar north specifically our analysis was comprised of two steps first we examined the extent to which climate change is considered in the broader water and health literature in the circumpolar north results presented in section 3 1 as such articles did not have to include climate change content to be included in this review this enabled us to calculate the proportion of water and health related articles that included climate change considerations in the literature base i e number of articles with climate change considerations divided by the number of all water and health related articles in the circumpolar north and how these proportions changed over time by region and other attributes second the articles that included climate change considerations were examined in depth results presented in section 3 2 articles were categorized as explicitly considering climate change to a major extent if climate change or global warming was included in the title objectives methods and or results of the paper articles were categorized as explicitly considering climate change to a minor extent if climate change or global warming were included in the introduction and or discussion but not incorporated into the objectives or methodology of the study finally articles were categorized as implicitly considering climate change if climate related or sensitive factors e g shifts in seasonal patterns and temperature were discussed without explicit use of the terms climate change or global warming to facilitate this analysis a data extraction form appendix b was created and used to obtain information from each article using distillersr for literature reviews only the research topics were recorded for primary research articles extracted data were analysed using descriptive statistics including chi square tests and logistic regressions analyses were conducted using stata 13 1 statacorp college station tx usa and graphs were generated using microsoft excel 2016 microsoft corporation redmond wa usa 3 results the initial search identified 6 826 articles after screening 74 articles met the inclusion criteria and were analysed fig 2 the level of agreement between reviewers was good 36 with a cohen s kappa statistic of κ 0 83 for first level screening and κ 0 75 for second level screening 3 1 to what extent is climate change covered in the water and health literature 3 1 1 one third of water and health articles considered climate change of the 74 articles on water and health in the circumpolar north approximately one third n 25 articles 33 8 of the articles assessed or made reference to climate change table 2 with a higher number of climate focused articles published in more recent years fig 3 there was no clear trend in the proportion of water and health articles that considered climate change over time however the proportions were highest from 2015 to 2018 there were seven literature reviews and 67 primary research articles of the literature reviews about water and health in the circumpolar north all but one article considered climate change n 6 7 articles of the 67 primary research articles that examined water and health 19 considered climate change 28 4 while the water and health literature was dominated by quantitative research methods n 51 articles 76 1 the articles relating to climate change were more evenly distributed among study designs fig 3 in primary research articles methodological approach was associated with whether the article examined climate change qualitative studies had 10 98 times greater odds of considering climate change compared to quantitative studies p 0 01 of the articles that considered climate change 31 6 used participatory methods n 6 articles however participatory methods were not used in any of the articles that did not consider climate change fig 4 3 1 2 the main foci of articles varied by country and locale while most of the water and health research was conducted in finland n 20 74 articles 27 0 only one of these articles considered climate change n 1 20 articles 5 0 canada had the second highest number of water and health articles n 18 74 articles 24 3 however in contrast to finland most of the articles describing research in canada considered climate change n 13 18 articles 72 2 fig 3 the proportions of water and health research that examined climate change was similar in the usa n 5 11 45 5 of articles investigated climate change and iceland n 3 6 50 0 of articles investigated climate change the location of water and health primary research were somewhat evenly distributed among cities n 14 articles 20 9 large towns 25 articles 37 3 rural locations n 25 articles 37 3 and or remote locations n 19 articles 28 4 of these articles however most climate change research took place in rural n 15 25 articles 60 and remote n 13 articles 68 4 communities and very little climate change research took place in cities n 2 articles 14 3 and or large towns n 4 articles 16 0 fig 3 3 1 3 water source contaminants and health outcomes varied by articles that did and did not consider climate change water and health articles most commonly examined tap water n 23 articles and surface water n 11 articles similarly articles that considered climate change also most commonly examined tap water n 11 articles and surface water n 11 articles appendix c few articles examined trucked water meltwater and water in storage tanks however the proportion of these articles that considered climate change was high of the five articles that examined trucked water four considered climate change 80 0 of the seven articles that examined meltwater five considered climate change 71 4 and of the 11 articles that examined water in storage tanks in homes seven considered climate change 63 6 metals metalloids and other elements were most commonly examined in water and health articles n 25 articles however few of these articles considered climate change n 3 25 articles 12 bacteria n 17 articles and parasites n 10 articles were often the focus of water and health articles and climate change was considered in some of these articles n 5 17 articles examined bacteria and considered climate change 4 10 articles examined parasites and considered climate change while 12 water and health articles examined viruses in water only one of these articles considered climate change most water and health articles collected data on human health n 48 articles of which only 12 considered climate change n 12 48 articles 25 many water and health articles examined waterborne disease outbreaks n 16 articles however very few of these considered climate change n 3 16 articles 18 8 3 2 what is the nature of climate change considerations in water and health literature 3 2 1 many articles considered climate change to a major extent while 25 articles considered climate change in some capacity the degree to which it was considered and or evaluated varied greatly within the literature table 2 approximately half of the articles n 12 articles 48 0 considered climate change to a major extent while ten articles 40 0 considered climate change explicitly to a minor extent and three articles 12 0 made implicit references to climate change for instance some articles included climate change in the study goals data collection and analysis explicitly considered to a major extent 11 13 14 19 37 41 while others discussed their results in the context of climate change explicitly considered to a minor extent 21 22 25 26 38 40 43 46 48 49 other articles considered climate change implicitly for instance articles examined associationsbetween waterborne outbreaks and precipitation 42 mentioned the links between medical ecological socioeconomic and climatic factors 47 and referenced a rapidly changing arctic environment 20 3 2 2 few articles empirically associated water health with climate change few articles n 6 24 0 empirically evaluated associations of water and or health with climate change of the studies that did evaluate an association three articles did so via qualitative methodologies one article used quantitative methodologies and two articles utilized a mixed methods qualitative and quantitative approach for example studies used interviews 11 13 19 41 and participatory methods 11 13 to record indigenous knowledge and other observations related to climate change impacts on drinking water and health other studies used surveys 11 37 hospital records 14 and water sampling 13 14 to understand the climate water health nexus 3 2 3 health implications of both water quality and quantity was assessed in the context of climate change of the articles that considered climate change most addressed relationships between water quality and health n 17 25 articles 70 8 of these articles the most commonly described issues included infectious waterborne illnesses n 13 17 articles 76 5 some of these articles collected health data on illnesses including cryptosporidiosis n 3 13 20 40 giardiasis n 1 20 norovirus n 1 42 and all cause acute gastrointestinal illness n 7 13 14 21 26 27 few articles that considered climate change described chemical contaminants n 4 17 articles 23 5 these chemicals included non microbiological contaminants such as metals metalloids and other elements n 3 40 43 46 and pesticides n 1 43 water quantity impacts on health were considered in six climate change articles n 6 24 0 11 13 19 37 40 41 for instance some articles documented indigenous knowledge related to observed declines in drinking water quantity related to reduced snow warmer temperatures and loss of groundwater aquifers 11 13 37 indigenous knowledge related to observations of decreased water quantity linked to health impacts were also documented in some studies 11 13 41 3 2 4 remote populations indigenous peoples and age were most commonly described as factors influencing vulnerability to climate change many articles identified remote populations n 14 articles 56 indigenous peoples n 13 articles 52 and age n 5 articles 20 as factors that contribute to climate change vulnerability for example articles described increased vulnerability to climate change due to the close relationships that many indigenous peoples have with the environment 11 13 water treatment infrastructure challenges in remote locations 38 40 high gastrointestinal illness rates among infants children and the elderly 19 and concerns about water access and health impacts on children and elders 41 fewer articles however identified public health service access n 3 articles 12 gender n 2 articles 8 and the economy n 2 articles 8 as factors that influence climate change vulnerability 3 2 5 examining climate change adaptation was rare of articles that considered climate change only seven explicitly mentioned climate change adaptation n 7 25 28 0 only two primary research articles collected data on climate change adaptations n 2 19 10 5 13 37 which included forums for sharing strategies and innovations for climate change adaptation 37 as well as environmental monitoring 13 3 2 6 no articles quantitatively projected future climate change impacts on water no articles quantitatively projected future climate change impacts on water two articles however did capture qualitative data on concern for future impacts on climate change based on indigenous knowledge 11 41 for instance one article documented concern over how observed climate related environmental changes could compromise the safety of drinking water in the future based on inuit knowledge 11 while few articles projected future climate change impacts the majority of primary research articles did mention future implications of climate change in the introduction and or discussion sections of the paper n 11 19 57 9 for example articles called for further research on future climate change impacts 25 discussed results in the context of future climate change 14 22 and mentioned future climate change projections in the introduction and or discussion sections of the article 19 49 4 discussion while the number of climate change water and health articles has increased relatively recently research on this topic remains nascent despite the risks posed by climate change indeed only 25 of the 74 included articles implicitly or explicitly mentioned climate change of which only 12 articles considered climate change in depth and explicitly and only 6 articles collected data on climate variables e g temperature over time a variety of different water sources were examined in articles capturing the range and variety of drinking water sources that northern residents utilize including surface and ground water treated and untreated tap water and meltwater from snow ice and icebergs while the consideration of populations vulnerable to climate change impacts on drinking water was not in depth indigenous peoples rural populations and children and elderly were most commonly mentioned as potentially vulnerable while most water and health research was conducted in finland and canada articles focusing on climate change were rare in finland but more frequent in canada this finding highlights an opportunity for increased climate water health research in finland and elsewhere in the arctic indeed given the demonstrated high level of water and health research capacity in finland there are clear opportunities to develop a stream of water and health research that encompasses addresses and responds to climate change threats in this country water and health research in norway sweden iceland russia and greenland infrequently considered climate change creating a large gap in understanding in a region experiencing the fastest warming on the planet with vulnerable drinking water sources 1 50 52 northern canada and alaska usa had the most water and health articles that considered climate change however most of this research only mentioned climate change with very few articles empirically examining climate change impacts or risks water and health research spanned urban rural and remote settings however water and health research that considered climate change was concentrated in rural and remote settings this finding could reflect the heightened vulnerability of rural and remote systems to climate change impacts on drinking water 1 4 12 for instance many rural and remote communities rely on surface water for drinking but the water treatment systems often provide only basic water treatment e g chlorination 12 without more advanced treatment options e g filtration uv treatment coagulation flocculation and sedimentation etc surface water can be vulnerable to heavy rainfall and rapid snowmelt that can increase runoff and turbidity as well as by seasonal and long term changes in water quality all of which can potentially overwhelm water treatment facilities 53 54 furthermore climate change impacts on water distribution systems in rural and remote areas can interrupt water provision for community members 12 for instance permafrost thaw can damage water distribution infrastructure high impact weather events can interrupt trucked water service to homes and water storage tanks in homes can be insufficiently designed and maintained for climate related changes in water quality among other impacts 12 13 urban centres are also vulnerable to climate change impacts on drinking water globally it is clear that even major metropolitan cities in high income countries have water treatment and distribution infrastructure that is vulnerable to climate change 53 58 urban centres in the circumpolar north are indeed also vulnerable to climate change impacts on drinking water 12 52 59 given most people in the circumpolar north reside in urban centres this presents an important and under studied climate change risk water and health research that considered climate change included articles focused on microbial contamination of drinking water and consequent health impacts this topic of research is particularly important given the high baseline level of acute gastrointestinal illness in the circumpolar north 14 25 27 which is anticipated to be exacerbated by climate change 1 indeed finland and sweden have already reported increased waterborne disease in the past decade and waterborne illness has been reported as an important climate change concern in norway and sweden 52 the breadth of infectious waterborne pathogens however has not been investigated sufficiently in cold climates in general and even less so in the context of climate change studies focusing on specific species of parasites bacteria and viruses in the context of climate change remains erratic sporadic and patchy water and health research was dominated by articles about chemical contaminants however this focus was rare in articles that considered climate change this research gap is detrimental given the uncertainty risk and adverse consequences of chemical contaminants contaminating drinking water sources due to climate change persistent contaminants are already found throughout northern ecosystems as a result of local sources e g mining pesticide use as well as transport from lower latitudes through air water and terrestrial routes 60 climate change is expected to exacerbate these existing chemical contaminant risks in the circumpolar north 61 64 accelerated temperature rise and the subsequent melting of glaciers snow and ice can enhance transport of chemical contaminants and airborne chemical contaminants that have been deposited onto glaciers and trapped in the ice may be deposited into glacier fed lakes and waterbodies increasing exposure to humans and wildlife 65 given this climate change risk further research is warranted while adaptation was frequently mentioned in the introduction and discussion sections of papers articles examining climate change adaptation options were rare this research gap has critical implications for planning policy and programming related to water health and or climate change in the circumpolar north examining the range nature efficacy efficiency and relevance of adaptation options are important in any region 66 but is particularly critical for the circumpolar north 67 given the important differences in cold climate culture livelihoods and resources available compared to other more southern locales 10 12 13 16 17 while adaptation options have not been evaluated more generally the health and climate change literature emphasizes the need for community based monitoring of water systems the integration of water and health monitoring the development of climate water and health metrics that matter locally and culturally and the inclusion and or prioritization of indigenous knowledge in monitoring and decision making in the circumpolar north 5 13 24 37 67 72 both water quality and quantity were investigated in the context of health outcomes and current and historic impacts of climate change on water and health were considered understanding how future climate change will impact human society has become a critical area of research 73 74 including in climate water health research e g 75 77 however no articles quantitatively projected future climate change impacts on drinking water in the circumpolar north this research deficit limits the ability of the circumpolar north to look forward understand future risks plan and prioritize adaptations and respond to climate change 5 conclusion while the number of articles has increased recently this area of research remains under studied despite the transformational changes that the circumpolar north has already experienced and will continue to experience due to climate change more research investigating the climate water health nexus is needed in order to understand current and future risks and to adapt particularly given the unique features of drinking water quality access provision and safety in the circumpolar north research examining and evaluating adaptation options as well as research projecting future climate change impacts at the climate water health nexus is absent in the circumpolar north responding to this research gap

20142,since the start of stream daylighting deculverting streams buried to make way for urban development in the 1970s several case study project based reviews emerged yet there is a need for literature based reviews that identify the literature s themes interconnections pressing issues and knowledge gaps therefore we combine the systematic review and content analysis methods to investigate 115 peer reviewed and grey literature publications on stream daylighting our findings reveal temporal shifts in the multi inter disciplinary clustering patterns of the identified nine themes and 53 sub themes furthermore there is a dearth in this literature on built form and urban design inclusive planning and on case studies from the global south last the connections are absent between stream daylighting and nature based solutions and climate change adaptation e g vis à vis stormwater management urban heat island and rainwater harvesting and climate mitigation decreasing greenhouse gas emissions such as through enhancing the opportunities for walkability cycling and connections to transit keywords stream daylighting deculverting systematic review content analysis 1 introduction the unprecedented urban development since the twentieth century often overlooked urban ecosystems including urban streams and rivers which have been diverted straightened confined and channelled beyond recognition 1 iv environmental awareness brought the moral ethical and ecological consequences of development decisions under the limelight 2 simultaneously the adverse impacts of global climate change on cities such as floods heat waves and droughts heightened the importance of nature based solutions 1 1 nbs refers to the use of nature in tackling challenges such as climate change food security water resources or disaster risk management an overarching term that extends beyond conservation to incorporate the sustainable use of biodiversity 86 nbs for ecosystem services 3 4 stream daylighting is one such solution that refers to the practice of removing streams from buried conditions and exposing them to the earth s surface in order to directly or indirectly enhance the ecological economic and or socio cultural well being of a region and its inhabitants 5 10 accordingly stream daylighting has been ascribed to disciplines like socio ecology for the ecosystem services that benefit humans see 6 and hydro ecology for improved water quality and stormwater management see 7 10 although practiced since the 1970s daylighting received public attention with the increased interest in lost rivers including the reintroduction in 2004 of the lost cheonggyecheon stream in seoul south korea since the first peer reviewed publication in 1992 by charbonneau and resh however the stream daylighting literature has been dispersed over a wide array of disciplines and fragmented over multiple themes furthermore all existing reviews are case study project based see 1 11 13 hence warranting literature based reviews that critically examine the literature s trends intersections and future research trajectories more importantly the contemporary global climate change challenges warrant a review of the stream daylighting literature vis à vis shifting environmental perspectives and the integration of nature based solutions within urban areas accordingly we combine the systematic review and the content analysis methods to unravel the manifest and latent content of the literature on urban stream daylighting our findings identify the main themes and sub themes in the literature the discussions geographic scope and the case studies current omissions also provide opportunities for future empirical research including a need for cross inter disciplinary studies and for balancing the emphasis on case studies to present underrepresented cases furthermore there is a need for empirical studies that connect stream daylighting and climate change particularly its role as a nature based solution that provides valuable ecosystem services for adaptation e g stormwater management urban heat island and rainwater harvesting and for mitigation e g through walkability cycling and transit opportunities 2 the research methodology to date there are a handful of case study project based reviews that offer important insights the earliest pinkham 1 and buchholz younos 11 are professional reports grey literature that provide valuable insights by experienced professionals document the stream daylighting projects the then completed in the usa and evaluate these projects ecologically and socially three are peer reviewed whereby wild et al 12 and wild dempsey and broadhead 13 review stream daylighting projects globally while broadhead horn and lerner 14 investigate lost rivers captured in combined sewers all these reviews are case study project based that discuss best practices and engage practitioners in the collection of data thus while they offer valuable insights yet there remains a need for reviews that analyze the literature s manifest data explicit facts and figures and latent content hidden constructs and underlying trends see 15 accordingly this paper combines the systematic literature review and content analysis methods appendix a fig 1 by including all the literature that tackles stream daylighting and which was published between 1992 and 2018 the systematic review facilitates an understanding of the discourse s general scope and nature 15 16 also by scrutinizing the subject matter of the publications the content analysis facilitates an understanding of critical themes and the derivation of rich insights 17 22 our combined method followed four steps beginning with identifying the research questions and study objectives namely what are the dominant themes and sub themes in the stream daylighting literature and to what extent does the stream daylighting literature tackle climate change adaptation and mitigation second the literature research sought all the literature on stream daylighting using search engines like primo an academic search engine supported by google scholar and google the boolean search commenced with the following keywords stream river creek and brook combined with one or more of the root words daylight and or its synonyms deculvert and uncover we also used the keyword cheonggyecheon the well known lost stream that had been reintroduced in seoul s urban landscape based on the careful reading of these sources contents we observed that they referred to the cheonggyecheon as a restoration not as a daylighting project because the water was pumped from the nearby han river and from underground sources as opposed to being released from a culvert 23 subsequently the boolean search terms expanded to include the root words bury deculvert establish naturalize open reclaim recover regenerate rehabilitate renovate restore resurface revitalize uncover and or unearth concurrent with the boolean search we also supplemented our data collection by investigating the references cited in the yielded sources for their relevancy to stream daylighting as the sources accumulated priority was given to english language peer reviewed sources journal articles and university press publications however these were few therefore we expanded the search to the grey literature while assessing its quality through careful reading of each source s contents and scrutinizing the authors expertise and institutional affiliations resultantly the search yielded 115 sources that were published between 1992 and 2018 table 1 all these sources are in english except one german language 2 2 the principal investigator translated this report from german into english due to its relevance and significance especially given the dearth in sources on zürich s unique stream daylighting initiative professional report on the city of zürich s switzerland unique stream daylighting policy adopted since 1986 that thus far ensued in daylighting nearly 24 km 24 third we extracted organized coded and recorded the data in two files an excel document that recorded each source s manifest data i e explicit characteristics like title year type and location and a word document that open coded the latent content henceforth referred to simply as content the latter took the form of a standardized format for an annotated bibliography that organized thorough notes under headings i e a rule guided technique that controlled for researchers bias appendix a table 1 19 20 25 last we coded the headings from the word document latent content and combined them with the manifest data in the excel document in order to facilitate relational analysis distill grouping through sorting and collapsing dis similar

decade for publications to gradually increase fig 1 three points in 2004 2012 and 2016 mark an increase in the number of publications from only two sources in 2003 2004 saw seven new publications a

new publications in 2016 marked nearly a fivefold increase from 2015 it is difficult to conclusively pin down the reasons behind these sudden surges but it is possible to correlate the number of publications per year fig 1 and the publication year for the most cited sources table 2 and appendix a table 2 these data indicate the possibility that the media attention toward the cheonggyecheon project in 2004 combined with influential publications like kang and cervero s 43 contributed to this increase indeed 14 of the 21 articles published in the three years between 2010 and 2012 explicitly mention the cheonggyecheon as for the latent content a hierarchy of themes at two different levels emerged nine higher order categories that represented the dominant themes daylighting

daylighting from only three themes in 1992 i e sociocultural ecological and daylighting to nine in 2018 the 2004 2012 and 2016 points fig 1 marked the emergence of new themes the most frequently tackled themes are ecological sociocultural and hydrological discussed in 70 69 and 64 of the sources while inclusive planning and built form and urban design remain the least discussed in 42 and 41 of the sources fig 2 since the sub themes may coexist within each source we analyzed their overlaps interestingly two clusters emerged fig 3 the first includes ecology sociocultural hydrology infrastructure and economic that are simultaneously highly correlated to each other and are the most frequently discussed in the literature for example 80 to 90 of the sources that discuss stream daylighting through the lens of ecology also address hydrology likewise 70 to 80 of the sources that address hydrology also discuss infrastructure the second cluster consists of correlations among the themes discussed in less than 50 of the sources daylighting in 46 politics and policy in 43 and inclusive planning in 42 for example more than 60 of the sources that delve into stream daylighting s inclusive planning processes also discuss politics and policy the built form and urban design theme maintains weak correlations with all the other themes except inclusive planning hence remains outside both clusters our analysis also reveals seven sub themes that warrant further research appendix a fig 2 overlaying the geographic scope and the themes reveals that the 115 sources exclude africa and south america and only cover north america europe oceania and asia with variable theme distribution and with north america and oceania the most and least discussed consecutively ecology and hydrology are the most frequently discussed in studies on north america while built form and urban design is the least tackled hydrology recurs in most studies on europe whereas politics and policy is hardly mentioned the sociocultural and daylighting themes are consecutively the most and least prominent in asia while ecology and inclusive planning are the most and least addressed in oceania fig 4 our analysis of the case studies projects geographic distribution reveals 74 projects 53 in north america followed by 59 42 in europe of which 40 or 29 are in switzerland fig 5 these findings differ from wild dempsey and broadhead s 13 who report only 51 28 projects in north america 121 67 in europe 4 4 the data sources for wild dempsey and broadhead s 83 study are based on volunteered data on case studies gathered primarily through engaging practitioners whereas our study extracts the data from the literature two in asia compared to four in the literature including wadi hanifah in saudi arabia 44 and one in africa where none were reported in the literature furthermore our analysis reveals that the locations discussed more frequently do not necessarily contain more daylighting projects especially in europe and asia europe s 59 daylighting projects appear in 27 sources while zürich s 40 projects nearly a third of all case studies appear in only four sources 24 38 45 46 in contrast 40 sources discuss only four projects in asia of 36 sources exclusively discuss the cheonggyecheon 1 of all projects fig 5 lastly our analysis explored the relationships between the sub themes and climate change adaptation systems adjustments and mitigation decreasing greenhouse gas emissions of the total 115 sources only 16 refer to climate change all of which with the exception of richards and edwards 47 mention it only briefly without offering any detailed analyses beginning with adaptation it was not until the 2007 redrafting of the european chartered institution of water and environmental management s ciwem report de culverting of water courses 48 that the limitations of culverts in managing increased flooding brought on by climate change were highlighted fig 6 generally our findings indicate that the literature s sources avoid the term adaptation in many cases 7 49 52 and mostly discuss how stream daylighting can mitigate 5 5 mitigate in this context is used to literally mean lessen and not to refer to decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions the impacts of climate change through the lens of five sub themes stormwater management hydrology urban heat island ecology sustainable development infrastructure biodiversity ecology and urban resilience built form and urban design appendix a fig 2 among these sub themes stormwater management appears more frequently in the literature that mentions climate change whereas urban resilience appears the least fig 7 to elaborate of the 16 sources that discuss stream daylighting in relation to climate change

alleviate the effects of climate change 7 57 and e only one article specifically discusses the cheonggyecheon project as an example of resilient urban design that reduces the negative impacts of climate change 57 similarly our findings reveal that of the total 115 sources analyzed in this study only three discuss issues related to climate change mitigation these sources simultaneously discuss adaptation this is in line with kim and jung s 54 finding that there is a deficit of sources in the literature that relate stream daylighting to climate change mitigation figs 6 and 7 in fact our content analysis reveals that these three articles do not specifically use the term mitigation although they discuss stream daylighting s capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the infrastructure theme specifically two of these three articles argue that stream daylighting through creating opportunities for alternative transit options like cycling and walkability corridors the transportation sub theme can reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases 54 56 the third article referred to stream daylighting as an opportunity for low impact development that through carbon sequestration increases urban sustainability the sustainable development sub theme fig 7 58 4 discussion our thematic analysis identifies current trends and omissions in the literature the trends indicate the inter multi disciplinary nature of stream daylighting research and an increased sub theme diversity over time figs 1 and 2 notably 18 of the 19 sources published in 2016 tackle at least three themes each while each of the 15 sources published in 2017 tackles at least two themes and each of the 12 sources published in 2018 tackles three or more themes additionally 2016 2017 and 2018 witnessed a significant increase in the number of sources that simultaneously deal with ecology sociocultural and hydrology and their interdisciplinary connections fig 2 and appendix a fig 3 this multidisciplinary trend prevails for the ecology sociocultural hydrology infrastructure and economics themes while their connections to the remaining daylighting built form and urban design inclusive planning and politics and policy themes remain relatively weak fig 3 in particular the most discussed sub themes in the literature are wildlife habitat and connectivity under ecology stormwater management and water quality and pollution both under hydrology consecutively discussed in 55 54 and 44 sources appendix a fig 2 all the research themes persisted albeit with shifts over time ecology dominates over three nine year time periods i e 1992 2000 2001 2009 and 2010 2018 while built form and urban design daylighting hydrology and inclusive planning are declining economics infrastructure politics and policy and sociocultural themes fluctuate where each significantly increased in 2001 2009 but slightly decreased in 2010 2018 appendix a fig 3 in terms of omissions there is imbalance in tackling the sub themes and their correlations which may be the result of unequal representation of case studies and geographic regions there is a dearth of stream daylighting case studies from the global south while the literature s dominant themes emerge from the most discussed case studies for example case studies from water rich countries abound hence daylighting s potential to address water scarcity remains unexplored e g through rainwater harvesting also the sociocultural theme dominates the 40 sources on asia probably because 36 of them discuss the cheonggyecheon project which is considered an urban revitalization and which relies on pumped rather than natural water flow hence whether it actually constitutes daylighting remains controversial 59 interestingly this single 7 km project 1 of all the literature s projects received more attention than the city of zürich s 24 km of daylighted streams attributed to its consistent policy since 1986 surely this warrants a shift away from landmark projects to ones that are less alluring but that might offer valuable insights into the sub themes identified herewith and into the connections to climate change mitigation and adaptation this imbalance also impacts the sub themes correlations fig 3 although the daylighted streams contribute positively to climate change adaptation and mitigation yet our findings reveal weak connections between built form and urban design ecology and hydrology providing ample opportunity for new empirical studies in areas like landscape ecological urbanism for example sub themes like urban form morphology and landscape design under built form and urban design could explore urban stream daylighting s contribution as a nature based solution to urban hydrology and ecology through stormwater management and rainwater harvesting water sensitive urban design that alleviates the urban heat island and connected and permeable public realm that is conducive to walkability cycling and transit thus far only a handful of articles explore these connections like the navigli canal s milan and the cheonggyecheon stream s seoul contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions managing excess stormwater and regulating urban temperature 10 47 57 59 5 conclusion in this paper we combined the methods of a systematic literature review with those of content analysis to offer a comprehensive review of english language articles except one german language government report by the city of zürich on stream daylighting that were published between 1992 and 2018 there has been thus far a lack of such a comprehensive effort that identifies codes and categorizes the various perspectives and topics in the stream daylighting literature the comprehensiveness of the systematic literature review combined with the in depth perspective of the content analysis approach facilitated a better understanding of the current status of research and writing on the daylighting deculverting of urban streams specifically it facilitated an identification of the themes their corresponding sub themes and their correlations to each other these nine dominant themes are ecology sociocultural hydrology infrastructure economics daylighting politics and policy inclusive planning and built form and urban design furthermore the combined methodology allowed for a better understanding of the stream daylighting case studies the geographical scope covered in the literature and the connections between stream daylighting and climate change adaptation and mitigation accordingly the analysis revealed the current research trends and the disciplinary connections that could be further enhanced in future studies as well as the current research gaps that warrant further empirical research namely 1 this study covered the peer reviewed and the grey literature but excluded policy documents multimedia media reports and social media e g recorded lectures documentaries print and online news reports blogs etc future reviews that include these sources would enrich our knowledge of stream daylighting 2 the literature on stream daylighting has been and continues to be inter multi disciplinary while the diversity of the sub themes continues to increase over time the prominence of the themes and their sub themes however continue to shift over time except for the ecology theme which persisted while its wildlife habitat and connectivity sub theme is currently gaining prominence there is a need for studies that analyze the reasons behind these shifts 3 there is a lack of disciplinary connections firstly between built form and urban design and nearly all of the other themes especially the ecology and hydrology themes and secondly between the more frequently discussed themes in the literature i e ecology sociocultural hydrology infrastructure and economics and the less frequently discussed ones i e daylighting politics and policy and inclusive planning 4 while stream daylighting is an intervention that affects land uses there is still a need for empirical studies that investigate the connections between stream daylighting and the built form and urban design 5 the existing literature has yet to address the involvement of local stakeholders in stream daylighting projects hence the inclusive planning theme warrants explorations of how local inclusion and local ecological knowledge may contribute to planning implementing and maintaining stream daylighting initiatives 60 6 there is a need to shift the focus of the empirical studies on stream daylighting from landmark projects like the cheonggyecheon stream in seoul to the less alluring and less well known initiatives among the latter is zürich s policy which resulted thus far in daylighting over 24 km throughout the city with significant results on a variety of fronts ecological e g flora and fauna ecosystem services for climate adaptation e g stormwater management built form e g public space and neighbourhood design and cultural e g local participation and the inclusion of the local ecological knowledge erz 24 7 building on the previous point there is a dire need for further empirical studies that focus on the global south such as regions where challenges like water scarcity are exacerbated by climate change such studies may lead to the emergence of new themes and sub themes like environmental and climate justice as well as more robust correlations among the various themes sub themes 8 finally and more importantly there is an urgent need for empirical studies that tackle stream daylighting as a nature based solution for the challenges that arise from climate change specifically studies should delve deeper into stream daylighting as an action that enhances the resilience of urban form in the face of the changing climate credit authorship contribution statement luna khirfan investigation conceptualization methodology formal

20142,since the start of stream daylighting deculverting streams buried to make way for urban development in the 1970s several case study project based reviews emerged yet there is a need for literature based reviews that identify the literature s themes interconnections pressing issues and knowledge gaps therefore we combine the systematic review and content analysis methods to investigate 115 peer reviewed and grey literature publications on stream daylighting our findings reveal temporal shifts in the multi inter disciplinary clustering patterns of the identified nine themes and 53 sub themes furthermore there is a dearth in this literature on built form and urban design inclusive planning and on case studies from the global south last the connections are absent between stream daylighting and nature based solutions and climate change adaptation e g vis à vis stormwater management urban heat island and rainwater harvesting and climate mitigation decreasing greenhouse gas emissions such as through enhancing the opportunities for walkability cycling and connections to transit keywords stream daylighting deculverting systematic review content analysis 1 introduction the unprecedented urban development since the twentieth century often overlooked urban ecosystems including urban streams and rivers which have been diverted straightened confined and channelled beyond recognition 1 iv environmental awareness brought the moral ethical and ecological consequences of development decisions under the limelight 2 simultaneously the adverse impacts of global climate change on cities such as floods heat waves and droughts heightened the importance of nature based solutions 1 1 nbs refers to the use of nature in tackling challenges such as climate change food security water resources or disaster risk management an overarching term that extends beyond conservation to incorporate the sustainable use of biodiversity 86 nbs for ecosystem services 3 4 stream daylighting is one such solution that refers to the practice of removing streams from buried conditions and exposing them to the earth s surface in order to directly or indirectly enhance the ecological economic and or socio cultural well being of a region and its inhabitants 5 10 accordingly stream daylighting has been ascribed to disciplines like socio ecology for the ecosystem services that benefit humans see 6 and hydro ecology for improved water quality and stormwater management see 7 10 although practiced since the 1970s daylighting received public attention with the increased interest in lost rivers including the reintroduction in 2004 of the lost cheonggyecheon stream in seoul south korea since the first peer reviewed publication in 1992 by charbonneau and resh however the stream daylighting literature has been dispersed over a wide array of disciplines and fragmented over multiple themes furthermore all existing reviews are case study project based see 1 11 13 hence warranting literature based reviews that critically examine the literature s trends intersections and future research trajectories more importantly the contemporary global climate change challenges warrant a review of the stream daylighting literature vis à vis shifting environmental perspectives and the integration of nature based solutions within urban areas accordingly we combine the systematic review and the content analysis methods to unravel the manifest and latent content of the literature on urban stream daylighting our findings identify the main themes and sub themes in the literature the discussions geographic scope and the case studies current omissions also provide opportunities for future empirical research including a need for cross inter disciplinary studies and for balancing the emphasis on case studies to present underrepresented cases furthermore there is a need for empirical studies that connect stream daylighting and climate change particularly its role as a nature based solution that provides valuable ecosystem services for adaptation e g stormwater management urban heat island and rainwater harvesting and for mitigation e g through walkability cycling and transit opportunities 2 the research methodology to date there are a handful of case study project based reviews that offer important insights the earliest pinkham 1 and buchholz younos 11 are professional reports grey literature that provide valuable insights by experienced professionals document the stream daylighting projects the then completed in the usa and evaluate these projects ecologically and socially three are peer reviewed whereby wild et al 12 and wild dempsey and broadhead 13 review stream daylighting projects globally while broadhead horn and lerner 14 investigate lost rivers captured in combined sewers all these reviews are case study project based that discuss best practices and engage practitioners in the collection of data thus while they offer valuable insights yet there remains a need for reviews that analyze the literature s manifest data explicit facts and figures and latent content hidden constructs and underlying trends see 15 accordingly this paper combines the systematic literature review and content analysis methods appendix a fig 1 by including all the literature that tackles stream daylighting and which was published between 1992 and 2018 the systematic review facilitates an understanding of the discourse s general scope and nature 15 16 also by scrutinizing the subject matter of the publications the content analysis facilitates an understanding of critical themes and the derivation of rich insights 17 22 our combined method followed four steps beginning with identifying the research questions and study objectives namely what are the dominant themes and sub themes in the stream daylighting literature and to what extent does the stream daylighting literature tackle climate change adaptation and mitigation second the literature research sought all the literature on stream daylighting using search engines like primo an academic search engine supported by google scholar and google the boolean search commenced with the following keywords stream river creek and brook combined with one or more of the root words daylight and or its synonyms deculvert and uncover we also used the keyword cheonggyecheon the well known lost stream that had been reintroduced in seoul s urban landscape based on the careful reading of these sources contents we observed that they referred to the cheonggyecheon as a restoration not as a daylighting project because the water was pumped from the nearby han river and from underground sources as opposed to being released from a culvert 23 subsequently the boolean search terms expanded to include the root words bury deculvert establish naturalize open reclaim recover regenerate rehabilitate renovate restore resurface revitalize uncover and or unearth concurrent with the boolean search we also supplemented our data collection by investigating the references cited in the yielded sources for their relevancy to stream daylighting as the sources accumulated priority was given to english language peer reviewed sources journal articles and university press publications however these were few therefore we expanded the search to the grey literature while assessing its quality through careful reading of each source s contents and scrutinizing the authors expertise and institutional affiliations resultantly the search yielded 115 sources that were published between 1992 and 2018 table 1 all these sources are in english except one german language 2 2 the principal investigator translated this report from german into english due to its relevance and significance especially given the dearth in sources on zürich s unique stream daylighting initiative professional report on the city of zürich s switzerland unique stream daylighting policy adopted since 1986 that thus far ensued in daylighting nearly 24 km 24 third we extracted organized coded and recorded the data in two files an excel document that recorded each source s manifest data i e explicit characteristics like title year type and location and a word document that open coded the latent content henceforth referred to simply as content the latter took the form of a standardized format for an annotated bibliography that organized thorough notes under headings i e a rule guided technique that controlled for researchers bias appendix a table 1 19 20 25 last we coded the headings from the word document latent content and combined them with the manifest data in the excel document in order to facilitate relational analysis distill grouping through sorting and collapsing dis similar headings and identify sub themes this combination of both datasets in one excel document increased our methodological rigour by converting the inductive categorization of the sub themes into quantitative metrics 20 we used alteryx a data management software to clean the excel document of data entry errors whereby the cleaned data became the analytical backbone of a database dashboard

analysis methodologies 26 the former summarizes and absorbs vast amounts of data 27 while the latter suits rigorous qualitative and quantitative analysis of textual data hence facilitates in depth understanding of multifaceted and multi disciplinary phenomena 17 and longitudinal analyses 17 19 28 yet both methods face inconsistencies in the literature s inclusion and exclusion criteria 29 while the substantial number of publications yielded by systematic literature search 30 renders the content analysis effort and time intensive see 17 20 22 28 31 32 we overcame these challenges through a clear replicable and user friendly protocol that ensured credibility truth value and objectivity transferability applicability and replicability and dependability consistency and accuracy the protocol included individual and team verification of notes extracted themes organization and coding categorization and careful documentation appendix a table 1 that collectively ascertained the presence of an

connections between built form and urban design ecology and hydrology providing ample opportunity for new empirical studies in areas like landscape ecological urbanism for example sub themes like urban form morphology and landscape design under built form and urban design could explore urban stream daylighting s contribution as a nature based solution to urban hydrology and ecology through stormwater management and rainwater harvesting water sensitive urban design that alleviates the urban heat island and connected and permeable public realm that is conducive to walkability cycling and transit thus far only a handful of articles explore these connections like the navigli canal s milan and the cheonggyecheon stream s seoul contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions managing excess stormwater and regulating urban temperature 10 47 57 59 5 conclusion in this paper we combined the methods of a systematic literature review with those of content analysis to offer a comprehensive review of english language articles except one german language government report by the city of zürich on stream daylighting that were published between 1992 and 2018 there has been thus far a lack of such a comprehensive effort that identifies codes and categorizes the various perspectives and topics in the stream daylighting literature the comprehensiveness of the systematic literature review combined with the in depth perspective of the content analysis approach facilitated a better understanding of the current status of research and writing on the daylighting deculverting of urban streams specifically it facilitated an identification of the themes their corresponding sub themes and their correlations to each other these nine dominant themes are ecology sociocultural hydrology infrastructure economics daylighting politics and policy inclusive planning and built form and urban design furthermore the combined methodology allowed for a better understanding of the stream daylighting case studies the geographical scope covered in the literature and the connections between stream daylighting and climate change adaptation and mitigation accordingly the analysis revealed the current research trends and the disciplinary connections that could be further enhanced in future studies as well as the current research gaps that warrant further empirical research namely 1 this study covered the peer reviewed and the grey literature but excluded policy documents multimedia media reports and social media e g recorded lectures documentaries print and online news reports blogs etc future reviews that include these sources would enrich our knowledge of stream daylighting 2 the literature on stream daylighting has been and continues to be inter multi disciplinary while the diversity of the sub themes continues to increase over time the prominence of the themes and their sub themes however continue to shift over time except for the ecology theme which persisted while its wildlife habitat and connectivity sub theme is currently gaining prominence there is a need for studies that analyze the reasons behind these shifts 3 there is a lack of disciplinary connections firstly between built form and urban design and nearly all of the other themes especially the ecology and hydrology themes and secondly between the more frequently discussed themes in the literature i e ecology sociocultural hydrology infrastructure and economics and the less frequently discussed ones i e daylighting politics and policy and inclusive planning 4 while stream daylighting is an intervention that affects land uses there is still a need for empirical studies that investigate the connections between stream daylighting and the built form and urban design 5 the existing literature has yet to address the involvement of local stakeholders in stream daylighting projects hence the inclusive planning theme warrants explorations of how local inclusion and local ecological knowledge may contribute to planning implementing and maintaining stream daylighting initiatives 60 6 there is a need to shift the focus of the empirical studies on stream daylighting from landmark projects like the cheonggyecheon stream in seoul to the less alluring and less well known initiatives among the latter is zürich s policy which resulted thus far in daylighting over 24 km throughout the city with significant results on a variety of fronts ecological e g flora and fauna ecosystem services for climate adaptation e g stormwater management built form e g public space and neighbourhood design and cultural e g local participation and the inclusion of the local ecological knowledge erz 24 7 building on the previous point there is a dire need for further empirical studies that focus on the global south such as regions where challenges like water scarcity are exacerbated by climate change such studies may lead to the emergence of new themes and sub themes like environmental and climate justice as well as more robust correlations among the various themes sub themes 8 finally and more importantly there is an urgent need for empirical studies that tackle stream daylighting as a nature based solution for the challenges that arise from climate change specifically studies should delve deeper into stream daylighting as an action that enhances the resilience of urban form in the face of the changing climate credit authorship contribution statement luna khirfan investigation conceptualization methodology formal

20143,healthy rivers provide a broad range of services that benefit economies and communities but the concepts of water security as well as water management in practice have tended to focus on a narrow set of those services accomplishing the diverse objectives bundled under water security including water quantity and quality linkages with food security risk management and ecosystem conservation will require a more holistic valuing of rivers services coupled with policies and mechanisms to maintain and restore those values rivers have typically been viewed as sources of water to support irrigation water supply or hydropower while the water that rivers provide often has immense value to economies and thus it is this role where rivers are well represented within frameworks for water security rivers provide a diverse range of other services that encompass but extend beyond water as a resource that can be defined by volume or quality these services can also produce vital benefits for economies and communities and they are generated by rivers as complex biophysical systems not just as conduits for delivering water examples of these services include fisheries floodplains that reduce flood risk sediment delivery to deltas and components of the channel network that regulate water quantity and quality concepts such as natural capital and ecosystem services are intended to better value these services however the valuations produced are often not effectively integrated into decisions or management although rigorous science provides an important foundation for embedding the value of rivers within water security translating those values into management and policy will require the communication of river values into terms and numbers that matter to key audiences and the assembly of coalitions to translate value into action keywords rivers water security floodplains fisheries sediment valuing water 1 introduction as reflected by the creation of this journal water security has become a dominant concept in water resources management shaping both research and practice 14 53 although the simplest uses of the term water security equate it to ensuring adequate volumes of water for people s health and livelihoods various other definitions including the one used in this journal are broader and integrate a diverse range of objectives encompassing water quantity and quality as well as managing risks from water related natural disasters floods and droughts and maintaining water related ecosystems 24 as such water security is not strictly about water as a direct resource but also includes how water and its management influence a range of other resources and development goals including food security public safety and ecosystem conservation 5 despite this broader framing the concept of water security still often tends to be associated with the management of water quantity and provision of water 17 water security in practice i e policies and investment decisions for water management reflects this narrower framing and often emphasizes services delivered through water management infrastructure and thus may fall short of achieving more comprehensive objectives 61 in this paper we argue that water security has generally overlooked rivers and their full range of services that contribute to the comprehensive objectives bundled under water security including water quantity and quality ecosystem conservation and linkages with food security and risk management thus effectively achieving those broad and intertwined objectives will require more fully integrating rivers and their services into concepts of water security and the policies and management intended to achieve it here we focus on rivers in a much more comprehensive way than they are typically incorporated into concepts of water security and management and regulation more generally rivers have typically been viewed as sources of water that can be dammed diverted or otherwise tapped to provide water for irrigation municipal supply or industry other major traditional uses of rivers have included hydropower navigation and waste disposal while these more traditional uses of water from rivers have provided considerable benefits to economies and thus these aspects of rivers are well represented within frameworks for water security rivers provide a diverse range of other services beyond the delivery of water resources that can be defined by volume or quality these services are generated by rivers as complex biophysical systems not just as conduits for provisioning water that also produce vital benefits for economies and communities these other services arise from the distinct functional components of a river including 1 flows of water sediment and nutrients that vary over time 2 diverse morphological features such as floodplains that interact with those flows and 3 living organisms such as vegetation and fish with habitat and resources largely defined by those flows and morphological features further services from a river are not just a product of the channel at a given point but how the upstream channel network interacts with the surrounding landscape and connectivity within that network further discussion of the structures and relationships that define a river system is beyond the scope of this paper however the key point is that a river is not just a canal for moving water it is a dynamic system within which a range of biophysical processes produce diverse services that have value for ecosystems economies or both the traditional uses of rivers often conflict with these other services particularly when those uses are planned developed and operated without valuing or even recognizing this broader set of services to illustrate rivers are an important source of water for irrigation this value has generally been recognized by governments and many countries have made substantial investments in the infrastructure needed to dam rivers and divert and distribute river water to croplands thus the food security aspects of managing rivers for irrigation have been well recognized and are reflected within traditional concepts of water and food security however rivers are more than just flows of water they are flows of sediment and organisms which also have vital interactions with food security for example the nutrients bound to sediments promote food webs that support fisheries productivity in downstream habitats such as floodplains deltas and near shore coastal environments 3 sediment supplied from rivers is also crucial for creating and maintaining deltas which are among the most productive agricultural regions on earth and home to at least 500 million people 48 for example the mekong delta has a population of 21 million people and grows more than half of vietnam s rice crop 23 similarly a river in a given place is not just a point from which water can be withdrawn for various purposes but rather is one section of a connected channel network the ability of organisms such as fish to move within that network can have a strong influence on the productivity of a river ecosystem at any given point in the mekong river basin the majority of the fish biomass harvested annually in the world s most productive freshwater fishery comes from fish species that either migrate longitudinally e g upstream and downstream within the network or laterally between river and floodplain or both 23 these other food security related services from rivers have generally not been recognized or supported through formal policies and investment certainly far less so than the service of river water for irrigation 35 dams built to provide the traditional river benefits of irrigation and hydropower can block fish migration and trap sediment in their reservoirs depriving downstream deltas of the annual replenishment of sediment needed to counteract processes of compaction erosion and rising sea levels reservoirs trap more than 90 of sediment in some river systems and as such many river deltas are now sinking and shrinking 48 development of a set of hydropower dams proposed for the mekong could cut migratory fish biomass by nearly half 23 and would reduce sediment supply to less than 10 percent of the natural rate 44 due to this loss of sediment combined with compaction and rising sea level more than half of this economically crucial delta could be under water by 2100 43 the sediment and fish migration examples highlight how the failure to recognize value and manage for river services can undermine the broader objectives bundled under water security including food security and resilience to natural disasters for a river such as the mekong the relationship between water and food security is less about managing volumes of water for irrigation than it is about how flowing water in the form of a connected river system provides migratory pathways for fish and delivers sediment and nutrients to support agriculture on floodplains and the delta as illustrated by the mekong the infrastructure required for rivers traditional benefits can often cause major impacts to those benefits that arise from rivers as biophysical systems highlighting how the failure to fully incorporate the diverse values of rivers into decisions about water management can produce unintended and significant negative impacts reconciling these tradeoffs between various water and river benefits and achieving more balanced outcomes is one of the great challenges of water management and thus highly relevant to research and dialogue focused on water security 51 2 benefits from rivers tradeoffs valuing ecosystem services and integrating values into management rivers have traditionally been valued and thus managed for a relatively narrow set of uses including navigation flood control hydropower and water supply for irrigation and cities 35 these uses have provided considerable benefits including nearly 20 of global electricity generation from hydropower approximately a quarter of global food production from lands irrigated by rivers and drinking water for billions of people 33 while these uses have contributed to economic growth they have also been the primary causes of losses of other economic social and environmental benefits from rivers for example dams are consistently ranked among the leading contributors to the population declines of freshwater species and their increased risks of extinction 8 the loss of fisheries and capture of sediment 48 due primarily to dams two thirds of the world s longest rivers 1000 km are no longer considered free flowing 15 further nearly two thirds of global wetlands have been lost since 1900 10 due to these widespread modifications to and losses of rivers and other habitats freshwater species have declined dramatically such as an 83 decline in the populations of freshwater vertebrate species tracked by the living planet index 58 in response to the continued decline of freshwater ecosystems scientists and conservation organizations began to emphasize the various services that ecosystems provided to society and suggested that improved quantification and valuation of those services could promote improved management concepts such as ecosystem services were developed to more effectively quantify the diverse range of resources services and benefits provided by natural ecosystems including rivers 39 among global ecosystem types rivers and river dependent ecosystems such as wetlands floodplains and estuaries provide among the greatest per hectare value of ecosystem services 6 7 these services include four that we feature below clean water sediment fisheries and the regulation of flood flows along with carbon and nutrient sequestration fiber production biodiversity and a range of cultural spiritual and recreational values 2 the methods and tools to quantify ecosystem services have evolved rapidly these methods include techniques to translate rivers diverse benefits into monetary and non monetary values despite progress on quantifying ecosystem services the influence of this valuation on decisions has remained limited in part due to the inherent challenges of translating science into policy 29 38 16 specifically for rivers the disconnect between ecosystem service values and decision making reflects the fact that more traditional management objectives of rivers such as irrigation and hydropower produce benefits that can be monetized and accrue to well defined interests while many of their associated costs such as the loss of fisheries are externalized in contrast rivers broader benefits are often diffuse and poorly defined and therefore difficult to quantify or monetize 13 even though ecosystem service valuations are often expressed in terms of units of currency e g usd they frequently quantify services that cannot be readily monetized within conventional markets and often lack a clear decision making context as such they remain common pool resources subject to government policy and management 56 7 thus methods for valuing rivers ecosystem services may be necessary but not sufficient for improving how rivers are integrated into water security and water management 51 similarly cook and bakker 5 describe the challenge of operationalizing broader definitions of water security e g those that could incorporate the ecosystem values of rivers they note that when put into practice broad definitions of water security tend to narrow due to the inherent difficulties of integrating diverse values into decisions and management research on the enabling conditions for successful integration of ecosystem service valuations into decisions and management can provide insight into how rivers diverse benefits can be incorporated into water security and water management posner et al 38 examined the extent to which ecosystem service valuations were incorporated into policy and management and concluded that the credibility of the science e g the rigor of methods was not a significant predictor of influence rather the most influential factor was the legitimacy of knowledge which reflected the processes through which the science was developed they found that the legitimacy of knowledge was enhanced through the co production of knowledge with stakeholders and the inclusion of diverse perspectives the importance of stakeholder inclusion co creation of information and transparency has been confirmed by several other studies 62 9 36 primmer et al 40 found that incorporation of ecosystem service valuations into policy required translating valuations into terms and concepts well understood to decision makers and relevant to their specific missions pittock et al 37 focused on the enabling conditions associated with effective policies and decision making for balancing objectives for water energy and food within river basin management they reported a similar set of conditions as the studies on effective integration of ecosystem service valuations including consistent inclusion of diverse stakeholders and transparency they also found that decisions based on strict economic analysis can underestimate risk and disruption to values such as the social stability of rural communities that decision makers may ultimately prioritize more than the economic numbers revealed in a cost benefit analysis thus although science based quantification of rivers ecosystem services provides an important foundation for embedding the value of rivers within water security translating those values into management and policy will require co development of information with engaged stakeholders the communication of river values into concepts and terms that matter to those stakeholders and to decision makers and the assembly of coalitions to translate value into action in the following sub sections we examine a set of river resources and services that have traditionally been overlooked in concepts of water security and undervalued by management and decision makers for each we summarize how the services are a function of rivers as complex biophysical systems that is how they transcend the value of a volume of water in the river recognizing the limitations of simply quantifying ecosystem service values in influencing management decisions we also describe how these services can be translated into terms and concepts that are important to various stakeholders and decision makers 2 1 river fisheries rivers support some of the most productive fisheries in the world including the mekong river with an annual harvest that exceeds 3 million tons and is valued at us 17 billion per year 28 river fisheries support much of the nearly 12 million tons of freshwater fish harvested globally each year sufficient to provide the primary source of protein for 160 million people and supporting livelihoods for 60 million people with 55 percent of those being women 27 11 these global estimates are likely very conservative because harvest statistics for freshwater fisheries are generally underreported river fisheries provide the most important source of protein for several countries in southeast asia including cambodia and myanmar and are important sources of protein and nutrients in several other regions including the amazon and across south asia and parts of africa 12 several natural features and processes of rivers are responsible for the high productivity of riverine fisheries including floodplain habitats connected to the river and a natural flow regime that can periodically inundate those floodplains rivers that retain these features tend to be considerably more productive than those or other freshwater habitats such as reservoirs that lack them a phenomenon known as the flood pulse advantage 4 however freshwater fisheries are consistently undervalued by decision makers often because in many countries much of the total harvest occurs outside of formal markets 25 similarly freshwater fisheries are generally poorly recognized within governance processes for example the sustainable development goals includes a specific target for marine fisheries but not for freshwater fisheries 52 although the value of fish harvests can be expressed in monetary terms as noted these estimates are generally considerably lower than their actual value to people due to underreporting and may have lower financial values than proposed river developments such as hydropower that could jeopardize fisheries to move beyond estimates of monetary values riverine fisheries resources can be translated into terms that are relevant for those responsible for rural food security and social stability including government ministries and multilateral development and financial institutions for example because fish harvests provide a source of low cost and widely available protein and source of income for rural people they increase the spending power of low income communities and contribute to social stability 57 further the value of river fisheries can be converted into units of the land and water resources that would be required to replace the lost protein from capture fisheries with protein from aquaculture or livestock while the monetary value of river fisheries may seem replaceable to a decision maker particularly when that value is less than the revenue that would be derived from development such as hydropower within a traditional cost benefit framework values such as rural food security and social stability may resonate more strongly with decision makers who are concerned about competition for land and water orr et al 34 found that offsetting the fisheries protein lost should mainstem dams be built on the mekong would require increases in water use of up to 64 and 24 and increases in pasture land up to 20 and 42 in cambodia and laos respectively 2 2 sediment rivers deliver sediments including sand and gravel to floodplains and deltas a crucial contribution to the stability of these areas and to water security a river system s ability to deliver sediment results from natural processes and characteristics that occur at the scale of an entire river basin a river s sediment budget includes terrestrial as well as fluvial processes including hillslope and bank erosion sediment transport deposition and remobilization all of which eventually create connectivity between upland sources of sediment and downstream areas of deposition river infrastructure disrupts lateral and longitudinal sediment connectivity in rivers for example levees can prevent sediment from being deposited on floodplains and deltas and the reservoirs behind dams can capture sediment in transport nearly a quarter of global annual sediment flux is now captured by reservoirs in some river basins nearly all e g 98 of sediment is trapped by reservoirs and globally the sediment trapping in dams outweighs the effect of increased erosion resulting in a net reduction of sediment fluxes to floodplains deltas and oceans 47 sand mining can also reduce rivers sediment supply globally between 30 and 50 billion tons of sand and gravel are mined each year primarily for construction materials with rivers as the leading source 46 the loss of river transported sediment poses specific risks for agriculture public safety and a range of processes in rivers and river deltas that are directly related to water security along river courses reduced loads of sediment change morphodynamics often resulting in changes in channel patterns and incision i e the lowering of the river bed incision then hinders gravity driven irrigation and destabilizes river banks resulting in losses of residential and commercial property 19 where rivers meet the ocean deltas support a population of over 500 million people and some of the world s most productive agricultural areas river deltas are among the most economically important regions in many countries due to their extremely high values in terms of population agricultural productivity and gdp thus maintaining the flow of sediment in rivers is a key strategy for mitigating the impacts of climate change on deltas people and national economies to remain above the sea level deltas require continued replenishment of sediment to offset erosion compaction and rising sea levels from climate change 49 a delta with diminished sediment supply will begin to sink and shrink increasing the risk from flooding and storm surges for cities and communities further agriculture can decline due to lost land and the intrusion of saltwater into both surface and groundwater due to both reservoir capture and unregulated and high levels of sand mining sediment supply to many river deltas has declined dramatically including the yangtze mekong and nile 48 in addition to the negative impacts on deltas the loss of sand from rivers also reduces the amount delivered to the oceans and coastal habitats depleted sediment supply can lead to a loss of beaches and coastal sand dunes which act as buffers that protect people and property from natural disasters such as tropical cyclones and storm surges because excess erosion from poorly managed landscapes can negatively impact water quality sediment retention on hillslopes e g by forests has been the primary sediment related ecosystem service considered within water security while important this initial emphasis on avoiding sediments in rivers for purposes of water quality may have contributed to the lack of awareness from decision makers that natural rates of sediment transport and delivery are crucial to many other objectives the range of benefits that rivers provide in terms of delivering sediment is still generally overlooked by decision makers in many systems sediment budgets are not measured or monitored and sediment does not appear to be reflected in decisions about investment and infrastructure for example the government of vietnam has supported hydropower projects on the mekong river or key tributaries that will have considerable negative impacts on the viability of the mekong delta which produces ¼ of vietnam s gdp 23 to increase the priority given by decision makers to rivers and sediment the value of maintaining sediment delivery can be framed in terms of public safety and agricultural productivity this narrative does appear to be having some influence on the government of vietnam in their recent actions and statements for example the state sponsored english language newspaper vietnam news published a commentary urging a vietnamese company to reconsider its support for a mekong dam noting while hydropower projects can promote economic development the potential hit to food security and agricultural productivity from decreased sediment flowwill trigger higher poverty levels and climate vulnerability 55 further the vietnamese government has formally signaled that it will focus on threats to the mekong delta from upstream dams at meetings of the association of southeast asian nations asean 26 2 3 flood risk reduction of floodplains recent analyses forecast that even relatively small increases in the global average temperature can increase the frequency of damaging floods 21 beyond climate change the number of people at risk from floods is also increasing due to continued population growth within flood prone areas approximately half of new urban development by 2030 will occur within areas with elevated risks of flooding translating to an additional extent of urban development the size of spain 500 000 square kilometers that will be at risk of floods 18 development on floodplains generally includes construction of levees which results in a reduction in the area available to convey floodwaters a reduction of conveyance and potentially an increase in flood hazard up or downstream 20 in regions with mature flood management systems the physical infrastructure including dams and levees are often deteriorating due to insufficient budgets for maintenance and rehabilitation further various changes in land use including urbanization the filling of wetlands and conversion of forest to agriculture increases the intensity of runoff and flood risk 41 traditionally decisions about flood management have focused on engineered structures such as levees floodwalls and dams however a consensus is now emerging that flood managers should pursue a diversified portfolio approach to manage both the rise in flood risk and society s broader expectations of services from rivers and floodplains 41 a diversified portfolio approach will still include engineered structures but will fully consider and integrate non structural measures such as improved zoning building codes and insurance as well as investments in green infrastructure or nature based solutions including wetlands and floodplains 31 riverine examples of nature based solutions include the maintenance or reconnection of large areas of floodplain connected to rivers to store or convey floodwaters and attenuate peak flows while engineered infrastructure such as a levee generally provides a single local benefit flood risk reduction it can potentially increase flood hazards elsewhere and often causes negative impacts on other river values in contrast green infrastructure often provides multiple benefits for example connected floodplains can provide flood risk reduction but also provide a range of other benefits including nutrient retention groundwater recharge habitat for fish and wildlife and recreation 30 the yolo bypass in the valley of the sacramento river california usa illustrates these diverse benefits the bypass is a 25 000 hectare area of historic floodplain that was reconnected to the sacramento river in the 1920s during major flood events approximately 80 of the volume of floodwaters is conveyed by the bypass dramatically reducing flood risk for the city of sacramento and much of the surrounding region much of the bypass remains in productive agriculture and it also provides the best remaining lowland floodplain habitat in the sacramento valley for native birds and fish 45 in addition to the sacramento river there are several other examples including the lower mississippi river where flood management originally focused on containing rivers within levees and then following repeated floods engineers reconnected portions of the historic floodplain to provide more room for floodwaters 31 despite these examples only a relatively small amount of global investment in flood management is going into nature based solutions or green infrastructure however in regions where governments have multiple objectives for rivers encompassing both flood risk reduction and ecosystem restoration the multiple benefits of floodplains are gaining increasing attention in the netherlands a room for the river approach has been adopted that incorporates more floodplain storage and conveyance with associated benefits for ecosystems within a system that is intensely managed by engineered infrastructure in california planners are confronted with strong pressures to both reduce flood risk and restore ecosystems and the state has passed several bond funding packages and policies such as the central valley flood protection plan 2017 update that mandate multiple benefit floodplain projects similarly recent evolution of flood management in germany has included increasing attention on levee relocation to expand the extent of floodplains that can be flooded due to the convergence of goals 1 the restoration of an important habitat type now rare in germany and 2 for the flood risk reduction that habitat type can provide 50 these multiple benefit approaches to river and floodplain management in the europe and california share two characteristics 1 governments striving to achieve multiple objectives from rivers including environmental restoration and 2 planners that realize the limitations to continued reliance on building higher and stronger levees in the face of climate change and associated uncertainty of future risk this recognition of diverse values and the need for greater system flexibility to manage in the face of uncertainty reflect the integrative approach to water security described by zeitoun et al 61 and can serve as examples to countries currently undergoing development of their flood management systems 2 4 improved water quantity and quality from ecosystem processes within river systems global water demand has been increasing at approximately 1 percent per year and will continue to increase due to population growth and water intensive shifts in consumption e g toward more meat in diets studies consistently forecast a gap between future supply and demand and climate change will likely exacerbate these challenges in many regions of the world for example schlosser et al 42 forecast that approximately half the world s population will live in regions with water stress by 2050 a set of natural features of rivers and their basins are critical to maintaining water quantity and quality this green infrastructure includes forested watersheds with deep soils that increase infiltration of precipitation and reduce excessive surface erosion and levels and sediment and nutrients that enter water supplies wetlands also retain nutrients and sediment and so strategically placed wetlands can improve water quality in agricultural regions floodwaters that spread across floodplains contribute to groundwater recharge and can be managed in coordination with reservoirs that store water for irrigation 54 this green infrastructure clearly does not replace but rather complements engineered infrastructure within water supply systems however water supply managers have generally underinvested in green infrastructure within the river basins that generate the water that is managed by reservoirs and water treatment plants abell et al 1 found that 40 of the watersheds that provide water to cities had high to moderate levels of degradation they further found that most cities had the potential to reduce nutrients and sediment in their water supply through investments in forests and or better management of upstream agriculture as described above for floodplains investments in the green infrastructure of river basins can provide other diverse benefits including carbon sequestration and habitat for wildlife the 2018 world water development report from un water called for increased investments in green infrastructure nature based solutions to improve management of water supplies in the context of climate change and growing demands the report recommends a range of green infrastructure investments that use natural features and processes to increase water quantity e g recharging groundwater and retaining water in soils and water quality e g wetlands cape town which received extensive global media coverage of its historic drought provides a compelling example of how investments in the green infrastructure of river basins can complement engineered solutions while further investments in engineered infrastructure such as groundwater pumping or desalination will be necessary cape town and other parts of south africa would benefit from restoration of native vegetation within water supply watersheds non native species such as eucalyptus evapotranspire more water than do native plants removal of non natives and replacement with native vegetation could provide an additional increment of water supply at a lower cost than most other interventions 60 3 conclusion services created by rivers as biophysical systems deliver significant financial and economic benefits that contribute to the diverse objectives encompassed by water security frameworks however the management of water resources and rivers rarely prioritizes these services even as methods for valuing them have improved as a result these other benefits and freshwater ecosystems in general have declined dramatically in much of the world 52 here we suggest these losses are not the inevitable collateral damage that must be accepted as part of development to ensure water security rather river management that strives to encompass the full range of benefits from rivers can reduce risks and produce much more balanced and long lasting outcomes 32 31 reconciling traditional benefits such as hydropower and water supply with the benefits that arise from healthy rivers is the essential challenge for river management the premise of this paper is that the full goals of water security require this reconciliation because the various services produced by rivers as complex biophysical systems are central to the broader range of objectives pursued under the concept of water security such as food security and public safety we recommend fully integrating rivers into frameworks for water security water security as defined in this journal extends beyond water quantity and quality to encompass other objectives that intersect with water including food security managing of risk from natural disasters and the conservation of aquatic ecosystems and their services this expanded definition clearly encompasses the river services featured in this paper integrative approaches to water security such as that proposed by zeitoun et al 61 emphasizing the inclusion of diverse voices and values transparency and adaptive approaches to management under uncertainty should be conducive to the comprehensive integration of rivers into water security however in practice water security tends to focus on water quantity e g see commentary by gunda et al 17 that water security generally remains limited to quantity to the functional exclusion of other objectives even water quality and considers rivers in terms of the volumes of water they can provide and emphasizes engineered infrastructure as the primary solution to increase security 61 this narrower treatment of rivers in water security and management risks holding back the intended expansion of the concept of water security and broader development objectives more generally such as the sustainable development goals sdgs in contrast a broader definition of water security if translated into management could contribute to policies and programs that achieve a greater diversity of benefits from rivers 51 and help achieve the sdgs with their intertwined objectives for economic social and environmental progress while methods to quantify the ecosystem service values of rivers can provide important information for decision making processes on its own the availability of these valuations often does not move decisions toward more comprehensive management of river benefits keys for integrating valuations into decision making and management include the participation of diverse stakeholders at key points the co creation of information and the framing of values in terms and concepts that are tailored to the objectives of various decision makers note that these values do not need to be translated into the same units such as currency navigating tradeoffs is an essential challenge for successfully incorporating diverse values into decision making for sustainable and inclusive water management 13 multi objective analysis can incorporate values using different units thus not requiring that all the values are monetized which can be difficult or controversial for some resources 22 decision makers can then compare how different decision options such as alternate combinations of investments and management perform across the various objectives 32 although quantifying value can improve management decisions we believe that to who and how rivers values are communicated are as or more important than the numerical quantification rivers diverse values must be framed as directly relevant to the economic sectors and trends that decision makers prioritize such as employment public safety economic growth and social stability 40 in other words the services delivered by rivers as biophysical systems cannot remain siloed as environmental accordingly the decision makers who understand these connections must expand beyond those within the ministries for water and environment to include those who manage or invest in other sectors such as agriculture and public safety 37 currently the leaders of various ministries and companies whose objectives are strongly influenced by rivers often do not recognize the extent to which their objectives are influenced by rivers and the risks they face if they are mismanaged quantifying values and then framing those values in ways that are directly relevant to decision makers will help them understand these linkages this process is illustrated by the translation of river fisheries into terms of the land and water required to replace them and the implications for resource competition and social stability 34 this approach can potentially produce more diverse coalition to advocate for sustainable management of rivers including the decisions and investments that will contribute to water security in pursuit of building such coalitions wwf has coordinated rivers in the economy processes in several regions to directly engage diverse stakeholders and decision makers including those from sectors not traditionally involved in water management debates to collectively discuss the contribution of rivers to societal benefits and economic gain and to identify shared solutions 57 59 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

20143,healthy rivers provide a broad range of services that benefit economies and communities but the concepts of water security as well as water management in practice have tended to focus on a narrow set of those services accomplishing the diverse objectives bundled under water security including water quantity and quality linkages with food security risk management and ecosystem conservation will require a more holistic valuing of rivers services coupled with policies and mechanisms to maintain and restore those values rivers have typically been viewed as sources of water to support irrigation water supply or hydropower while the water that rivers provide often has immense value to economies and thus it is this role where rivers are well represented within frameworks for water security rivers provide a diverse range of other services that encompass but extend beyond water as a resource that can be defined by volume or quality these services can also produce vital benefits for economies and communities and they are generated by rivers as complex biophysical systems not just as conduits for delivering water examples of these services include fisheries floodplains that reduce flood risk sediment delivery to deltas and components of the channel network that regulate water quantity and quality concepts such as natural capital and ecosystem services are intended to better value these services however the valuations produced are often not effectively integrated into decisions or management although rigorous science provides an important foundation for embedding the value of rivers within water security translating those values into management and policy will require the communication of river values into terms and numbers that matter to key audiences and the assembly of coalitions to translate value into action keywords rivers water security floodplains fisheries sediment valuing water 1 introduction as reflected by the creation of this journal water security has become a dominant concept in water resources management shaping both research and practice 14 53 although the simplest uses of the term water security equate it to ensuring adequate volumes of water for people s health and livelihoods various other definitions including the one used in this journal are broader and integrate a diverse range of objectives encompassing water quantity and quality as well as managing risks from water related natural disasters floods and droughts and maintaining water related ecosystems 24 as such water security is not strictly about water as a direct resource but also includes how water and its management influence a range of other resources and development goals including food security public safety and ecosystem conservation 5 despite this broader framing the concept of water security still often tends to be associated with the management of water quantity and provision of water 17 water security in practice i e policies and investment decisions for water management reflects this narrower framing and often emphasizes services delivered through water management infrastructure and thus may fall short of achieving more comprehensive objectives 61 in this paper we argue that water security has generally overlooked rivers and their full range of services that contribute to the comprehensive objectives bundled under water security including water quantity and quality ecosystem conservation and linkages with food security and risk management thus effectively achieving those broad and intertwined objectives will require more fully integrating rivers and their services into concepts of water security and the policies and management intended to achieve it here we focus on rivers in a much more comprehensive way than they are typically incorporated into concepts of water security and management and regulation more generally rivers have typically been viewed as sources of water that can be dammed diverted or otherwise tapped to provide water for irrigation municipal supply or industry other major traditional uses of rivers have included hydropower navigation and waste disposal while these more traditional uses of water from rivers have provided considerable benefits to economies and thus these aspects of rivers are well represented within frameworks for water security rivers provide a diverse range of other services beyond the delivery of water resources that can be defined by volume or quality these services are generated by rivers as complex biophysical systems not just as conduits for provisioning water that also produce vital benefits for economies and communities these other services arise from the distinct functional components of a river including 1 flows of water sediment and nutrients that vary over time 2 diverse morphological features such as floodplains that interact with those flows and 3 living organisms such as vegetation and fish with habitat and resources largely defined by those flows and morphological features further services from a river are not just a product of the channel at a given point but how the upstream channel network interacts with the surrounding landscape and connectivity within that network further discussion of the structures and relationships that define a river system is beyond the scope of this paper however the key point is that a river is not just a canal for moving water it is a dynamic system within which a range of biophysical processes produce diverse services that have value for ecosystems economies or both the traditional uses of rivers often conflict with these other services particularly when those uses are planned developed and operated without valuing or even recognizing this broader set of services to illustrate rivers are an important source of water for irrigation this value has generally been recognized by governments and many countries have made substantial investments in the infrastructure needed to dam rivers and divert and distribute river water to croplands thus the food security aspects of managing rivers for irrigation have been well recognized and are reflected within traditional concepts of water and food security however rivers are more than just flows of water they are flows of sediment and organisms which also have vital interactions with food security for example the nutrients bound to sediments promote food webs that support fisheries productivity in downstream habitats such as floodplains deltas and near shore coastal environments 3 sediment supplied from rivers is also crucial for creating and maintaining deltas which are among the most productive agricultural regions on earth and home to at least 500 million people 48 for example the mekong delta has a population of 21 million people and grows more than half of vietnam s rice crop 23 similarly a river in a given place is not just a point from which water can be withdrawn for various purposes but rather is one section of a connected channel network the ability of organisms such as fish to move within that network can have a strong influence on the productivity of a river ecosystem at any given point in the mekong river basin the majority of the fish biomass harvested annually in the world s most productive freshwater fishery comes from fish species that either migrate longitudinally e g upstream and downstream within the network or laterally between river and floodplain or both 23 these other food security related services from rivers have generally not been recognized or supported through formal policies and investment certainly far less so than the service of river water for irrigation 35 dams built to provide the traditional river benefits of irrigation and hydropower can block fish migration and trap sediment in their reservoirs depriving downstream deltas of the annual replenishment of sediment needed to counteract processes of compaction erosion and rising sea levels reservoirs trap more than 90 of sediment in some river systems and as such many river deltas are now sinking and shrinking 48 development of a set of hydropower dams proposed for the mekong could cut migratory fish biomass by nearly half 23 and would reduce sediment supply to less than 10 percent of the natural rate 44 due to this loss of sediment combined with compaction and rising sea level more than half of this economically crucial delta could be under water by 2100 43 the sediment and fish migration examples highlight how the failure to recognize value and manage for river services can undermine the broader objectives bundled under water security including food security and resilience to natural disasters for a river such as the mekong the relationship between water and food security is less about managing volumes of water for irrigation than it is about how flowing water in the form of a connected river system provides migratory pathways for fish and delivers sediment and nutrients to support agriculture on floodplains and the delta as illustrated by the mekong the infrastructure required for rivers traditional benefits can often cause major impacts to those benefits that arise from rivers as biophysical systems highlighting how the failure to fully incorporate the diverse values of rivers into decisions about water management can produce unintended and significant negative impacts reconciling these tradeoffs between various water and river benefits and achieving more balanced outcomes is one of the great challenges of water management and thus highly relevant to research and dialogue focused on water security 51 2 benefits from rivers tradeoffs valuing ecosystem services and integrating values into management rivers have traditionally been valued and thus managed for a relatively narrow set of uses including navigation flood control hydropower and water supply for irrigation and cities 35 these uses have provided considerable benefits including nearly 20 of global electricity generation from hydropower approximately a quarter of global food production from lands irrigated by rivers and drinking water for billions of people 33 while these uses have contributed to economic growth they have also been the primary causes of losses of other economic social and environmental benefits from rivers for example dams are consistently ranked among the leading contributors to the population declines of freshwater species and their increased risks of extinction 8 the loss of fisheries and capture of sediment 48 due primarily to dams two thirds of the world s longest rivers 1000 km are no longer considered free flowing 15 further nearly two thirds of global wetlands have been lost since 1900 10 due to these widespread modifications to and losses of rivers and other habitats freshwater species have declined dramatically such as an 83 decline in the populations of freshwater vertebrate species tracked by the living planet index 58 in response to the continued decline of freshwater ecosystems scientists and conservation organizations began to emphasize the various services that ecosystems provided to society and suggested that improved quantification and valuation of those services could promote improved management concepts such as ecosystem services were developed to more effectively quantify the diverse range of resources services and benefits provided by natural ecosystems including rivers 39 among global ecosystem types rivers and river dependent ecosystems such as wetlands floodplains and estuaries provide among the greatest per hectare value of ecosystem services 6 7 these services include four that we feature below clean water sediment fisheries and the regulation of flood flows along with carbon and nutrient sequestration fiber production biodiversity and a range of cultural spiritual and recreational values 2 the methods and tools to quantify ecosystem services have evolved rapidly these methods include techniques to translate rivers diverse benefits into monetary and non monetary values despite progress on quantifying ecosystem services the influence of this valuation on decisions has remained limited in part due to the inherent challenges of translating science into policy 29 38 16 specifically for rivers the disconnect between ecosystem service values and decision making reflects the fact that more traditional management objectives of rivers such as irrigation and hydropower produce benefits that can be monetized and accrue to well defined interests while many of their associated costs such as the loss of fisheries are externalized in contrast rivers broader benefits are often diffuse and poorly defined and therefore difficult to quantify or monetize 13 even though ecosystem service valuations are often expressed in terms of units of currency e g usd they frequently quantify services that cannot be readily monetized within conventional markets and often lack a clear decision making context as such they remain common pool resources subject to government policy and management 56 7 thus methods for valuing rivers ecosystem services may be necessary but not sufficient for improving how rivers are integrated into water security and water management 51 similarly cook and bakker 5 describe the challenge of operationalizing broader definitions of water security e g those that could incorporate the ecosystem values of rivers they note that when put into practice broad definitions of water security tend to narrow due to the inherent difficulties of integrating diverse values into decisions and management research on the enabling conditions for successful integration of ecosystem service valuations into decisions and management can provide insight into how rivers diverse benefits can be incorporated into water security and water management posner et al 38 examined the extent to which ecosystem service valuations were incorporated into policy and management and concluded that the credibility of the science e g the rigor of methods was not a significant predictor of influence rather the most influential factor was the legitimacy of knowledge which reflected the processes through which the science was developed they found that the legitimacy of knowledge was enhanced through the co production of knowledge with stakeholders and the inclusion of diverse perspectives the importance of stakeholder inclusion co creation of information and transparency has been confirmed by several other studies 62 9 36 primmer et al 40 found that incorporation of ecosystem service valuations into policy required translating valuations into terms and concepts well understood to decision makers and relevant to their specific missions pittock et al 37 focused on the enabling conditions associated with effective policies and decision making for balancing objectives for water energy and food within river basin management they reported a similar set of conditions as the studies on effective integration of ecosystem service valuations including consistent inclusion of diverse stakeholders and transparency they also found that decisions based on strict economic analysis can underestimate risk and disruption to values such as the social stability of rural communities that decision makers may ultimately prioritize more than the economic numbers revealed in a cost benefit analysis thus although science based quantification of rivers ecosystem services provides an important foundation for embedding the value of rivers within water security translating those values into management and policy will require co development of information with engaged stakeholders the communication of river values into concepts and terms that matter to those stakeholders and to decision makers and the assembly of coalitions to translate value into action in the following sub sections we examine a set of river resources and services that have traditionally been overlooked in concepts of water security and undervalued by management and decision makers for each we summarize how the services are a function of rivers as complex biophysical systems that is how they transcend the value of a volume of water in the river recognizing the limitations of simply quantifying ecosystem service values in influencing management decisions we also describe how these services can be translated into terms and concepts that are important to various stakeholders and decision makers 2 1 river fisheries rivers support some of the most productive fisheries in the world including the mekong river with an annual harvest that exceeds 3 million tons and is valued at us 17 billion per year 28 river fisheries support much of the nearly 12 million tons of freshwater fish harvested globally each year sufficient to provide the primary source of protein for 160 million people and supporting livelihoods for 60 million people with 55 percent of those being women 27 11 these global estimates are likely very conservative because harvest statistics for freshwater fisheries are generally underreported river fisheries provide the most important source of protein for several countries in southeast asia including cambodia and myanmar and are important sources of protein and nutrients in several other regions including the amazon and across south asia and parts of africa 12 several natural features and processes of rivers are responsible for the high productivity of riverine fisheries including floodplain habitats connected to the river and a natural flow regime that can periodically inundate those floodplains rivers that retain these features tend to be considerably more productive than those or other freshwater habitats such as reservoirs that lack them a phenomenon known as the flood pulse advantage 4 however freshwater fisheries are consistently undervalued by decision makers often because in many countries much of the total harvest occurs outside of formal markets 25 similarly freshwater fisheries are generally poorly recognized within governance processes for example the sustainable development goals includes a specific target for marine fisheries but not for freshwater fisheries 52 although the value of fish harvests can be expressed in monetary terms as noted these estimates are generally considerably lower than their actual value to people due to underreporting and may have lower financial values than proposed river developments such as hydropower that could jeopardize fisheries to move beyond estimates of monetary values riverine fisheries resources can be translated into terms that are relevant for those responsible for rural food security and social stability including government ministries and multilateral development and financial institutions for example because fish harvests provide a source of low cost and widely available protein and source of income for rural people they increase the spending power of low income communities and contribute to social stability 57 further the value of river fisheries can be converted into units of the land and water resources that would be required to replace the lost protein from capture fisheries with protein from aquaculture or livestock while the monetary value of river fisheries may seem replaceable to a decision maker particularly when that value is less than the revenue that would be derived from development such as hydropower within a traditional cost benefit framework values such as rural food security and social stability may resonate more strongly with decision makers who are concerned about competition for land and water orr et al 34 found that offsetting the fisheries protein lost should mainstem dams be built on the mekong would require increases in water use of up to 64 and 24 and increases in pasture land up to 20 and 42 in cambodia and laos respectively 2 2 sediment rivers deliver sediments including sand and gravel to floodplains and deltas a crucial contribution to the stability of these areas and to water security a river system s ability to deliver sediment results from natural processes and characteristics that occur at the scale of an entire river basin a river s sediment budget includes terrestrial as well as fluvial processes including hillslope and bank erosion sediment transport deposition and remobilization all of which eventually create connectivity between upland sources of sediment and downstream areas of deposition river infrastructure disrupts lateral and longitudinal sediment connectivity in rivers for example levees can prevent sediment from being deposited on floodplains and deltas and the reservoirs behind dams can capture sediment in transport nearly a quarter of global annual sediment flux is now captured by reservoirs in some river basins nearly all e g 98 of sediment is trapped by reservoirs and globally the sediment trapping in dams outweighs the effect of increased erosion resulting in a net reduction of sediment fluxes to floodplains deltas and oceans 47 sand mining can also reduce rivers sediment supply globally between 30 and 50 billion tons of sand and gravel are mined each year primarily for construction materials with rivers as the leading source 46 the loss of river transported sediment poses specific risks for agriculture public safety and a range of processes in rivers and river deltas that are directly related to water security along river courses reduced loads of sediment change morphodynamics often resulting in changes in channel patterns and incision i e the lowering of the river bed incision then hinders gravity driven irrigation and destabilizes river banks resulting in losses of residential and commercial property 19 where rivers meet the ocean deltas support a population of over 500 million people and some of the world s most productive agricultural areas river deltas are among the most economically important regions in many countries due to their extremely high values in terms of population agricultural productivity and gdp thus maintaining the flow of sediment in rivers is a key strategy for mitigating the impacts of climate change on deltas people and national economies to remain above the sea level deltas require continued replenishment of sediment to offset erosion compaction and rising sea levels from climate change 49 a delta with diminished sediment supply will begin to sink and shrink increasing the risk from flooding and storm surges for cities and communities further agriculture can decline due to lost land and the intrusion of saltwater into both surface and groundwater due to both reservoir capture and unregulated and high levels of sand mining sediment supply to many river deltas has declined dramatically including the yangtze mekong and nile 48 in addition to the negative impacts on deltas the loss of sand from rivers also reduces the amount delivered to the oceans and coastal habitats depleted sediment supply can lead to a loss of beaches and coastal sand dunes which act as buffers that protect people and property from natural disasters such as tropical cyclones and storm surges because excess erosion from poorly managed landscapes can negatively impact water quality sediment retention on hillslopes e g by forests has been the primary sediment related ecosystem service considered within water security while important this initial emphasis on avoiding sediments in rivers for purposes of water quality may have contributed to the lack of awareness from decision makers that natural rates of sediment transport and delivery are crucial to many other objectives the range of benefits that rivers provide in terms of delivering sediment is still generally overlooked by decision makers in many systems sediment budgets are not measured or monitored and sediment does not appear to be reflected in decisions about investment and infrastructure for example the government of vietnam has supported hydropower projects on the mekong river or key tributaries that will have considerable negative impacts on the viability of the mekong delta which produces ¼ of vietnam s gdp 23 to increase the priority given by decision makers to rivers and sediment the value of maintaining sediment delivery can be framed in terms of public safety and agricultural productivity this narrative does appear to be having some influence on the government of vietnam in their recent actions and statements for example the state sponsored english language newspaper vietnam news published a commentary urging a vietnamese company to reconsider its support for a mekong dam noting while hydropower projects can promote economic development the potential hit to food security and agricultural productivity from decreased sediment flowwill trigger higher poverty levels and climate vulnerability 55 further the vietnamese government has formally signaled that it will focus on threats to the mekong delta from upstream dams at meetings of the association of southeast asian nations asean 26 2 3 flood risk reduction of floodplains recent analyses forecast that even relatively small increases in the global average temperature can increase the frequency of damaging floods 21 beyond climate change the number of people at risk from floods is also increasing due to continued population growth within flood prone areas approximately half of new urban development by 2030 will occur within areas with elevated risks of flooding translating to an additional extent of urban development the size of spain 500 000 square kilometers that will be at risk of floods 18 development on floodplains generally includes construction of levees which results in a reduction in the area available to convey floodwaters a reduction of conveyance and potentially an increase in flood hazard up or downstream 20 in regions with mature flood management systems the physical infrastructure including dams and levees are often deteriorating due to insufficient budgets for maintenance and rehabilitation further various changes in land use including urbanization the filling of wetlands and conversion of forest to agriculture increases the intensity of runoff and flood risk 41 traditionally decisions about flood management have focused on engineered structures such as levees floodwalls and dams however a consensus is now emerging that flood managers should pursue a diversified portfolio approach to manage both the rise in flood risk and society s broader expectations of services from rivers and floodplains 41 a diversified portfolio approach will still include engineered structures but will fully consider and integrate non structural measures such as improved zoning building codes and insurance as well as investments in green infrastructure or nature based solutions including wetlands and floodplains 31 riverine examples of nature based solutions include the maintenance or reconnection of large areas of floodplain connected to rivers to store or convey floodwaters and attenuate peak flows while engineered infrastructure such as a levee generally provides a single local benefit flood risk reduction it can potentially increase flood hazards elsewhere and often causes negative impacts on other river values in contrast green infrastructure often provides multiple benefits for example connected floodplains can provide flood risk reduction but also provide a range of other benefits including nutrient retention groundwater recharge habitat for fish and wildlife and recreation 30 the yolo bypass in the valley of the sacramento river california usa illustrates these diverse benefits the bypass is a 25 000 hectare area of historic floodplain that was reconnected to the sacramento river in the 1920s during major flood events approximately 80 of the volume of floodwaters is conveyed by the bypass dramatically reducing flood risk for the city of sacramento and much of the surrounding region much of the bypass remains in productive agriculture and it also provides the best remaining lowland floodplain habitat in the sacramento valley for native birds and fish 45 in addition to the sacramento river there are several other examples including the lower mississippi river where flood management originally focused on containing rivers within levees and then following repeated floods engineers reconnected portions of the historic floodplain to provide more room for floodwaters 31 despite these examples only a relatively small amount of global investment in flood management is going into nature based solutions or green infrastructure however in regions where governments have multiple objectives for rivers encompassing both flood risk reduction and ecosystem restoration the multiple benefits of floodplains are gaining increasing attention in the netherlands a room for the river approach has been adopted that incorporates more floodplain storage and conveyance with associated benefits for ecosystems within a system that is intensely managed by engineered infrastructure in california planners are confronted with strong pressures to both reduce flood risk and restore ecosystems and the state has passed several bond funding packages and policies such as the central valley flood protection plan 2017 update that mandate multiple benefit floodplain projects similarly recent evolution of flood management in germany has included increasing attention on levee relocation to expand the extent of floodplains that can be flooded due to the convergence of goals 1 the restoration of an important habitat type now rare in germany and 2 for the flood risk reduction that habitat type can provide 50 these multiple benefit approaches to river and floodplain management in the europe and california share two characteristics 1 governments striving to achieve multiple objectives from rivers including environmental restoration and 2 planners that realize the limitations to continued reliance on building higher and stronger levees in the face of climate change and associated uncertainty of future risk this recognition of diverse values and the need for greater system flexibility to manage in the face of uncertainty reflect the integrative approach to water security described by zeitoun et al 61 and can serve as examples to countries currently undergoing development of their flood management systems 2 4 improved water quantity and quality from ecosystem processes within river systems global water demand has been increasing at approximately 1 percent per year and will continue to increase due to population growth and water intensive shifts in consumption e g toward more meat in diets studies consistently forecast a gap between future supply and demand and climate change will likely exacerbate these challenges in many regions of the world for example schlosser et al 42 forecast that approximately half the world s population will live in regions with water stress by 2050 a set of natural features of rivers and their basins are critical to maintaining water quantity and quality this green infrastructure includes forested watersheds with deep soils that increase infiltration of precipitation and reduce excessive surface erosion and levels and sediment and nutrients that enter water supplies wetlands also retain nutrients and sediment and so strategically placed wetlands can improve water quality in agricultural regions floodwaters that spread across floodplains contribute to groundwater recharge and can be managed in coordination with reservoirs that store water for irrigation 54 this green infrastructure clearly does not replace but rather complements engineered infrastructure within water supply systems however water supply managers have generally underinvested in green infrastructure within the river basins that generate the water that is managed by reservoirs and water treatment plants abell et al 1 found that 40 of the watersheds that provide water to cities had high to moderate levels of degradation they further found that most cities had the potential to reduce nutrients and sediment in their water supply through investments in forests and or better management of upstream agriculture as described above for floodplains investments in the green infrastructure of river basins can provide other diverse benefits including carbon sequestration and habitat for wildlife the 2018 world water development report from un water called for increased investments in green infrastructure nature based solutions to improve management of water supplies in the context of climate change and growing demands the report recommends a range of green infrastructure investments that use natural features and processes to increase water quantity e g recharging groundwater and retaining water in soils and water quality e g wetlands cape town which received extensive global media coverage of its historic drought provides a compelling example of how investments in the green infrastructure of river basins can complement engineered solutions while further investments in engineered infrastructure such as groundwater pumping or desalination will be necessary cape town and other parts of south africa would benefit from restoration of native vegetation within water supply watersheds non native species such as eucalyptus evapotranspire more water than do native plants removal of non natives and replacement with native vegetation could provide an additional increment of water supply at a lower cost than most other interventions 60 3 conclusion services created by rivers as biophysical systems deliver significant financial and economic benefits that contribute to the diverse objectives encompassed by water security frameworks however the management of water resources and rivers rarely prioritizes these services even as methods for valuing them have improved as a result these other benefits and freshwater ecosystems in general have declined dramatically in much of the world 52 here we suggest these losses are not the inevitable collateral damage that must be accepted as part of development to ensure water security rather river management that strives to encompass the full range of benefits from rivers can reduce risks and produce much more balanced and long lasting outcomes 32 31 reconciling traditional benefits such as hydropower and water supply with the benefits that arise from healthy rivers is the essential challenge for river management the premise of this paper is that the full goals of water security require this reconciliation because the various services produced by rivers as complex biophysical systems are central to the broader range of objectives pursued under the concept of water security such as food security and public safety we recommend fully integrating rivers into frameworks for water security water security as defined in this journal extends beyond water quantity and quality to encompass other objectives that intersect with water including food security managing of risk from natural disasters and the conservation of aquatic ecosystems and their services this expanded definition clearly encompasses the river services featured in this paper integrative approaches to water security such as that proposed by zeitoun et al 61 emphasizing the inclusion of diverse voices and values transparency and adaptive approaches to management under uncertainty should be conducive to the comprehensive integration of rivers into water security however in practice water security tends to focus on water quantity e g see commentary by gunda et al 17 that water security generally remains limited to quantity to the functional exclusion of other objectives even water quality and considers rivers in terms of the volumes of water they can provide and emphasizes engineered infrastructure as the primary solution to increase security 61 this narrower treatment of rivers in water security and management risks holding back the intended expansion of the concept of water security and broader development objectives more generally such as the sustainable development goals sdgs in contrast a broader definition of water security if translated into management could contribute to policies and programs that achieve a greater diversity of benefits from rivers 51 and help achieve the sdgs with their intertwined objectives for economic social and environmental progress while methods to quantify the ecosystem service values of rivers can provide important information for decision making processes on its own the availability of these valuations often does not move decisions toward more comprehensive management of river benefits keys for integrating valuations into decision making and management include the participation of diverse stakeholders at key points the co creation of information and the framing of values in terms and concepts that are tailored to the objectives of various decision makers note that these values do not need to be translated into the same units such as currency navigating tradeoffs is an essential challenge for successfully incorporating diverse values into decision making for sustainable and inclusive water management 13 multi objective analysis can incorporate values using different units thus not requiring that all the values are monetized which can be difficult or controversial for some resources 22 decision makers can then compare how different decision options such as alternate combinations of investments and management perform across the various objectives 32 although quantifying value can improve management decisions we believe that to who and how rivers values are communicated are as or more important than the numerical quantification rivers diverse values must be framed as directly relevant to the economic sectors and trends that decision makers prioritize such as employment public safety economic growth and social stability 40 in other words the services delivered by rivers as biophysical systems cannot remain siloed as environmental accordingly the decision makers who understand these connections must expand beyond those within the ministries for water and environment to include those who manage or invest in other sectors such as agriculture and public safety 37 currently the leaders of various ministries and companies whose objectives are strongly influenced by rivers often do not recognize the extent to which their objectives are influenced by rivers and the risks they face if they are mismanaged quantifying values and then framing those values in ways that are directly relevant to decision makers will help them understand these linkages this process is illustrated by the translation of river fisheries into terms of the land and water required to replace them and the implications for resource competition and social stability 34 this approach can potentially produce more diverse coalition to advocate for sustainable management of rivers including the decisions and investments that will contribute to water security in pursuit of building such coalitions wwf has coordinated rivers in the economy processes in several regions to directly engage diverse stakeholders and decision makers including those from sectors not traditionally involved in water management debates to collectively discuss the contribution of rivers to societal benefits and economic gain and to identify shared solutions 57 59 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

20144,anthropocentrism poses two major challenges to american stormwater management first the conviction that runoff is a threat to human health and property promotes the construction of storm sewers to rapidly remove runoff from cities with consequent significant deleterious ecosystem effects second the pastoral aesthetic preference prompts the dissatisfaction with low impact development lid that aims to effectively and sustainably manage stormwater because of its unkempt appearance the 1987 national pollution discharge elimination system npdes initiated a regulatory framework that not only considered human wellbeing but ecological health thereby instigating a challenge to anthropocentrism with phase i 1990 and phase ii 1999 the npdes stormwater program explicitly include specific measures to regulate stormwater discharges and promote the implementation and appreciation of lid the advance of american stormwater regulations therefore manifests the intention to attenuate the anthropocentrism impeding the proliferation of sustainable stormwater management moving the country toward ecocentricism and environmental sustainability keywords sustainable stormwater management anthropocentrism landscape aesthetics low impact development lid national pollution discharge elimination system npdes environmental sustainability 1 introduction since the publication of design with nature 44 by ian mcharg the design of landscapes and cities has strived to reconcile and equitably provide for the requirements of both human and natural systems in practice this has been hard to achieve in particular urban development often prioritizes immediate benefits to humans in the form of recreation leisure beauty comfort habitation safety and most especially economy over the more diffuse long term benefits to nature or ecosystems this certainly implies the dominance of anthropocentrism in city planning and sanitary engineering anthropocentrism refers to the belief that human beings are the center of the universe 4 from this view other living and non living parts of existence have value only in relation to their effects or benefits to humans 3 39 anthropocentrism characterizes the underlying ethical attitude toward nature and environment which has long been embedded in western tradition 3 in anthropocentric ethics moral standing is granted only to humans 1 8 and nature has moral consideration because degrading or preserving nature can in turn harm or benefit humans 39 the emergence of environmental ethics as a new philosophical discipline in the early 1970s significantly posed a challenge to anthropocentrism 3 many philosophers started to reiterate that anthropocentrism is an insufficient and misguided basis for normative ethics and propose that environmental ethics move beyond anthropocentrism beyond human interests 1 ecocentrism hence has been emphasized by scholars as a countervailing ethical perspective of moral reasoning about environmental issues which can direct us toward sustainable future literally ecocentrism means the perspective that regards the whole ecosphere as central in importance and attempts to redress the imbalance created by anthropocentrism 58 ecocentrism represents the idea that everything in the natural world has its own intrinsic value and deserves moral consideration both anthropocentrism and ecocentrism justify human concerns about environmental deterioration and natural conservation yet these two ideas are different in terms of the motivation underlying their concern as thompson and barton 67 clarify ecocentric individuals value nature for its own sake and therefore judge that it deserves protection because of its intrinsic value in contrast anthropocentrics feel that the environment should be protected because of its value in maintaining or enhancing the quality of life for humans in view of these philosophical ideas anthropocentrism has played a role in placing human benefits especially in terms of public health flood control water quality fishery agriculture recreation and landscape beauty as primary goals of stormwater management policies and practices these anthropocentric goals subsequently have impeded ecologically sustainable stormwater management design in the united states this paper elucidates two major challenges that anthropocentrism has posed to the implementation of american sustainable stormwater management the recent advance of american stormwater regulations which aims to alleviate longstanding ecological problems caused by runoff in order to protect water resources and ecosystems exemplifies the attenuation of anthropocentric perspectives in stormwater management fostering ecological awareness to achieve environmental sustainability 2 stormwater runoff and sustainable stormwater management in the united states stormwater runoff also known as runoff refers to excess water from rain snow and melted ice that runs over the ground and then flows into nearby water bodies as other countries around the world in the united states urbanization has put enormous stress on the drainage and management of stormwater runoff the change of land cover from soils and plants to roads roofs and so on has significantly altered the stormwater flows whether during or following the storm events 27 in natural areas the amount of runoff is significantly reduced by the processes of evapotranspiration and infiltration 55 urban development disrupts these two processes due to the increase of impervious surfaces along with the decrease of vegetation and pervious areas the larger volume and higher velocity of runoff is produced which finally prompts flood and erosion problems 27 76 in addition to impacts on the amount and speed of runoff urban development seriously affects the quality of water in urban areas runoff that flows over pavements especially streets parking lots and rooftops picks up varieties of pollutants and becomes polluted runoff 76 as the us epa 74 reports some of the principal contaminants found in storm water runoff include heavy metals toxic chemicals organic compounds pesticides and herbicides pathogens nutrients sediments and salts and other de icing compounds this polluted runoff causes many adverse effects particularly the degradation of water quality and the broad deterioration of ecosystems the problems created by urban stormwater runoff have catalyzed the development of sustainable stormwater management 1 1 sustainable stormwater management is also known as for example low impact development lid natural drainage system nds sustainable urban drainage system suds water sensitive urban design wsud and green infrastructure 65 26 which refers to an approach to manage runoff which replicates natural hydrologic regimes 65 this innovation emphasizes decentralized and landscape based strategies which combine a variety of techniques especially retaining detaining harvesting infiltrating and filtering runoff in order to achieve effective runoff management allow groundwater recharge reduce contaminant pollution and protect sensitive ecosystems 9 many of these techniques are not new and represent the resurgence of age old practices 42 abandoned as a result of the promotion of pipe based engineering technology that simply rapidly dumped urban runoff into streams rivers bays lakes and oceans in the united states public agencies have widely introduced this contemporary approach to urban stormwater management commonly denoted as low impact development or lid generally lid refers to a site design strategy with a goal of maintaining or replicating the pre development hydrologic regime through the use of design techniques to create a functionally equivalent hydrologic landscape 72 lid can be applied to nearly all kinds of new development projects and redevelopment sites 81 typically lid utilizes a range of stormwater control measures widely known as best management

pollutants and contaminants from reaching receiving waters the installations commonly used as bmps are abundant 42 for example rain gardens bioswales green roofs rain barrels porous pavements riparian buffers and stormwater wetlands 72 81 the united states environmental protection agency us epa has developed and promoted both principles and guidelines for implementing lid and bmps with the aim of achieving sustainable stormwater management also state and city agencies have aggressively promoted and implemented sustainable stormwater management in particular maryland virginia philadelphia in

engineering and landscape architecture serve as key advocates of this effort given that their professional projects very much involve urban stormwater management 3 anthropocentrism as an impediment to sustainable stormwater management as public agencies promoted sustainable stormwater management practices to reform urban drainage systems and mitigate their damaging effects public perspectives influenced their promulgation widespread anthropocentric perspectives impeded and continue to impede the adoption and acceptance of sustainable stormwater management in particular anthropocentrism has posed two major challenges that hinder the achievement of sustainable stormwater management the first challenge rests on the pervasive if understandable conviction that urban runoff consists of excess dirty water forming a major cause of nuisances and threats to human health and property this has resulted in stormwater management paradigms that emphasize rapid removal of runoff from cities in order to provide hygienic environments and reduce flood risks yet subsequently cause ecological problems according to karvonen 38 humankind had developed drainage systems to route rainwater out of towns as

empire 38 therefore as melosi 45 writes before the mid nineteenth century few large american cities or european cities for that matter constructed drainage systems and refuse disposal facilities on par with the great ancient civilization of babylon mesopotamia carthage or rome ditches streams streets and gutters were commonly used as the major means to convey and dispose stormwater runoff along with all water borne wastes to nearby waterways 38 63 these open drainage channels soon became dirty odorous and unsightly because household wastewater and other waste products including rubbish garbage excrement and so on were often dropped into them 45 63 dumping of wastes into the drainage networks caused not only aesthetic problems but also health risks 38 furthermore the increase in wastewater volume as urban population increased and the introduction of centralized water supplies along with water closets overwhelmed the drainage systems and compounded health hazards 27 38 45 although urban epidemics proliferated and caused numerous deaths in many cities the relationship between diseases and unsanitary water conditions was still unknown 45 in the mid nineteenth century the work of the remarkable english reformer edwin chadwick revealed that the physical environment and sanitation affects public health his work squarely implicated urban runoff in the dire health conditions of industrial cities 45 the discovery of the linkage between a london cholera outbreak and the poor sanitation by john snow in 1854 certainly cemented the link between contaminated urban water supplies and the spread of disease the advent of the sanitary city movement resulted in the substantial redesign of urban engineering technology for the conveyance and disposal of sewage and wastewater in late nineteenth and early twentieth century cities including urban runoff drainage systems 45 this created the underground drainage infrastructure which in the first half of the twentieth century became the conventional standard means of stormwater management throughout the world 38 63 this innovation comprised efficient underground pipe networks emphasized fast conveyance of runoff and sewage out of cities and into nearby water bodies two types classify these urban stormwater conveyance systems the combined system and the separate system the combined system conveys both wastewater and stormwater in the same set of pipes while the separate system conveys wastewater and stormwater separately indeed these expedient drainage systems have effectively managed stormwater for the protection of human health and property yet they have also subsequently caused several severe environmental problems 65 piped drainage systems prompted two major damaging effects flood and erosion hazards and water quality deterioration 27 specifically as the systems produce and discharge a large volume and high velocity of effluent into waterways they cause significant downstream flooding and channel erosion damaging vestigial functioning ecological systems in addition as these systems drain untreated contaminated water into receiving waterbodies they are also a significant cause of poor water quality and further pervasive damage to ecological systems fundamentally since the late nineteenth century urban drainage systems markedly prioritized benefits to humans over all other considerations quintessentially an anthropocentric approach the anthropocentrism of the american landscape preference for the pastoral ideal poses another challenge to sustainable stormwater management the american pastoral landscape ideal has its roots in the eighteenth century english landscape aesthetics particularly the theory of the picturesque literally meaning picture like the picturesque advocates an aesthetic appreciation of visual attributes of nature that look like landscape paintings both in terms of components and compositions 7 11 since the eighteenth century picturesque ideas influenced landscape architects and designers in both europe and north america 29 in the united states fredrick law olmsted founder of the profession of landscape architecture transformed the picturesque landscape aesthetic into a distinctive prevailing american idea of the pastoral landscape as mozingo 48 writes olmsted employed the term pastoral instead of the beautiful or picturesque to evoke a familiar tranquil and cultivated nature as a counterpoint to the city inspired by the scenic rural landscape olmsted s pastoral idea emphasized a naturalistic landscape of tidily composed undulating lawn expanses clusters of trees serpentine water features and sinuous pathways in the late nineteenth and through much of the twentieth century olmsted his compatriots and followers forged wide acceptance of pastoral landscapes first through the design of large public parks followed by park systems parkways residential suburbs college campuses cemeteries hospital grounds expositions factory grounds and suburban corporate offices as pregill and volkman note 62 eventually americans manifested a perennial fascination with the pastoral landscape as the prolific environmental psychology scholars stephen kaplan and rachel kaplan have repeatedly established landscape appreciation fulfills distinct human needs and the aesthetic quality particularly the visual character of everyday nature significantly affects public satisfaction 34 36 37 the everyday nature denotes a realm of natural environment the common backyard variety of nature which is more immediately accessible to a broader range of the population and includes a wide range of outdoor settings such as roadsides and drainage facilities 34 unfortunately according to echols 13 stormwater facilities are often engineered simply to solve excess runoff problems with no concern for aesthetic or other qualities by highlighting the utilization of natural systems to manage stormwater especially through the use of native tolerant plants with pollutant removal capability along with minimal maintenance and irrigation requirement these facilities are ecologically functional and robust but appear messy to the eye of humans who prefer pastoral and neat landscapes as a result they frequently fall short of achieving public satisfaction and support more precisely the visual appearance of stormwater management landscapes has often come into conflict with the pastoral ideal of scenic landscapes which glorifies a naturalistic yet a very neat verdant and manicured appearance grounded in the nineteenth century public parks so that the public often perceives these elements regardless of ecological benefits as unkempt and ugly moreover because the pastoral beauty is often mistaken for healthy ecological systems 49 50 the messy landscape is assumed to be dirty unhealthy and unsafe 52 as one example the stormwater treatment basins referred to as wetlands by those proposing their construction were referred to as swamps by those living near their proposed construction sites 50 the messy appearance therefore challenges public acceptance and appreciation of sustainable stormwater management designs researchers have persistently studied public response and definitely documented the negative reaction to ecologically valuable stormwater management facilities e g 12 13 34 47 50 53 it is important to note that problems with the appearance of ecosystems have been prevalent and become problematic throughout a broad range of ecological landscape design practices as nassauer 50 notes ecological quality tends to look messy and this poses problems for those who imagine and construct new landscapes to enhance ecological quality numerous writings and studies especially in the landscape perception and design fields address this recurring issue e g 16 17 28 35 36 49 51 54 59 66 fixated on the pastoral ideal many americans are unlikely to appreciate sustainable stormwater management landscapes whatever their demonstrated ecological importance as gobster nassauer daniel and fry 18 emphasize aesthetic appreciation substantially affects public support and protection of ecological landscapes meyer 46 furthermore explicates the tenet that aesthetic experience can play a role in re centering human consciousness from an egocentric to a more bio centric perspective by influencing intellectual and moral position s leading to the development of recognition empathy love respect and care for the environment a key to environmental ethics for instance crissy field marsh in san francisco where stormwater runoff is managed before discharging to san francisco bay provides habitat for numerous wildlife species while at the same time that it provides for public recreation as people experience the variation of textures colors and water levels of the marsh and witness the closing of gates to a bridge crossing the marsh that signals periods when the presence of humans would disturb wildlife they develop an aesthetic appreciation of and also a respect for the landscape 46 consequently aligning aesthetic and functional goals of stormwater management facilities proves a challenging task for designers and developers 41 this dilemma underscores the impediments that anthropocentric aesthetic preferences place on the proliferation of sustainable stormwater management policies and practices in the united states 4 advance of stormwater regulations and management paradigms in the united states since the mid twentieth century a series of environmental laws particularly the clean water act cwa the endangered species act esa and the safe drinking water act sdwa have been promulgated and amended with the goal of protecting american waters and ecosystems indeed these federal enactments demonstrated serious concern regarding the environmental impacts of pollution from urban runoff and other diffuse sources requiring that urban runoff management be integral to policies regulation and implementation to achieve good water quality 38 56 57 in response to the legal requirements municipalities across the united states have begun to implement strategies to remove the pollutants from urban stormwater runoff 26 in this effort state and local agencies have extensively promoted and utilized landscape based principles rather than the engineer dominated approaches thus american environmental legislation drives contemporary urban runoff management practices particularly lid and bmps 42 although a range of regulations have influenced the modification of stormwater management paradigms and practices the national pollution discharge elimination system npdes stormwater program has played the most significant role in challenging anthropocentric stormwater management and moving the country toward sustainable future in 1948 the federal water pollution control act fwpca mandated the goal of maintaining and restoring the chemical physical and biological integrity of waters in the united states 55 considerably revised and expanded in 1972 the fwpca became the cwa commonly known today despite the fact that the cwa compelled the reduction of water pollution it did not provide any specific measure that directly regulated stormwater discharges 61 in 1987 the us epa initiated the npdes under the cwa with the aim of emphasizing the role of stormwater in causing or contributing to water quality impairments 55 the npdes stormwater program therefore is in charge of controlling toxic pollutants contaminated in runoff discharged to american waters safeguarding the valuable water resources and ecosystems this represents a move beyond the anthrpocentrism of previous stormwater management regimes as it validates concerns for not only human wellbeing but for ecosystem health as well enactment of the npdes stormwater program notwithstanding degraded and polluted waters still remained as a problematic issue in the country in 1990 the us epa announced the phase i stormwater rules in order to address this longstanding issue these rules focused on the npdes permits which regulate discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4s 2 2 municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 is a publicly owned conveyance or system of conveyances used for collecting or conveying stormwater including roads with drainage systems municipal streets catch basins curbs gutters ditches man made channels and storm drains but it is neither a combined sewer nor a part of a publicly owned treatment works 73 along with industrial activities and construction sites 77 obviously the focus of the phase i regulations was on point source pollution 3 3 point source pollution is polluted water discharged into waterbodies such as streams rivers lakes and oceans at a specific location through pipes outfalls and conveyance channels from either municipal wastewater treatment plants or individual waste treatment facilities 82 discharges which were considered a major threat to water quality at that time as a series of national water quality inventory reports repeatedly revealed that nonpoint source nps pollution 4 4 nonpoint source nps pollution is polluted water that comes from many diffuse sources generally nps pollution is generated as rainfall or snowmelt flows over the ground and carries away pollutants including excess fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural lands oil and geese from urban areas sediment from construction sites and so on into receiving waters 73 formed the leading source of pollutants causing water quality impairments e g 68 69 71 nps pollution particularly urban runoff became a primary and widespread concern 70 in response the us epa issued the phase ii stormwater rules in 1999 this second phase expanded the phase i regulations to require additional control of nps pollution from the small ms4s in urbanized areas and the small construction sites 77 moreover as the us epa intended to reduce further negative impacts from polluted runoff the phase ii also required each ms4 to conduct six ms4 minimum control measures including 1 public education and outreach 2 public participation and involvement 3 illicit discharge detection and elimination 4 construction site runoff control 5 post construction runoff control and 6 pollution prevention and good housekeeping 78 by including the first and the second of the six ms4 measures the us epa clearly realized that public engagement was crucial to the success of stormwater management programs the first measure public education and outreach required programs to educate people about the adverse effects of polluted stormwater runoff and suggested three strategies forming partnerships using educational materials and strategies particularly brochures fact sheets posters stickers interpretive signs websites learning programs and economic incentives and reaching diverse audiences 79 the second measure public participation and involvement required the implementation of programs to give opportunities to the public to play an active role in both the development and implementation of the stormwater management programs the possible practices that could be incorporated into a public participation and involvement program included public meetings and citizen panels volunteer water quality monitoring volunteer educators and speakers storm drain stenciling and community clean ups 80 the goal of these two measures was to establish informed and involved communities which the us epa recognized as essential for achieving successful stormwater management 79 80 this nationally mandated requirement to educate the public about the broader ecosystem interactions of urban runoff certainly implies an attempt to reduce anthropocentric attitudes toward stormwater its goal was to reverse the out of sight out of mind paradigm of early twentieth century urban runoff management which indubitably had immediate beneficial effects for humans but also acutely deleterious effects for aquatic ecosystems especially over the long term in particular it manifested the aim of supplying the public with scientific knowledge to advance their understanding about the water cycle and urban runoff and their connections to far reaching environmental conditions fundamentally it recast urban stormwater as an ecosystem resource not a waste or a nuisance to be managed not only for human benefits but also ecological benefits notably studies especially those conducted in response to the phase ii rules to determine the status of people s stormwater mindsets have revealed that public behavior and awareness related to stormwater pollution has positively changed over time a series of stormwater surveys in san diego proves to be an exemplary case in this regard 19 25 30 33 for example the 2013 survey 22 says that very high proportions of residents say they have made behavioral changes as a direct result of seeing any information about how polluted water in storm drains affects local creeks the beaches and the ocean and suggests that concern about sources of storm drain pollution generally seems to be higher than it was a year ago this re conception of urban runoff management underscores the essential role of public education and environmental science in changing attitudes and behaviors of the public in addition scientific knowledge is fundamental to the aesthetic appreciation of the landscape this tenet was introduced since the 1970s by the philosopher allen carlson who proposes that aesthetic appreciation of environment must be freed from old approaches modeled on formalistic appreciation of isolated objects or picturesque appreciation of scenic beauty yet should be central to the knowledge provided by sciences such as geology biology and ecology 5 specifically it is primarily science that gives knowledge about why it is what it is and what it is like 5 so that science can help people evaluate landscapes expansively releasing them from subjective aesthetic preferences 6 43 64 in view of this idea scientific knowledge forms a pivotal component to move beyond the perennial american affection for the pastoral landscape ideal more specifically knowledge related to ecological processes and sustainable management of urban runoff can motivate people to appreciate stormwater management facilities not only through their visual character but also through their ecological benefits this can in turn result in more public satisfaction and support for such amenities extending scientific understanding to citizens buttresses the growth of public awareness and responsibility and ultimately champions ecological ethics to counter anthropocentric public attitudes toward stormwater management potentially ecological ethics encourages a holistic view of urban stormwater management to consider environmental benefits over or at least equal to human benefits furthermore ethics and aesthetics are related in environmental design 10 40 as blanchon caillot et al 2 note the classic tripartite definition of environmental design forms if ecology is added to aesthetics and ethics in other words the aesthetic appreciation of ecologically sound design involves moral considerations because humans possess instincts concerning the power of nature based on this idea ecological ethics can play a vital part in enhancing aesthetic appreciation of and satisfaction with sustainable stormwater management design the extended implications of the us epa phase ii requirements thus support a fundamental shift in stormwater management paradigm balancing the anthropocentric and the ecocentric perspectives 5 conclusion undeniably anthropocentrism in environmental design has been widespread and caused innumerable severe environmental problems all over the world for decades severe adverse environmental impacts resulting from our human centered perspectives have become apparent threats to not only human health and living conditions but also other species and non living components of the biosphere accordingly in this environmentally conscious age an attempt to reduce the anthropocentrism deeply embedded in people s heads and hearts is an essential yet onerous task in the united states and elsewhere anthropocentrism has long been one of the key impediments to sustainable stormwater management policies and practices the advance of american stormwater regulations particularly the npdes stormwater program along with its phase i and phase ii stormwater rules certainly denotes the use of legislation as advocate and driver for challenging anthropocentrism impeding the implementation of sustainable stormwater management first these regulatory systems acknowledge stormwater as a valuable resource not a waste product and lid as well as bmps as sustainable solutions for stormwater management in consequence in the recent decades stormwater practitioners along with developers and home owners have increasingly adopted and implemented lid and bmps instead of conventionally engineered drainage systems reducing impact from stomwater discharges on waterways and related ecological systems furthermore the regulatory agencies enacted these rules not only to solve persistent problems produced by stormwater runoff but also to foster environmentally aware stormwater management attitudes and actions in the united states especially through public education and participation that cultivates environmental ethics the information and knowledge disseminated in compliance with the first two ms4 measures can make people understand the advantages along with the logics behind the unkempt unappealing appearance of the lid landscapes and then accept and appreciate them releasing people from subjective aesthetic preference for the neat landscape rooted in the park like pastoral ideal of scenic beauty the practice of stormwater management is not the same as ecological restoration or biological conservation because it is fundamentally anthropocentric in particular the requirement for stormwater management will undeniably be focused on public health especially flood and pollution control and public recreation even though the consideration of ecosystem health is incorporated in the practice importantly as sustainable designed landscapes including stormwater management facilities also indisputably interrelate with social routines and spatial practices from daily promenades to commuting to work 46 they can be perceived and regarded as an essential and appealing amenity of the city for many years stormwater practitioners and landscape designers have earnestly worked on getting stormwater practices accepted and supported by local governments and residents as part of necessary urban infrastructure they have dedicated to the design installation and especially long term operation and maintenance in order to make them appeal to the public and produce a civic experience many exemplary cases have appeared throughout the country growing vine street in washington tanner springs park in oregon hunter s point south waterfront park in new york and the dell at the university of virginia invirginia among many others remarkably as the quality of stormwater runoff still remains one of the great environmental challenges in the country efforts to educate people in order to shift their attitudes toward stormwater management from the anthropocentric to the incorporation of the ecocentric will need to continue even though based on the first two ms4 measures supplying education materials and providing participation activities are common means for generating knowledge of sustainable stormwater management many scholars also advocate the idea that stormwater management facilities themselves can be utilized as an opportunity to advance stormwater education over the past decades both academics and professionals have significantly promoted this idea prominent among them are stuart echols and eliza pennypacker who developed an especially inspiring approach to sustainable stormwater management artful rainwater design ard this approach emphasizes the design of stormwater management facilities as an amenity that celebrates rainwater and promotes the experience of rainwater in a way that increases the landscape s attractiveness and value 15 education notably is listed as the first of five amenity goals of ard the other four goals include recreation safety public relations and aesthetic richness for them the education goal is understood as creating favorable conditions to learn about rainwater and related issues 15 they also explicate that an on site stormwater management system can be an engaging opportunity to educate people about rainwater issues from promoting awareness of stormwater best management practices strategies to the site s historical water condition 60 through their extensive analysis of case studies they suggest several design techniques which can effectively contribute to educational results for example creating a narrative of the hydrologic cycle or the historical water condition making stormwater trails or systems visible and legible providing signs or exhibits and arranging tours games or other educational activities 15 one exemplar is pierce county environmental services in washington that provides a well designed trail system in order to display a variety of strategies for stormwater management 60 and also includes a number of particularly appealing and informative interpretive signs at strategic spots in order to augment learning opportunities 14 another is stephen epler hall at portland state university in oregon that uses intriguing iconic stormwater management features particularly the downspouts attached to the building columns the runnels lining across the plaza and the concrete basins filled with river rocks to engage its visitors in deciphering the stormwater management systems of the site and learning about sustainable stormwater management techniques 60 in summary the phase i and phase ii of the npdes stormwater program enacted in the united states under the cwa epitomize the development of regulatory systems for the sake of human beings as well as planetary ecosystems furthermore the phase ii rules emphasize knowledge as a significant booster of positive attitudes and behaviors related to stormwater management therefore it is worth recapitulating that education is exceptionally crucial to make people leave behind their anthropocentric attitudes toward stormwater management in order to build a better and ultimately sustainable future more precisely scientific knowledge helps people understand the bases of environmental problems and stomwater management practices and then develop ecological ethics thereby making them care more about ecosystems and other species however

20144,anthropocentrism poses two major challenges to american stormwater management first the conviction that runoff is a threat to human health and property promotes the construction of storm sewers to rapidly remove runoff from cities with consequent significant deleterious ecosystem effects second the pastoral aesthetic preference prompts the dissatisfaction with low impact development lid that aims to effectively and sustainably manage stormwater because of its unkempt appearance the 1987 national pollution discharge elimination system npdes initiated a regulatory framework that not only considered human wellbeing but ecological health thereby instigating a challenge to anthropocentrism with phase i 1990 and phase ii 1999 the npdes stormwater program explicitly include specific measures to regulate stormwater discharges and promote the implementation and appreciation of lid the advance of american stormwater regulations therefore manifests the intention to attenuate the anthropocentrism impeding the proliferation of sustainable stormwater management moving the country toward ecocentricism and environmental sustainability keywords sustainable stormwater management anthropocentrism landscape aesthetics low impact development lid national pollution discharge elimination system npdes environmental sustainability 1 introduction since the publication of design with nature 44 by ian mcharg the design of landscapes and cities has strived to reconcile and equitably provide for the requirements of both human and natural systems in practice this has been hard to achieve in particular urban development often prioritizes immediate benefits to humans in the form of recreation leisure beauty comfort habitation safety and most especially economy over the more diffuse long term benefits to nature or ecosystems this certainly implies the dominance of anthropocentrism in city planning and sanitary engineering anthropocentrism refers to the belief that human beings are the center of the universe 4 from this view other living and non living parts of existence have value only in relation to their effects or benefits to humans 3 39 anthropocentrism characterizes the underlying ethical attitude toward nature and environment which has long been embedded in western tradition 3 in anthropocentric ethics moral standing is granted only to humans 1 8 and nature has moral consideration because degrading or preserving nature can in turn harm or benefit humans 39 the emergence of environmental ethics as a new philosophical discipline in the early 1970s significantly posed a challenge to anthropocentrism 3 many philosophers started to reiterate that anthropocentrism is an insufficient and misguided basis for normative ethics and propose that environmental ethics move beyond anthropocentrism beyond human interests 1 ecocentrism hence has been emphasized by scholars as a countervailing ethical perspective of moral reasoning about environmental issues which can direct us toward sustainable future literally ecocentrism means the perspective that regards the whole ecosphere as central in importance and attempts to redress the imbalance created by anthropocentrism 58 ecocentrism represents the idea that everything in the natural world has its own intrinsic value and deserves moral consideration both anthropocentrism and ecocentrism justify human concerns about environmental deterioration and natural conservation yet these two ideas are different in terms of the motivation underlying their concern as thompson and barton 67 clarify ecocentric individuals value nature for its own sake and therefore judge that it deserves protection because of its intrinsic value in contrast anthropocentrics feel that the environment should be protected because of its value in maintaining or enhancing the quality of life for humans in view of these philosophical ideas anthropocentrism has played a role in placing human benefits especially in terms of public health flood control water quality fishery agriculture recreation and landscape beauty as primary goals of stormwater management policies and practices these anthropocentric goals subsequently have impeded ecologically sustainable stormwater management design in the united states this paper elucidates two major challenges that anthropocentrism has posed to the implementation of american sustainable stormwater management the recent advance of american stormwater regulations which aims to alleviate longstanding ecological problems caused by runoff in order to protect water resources and ecosystems exemplifies the attenuation of anthropocentric perspectives in stormwater management fostering ecological awareness to achieve environmental sustainability 2 stormwater runoff and sustainable stormwater management in the united states stormwater runoff also known as runoff refers to excess water from rain snow and melted ice that runs over the ground and then flows into nearby water bodies as other countries around the world in the united states urbanization has put enormous stress on the drainage and management of stormwater runoff the change of land cover from soils and plants to roads roofs and so on has significantly altered the stormwater flows whether during or following the storm events 27 in natural areas the amount of runoff is significantly reduced by the processes of evapotranspiration and infiltration 55 urban development disrupts these two processes due to the increase of impervious surfaces along with the decrease of vegetation and pervious areas the larger volume and higher velocity of runoff is produced which finally prompts flood and erosion problems 27 76 in addition to impacts on the amount and speed of runoff urban development seriously affects the quality of water in urban areas runoff that flows over pavements especially streets parking lots and rooftops picks up varieties of pollutants and becomes polluted runoff 76 as the us epa 74 reports some of the principal contaminants found in storm water runoff include heavy metals toxic chemicals organic compounds pesticides and herbicides pathogens nutrients sediments and salts and other de icing compounds this polluted runoff causes many adverse effects particularly the degradation of water quality and the broad deterioration of ecosystems the problems created by urban stormwater runoff have catalyzed the development of sustainable stormwater management 1 1 sustainable stormwater management is also known as for example low impact development lid natural drainage system nds sustainable urban drainage system suds water sensitive urban design wsud and green infrastructure 65 26 which refers to an approach to manage runoff which replicates natural hydrologic regimes 65 this innovation emphasizes decentralized and landscape based strategies which combine a variety of techniques especially retaining detaining harvesting infiltrating and filtering runoff in order to achieve effective runoff management allow groundwater recharge reduce contaminant pollution and protect sensitive ecosystems 9 many of these techniques are not new and represent the resurgence of age old practices 42 abandoned as a result of the promotion of pipe based engineering technology that simply rapidly dumped urban runoff into streams rivers bays lakes and oceans in the united states public agencies have widely introduced this contemporary approach to urban stormwater management commonly denoted as low impact development or lid generally lid refers to a site design strategy with a goal of maintaining or replicating the pre development hydrologic regime through the use of design techniques to create a functionally equivalent hydrologic landscape 72 lid can be applied to nearly all kinds of new development projects and redevelopment sites 81 typically lid utilizes a range of stormwater control measures widely known as best management practices or bmps to achieve its goal according to us epa 75 a bmp is defined as a device practice or method for removing reducing retarding or preventing targeted stormwater runoff constituents pollutants and contaminants from reaching receiving waters the installations commonly used as bmps are abundant 42 for example rain gardens bioswales green roofs rain barrels porous pavements riparian buffers and stormwater wetlands 72 81 the united states environmental protection agency us epa has developed and promoted both principles and guidelines for implementing lid and bmps with the aim of achieving sustainable stormwater management also state and city agencies have aggressively promoted and implemented sustainable stormwater management in particular maryland virginia philadelphia in pennsylvania chicago in illinois portland in oregon seattle in washington san francisco in california and washington d c in addition professional practitioners especially those in environmental engineering and landscape architecture serve as key advocates of this effort given that their professional projects very much involve urban stormwater management 3 anthropocentrism as an impediment to

notes ecological quality tends to look messy and this poses problems for those who imagine and construct new landscapes to enhance ecological quality numerous writings and studies especially in the landscape perception and design fields address this recurring issue e g 16 17 28 35 36 49 51 54 59 66 fixated on the pastoral ideal many americans are unlikely to appreciate sustainable stormwater management landscapes whatever their demonstrated ecological importance as gobster nassauer daniel and fry 18 emphasize aesthetic appreciation substantially affects public support and protection of ecological landscapes meyer 46 furthermore explicates the tenet that aesthetic experience can play a role in re centering human consciousness from an egocentric to a more bio centric perspective by influencing intellectual and moral position s leading to the development of recognition empathy love respect and care for the environment a key to environmental ethics for instance crissy field marsh in san francisco where stormwater runoff is managed before discharging to san francisco bay provides habitat for numerous wildlife species while at the same time that it provides for public recreation as people experience the variation of textures colors and water levels of the marsh and witness the closing of gates to a bridge crossing the marsh that signals periods when the presence of humans would disturb wildlife they develop an aesthetic appreciation of and also a respect for the landscape 46 consequently aligning aesthetic and functional goals of stormwater management facilities proves a challenging task for designers and developers 41 this dilemma underscores the impediments that anthropocentric aesthetic preferences place on the proliferation of sustainable stormwater management policies and practices in the united states 4 advance of stormwater regulations and management paradigms in the united states since the mid twentieth century a series of environmental laws particularly the clean water act cwa the endangered species act esa and the safe drinking water act sdwa have been promulgated and amended with the goal of protecting american waters and ecosystems indeed these federal enactments demonstrated serious concern regarding the environmental impacts of pollution from urban runoff and other diffuse sources requiring that urban runoff management be integral to policies regulation and implementation to achieve good water quality 38 56 57 in response to the legal requirements municipalities across the united states have begun to implement strategies to remove the pollutants from urban stormwater runoff 26 in this effort state and local agencies have extensively promoted and utilized landscape based principles rather than the engineer dominated approaches thus american environmental legislation drives contemporary urban runoff management practices particularly lid and bmps 42 although a range of regulations have influenced the modification of stormwater management paradigms and practices the national pollution discharge elimination system npdes stormwater program has played the most significant role in challenging anthropocentric stormwater management and moving the country toward sustainable future in 1948 the federal water pollution control act fwpca mandated the goal of maintaining and restoring the chemical physical and biological integrity of waters in the united states 55 considerably revised and expanded in 1972 the fwpca became the cwa commonly known today despite the fact that the cwa compelled the reduction of water pollution it did not provide any specific measure that directly regulated stormwater discharges 61 in 1987 the us epa initiated the npdes under the cwa with the aim of emphasizing the role of stormwater in causing or contributing to water quality impairments 55 the npdes stormwater program therefore is in charge of controlling toxic pollutants contaminated in runoff discharged to american waters safeguarding the valuable water resources and ecosystems this represents a move beyond the anthrpocentrism of previous stormwater management regimes as it validates concerns for not only human wellbeing but for ecosystem health as well enactment of the npdes stormwater program notwithstanding degraded and polluted waters still remained as a problematic issue in the country in 1990 the us epa announced the phase i stormwater rules in order to address this longstanding issue these rules focused on the npdes permits which regulate discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4s 2 2 municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 is a publicly owned conveyance or system of conveyances used for collecting or conveying stormwater including roads with drainage systems municipal streets catch basins curbs gutters ditches man made channels and storm drains but it is neither a combined sewer nor a part of a publicly owned treatment works 73 along with industrial activities and construction sites 77 obviously the focus of the phase i regulations was on point source pollution 3 3 point source pollution is polluted water discharged into waterbodies such as streams rivers lakes and oceans at a specific location through pipes outfalls and conveyance channels from either municipal wastewater treatment plants or individual waste treatment facilities 82 discharges which were considered a major threat to water quality at that time as a series of national water quality inventory reports repeatedly revealed that nonpoint source nps pollution 4 4 nonpoint source nps pollution is polluted water that comes from many diffuse sources generally nps pollution is generated as rainfall or snowmelt flows over the ground and carries away pollutants including excess fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural lands oil and geese from urban areas sediment from construction sites and so on into receiving waters 73 formed the leading source of pollutants causing water quality impairments e g 68 69 71 nps pollution particularly urban runoff became a primary and widespread concern 70 in response the us epa issued the phase ii stormwater rules in 1999 this second phase expanded the phase i regulations to require additional control of nps pollution from the small ms4s in urbanized areas and the small construction sites 77 moreover as the us epa intended to reduce further negative impacts from polluted runoff the phase ii also required each ms4 to conduct six ms4 minimum control measures including 1 public education and outreach 2 public participation and involvement 3 illicit discharge detection and elimination 4 construction site runoff control 5 post construction runoff control and 6 pollution prevention and good housekeeping 78 by including the first and the second of the six ms4 measures the us epa clearly realized that public engagement was crucial to the success of stormwater management programs the first measure public education and outreach required programs to educate people about the adverse effects of polluted stormwater runoff and suggested three strategies forming partnerships using educational materials and strategies particularly brochures fact sheets posters stickers interpretive signs websites learning programs and economic incentives and reaching diverse audiences 79 the second measure public participation and involvement required the implementation of programs to give opportunities to the public to play an active role in both the development and implementation of the stormwater management programs the possible practices that could be incorporated into a public participation and involvement program included public meetings and citizen panels volunteer water quality monitoring volunteer educators and speakers storm drain stenciling and community clean ups 80 the goal of these two measures was to establish informed and involved communities which the us epa recognized as essential for achieving successful stormwater management 79 80 this nationally mandated requirement to educate the public about the broader ecosystem interactions of urban runoff certainly implies an attempt to reduce anthropocentric attitudes toward stormwater its goal was to reverse the out of sight out of mind paradigm of early twentieth century urban runoff management which indubitably had immediate beneficial effects for humans but also acutely deleterious effects for aquatic ecosystems especially over the long term in particular it manifested the aim of supplying the public with scientific knowledge to advance their understanding about the water cycle and urban runoff and their connections to far reaching environmental conditions fundamentally it recast urban stormwater as an ecosystem resource not a waste or a nuisance to be managed not only for human benefits but also ecological benefits notably studies especially those conducted in response to the phase ii rules to determine the status of people s stormwater mindsets have revealed that public behavior and awareness related to stormwater pollution has positively changed over time a series of stormwater surveys in san diego proves to be an exemplary case in this regard 19 25 30 33 for example the 2013 survey 22 says that very high proportions of residents say they have made behavioral changes as a direct result of seeing any information about how polluted water in storm drains affects local creeks the beaches and the ocean and suggests that concern about sources of storm drain pollution generally seems to be higher than it was a year ago this re conception of urban runoff management underscores the essential role of public education and environmental science in changing attitudes and behaviors of the public in addition scientific knowledge is fundamental to the aesthetic appreciation of the landscape this tenet was introduced since the 1970s by the philosopher allen carlson who proposes that aesthetic appreciation of environment must be freed from old approaches modeled on formalistic appreciation of isolated objects or picturesque appreciation of scenic beauty yet should be central to the knowledge provided by sciences such as geology biology and ecology 5 specifically it is primarily science that gives knowledge about why it is what it is and what it is like 5 so that science can help people evaluate landscapes expansively releasing them from subjective aesthetic preferences 6 43 64 in view of this idea scientific knowledge forms a pivotal component to move beyond the perennial american affection for the pastoral landscape ideal more specifically knowledge related to ecological processes and sustainable management of urban runoff can motivate people to appreciate stormwater management facilities not only through their visual character but also through their ecological benefits this can in turn result in more public satisfaction and support for such amenities extending scientific understanding to citizens buttresses the growth of public awareness and responsibility and ultimately champions ecological ethics to counter anthropocentric public attitudes toward stormwater management potentially ecological ethics encourages a holistic view of urban stormwater management to consider environmental benefits over or at least equal to human benefits furthermore ethics and aesthetics are related in environmental design 10 40 as blanchon caillot et al 2 note the classic tripartite definition of environmental design forms if ecology is added to aesthetics and ethics in other words the aesthetic appreciation of ecologically sound design involves moral considerations because humans possess instincts concerning the power of nature based on this idea ecological ethics can play a vital part in enhancing aesthetic appreciation of and satisfaction with sustainable stormwater management design the extended implications of the us epa phase ii requirements thus support a fundamental shift in stormwater management paradigm balancing the anthropocentric and the ecocentric perspectives 5 conclusion undeniably anthropocentrism in environmental design has been widespread and caused innumerable severe environmental problems all over the world for decades severe adverse environmental impacts resulting from our human centered perspectives have become apparent threats to not only human health and living conditions but also other species and non living components of the biosphere accordingly in this environmentally conscious age an attempt to reduce the anthropocentrism deeply embedded in people s heads and hearts is an essential yet onerous task in the united states and elsewhere anthropocentrism has long been one of the key impediments to sustainable stormwater management policies and practices the advance of american stormwater regulations particularly the npdes stormwater program along with its phase i and phase ii stormwater rules certainly denotes the use of legislation as advocate and driver for challenging anthropocentrism impeding the implementation of sustainable stormwater management first these regulatory systems acknowledge stormwater as a valuable resource not a waste product and lid as well as bmps as sustainable solutions for stormwater management in consequence in the recent decades stormwater practitioners along with developers and home owners have increasingly adopted and implemented lid and bmps instead of conventionally engineered drainage systems reducing impact from stomwater discharges on waterways and related ecological systems furthermore the regulatory agencies enacted these rules not only to solve persistent problems produced by stormwater runoff but also to foster environmentally aware stormwater management attitudes and actions in the united states especially through public education and participation that cultivates environmental ethics the information and knowledge disseminated in compliance with the first two ms4 measures can make people understand the advantages along with the logics behind the unkempt unappealing appearance of the lid landscapes and then accept and appreciate them releasing people from subjective aesthetic preference for the neat landscape rooted in the park like pastoral ideal of scenic beauty the practice of stormwater management is not the same as ecological restoration or biological conservation because it is fundamentally anthropocentric in particular the requirement for stormwater management will undeniably be focused on public health especially flood and pollution control and public recreation even though the consideration of ecosystem health is incorporated in the practice importantly as sustainable designed landscapes including stormwater management facilities also indisputably interrelate with social routines and spatial practices from daily promenades to commuting to work 46 they can be perceived and regarded as an essential and appealing amenity of the city for many years stormwater practitioners and landscape designers have earnestly worked on getting stormwater practices accepted and supported by local governments and residents as part of necessary urban infrastructure they have dedicated to the design installation and especially long term operation and maintenance in order to make them appeal to the public and produce a civic experience many exemplary cases have appeared throughout the country growing vine street in washington tanner springs park in oregon hunter s point south waterfront park in new york and the dell at the university of virginia invirginia among many others remarkably as the quality of stormwater runoff still remains one of the great environmental challenges in the country efforts to educate people in order to shift their attitudes toward stormwater management from the anthropocentric to the incorporation of the ecocentric will need to continue even though based on the first two ms4 measures supplying education materials and providing participation activities are common means for generating knowledge of sustainable stormwater management many scholars also advocate the idea that stormwater management facilities themselves can be utilized as an opportunity to advance stormwater education over the past decades both academics and professionals have significantly promoted this idea prominent among them are stuart echols and eliza pennypacker who developed an especially inspiring approach to sustainable stormwater management artful rainwater design ard this approach emphasizes the design of stormwater management facilities as an amenity that celebrates rainwater and promotes the experience of rainwater in a way that increases the landscape s attractiveness and value 15 education notably is listed as the first of five amenity goals of ard the other four goals include recreation safety public relations and aesthetic richness for them the education goal is understood as creating favorable conditions to learn about rainwater and related issues 15 they also explicate that an on site stormwater management system can be an engaging opportunity to educate people about rainwater issues from promoting awareness of stormwater best management practices strategies to the site s historical water condition 60 through their extensive analysis of case studies they suggest several design techniques which can effectively contribute to educational results for example creating a narrative of the hydrologic cycle or the historical water condition making stormwater trails or systems visible and legible providing signs or exhibits and arranging tours games or other educational activities 15 one exemplar is pierce county environmental services in washington that provides a well designed trail system in order to display a variety of strategies for stormwater management 60 and also includes a number of particularly appealing and informative interpretive signs at strategic spots in order to augment learning opportunities 14 another is stephen epler hall at portland state university in oregon that uses intriguing iconic stormwater management features particularly the downspouts attached to the building columns the runnels lining across the plaza and the concrete basins filled with river rocks to engage its visitors in deciphering the stormwater management systems of the site and learning about sustainable stormwater management techniques 60 in summary the phase i and phase ii of the npdes stormwater program enacted in the united states under the cwa epitomize the development of regulatory systems for the sake of human beings as well as planetary ecosystems furthermore the phase ii rules emphasize knowledge as a significant booster of positive attitudes and behaviors related to stormwater management therefore it is worth recapitulating that education is exceptionally crucial to make people leave behind their anthropocentric attitudes toward stormwater management in order to build a better and ultimately sustainable future more precisely scientific knowledge helps people understand the bases of environmental problems and stomwater management practices and then develop ecological ethics thereby making them care more about ecosystems and other species however
