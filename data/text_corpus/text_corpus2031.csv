10155,water scarcity and rising temperatures are creating serious concerns over the sustainability of agriculture systems in arid regions of the middle east and north africa the aims were i to calibrate and evaluate the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model using detailed experimental datasets on maize zea mays l yield and water productivity in an arid mediterranean environment and ii to determine the impacts of various irrigation scheduling strategies on maize yield and water productivity in arid sandy soils and produce irrigation scheduling recommendations that maximize the marginal benefit per unit water applied the goodness of fit statistics comparing the observed and simulated crop phenology grain yield dry matter evapotranspiration et and soil water content indicate that the model simulates these crop and soil variables reasonably well for a medium maturity maize hybrid 110 days to physiological maturity commonly grown in the study region long term simulations 1984 2018 using the well calibrated model were performed and included three irrigation scheduling strategies i soil water based irrigation scheduling ii et based threshold irrigation scheduling and iii growth stage et based irrigation scheduling in the soil water based four levels of maximum allowable depletion mad of available soil water content awc were tested using the auto irrigation option of dssat results indicated that mad 50 is recommended for scheduling irrigation in arid sandy soils for potential irrigation water saving without unacceptable yield loss the et based threshold consisted of a combination of four cumulative net et threshold eth triggers of 14 21 28 and 35 mm and five et replacement levels of 50 70 90 110 and 130 et using the dssat et based auto irrigation option based on this irrigation strategy it is more favorable to irrigate at the high frequency of eth 14 or 21 mm than low frequency of eth 35 mm even when replacing 130 et as high drought stress during the crop development and reproductive stages were observed for eth 35 mm due to the omission of key irrigation events in the growth stage et based two levels of irrigation of 100 et and 60 et estimated based on the crop coefficient approach were tested with different combinations of targets during the vegetative and reproductive growth stages results indicated that meeting crop et requirements during the reproductive stage is more essential than during the vegetative stage for greater yield and enhanced wue particularly when available seasonal irrigation water is less than seasonal full crop et requirements in water limited environments reasonable yield and enhanced wue can be achieved by applying a deficit rate of 40 et during the vegetative stage and 80 et during the reproductive stage or scheduling irrigation based on soil water content to ensure awc of 30 in the top 0 30 cm soil layer throughout the growing season concepts developed in the present study can be adapted to effectively manage irrigation scheduling for medium maturity maize hybrids in arid sandy soils with low awc and organic c content keywords irrigation scheduling arid mediterranean climate dssat ceres maize sandy soil water use efficiency drought stress 1 introduction several challenges are facing field crops production in arid regions the most critical include water scarcity and the accompanying salinity stress extremes in temperature soil degradation and desertification aridity refers to a condition of prolonged dryness which is expressed as a function of temperature and precipitation in three zones hyper arid arid and semi arid north african countries including egypt where the present research has been conducted are in the arid zone with precipitation levels of usually less than 300 mm in this region agricultural systems are highly vulnerable to variability in climate which is expected to increase with more frequent and intense heat waves ipcc 2014 the challenges are further amplified by the increased demand for food and fiber production in this region to meet the growing population consumption needs this requires identifying efficient adaptation strategies for production systems of major cereal crops such as maize zea mays l and wheat triticum aestivum l such strategies should consider the interactions between weather condition soil properties and management practices several studies have reported on the negative impacts of heat and water stress on biomass production pollen viability and kernel number in maize cultivars with both temperate and tropical genetic backgrounds herrero and johnson 1981 edreira et al 2011 heat stress intensifies under water deficit conditions as the latter causes significant reductions in leaf water potential and photosynthetic pigments kebede et al 2012 documented a reduction in maize photosynthetic pigments due to a loss of chloroplast membrane integrity and damage to the photosynthetic apparatus by the combined effects of drought and heat stress these negative impacts of environmental abiotic stresses can be alleviated by adopting efficient scheduling strategies that apply the right amount of water at the right time based on agronomic and physiological information ullah et al 2019 for example in drip irrigated maize yield and water use efficiency wue increase by optimizing the coupling between irrigation rate and frequency el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 other research finds that maize grain yield and water productivity increase significantly with frequent irrigation at deficit rates compared with infrequent irrigation at high rates hokam et al 2011 however such a strategy does not increase yield or water productivity in a different semi arid environment howell et al 1997 lamm and trooien 2003 this indicates that results of such management decisions are influenced by the interaction between several input factors and the surrounding environment for instance mansour et al 2017 reported a significant genotype by irrigation interaction for barley hordeum vulgare l grown in an environment similar to that of present research and concluded that drought tolerant genotypes yield more with less water compared with drought sensitive genotypes therefore the type of irrigation scheduling needs to be tested to assess its spatial and temporal effects in relation to climate soil variability and the genetics of planted material process based cropping system models can after proper parameterization and calibration help determine crop management decisions as a function of climate soil and genetics of the planted material process based models offer the ability to predict the main intermediate processes outcomes that take place at any given time in the system e g dry matter accumulation prior to final yield of these models the crop environment resource synthesis ceres maize model part of the decision support systems for agrotechnology transfer dssat has been developed over the past three decades to simulate crop responses to management factors as they interact with climate and soil properties jones et al 2003 dejonge et al 2012 such simulations help develop cropping and management strategies for maize production across a wide range of environments nouna et al 2000 xie et al 2001 mastrorilli et al 2003 liu et al 2012 adnan et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 to improve the model research has focused on improving the mechanistic representation of transpiration soil water photosynthesis c allocation canopy temperature and water productivity under non stress and water limited conditions sau et al 2004 dejonge et al 2012 lizaso et al 2017 yakoub et al 2017 as a result the model performs acceptably well in predicting grain yield and soil water balance in cereal crops such as maize and wheat responding to various irrigation scheduling practices in different environments fang et al 2010 attia et al 2016 kisekka et al 2016 kothari et al 2019 gaps remain in knowledge on how yield and water productivity of maize respond to various irrigation scheduling practices in the arid sandy soils of the present study in the present research we evaluated and applied the dssat ceres maize model using a long term historical weather dataset to simulate maize yield and wue in arid sandy soils the objectives of this study were i to calibrate and evaluate the ceres maize model using datasets from irrigation scheduling experiments on drip irrigated maize production in the study region and ii to apply the calibrated model to determine the impacts of various deficit irrigation scheduling strategies on maize yield and water productivity in arid sandy soils and generate irrigation scheduling recommendations that maximize the marginal benefit per unit water applied to our knowledge this the first attempt in this region to use long term weather data to determine alternative deficit irrigation scheduling strategies that maximize the marginal benefits per unit of water applied without significant yield loss 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of ceres maize module the cropping system dssat ceres maize module part of dssat version 4 7 5 hoogenboom et al 2019 simulates the development of roots and shoots growth and senescence of leaves and stems biomass accumulation and growth and yield of maize as a function of soil weather and management practices jones et al 2003 the model utilizes mathematical equations to describe the basic flow and conversion processes of soil carbon water and nutrient balances on a daily basis and predicts the temporal changes in nutrient uptake water use and crop growth and yield biomass accumulation is simulated as a result of the product of crop specific radiation use efficiency and photosynthetically active radiation computed on a daily basis and partitioned between above and below ground biomass the computation takes into account the supply and demands of soil water carbon and nutrients with a priority of c allocation for the above ground biomass soil water content swc is modeled on a daily basis in several layers and is based on a soil water balance approach that considers of precipitation irrigation soil evaporation transpiration and runoff and drainage from the profile ritchie et al 2009 the et is simulated based on two options i priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 or ii fao 56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 the default priestley taylor method requires less weather variables of solar radiation and minimum and maximum temperature whereas wind speed and humidity data are required for the reference et estimation in the fao 56 penman monteith method the crop coefficient kc over the season is determined as a function of leaf area index lai and potential et is partitioned to potential transpiration and potential evaporation details on et simulation in the model can be found in dejonge et al 2012 2 2 model input data 2 2 1 crop management data data from four field experiments investigating surface drip irrigated maize planted on sandy soils entisol in ismailia egypt were used for the model calibration and evaluation table 1 objectives were to investigate maize yield and wue in response to various levels of irrigation measured data included soil physical and hydrological properties and crop development growth and final yield in two experiments the seasonal crop et and swc at 0 90 cm soil depth were also recorded the 1st experiment was conducted in 2005 and 2006 growing seasons and compared 3 et based irrigation levels each year namely 100 et 80 et and 60 et replacements corresponding to total water amounts of 595 476 and 357 mm respectively el hendawy et al 2008 the 2nd field experiment was carried out in 2005 and 2006 growing seasons and compared the following 4 irrigation frequency treatments once in 2 3 4 and 5 days referred to as f2 to f5 respectively assigned as the main plots in a randomized complete block split split plot design the total amount of water applied for each irrigation treatment was 524 mm and a blank application was included at planting to ensure full germination hokam et al 2011 the 3rd field experiment was carried out in 2007 and 2008 growing seasons and compared 12 irrigation treatments during each season treatments consisted of three et replacement levels of 100 et 80 et and 60 et nested within four irrigation frequency treatments el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 the 4th experiment was conducted in 2011 and 2012 growing seasons and compared the following et based irrigation levels each year 100 et 80 et and 60 et replacements corresponding to total water amounts of 625 500 375 mm respectively el hendawy et al 2014 these experiments compared a total of 44 treatments that all reported the final grain yield as well as other soil and or plant measurements table 1 the planted varieties are medium maturity varieties namely triple cross 310 sc310 in the 1st experiment and single cross 10 sc10 in the 2nd 3rd and 4th experiments other agronomic management data used as input for each experimental file of the model are described in table 1 2 2 2 weather and soil data climate data from 1984 to 2018 including minimum and maximum temperature c precipitation mm solar radiation mjm 2 d 1 and wind speed ms 1 were obtained from nearby i e within 10 km at ismailia egypt weather stations maintained by the egyptian meteorological authority ema all records were complete except for some missing solar radiation values that were obtained from nasa s prediction of worldwide energy resources a repository of global meteorological datasets https power larc nasa gov average minimum and maximum temperatures during the summer season from may to september were 20 c and 35 c respectively table 2 precipitation occurs during winter from november to april with an average of 80 mm over the period from 1984 to 2018 summer precipitation is negligible the soil is sandy throughout the profile sandy mixed hyperthermic typic torripsamments with approximately 90 sand content and 0 3 0 6 soc and classified as an entisol some of the soil input parameters were from measured data at each experimental site while others were generated using the sbuild tool of dssat measurements included soil physical properties of clay and sand percentages soc gkg 1 and bulk density gcm 3 the swc at the permanent wilting point and at field capacity were also measured at each site and were used to set up the soil water lower and upper limits respectively in the soil profile for each site table 3 the remaining input parameters such as root growth factor and soil water at saturation were generated using the sbuild tool of the model according to the measured soil hydrological parameters at each experiment the soil water holding capacity ranged from 55 mm m 1 soil in the 4th experiment to 60 68 mm m 1 soil in the 1st and 2nd experiments table 3 2 3 calibration and evaluation of the ceres maize module the ceres maize module of dssat csm was calibrated against the measured data from the high irrigation treatments in all experiments and was evaluated against data from the medium and low irrigation treatments in all experiments as it is recommended to calibrate the model under non stress conditions boote 1999 the high irrigation treatments in each experiment produced the highest yields compared to others the cultivar specific parameters were calibrated sequentially starting with phenological development parameters controlling anthesis and physiological maturity dates the radiation use efficiency rue value in ecotype specific parameters was adjusted to 3 7 g dry matter mj 1 par based on model calibration to fit dry matter recorded at 60 and 75 dap at the high irrigation level in the 2nd experiment crop yield parameters were obtained by fitting the model to observed grain yield at high irrigation levels initial values of cultivar parameters for calibrating a new cultivar were determined based on the dssat default medium maturity variety 990002 with the default ecotype ib0001 to estimate parameters based on the observed data the generalized likelihood uncertainty analysis glue sub module in dssat was used to estimate cultivar specific parameters the glue uses a bayesian method based on monte carlo sampling techniques applied to prior distributions of a parameter value and a gaussian likelihood function in parameters estimation depending on the observed data he et al 2010 the measured grain yield was reported at 15 5 grain moisture content thus grain yield value was reduced by 15 5 because the model simulates dry weight in addition to crop phenology growth and yield the model was evaluated for its ability to simulate the maximum lai measured in the 2nd experiment et measured in the 3rd experiment and swc measured in the 1st experiment the lai was determined destructively at v10 anthesis and physiological maturity hokam et al 2011 since the maximum lai in dssat ceres maize module is simulated at silking simulated max lai was compared with measured max lai at anthesis the et was estimated based on the soil water balance approach for 24 treatments in two growing seasons in the 3rd experiment see section 2 3 el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 and the simulated swc was compared to swc measured before and after each irrigation event 20 in total starting 23 dap at 0 90 cm soil depth in the 1st experiment el hendawy et al 2008 the swc was estimated by the gravimetric method oven dry basis and the values were multiplied by the bulk density of the respective soil layer therefore converted to a percentage volumetric basis model performance was evaluated using three indices the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse and mean percentage error mpe utilizing modeval function in the r package sirad bojanowski 2016 normalized rmse values 10 indicates an excellent prediction 10 and 20 indicates a good prediction 20 but 30 indicates a fair prediction and 30 denotes a poor prediction bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 the mpe value indicates the model s tendency to over positive or under negative estimate the observed data 2 4 irrigation scheduling strategies three irrigation scheduling strategies were implemented using long term historical weather data from 1984 to 2018 35 independent growing seasons in the study region and the soil profile of the 4th experiment with an average soil water holding capacity of 55 mm m 1 and soc of 0 59 in the 0 30 cm soil layer the initial swc at planting was set near saturation other agronomic management practices similar to those practiced in the 4th experiment were implemented table 1 the first irrigation scheduling strategy was based on the maximum allowable depletion mad of the available swc awc threshold for triggering irrigation using automatic when required auto irrigation based on swc option in dssat the second strategy was based on cumulative crop et threshold eth to trigger irrigation using auto irrigation based on et option in dssat the third strategy was based on replacing daily crop et requirements every 3 days with different targets during the vegetative and reproductive stages of the crop the first second and third irrigation scheduling strategies will be referred to as soil water based irrigation scheduling et based threshold irrigation scheduling and growth stage et based irrigation scheduling respectively simulated grain yield adjusted for 15 5 moisture content biomass yield wue for grain and biomass yield estimated as dry matter production per unit of et et and amount irrigation water were analyzed details of each strategy are explained in the following sections 2 4 1 soil water based irrigation scheduling in this irrigation scheduling four levels of mad 70 50 30 and 10 in the top 0 30 cm soil layer were applied to trigger irrigation to refill the soil water up to field capacity for instance an mad of 70 means that irrigation is triggered to replenish the reservoir up to field capacity in the top 30 cm soil layer whenever the awc in this layer falls below 30 to trigger this auto irrigation option in the model code a automatic when required was specified which determines the timing and amounts of irrigation water based on the available awc in the 0 30 cm soil layer default auto irrigation depth in the model other researchers have recommended the 0 45 cm soil layer to be considered for scheduling irrigation based on awc in sandy loam soil in sub tropical regions panda et al 2004 and therefore we accepted the default auto irrigation management depth of 30 cm for this irrigation scheduling the management depth was set at 30 cm and the threshold of maximum available awc ithrl was varied from 30 to 90 i e mad 70 to 10 while keeping the end point of maximum available awc ithru constant at 100 the model was run for 35 independent years from 1984 to 2018 with four mad treatments each year resulting in 140 simulations in total comparisons among treatments means were made using fisher s least significant difference lsd test following the anova test for a completely randomized design replicated by years as a random source of error using r software 2 4 2 et based threshold irrigation scheduling in this irrigation scheduling the auto irrigation based on et option code e in the file x was specified which triggers irrigation when cumulative amount of et minus any rainfall event net eto reaches a specified value imdep and determines the amount of water applied as a percentage of et ithru the calculated water amount is then passed to the water balance and the cumulative net et is then reset to zero with logging of amounts and timing of irrigation similar to automatic irrigation based on swc code a the et based threshold irrigation scheduling was run for four cumulative net et threshold triggers eth of 14 21 28 and 35 mm and five et replacement levels of 50 70 90 110 and 130 et resulting in 20 irrigation treatments combinations each year and thus 700 simulations in total regression analyses between grain yield or wue and et replacement i e et 50 70 etc or irrigation water amounts at each irrigation trigger level i e eth 14 mm 21 mm etc was performed using r software 2 4 3 growth stage et based irrigation scheduling in this irrigation scheduling different water deficit scenarios based on replacing various percentages of et during the vegetative and reproductive growth stages of maize were tested two levels of irrigation high and low were applied with different combinations of targets during the vegetative and reproductive growth stages the high irrigation level was applied to replace 100 of the crop s et requirements and the low level was applied to replace 60 of the crop s et requirements the daily crop et requirements were calculated based on the crop coefficient approach etc k c eto where k c is the site specific crop coefficient and eto is the grass reference et mmd 1 estimated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 using historical weather data 1984 2018 of the study region the grass reference et was calculated using historical weather data of minimum and maximum temperatures solar radiation wind speed and dew point temperature daily records of dew point temperature required for the actual vapor pressure estimation was obtained from nasa s prediction of worldwide energy resources https power larc nasa gov site specific maize crop coefficient values of 0 20 in the initial 1 20 in the mid and 0 35 in the late season were used as recommended for maize in the study region fig s1 el hendawy et al 2014 details of the grass reference et estimation are described in the supplementary material uniform applications of 120 mm were applied to all treatments during the first 2 weeks after planting and then irrigation scheduling was started 17 dap to replace the cumulative daily et amounts of the previous 3 days i e frequency of once every 3 days as 17 20 23 104 dap to be terminated at 104 dap for a total number of 32 applications during the growing season the daily crop et is considered as net et in this study due to the absence of precipitation during the summer season within each irrigation level irrigation targets defined as 40 60 80 and 100 were applied separately during the vegetative from 17 to 58 dap and reproductive from 59 to 104 dap stages each year of the long term simulations combinations of these percentages resulted in 16 irrigation treatments e g 40 v 80 r defines a percentage of 40 of the irrigation level during the vegetative stage and 80 of the irrigation level during the reproductive stage each year for two irrigation levels therefore there were 16 combinations of percentages applied for two irrigation levels across 35 years resulting in 1120 simulations average and standard deviation of irrigation water applied during the vegetative and reproductive stages at the high level of 100 et and the low level of 60 et are shown in table s1 scripting in r software was utilized to facilitate editing the file x and run the model for 16 irrigation treatments each year of the long term simulations treatments means were compared using the fisher s protected least significant difference lsd at the p 0 05 probability level following the anova test for a completely randomized design replicated by years as a random source of error using r software 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and evaluation the calibrated values for the genotype specific parameters in the dssat csm ceres maize model that produced the best fit to the observed data under non stress conditions the crop phenology variables of anthesis and physiological maturity dates agreed well with predicted data as indicated by nrmse and mpe values of 10 table 4 the value for p1 thermal time from seedling appearance to the end of the juvenile phase was 320 c day corresponding to a medium to late flowering maize hybrid the values for p2 day length sensitivity coefficient that is the delay in days for each hour increase in photoperiod above the longest photoperiod at which development proceed at maximum rate 12 5 h was set to 0 8 day per hour and the value for p5 thermal time from flowering to physiological maturity was calibrated to 868 c day corresponding to a medium maturity duration hybrid these values are closely similar to those reported for medium maturity maize hybrid in another semi arid environment hammad et al 2018 simulated grain yield in comparison with the observed data in the model calibration and evaluation is shown in fig 1 the simulated grain yield matches well the observed grain yield which was demonstrated by an nrmse of 11 7 and an mpe of 3 1 the model also simulated the amount of dry matter at 60 and 75 dap reasonably well with nrmse and mpe values of 30 and 12 respectively table 4 the values for g2 maximum number of kernel per plant was calibrated to 794 and g3 kernel filling rate was calibrated to 8 5 mg day 1 the values of g2 and g3 indicate that sc10 is a medium to high yielding hybrid for arid environments the calibrated phint phyllochron interval was 51 c day which is closely within the range reported by bao et al 2017 of 48 9 53 9 for some maize hybrids and our cultivar coefficients are within the range of their reported coefficients for these hybrids calibration of crop phenology parameters resulted in the best match with observed data in the model calibration but slight overestimates occurred in the model evaluation average observed anthesis date in the model evaluation was 2 d less than during calibration while model prediction of this variable remained constant resulting in increased mpe from 5 2 to 8 8 table 4 similarly the mpe for maturity date was transformed from slight underestimation during calibration to slight overestimation during evaluation but the rmse remained the same 5 d this indicates lack of model response to soil water stress in simulating maize phenology nonetheless the observed and simulated crop phenological data indicate acceptable model performance other crop variables used in the model evaluation are maximum lai and dry matter at 60 and 75 dap the model reasonably well simulated maximum lai recorded in the 2nd experiment as indicated by nrmse 20 table 4 for dry matter the model fairly simulated this variable with rmse of 1 3mgha 1 and nrmse of 30 but mpe showed over prediction by 30 under water stress treatments observed grain yield in the model evaluation ranged from 1225 to 6435 kg ha 1 in response to 34 deficit irrigation treatments applied in eight site yr field experiments fig 1 the model simulation of grain yield in the model evaluation showed a good response to water deficit treatments with the calibrated genotype cultivar parameters and the soil input data for each experiment table 3 this was further demonstrated by nrmse 20 and mpe of 1 16 showing that prediction had a good agreement with the observed data table 4 modeled grain yield indicated high performance in capturing differences in response to water stress across sites table 4 the rmse and nrmse were 0 69mgha 1 and 20 respectively during calibration and evaluation while mpe showed slight underestimation during calibration and very slight overestimation during evaluation nonetheless the model simulation of grain yield indicated good stability in response to water stress treatments across different cropping seasons in different sites fig 2 shows the comparison between observed and simulated et and swc in the model evaluation the comparison between observed and simulated et is shown in fig 2 which showed a better model performance predicting et under non water stress conditions than water stress conditions the mpe was 4 0 and the nrmse was 10 under non water stress conditions whereas when considering water stress conditions the mpe has increased to 7 0 and the nrmse was 15 table 4 as for swc simulation results indicated well prediction of this soil water variable with nrmse of 12 5 under non water stress condition i1 table 4 while there was slight under estimation under water stress conditions i2 table 4 nonetheless the overall swc simulation indicate acceptable model performance with rmse of only 10 mm 90 cm 1 these results suggest better model prediction of et and swc under non stress than stress conditions previous research has reported the complexity of precisely predicting yield and et under stress conditions evett and tolk 2009 dejonge et al 2011 in the present study the model tended to slightly underestimate et values in water stress scenarios fig 2 other researchers reported that permanent wilting point played a significant role in ceres wheat simulation of soil moisture content in 0 100 cm which has been improved by manually tuning this parameter yao et al 2020 3 2 irrigation scheduling strategies 3 2 1 soil water based irrigation scheduling as expected keeping the awc at 90 by mad 10 treatment produced the highest grain yield of 6 87mgha 1 averaged over the 35 growing seasons which was 46 higher than mad 70 with mad 50 and 30 in between table 5 the biomass yield followed similar trend with mad 10 producing significantly 32 higher biomass yield than mad 70 on the other hand mad 70 had the highest wue for both grain and biomass yields with 37 less irrigation water enhanced wue was also achieved by mad 50 compared with mad 10 and as for grain and biomass yields mad 50 had an intermediate yield level in between mad 10 and 70 table 5 in addition the total number of irrigation events was much less for mad 50 compared with mad 10 suggesting a lower production cost other researchers have found that a mad level of 45 resulted in the highest wue for maize in sandy loam soils compared to lower and higher mad levels panda et al 2004 our results suggest possible water saving and improved wue for grain and biomass yields while producing acceptable yield level by the deficit irrigation rate of mad 50 in the top 0 30 cm soil layer agreeing with previous research findings on maize irrigation scheduling in another arid environment gheysari et al 2017 this is of great importance in light of water shortage in arid regions of the present research in middle east and north africa where increasing wue is more important than maximizing yield potential 3 2 2 et based threshold irrigation scheduling the et based threshold irrigation scheduling consisted of four eth triggers for triggering irrigation and five et replacement levels resulting in 20 treatments each year of the long term simulations across the 35 years the relationship between grain yield and et replacement levels at different eth triggers is illustrated in fig 3a across eth triggers the 50 et replacement had the lowest yield of 1 6mgha 1 whereas the 110 et had the highest yield of 4 6mgha 1 fig 3a by looking at the grain yield response to different eth triggers across all et replacement levels we can see that there were three different yield categories i high by eth 14 and 21 mm ii medium by eth 28 mm threshold and iii low by eth 35 threshold these results indicate that plants had experienced high level of water stress for the 50 et replacement or when irrigation was triggered at eth 35 mm as indicated by drought stress index not shown as high as 0 55 during the crop development and reproductive stages the interaction between eth levels and et replacement levels indicated that the highest grain yield of 6 4mgha 1 was produced at 112 et for the eth 14 mm fig 3a however the wue for grain yield showed that replacing 105 of et and triggering irrigation at eth 21 mm produced the highest wue of 10 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig 3b and the grain yield at this level was only 8 less than the highest yield of 6 4mgha 1 in general a higher wue was observed at the eth 21 mm compared to other eth triggers regardless the et replacement levels therefore it can be indicated that based on grain yield and wue results triggering irrigation at 21 mm threshold and replacing 100 of et is a plausible option for irrigation scheduling in arid sandy soils for both improved wue and acceptable yield potential on the other hand unacceptable yield reduction was reported for eth 35 mm regardless of the et replacement level and therefore should be avoided in arid regions where maize is mainly dependent on irrigation water to grow our results agree with previous research findings on maize irrigation scheduling in arid sandy soils as it is more favorable to irrigate in high frequency even with less amounts of water than applying more water in low frequency el hendawy et al 2008 this might be attributed to the low soil water holding capacity and high summer temperatures which commonly exceed 37 c during peak growth stages table 2 responses of grain yield and wue to irrigation water are reported in fig 4 irrigation water of 790 mm produced the highest grain yield of 6 33mgha 1 when irrigation was triggered at eth 14 mm nevertheless if this amount of irrigation water is unavailable 575 mm of irrigation water corresponding to 90 et with eth of 21 mm produced an acceptable yield level of 5 21mgha 1 fig 4a in addition amounts of 575 mm of irrigation water produced higher wue of 9 65 kg ha 1 mm 1 when irrigation was triggered at eth 21 mm compared with other eth triggers fig 4b considering the average estimated daily etc of maize in the study region during peak growth stages of 7 5 mmd 1 fig s2 eth 21 mm means that irrigation in absence of rainfall should be approximately scheduled every 3 days to avoid severe water stress during this critical growth stage and consequently high yield reduction these results are in agreement with previous research findings of greater wue of maize grain yield in sandy soils of about 12 kg ha 1 mm 1 when replacing 100 et every 3 days el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 therefore it can be concluded that if water is available irrigating at eth 21 mm and replacing 105 of et is the recommended rate for potential yield and greater wue within eth scheduling strategy otherwise deficit rate of 90 et replacement at eth 21 mm can be imposed for potential water saving with acceptable yield level and high wue 3 2 3 growth stage et based irrigation scheduling at the high irrigation level of 100 et significantly greater yield was produced by high rates of 80 v 100 r and 100 v 100 r followed by deficit rates of 100 v 80 r 80 v 80 r and 60 v 100 r table 6 among the other deficit rates significantly greater yield was produced by treatments with higher targets during the reproductive stage than treatments with higher targets during the vegetative stage for instance treatment 40 v 60 r produced a greater yield than 60 v 40 r and treatment 40 v 80 r produced a greater yield than 80 v 40 r table 6 wue for grain yield showed additional advantage for deficit rates with higher targets during the reproductive stage which could be clearly attributed to their significantly higher yields using less amounts of water the biomass yield followed similar trend in general to grain yield but with significantly less yield for deficit rates applying lower target during the vegetative stage compared with full irrigation table 6 interestingly the highest wue for biomass yield was produced by the deficit rate of 80 v 80 r followed by 80 v 100 r suggesting that deficit targets during the vegetative stage are more advantageous compared to full irrigation deficit rate during the vegetative stage might have induced plants ability to explore large amounts of soil water in deep layers and therefore getting additional benefits of full irrigation during the reproductive stages pandey et al 2000 stated that maize plants might extend rooting depth in the soil searching for greater volume of water extraction as an adaptive strategy to cope with vegetative water stress results of seasonal maize et showed significant differences among treatments with higher simulated et of 570 and 545 mm by full irrigation and 100 v 80 r respectively table 6 by looking at irrigation water applied by these treatments we can see that approximately 40 mm could be saved by deficit rate 80 v 100 r without significant yield loss and about 80 mm could be saved by deficit rate 60 v 100 r with only 4 less yield compared with 100 v 100 r table 6 our results corroborate the findings of comas et al 2019 who evaluated twelve varying levels of deficit irrigation during late vegetative and grain filling growth stages of maize in another semi arid environment and reported that deficit irrigation during late vegetative stage e g 40 et produced similar yield to that produced by full irrigation while saving approximately 15 17 of the seasonal crop et requirements these results indicate enhanced efficacy of irrigation scheduling by these deficit irrigation rates which has resulted in increased wue results of the 16 irrigation treatments at the low irrigation level of 60 et followed similar trend to the high irrigation level of 100 et with even more pronounced advantage for higher target during reproductive stage table 6 this was demonstrated by the non significantly different grain yield by deficit rates of 40 60 80 v 100 r than 100 v 100 r and consequently greater wue for grain yield by 40 v 100 r for biomass yield significantly greater yield was produced by 100 v 100 r followed by 80 v 100 r with mostly similar wue to other deficit rates except the significantly greater wue by 40 v 80 r table 6 corresponding amounts of irrigation water showed about 70 mm water saving by the deficit rate of 40 v 100 r and at the same time produced similar grain yield to 100 v 100 r results of the 16 irrigation scheduling treatments at both the high and low levels indicated significant advantage by avoiding severe water stress during reproductive stage which was more pronounced at the low irrigation level across irrigation levels the drought stress index indicated greater stress by plants that received less water during reproductive stage even with the highest target during the vegetative stage e g 100 v 40 r had drought index of 0 37 vs 0 26 by 40 v 100 r not shown which indicates that under limited irrigation water availability deficit rate could be imposed during the vegetative stage rather than reproductive stage in general grain yield and wue responses to the high and low irrigation levels suggest maintaining irrigation targets 60 et during reproductive stage for avoiding high yield loss and enhanced wue in water limited environments in other words imposing deficit rates during the vegetative stage seems to be a plausible alternative option in water limited environments for enhancing wue and saving irrigation water that can be allocated later during the reproductive stage 3 2 4 comparison among irrigation scheduling strategies selected treatments from the previously discussed irrigation scheduling strategies are compared under two levels of irrigation water i high 550 mm and ii low 450 mm using two dimensional kernel density estimation kernel estimation of probability produces a smooth empirical probability density function based on individual locations of all sample data high kernel density indicates high intensity or clustering of destinations moderate kernel density may indicate dispersed destinations while low kernel density indicates negligible highly dispersed destination we are interested in observing the frequencies of high grain yield and wue simultaneously under irrigation water 550 mm there was one distinct peak of density for all compared treatments with different grain yield and wue values fig 5 the highest density profiles occurred at density estimates of 0 15 and had grain yield of 6 74 and 6 50mgha 1 and wue of 9 61 and 10 40 kg ha 1 mm 1 for mad 30 and eth 14 mm treatments respectively fig 5a and b the highest density profiles occurred at density estimates of 0 1 and indicated lower grain yield about 5 69mgha 1 but similar level of wue of 10 10 kg ha 1 mm 1 for eth 21 mm treatment fig 5c in 80 100 et treatment the highest density profiles occurred at density estimates of 0 08 and had grain yield of 8 05mgha 1 and wue of 12 27 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig 5d this shows that the data were clustered over a narrower range of density in the 80 100 et treatment with higher yield and wue than other treatments these results indicate that the growth stage et based irrigation scheduling strategy is more efficient than other scheduling strategies when the available water for irrigation was 550 mm reports on comparing different irrigation management strategies for maize in arid environment are scarce in the literature an exception to our knowledge was the study of gheysari et al 2017 in another arid environment who compared the effect of fixed intervals variable depth with variable intervals fixed depth based on various eth triggers on silage maize root and aboveground biomass characteristics and irrigation wue and reported greater total biomass root development and irrigation wue of maize by fixed intervals variable depth strategy they attributed these results to the negative impacts associated with high water stress as a result of omission of key irrigation events during the crop development and mid season by the variable intervals strategy present results suggest that irrigating at fixed intervals with imposed deficit rate during the vegetative stage of 80 of crop et requirements or at mad 30 utilized the available water for irrigation more efficiently than irrigating at eth 21 mm at the low water level of 450 mm treatments mad 70 and 60 60 et showed one peak with closely similar yield of 4 50mgha 1 and wue of 9 05 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig 6a and d for eth treatments there were two distinct peaks with lower yield level of 3 0mgha 1 fig 6b and c at this low water level the et replacement level was 70 for the eth treatments which may have contributed to yield and wue variations across years and therefore different clusters of data these results indicate that scheduling irrigation to maintain the awc in the top 0 30 cm soil layer at 30 could be considered as an efficient management strategy that optimizes yield and wue in water limited environments that said it is important to note that consistent uniformity of applied water e g drip irrigation system is essential to reproduce the relative differences reported here among these management strategies in another arid environment 4 conclusions results of the present research demonstrated the potential of the dssat model for testing large number of agronomic treatments across long term temporal scale the model reasonably well simulated grain yield crop et and soil moisture content in response to different irrigation treatments across 8 years site field experiments results of the long term model application indicated that scheduling irrigation at fixed intervals is more efficient than et based variable intervals for greater yield and wue of maize in the arid environment of the study region it was also observed that imposing deficit rate of 80 et during vegetative stage could be implemented in arid environments for greater wue without significant yield reduction results also indicated that the generally accepted level of 50 awc in crop production was also an effective irrigation scheduling option for maize production in arid sandy soils concepts developed in this study is applicable for efficient irrigation scheduling of medium maturity maize hybrids in

10155,water scarcity and rising temperatures are creating serious concerns over the sustainability of agriculture systems in arid regions of the middle east and north africa the aims were i to calibrate and evaluate the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model using detailed experimental datasets on maize zea mays l yield and water productivity in an arid mediterranean environment and ii to determine the impacts of various irrigation scheduling strategies on maize yield and water productivity in arid sandy soils and produce irrigation scheduling recommendations that maximize the marginal benefit per unit water applied the goodness of fit statistics comparing the observed and simulated crop phenology grain yield dry matter evapotranspiration et and soil water content indicate that the model simulates these crop and soil variables reasonably well for a medium maturity maize hybrid 110 days to physiological maturity commonly grown in the study region long term simulations 1984 2018 using the well calibrated model were performed and included three irrigation scheduling strategies i soil water based irrigation scheduling ii et based threshold irrigation scheduling and iii growth stage et based irrigation scheduling in the soil water based four levels of maximum allowable depletion mad of available soil water content awc were tested using the auto irrigation option of dssat results indicated that mad 50 is recommended for scheduling irrigation in arid sandy soils for potential irrigation water saving without unacceptable yield loss the et based threshold consisted of a combination of four cumulative net et threshold eth triggers of 14 21 28 and 35 mm and five et replacement levels of 50 70 90 110 and 130 et using the dssat et based auto irrigation option based on this irrigation strategy it is more favorable to irrigate at the high frequency of eth 14 or 21 mm than low frequency of eth 35 mm even when replacing 130 et as high drought stress during the crop development and reproductive stages were observed for eth 35 mm due to the omission of key irrigation events in the growth stage et based two levels of irrigation of 100 et and 60 et estimated based on the crop coefficient approach were tested with different combinations of targets during the vegetative and reproductive growth stages results indicated that meeting crop et requirements during the reproductive stage is more essential than during the vegetative stage for greater yield and enhanced wue particularly when available seasonal irrigation water is less than seasonal full crop et requirements in water limited environments reasonable yield and enhanced wue can be achieved by applying a deficit rate of 40 et during the vegetative stage and 80 et during the reproductive stage or scheduling irrigation based on soil water content to ensure awc of 30 in the top 0 30 cm soil layer throughout the growing season concepts developed in the present study can be adapted to effectively manage irrigation scheduling for medium maturity maize hybrids in arid sandy soils with low awc and organic c content keywords irrigation scheduling arid mediterranean climate dssat ceres maize sandy soil water use efficiency drought stress 1 introduction several challenges are facing field crops production in arid regions the most critical include water scarcity and the accompanying salinity stress extremes in temperature soil degradation and desertification aridity refers to a condition of prolonged dryness which is expressed as a function of temperature and precipitation in three zones hyper arid arid and semi arid north african countries including egypt where the present research has been conducted are in the arid zone with precipitation levels of usually less than 300 mm in this region agricultural systems are highly vulnerable to variability in climate which is expected to increase with more frequent and intense heat waves ipcc 2014 the challenges are further amplified by the increased demand for food and fiber production in this region to meet the growing population consumption needs this requires identifying efficient adaptation strategies for production systems of major cereal crops such as maize zea mays l and wheat triticum aestivum l such strategies should consider the interactions between weather condition soil properties and management practices several studies have reported on the negative impacts of heat and water stress on biomass production pollen viability and kernel number in maize cultivars with both temperate and tropical genetic backgrounds herrero and johnson 1981 edreira et al 2011 heat stress intensifies under water deficit conditions as the latter causes significant reductions in leaf water potential and photosynthetic pigments kebede et al 2012 documented a reduction in maize photosynthetic pigments due to a loss of chloroplast membrane integrity and damage to the photosynthetic apparatus by the combined effects of drought and heat stress these negative impacts of environmental abiotic stresses can be alleviated by adopting efficient scheduling strategies that apply the right amount of water at the right time based on agronomic and physiological information ullah et al 2019 for example in drip irrigated maize yield and water use efficiency wue increase by optimizing the coupling between irrigation rate and frequency el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 other research finds that maize grain yield and water productivity increase significantly with frequent irrigation at deficit rates compared with infrequent irrigation at high rates hokam et al 2011 however such a strategy does not increase yield or water productivity in a different semi arid environment howell et al 1997 lamm and trooien 2003 this indicates that results of such management decisions are influenced by the interaction between several input factors and the surrounding environment for instance mansour et al 2017 reported a significant genotype by irrigation interaction for barley hordeum vulgare l grown in an environment similar to that of present research and concluded that drought tolerant genotypes yield more with less water compared with drought sensitive genotypes therefore the type of irrigation scheduling needs to be tested to assess its spatial and temporal effects in relation to climate soil variability and the genetics of planted material process based cropping system models can after proper parameterization and calibration help determine crop management decisions as a function of climate soil and genetics of the planted material process based models offer the ability to predict the main intermediate processes outcomes that take place at any given time in the system e g dry matter accumulation prior to final yield of these models the crop environment resource synthesis ceres maize model part of the decision support systems for agrotechnology transfer dssat has been developed over the past three decades to simulate crop responses to management factors as they interact with climate and soil properties jones et al 2003 dejonge et al 2012 such simulations help develop cropping and management strategies for maize production across a wide range of environments nouna et al 2000 xie et al 2001 mastrorilli et al 2003 liu et al 2012 adnan et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 to improve the model research has focused on improving the mechanistic representation of transpiration soil water photosynthesis c allocation canopy temperature and water productivity under non stress and water limited conditions sau et al 2004 dejonge et al 2012 lizaso et al 2017 yakoub et al 2017 as a result the model performs acceptably well in predicting grain yield and soil water balance in cereal crops such as maize and wheat responding to various irrigation scheduling practices in different environments fang et al 2010 attia et al 2016 kisekka et al 2016 kothari et al 2019 gaps remain in knowledge on how yield and water productivity of maize respond to various irrigation scheduling practices in the arid sandy soils of the present study in the present research we evaluated and applied the dssat ceres maize model using a long term historical weather dataset to simulate maize yield and wue in arid sandy soils the objectives of this study were i to calibrate and evaluate the ceres maize model using datasets from irrigation scheduling experiments on drip irrigated maize production in the study region and ii to apply the calibrated model to determine the impacts of various deficit irrigation scheduling strategies on maize yield and water productivity in arid sandy soils and generate irrigation scheduling recommendations that maximize the marginal benefit per unit water applied to our knowledge this the first attempt in this region to use long term weather data to determine alternative deficit irrigation scheduling strategies that maximize the marginal benefits per unit of water applied without significant yield loss 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of ceres maize module the cropping system dssat ceres maize module part of dssat version 4 7 5 hoogenboom et al 2019 simulates the development of roots and shoots growth and senescence of leaves and stems biomass accumulation and growth and yield of maize as a function of soil weather and management practices jones et al 2003 the model utilizes mathematical equations to describe the basic flow and conversion processes of soil carbon water and nutrient balances on a daily basis and predicts the temporal changes in nutrient uptake water use and crop growth and yield biomass accumulation is simulated as a result of the product of crop specific radiation use efficiency and photosynthetically active radiation computed on a daily basis and partitioned between above and below ground biomass the computation takes into account the supply and demands of soil water carbon and nutrients with a priority of c allocation for the above ground biomass soil water content swc is modeled on a daily basis in several layers and is based on a soil water balance approach that considers of precipitation irrigation soil evaporation transpiration and runoff and drainage from the profile ritchie et al 2009 the et is simulated based on two options i priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 or ii fao 56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 the default priestley taylor method requires less weather variables of solar radiation and minimum and maximum temperature whereas wind speed and humidity data are required for the reference et estimation in the fao 56 penman monteith method the crop coefficient kc over the season is determined as a function of leaf area index lai and potential et is partitioned to potential transpiration and potential evaporation details on et simulation in the model can be found in dejonge et al 2012 2 2 model input data 2 2 1 crop management data data from four field experiments investigating surface drip irrigated maize planted on sandy soils entisol in ismailia egypt were used for the model calibration and evaluation table 1 objectives were to investigate maize yield and wue in response to various levels of irrigation measured data included soil physical and hydrological properties and crop development growth and final yield in two experiments the seasonal crop et and swc at 0 90 cm soil depth were also recorded the 1st experiment was conducted in 2005 and 2006 growing seasons and compared 3 et based irrigation levels each year namely 100 et 80 et and 60 et replacements corresponding to total water amounts of 595 476 and 357 mm respectively el hendawy et al 2008 the 2nd field experiment was carried out in 2005 and 2006 growing seasons and compared the following 4 irrigation frequency treatments once in 2 3 4 and 5 days referred to as f2 to f5 respectively assigned as the main plots in a randomized complete block split split plot design the total amount of water applied for each irrigation treatment was 524 mm and a blank application was included at planting to ensure full germination hokam et al 2011 the 3rd field experiment was carried out in 2007 and 2008 growing seasons and compared 12 irrigation treatments during each season treatments consisted of three et replacement levels of 100 et 80 et and 60 et nested within four irrigation frequency treatments el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 the 4th experiment was conducted in 2011 and 2012 growing seasons and compared the following et based irrigation levels each year 100 et 80 et and 60 et replacements corresponding to total water amounts of 625 500 375 mm respectively el hendawy et al 2014 these experiments compared a total of 44 treatments that all reported the final grain yield as well as other soil and or plant measurements table 1 the planted varieties are medium maturity varieties namely triple cross 310 sc310 in the 1st experiment and single cross 10 sc10 in the 2nd 3rd and 4th experiments other agronomic management data used as input for each experimental file of the model are described in table 1 2 2 2 weather and soil data climate data from 1984 to 2018 including minimum and maximum temperature c precipitation mm solar radiation mjm 2 d 1 and wind speed ms 1 were obtained from nearby i e within 10 km at ismailia egypt weather stations maintained by the egyptian meteorological authority ema all records were complete except for some missing solar radiation values that were obtained from nasa s prediction of worldwide energy resources a repository of global meteorological datasets https power larc nasa gov average minimum and maximum temperatures during the summer season from may to september were 20 c and 35 c respectively table 2 precipitation occurs during winter from november to april with an average of 80 mm over the period from 1984 to 2018 summer precipitation is negligible the soil is sandy throughout the profile sandy mixed hyperthermic typic torripsamments with approximately 90 sand content and 0 3 0 6 soc and classified as an entisol some of the soil input parameters were from measured data at each experimental site while others were generated using the sbuild tool of dssat measurements included soil physical properties of clay and sand percentages soc gkg 1 and bulk density gcm 3 the swc at the permanent wilting point and at field capacity were also measured at each site and were used to set up the soil water lower and upper limits respectively in the soil profile for each site table 3 the remaining input parameters such as root growth factor and soil water at saturation were generated using the sbuild tool of the model according to the measured soil hydrological parameters at each experiment the soil water holding capacity ranged from 55 mm m 1 soil in the 4th experiment to 60 68 mm m 1 soil in the 1st and 2nd experiments table 3 2 3 calibration and evaluation of the ceres maize module the ceres maize module of dssat csm was calibrated against the measured data from the high irrigation treatments in all experiments and was evaluated against data from the medium and low irrigation treatments in all experiments as it is recommended to calibrate the model under non stress conditions boote 1999 the high irrigation treatments in each experiment produced the highest yields compared to others the cultivar specific parameters were calibrated sequentially starting with phenological development parameters controlling anthesis and physiological maturity dates the radiation use efficiency rue value in ecotype specific parameters was adjusted to 3 7 g dry matter mj 1 par based on model calibration to fit dry matter recorded at 60 and 75 dap at the high irrigation level in the 2nd experiment crop yield parameters were obtained by fitting the model to observed grain yield at high irrigation levels initial values of cultivar parameters for calibrating a new cultivar were determined based on the dssat default medium maturity variety 990002 with the default ecotype ib0001 to estimate parameters based on the observed data the generalized likelihood uncertainty analysis glue sub module in dssat was used to estimate cultivar specific parameters the glue uses a bayesian method based on monte carlo sampling techniques applied to prior distributions of a parameter value and a gaussian likelihood function in parameters estimation depending on the observed data he et al 2010 the measured grain yield was reported at 15 5 grain moisture content thus grain yield value was reduced by 15 5 because the model simulates dry weight in addition to crop phenology growth and yield the model was evaluated for its ability to simulate the maximum lai measured in the 2nd experiment et measured in the 3rd experiment and swc measured in the 1st experiment the lai was determined destructively at v10 anthesis and physiological maturity hokam et al 2011 since the maximum lai in dssat ceres maize module is simulated at silking simulated max lai was compared with measured max lai at anthesis the et was estimated based on the soil water balance approach for 24 treatments in two growing seasons in the 3rd experiment see section 2 3 el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 and the simulated swc was compared to swc measured before and after each irrigation event 20 in total starting 23 dap at 0 90 cm soil depth in the 1st experiment el hendawy et al 2008 the swc was estimated by the gravimetric method oven dry basis and the values were multiplied by the bulk density of the respective soil layer therefore converted to a percentage volumetric basis model performance was evaluated using three indices the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse and mean percentage error mpe utilizing modeval function in the r package sirad bojanowski 2016 normalized rmse values 10 indicates an excellent prediction 10 and 20 indicates a good prediction 20 but 30 indicates a fair prediction and 30 denotes a poor prediction bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 the mpe value indicates the model s tendency to over positive or under negative estimate the observed data 2 4 irrigation scheduling strategies three irrigation scheduling strategies were implemented using long term historical weather data from 1984 to 2018 35 independent growing seasons in the study region and the soil profile of the 4th experiment with an average soil water holding capacity of 55 mm m 1 and soc of 0 59 in the 0 30 cm soil layer the initial swc at planting was set near saturation other agronomic management practices similar to those practiced in the 4th experiment were implemented table 1 the first irrigation scheduling strategy was based on the maximum allowable depletion mad of the available swc awc threshold for triggering irrigation using automatic when required auto irrigation based on swc option in dssat the second strategy was based on cumulative crop et threshold eth to trigger irrigation using auto irrigation based on et option in dssat the third strategy was based on replacing daily crop et requirements every 3 days with different targets during the vegetative and reproductive stages of the crop the first second and third irrigation scheduling strategies will be referred to as soil water based irrigation scheduling et based threshold irrigation scheduling and growth stage et based irrigation scheduling respectively simulated grain yield adjusted for 15 5 moisture content biomass yield wue for grain and biomass yield estimated as dry matter production per unit of et et and amount irrigation water were analyzed details of each strategy are explained in the following sections 2 4 1 soil water based irrigation scheduling in this irrigation scheduling four levels of mad 70 50 30 and 10 in the top 0 30 cm soil layer were applied to trigger irrigation to refill the soil water up to field capacity for instance an mad of 70 means that irrigation is triggered to replenish the reservoir up to field capacity in the top 30 cm soil layer whenever the awc in this layer falls below 30 to trigger this auto irrigation option in the model code a automatic when required was specified which determines the timing and amounts of irrigation water based on the available awc in the 0 30 cm soil layer default auto irrigation depth in the model other researchers have recommended the 0 45 cm soil layer to be considered for scheduling irrigation based on awc in sandy loam soil in sub tropical regions panda et al 2004 and therefore we accepted the default auto irrigation management depth of 30 cm for this irrigation scheduling the management depth was set at 30 cm and the threshold of maximum available awc ithrl was varied from 30 to 90 i e mad 70 to 10 while keeping the end point of maximum available awc ithru constant at 100 the model was run for 35 independent years from 1984 to 2018 with four mad treatments each year resulting in 140 simulations in total comparisons among treatments means were made using fisher s least significant difference lsd test following the anova test for a completely randomized design replicated by years as a random source of error using r software 2 4 2 et based threshold irrigation scheduling in this irrigation scheduling the auto irrigation based on et option code e in the file x was specified which triggers irrigation when cumulative amount of et minus any rainfall event net eto reaches a specified value imdep and determines the amount of water applied as a percentage of et ithru the calculated water amount is then passed to the water balance and the cumulative net et is then reset to zero with logging of amounts and timing of irrigation similar to automatic irrigation based on swc code a the et based threshold irrigation scheduling was run for four cumulative net et threshold triggers eth of 14 21 28 and 35 mm and five et replacement levels of 50 70 90 110 and 130 et resulting in 20 irrigation treatments combinations each year and thus 700 simulations in total regression analyses between grain yield or wue and et replacement i e et 50 70 etc or irrigation water amounts at each irrigation trigger level i e eth 14 mm 21 mm etc was performed using r software 2 4 3 growth stage et based irrigation scheduling in this irrigation scheduling different water deficit scenarios based on replacing various percentages of et during the vegetative and reproductive growth stages of maize were tested two levels of irrigation high and low were applied with different combinations of targets during the vegetative and reproductive growth stages the high irrigation level was applied to replace 100 of the crop s et requirements and the low level was applied to replace 60 of the crop s et requirements the daily crop et requirements were calculated based on the crop coefficient approach etc k c eto where k c is the site specific crop coefficient and eto is the grass reference et mmd 1 estimated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 using historical weather data 1984 2018 of the study region the grass reference et was calculated using historical weather data of minimum and maximum temperatures solar radiation wind speed and dew point temperature daily records of dew point temperature required for the actual vapor pressure estimation was obtained from nasa s prediction of worldwide energy resources https power larc nasa gov site specific maize crop coefficient values of 0 20 in the initial 1 20 in the mid and 0 35 in the late season were used as recommended for maize in the study region fig s1 el hendawy et al 2014 details of the grass reference et estimation are described in the supplementary material uniform applications of 120 mm were applied to all treatments during the first 2 weeks after planting and then irrigation scheduling was started 17 dap to replace the cumulative daily et amounts of the previous 3 days i e frequency of once every 3 days as 17 20 23 104 dap to be terminated at 104 dap for a total number of 32 applications during the growing season the daily crop et is considered as net et in this study due to the absence of precipitation during the summer season within each irrigation level irrigation targets defined as 40 60 80 and 100 were applied separately during the vegetative from 17 to 58 dap and reproductive from 59 to 104 dap stages each year of the long term simulations combinations of these percentages resulted in 16 irrigation treatments e g 40 v 80 r defines a percentage of 40 of the irrigation level during the vegetative stage and 80 of the irrigation level during the reproductive stage each year for two irrigation levels therefore there were 16 combinations of percentages applied for two irrigation levels across 35 years resulting in 1120 simulations average and standard deviation of irrigation water applied during the vegetative and reproductive stages at the high level of 100 et and the low level of 60 et are shown in table s1 scripting in r software was utilized to facilitate editing the file x and run the model for 16 irrigation treatments each year of the long term simulations treatments means were compared using the fisher s protected least significant difference lsd at the p 0 05 probability level following the anova test for a completely randomized design replicated by years as a random source of error using r software 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and evaluation the calibrated values for the genotype specific parameters in the dssat csm ceres maize model that produced the best fit to the observed data under non stress conditions the crop phenology variables of anthesis and physiological maturity dates agreed well with predicted data as indicated by nrmse and mpe values of 10 table 4 the value for p1 thermal time from seedling appearance to the end of the juvenile phase was 320 c day corresponding to a medium to late flowering maize hybrid the values for p2 day length sensitivity coefficient that is the delay in days for each hour increase in photoperiod above the longest photoperiod at which development proceed at maximum rate 12 5 h was set to 0 8 day per hour and the value for p5 thermal time from flowering to physiological maturity was calibrated to 868 c day corresponding to a medium maturity duration hybrid these values are closely similar to those reported for medium maturity maize hybrid in another semi arid environment hammad et al 2018 simulated grain yield in comparison with the observed data in the model calibration and evaluation is shown in fig 1 the simulated grain yield matches well the observed grain yield which was demonstrated by an nrmse of 11 7 and an mpe of 3 1 the model also simulated the amount of dry matter at 60 and 75 dap reasonably well with nrmse and mpe values of 30 and 12 respectively table 4 the values for g2 maximum number of kernel per plant was calibrated to 794 and g3 kernel filling rate was calibrated to 8 5 mg day 1 the values of g2 and g3 indicate that sc10 is a medium to high yielding hybrid for arid environments the calibrated phint phyllochron interval was 51 c day which is closely within the range reported by bao et al 2017 of 48 9 53 9 for some maize hybrids and our cultivar coefficients are within the range of their reported coefficients for these hybrids calibration of crop phenology parameters resulted in the best match with observed data in the model calibration but slight overestimates occurred in the model evaluation average observed anthesis date in the model evaluation was 2 d less than during calibration while model prediction of this variable remained constant resulting in increased mpe from 5 2 to 8 8 table 4 similarly the mpe for maturity date was transformed from slight underestimation during calibration to slight overestimation during evaluation but the rmse remained the same 5 d this indicates lack of model response to soil water stress in simulating maize phenology nonetheless the observed and simulated crop phenological data indicate acceptable model performance other crop variables used in the model evaluation are maximum lai and dry matter at 60 and 75 dap the model reasonably well simulated maximum lai recorded in the 2nd experiment as indicated by nrmse 20 table 4 for dry matter the model fairly simulated this variable with rmse of 1 3mgha 1 and nrmse of 30 but mpe showed over prediction by 30 under water stress treatments observed grain yield in the model evaluation ranged from 1225 to 6435 kg ha 1 in response to 34 deficit irrigation treatments applied in eight site yr field experiments fig 1 the model simulation of grain yield in the model evaluation showed a good response to water deficit treatments with the calibrated genotype cultivar parameters and the soil input data for each experiment table 3 this was further demonstrated by nrmse 20 and mpe of 1 16 showing that prediction had a good agreement with the observed data table 4 modeled grain yield indicated high performance in capturing differences in response to water stress across sites table 4 the rmse and nrmse were 0 69mgha 1 and 20 respectively during calibration and evaluation while mpe showed slight underestimation during calibration and very slight overestimation during evaluation nonetheless the model simulation of grain yield indicated good stability in response to water stress treatments across different cropping seasons in different sites fig 2 shows the comparison between observed and simulated et and swc in the model evaluation the comparison between observed and simulated et is shown in fig 2 which showed a better model performance predicting et under non water stress conditions than water stress conditions the mpe was 4 0 and the nrmse was 10 under non water stress conditions whereas when considering water stress conditions the mpe has increased to 7 0 and the nrmse was 15 table 4 as for swc simulation results indicated well prediction of this soil water variable with nrmse of 12 5 under non water stress condition i1 table 4 while there was slight under estimation under water stress conditions i2 table 4 nonetheless the overall swc simulation indicate acceptable model performance with rmse of only 10 mm 90 cm 1 these results suggest better model prediction of et and swc under non stress than stress conditions previous research has reported the complexity of precisely predicting yield and et under stress conditions evett and tolk 2009 dejonge et al 2011 in the present study the model tended to slightly underestimate et values in water stress scenarios fig 2 other researchers reported that permanent wilting point played a significant role in ceres wheat simulation of soil moisture content in 0 100 cm which has been improved by manually tuning this parameter yao et al 2020 3 2 irrigation scheduling strategies 3 2 1 soil water based irrigation scheduling as expected keeping the awc at 90 by mad 10 treatment produced the highest grain yield of 6 87mgha 1 averaged over the 35 growing seasons which was 46 higher than mad 70 with mad 50 and 30 in between table 5 the biomass yield followed similar trend with mad 10 producing significantly 32 higher biomass yield than mad 70 on the other hand mad 70 had the highest wue for both grain and biomass yields with 37 less irrigation water enhanced wue was also achieved by mad 50 compared with mad 10 and as for grain and biomass yields mad 50 had an intermediate yield level in between mad 10 and 70 table 5 in addition the total number of irrigation events was much less for mad 50 compared with mad 10 suggesting a lower production cost other researchers have found that a mad level of 45 resulted in the highest wue for maize in sandy loam soils compared to lower and higher mad levels panda et al 2004 our results suggest possible water saving and improved wue for grain and biomass yields while producing acceptable yield level by the deficit irrigation rate of mad 50 in the top 0 30 cm soil layer agreeing with previous research findings on maize irrigation scheduling in another arid environment gheysari et al 2017 this is of great importance in light of water shortage in arid regions of the present research in middle east and north africa where increasing wue is more important than maximizing yield potential 3 2 2 et based threshold irrigation scheduling the et based threshold irrigation scheduling consisted of four eth triggers for triggering irrigation and five et replacement levels resulting in 20 treatments each year of the long term simulations across the 35 years the relationship between grain yield and et replacement levels at different eth triggers is illustrated in fig 3a across eth triggers the 50 et replacement had the lowest yield of 1 6mgha 1 whereas the 110 et had the highest yield of 4 6mgha 1 fig 3a by looking at the grain yield response to different eth triggers across all et replacement levels we can see that there were three different yield categories i high by eth 14 and 21 mm ii medium by eth 28 mm threshold and iii low by eth 35 threshold these results indicate that plants had experienced high level of water stress for the 50 et replacement or when irrigation was triggered at eth 35 mm as indicated by drought stress index not shown as high as 0 55 during the crop development and reproductive stages the interaction between eth levels and et replacement levels indicated that the highest grain yield of 6 4mgha 1 was produced at 112 et for the eth 14 mm fig 3a however the wue for grain yield showed that replacing 105 of et and triggering irrigation at eth 21 mm produced the highest wue of 10 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig 3b and the grain yield at this level was only 8 less than the highest yield of 6 4mgha 1 in general a higher wue was observed at the eth 21 mm compared to other eth triggers regardless the et replacement levels therefore it can be indicated that based on grain yield and wue results triggering irrigation at 21 mm threshold and replacing 100 of et is a plausible option for irrigation scheduling in arid sandy soils for both improved wue and acceptable yield potential on the other hand unacceptable yield reduction was reported for eth 35 mm regardless of the et replacement level and therefore should be avoided in arid regions where maize is mainly dependent on irrigation water to grow our results agree with previous research findings on maize irrigation scheduling in arid sandy soils as it is more favorable to irrigate in high frequency even with less amounts of water than applying more water in low frequency el hendawy et al 2008 this might be attributed to the low soil water holding capacity and high summer temperatures which commonly exceed 37 c during peak growth stages table 2 responses of grain yield and wue to irrigation water are reported in fig 4 irrigation water of 790 mm produced the highest grain yield of 6 33mgha 1 when irrigation was triggered at eth 14 mm nevertheless if this amount of irrigation water is unavailable 575 mm of irrigation water corresponding to 90 et with eth of 21 mm produced an acceptable yield level of 5 21mgha 1 fig 4a in addition amounts of 575 mm of irrigation water produced higher wue of 9 65 kg ha 1 mm 1 when irrigation was triggered at eth 21 mm compared with other eth triggers fig 4b considering the average estimated daily etc of maize in the study region during peak growth stages of 7 5 mmd 1 fig s2 eth 21 mm means that irrigation in absence of rainfall should be approximately scheduled every 3 days to avoid severe water stress during this critical growth stage and consequently high yield reduction these results are in agreement with previous research findings of greater wue of maize grain yield in sandy soils of about 12 kg ha 1 mm 1 when replacing 100 et every 3 days el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 therefore it can be concluded that if water is available irrigating at eth 21 mm and replacing 105 of et is the recommended rate for potential yield and greater wue within eth scheduling strategy otherwise deficit rate of 90 et replacement at eth 21 mm can be imposed for potential water saving with acceptable yield level and high wue 3 2 3 growth stage et based irrigation scheduling at the high irrigation level of 100 et significantly greater yield was produced by high rates of 80 v 100 r and 100 v 100 r followed by deficit rates of 100 v 80 r 80 v 80 r and 60 v 100 r table 6 among the other deficit rates significantly greater yield was produced by treatments with higher targets during the reproductive stage than treatments with higher targets during the vegetative stage for instance treatment 40 v 60 r produced a greater yield than 60 v 40 r and treatment 40 v 80 r produced a greater yield than 80 v 40 r table 6 wue for grain yield showed additional advantage for deficit rates with higher targets during the reproductive stage which could be clearly attributed to their significantly higher yields using less amounts of water the biomass yield followed similar trend in general to grain yield but with significantly less yield for deficit rates applying lower target during the vegetative stage compared with full irrigation table 6 interestingly the highest wue for biomass yield was produced by the deficit rate of 80 v 80 r followed by 80 v 100 r suggesting that deficit targets during the vegetative stage are more advantageous compared to full irrigation deficit rate during the vegetative stage might have induced plants ability to explore large amounts of soil water in deep layers and therefore getting additional benefits of full irrigation during the reproductive stages pandey et al 2000 stated that maize plants might extend rooting depth in the soil searching for greater volume of water extraction as an adaptive strategy to cope with vegetative water stress results of seasonal maize et showed significant differences among treatments with higher simulated et of 570 and 545 mm by full irrigation and 100 v 80 r respectively table 6 by looking at irrigation water applied by these treatments we can see that approximately 40 mm could be saved by deficit rate 80 v 100 r without significant yield loss and about 80 mm could be saved by deficit rate 60 v 100 r with only 4 less yield compared with 100 v 100 r table 6 our results corroborate the findings of comas et al 2019 who evaluated twelve varying levels of deficit irrigation during late vegetative and grain filling growth stages of maize in another semi arid environment and reported that deficit irrigation during late vegetative stage e g 40 et produced similar yield to that produced by full irrigation while saving approximately 15 17 of the seasonal crop et requirements these results indicate enhanced efficacy of irrigation scheduling by these deficit irrigation rates which has resulted in increased wue results of the 16 irrigation treatments at the low irrigation level of 60 et followed similar trend to the high irrigation level of 100 et with even more pronounced advantage for higher target during reproductive stage table 6 this was demonstrated by the non significantly different grain yield by deficit rates of 40 60 80 v 100 r than 100 v 100 r and consequently greater wue for grain yield by 40 v 100 r for biomass yield significantly greater yield was produced by 100 v 100 r followed by 80 v 100 r with mostly similar wue to other deficit rates except the significantly greater wue by 40 v 80 r table 6 corresponding amounts of irrigation water showed about 70 mm water saving by the deficit rate of 40 v 100 r and at the same time produced similar grain yield to 100 v 100 r results of the 16 irrigation scheduling treatments at both the high and low levels indicated significant advantage by avoiding severe water stress during reproductive stage which was more pronounced at the low irrigation level across irrigation levels the drought stress index indicated greater stress by plants that received less water during reproductive stage even with the highest target during the vegetative stage e g 100 v 40 r had drought index of 0 37 vs 0 26 by 40 v 100 r not shown which indicates that under limited irrigation water availability deficit rate could be imposed during the vegetative stage rather than reproductive stage in general grain yield and wue responses to the high and low irrigation levels suggest maintaining irrigation targets 60 et during reproductive stage for avoiding high yield loss and enhanced wue in water limited environments in other words imposing deficit rates during the vegetative stage seems to be a plausible alternative option in water limited environments for enhancing wue and saving irrigation water that can be allocated later during the reproductive stage 3 2 4 comparison among irrigation scheduling strategies selected treatments from the previously discussed irrigation scheduling strategies are compared under two levels of irrigation water i high 550 mm and ii low 450 mm using two dimensional kernel density estimation kernel estimation of probability produces a smooth empirical probability density function based on individual locations of all sample data high kernel density indicates high intensity or clustering of destinations moderate kernel density may indicate dispersed destinations while low kernel density indicates negligible highly dispersed destination we are interested in observing the frequencies of high grain yield and wue simultaneously under irrigation water 550 mm there was one distinct peak of density for all compared treatments with different grain yield and wue values fig 5 the highest density profiles occurred at density estimates of 0 15 and had grain yield of 6 74 and 6 50mgha 1 and wue of 9 61 and 10 40 kg ha 1 mm 1 for mad 30 and eth 14 mm treatments respectively fig 5a and b the highest density profiles occurred at density estimates of 0 1 and indicated lower grain yield about 5 69mgha 1 but similar level of wue of 10 10 kg ha 1 mm 1 for eth 21 mm treatment fig 5c in 80 100 et treatment the highest density profiles occurred at density estimates of 0 08 and had grain yield of 8 05mgha 1 and wue of 12 27 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig 5d this shows that the data were clustered over a narrower range of density in the 80 100 et treatment with higher yield and wue than other treatments these results indicate that the growth stage et based irrigation scheduling strategy is more efficient than other scheduling strategies when the available water for irrigation was 550 mm reports on comparing different irrigation management strategies for maize in arid environment are scarce in the literature an exception to our knowledge was the study of gheysari et al 2017 in another arid environment who compared the effect of fixed intervals variable depth with variable intervals fixed depth based on various eth triggers on silage maize root and aboveground biomass characteristics and irrigation wue and reported greater total biomass root development and irrigation wue of maize by fixed intervals variable depth strategy they attributed these results to the negative impacts associated with high water stress as a result of omission of key irrigation events during the crop development and mid season by the variable intervals strategy present results suggest that irrigating at fixed intervals with imposed deficit rate during the vegetative stage of 80 of crop et requirements or at mad 30 utilized the available water for irrigation more efficiently than irrigating at eth 21 mm at the low water level of 450 mm treatments mad 70 and 60 60 et showed one peak with closely similar yield of 4 50mgha 1 and wue of 9 05 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig 6a and d for eth treatments there were two distinct peaks with lower yield level of 3 0mgha 1 fig 6b and c at this low water level the et replacement level was 70 for the eth treatments which may have contributed to yield and wue variations across years and therefore different clusters of data these results indicate that scheduling irrigation to maintain the awc in the top 0 30 cm soil layer at 30 could be considered as an efficient management strategy that optimizes yield and wue in water limited environments that said it is important to note that consistent uniformity of applied water e g drip irrigation system is essential to reproduce the relative differences reported here among these management strategies in another arid environment 4 conclusions results of the present research demonstrated the potential of the dssat model for testing large number of agronomic treatments across long term temporal scale the model reasonably well simulated grain yield crop et and soil moisture content in response to different irrigation treatments across 8 years site field experiments results of the long term model application indicated that scheduling irrigation at fixed intervals is more efficient than et based variable intervals for greater yield and wue of maize in the arid environment of the study region it was also observed that imposing deficit rate of 80 et during vegetative stage could be implemented in arid environments for greater wue without significant yield reduction results also indicated that the generally accepted level of 50 awc in crop production was also an effective irrigation scheduling option for maize production in arid sandy soils concepts developed in this study is applicable for efficient irrigation scheduling of medium maturity maize hybrids in other arid regions characterized with low fertility and water holding capacity 55 mm m 1 soils credit authorship contribution statement ahmed attia conceptualization methodology software investigation

10156,atmospheric co2 elevation e co2 could alleviate the impact of soil water deficit yet the underlying mechanisms remains largely elusive this study aimed to investigate whether different endogenous abscisic acid aba level modulates the response of barley and tomato plants to soil water deficit combined with e co2 wild type wt genotypes steptoe barley and ac tomato and their corresponding aba deficient mutants az34 barley and ac flacca were grown in pots separately in greenhouse cells with ambient a co2 400 ppm and e co2 800 ppm and were either well watered or exposed to soil water deficit the results showed that compared to well watered regime soil water deficit decreased aboveground dry matter adm leaf area la and specific leaf area sla while enhanced water use efficiency wue in all genotypes e co2 increased adm and la in tomato genotypes moreover it reduced sla leaf n concentration while improved wue and nitrogen use efficiency nue in wt plants not in aba deficient mutants these results indicate that endogenous aba level played an important role in modulating the response of wue and nue of barley and tomato to e co2 environment which advances our knowledge on the physiological mechanisms of crop plants adapt to future climate changed scenarios keywords aba co2 water deficit water and nitrogen use barley tomato 1 introduction atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration co2 has risen at an accelerating pace in the past 100 years and is predicted to reach 550 ppm by 2050s and 800 ppm at the end of this century intergovernmental panel on climate change 2013 moreover decreased summer precipitation and increased temperature induced by global warming will cause severe seasonal drought in many agricultural areas wei et al 2018 therefore it is essential to understand the water and nitrogen use responses of different genotypes to soil water deficit at elevated co2 e co2 for sustainable crop production in the future climates earlier evidence has indicated that plants grown at e co2 possessed higher leaf photosynthesis rate lower stomatal conductance and transpiration rate and enhanced water use efficiency wue at leaf scale li et al 2017 wei et al 2018 accordingly at e co2 plant dry matter was increased and specific leaf area was generally decreased jones et al 1985 bunce 2004 while the total plant water consumption was probably not declined due to the increased leaf transpiring area when scaling up to canopy level fleisher et al 2008 nevertheless greater wue at plant scale has frequently been observed in crops grown at e co2 pazzagli et al 2016 moreover the magnitude of carbon c accumulation and nitrogen n uptake response to co2 elevation is tissue specific and highly dependent on plant n status and the greatest increases were obtained under a range of intermediate n availability gifford et al 2000 e co2 has often been reported to reduce the concentrations of minerals in wheat grains particularly n resulting in the problem of hidden hunger loladze 2002 2014 this reduction could mainly be caused by the dilution resulted from increased carbohydrate assimilation mcgrath and lobell 2013 and limitation of nutrients uptake from roots due to the lower mass flow rate under e co2 houshmandfar et al 2015 li et al 2016 whilst the plant n content may be not decrease as a result of increased biomass thereby nitrogen use efficiency nue was generally improved in e co2 plant related to greater c content and or lower n concentration reddy et al 2010 during soil water deficit the root to shoot hormonal signaling mainly xylem sap abscisic acid aba concentration was accumulated in the drying roots and transported to the leaf triggering partial stomatal closure and declining transpiration rate liu et al 2003 wilkinson and davies 2002 yan et al 2017 hence plant water status was maintained and wue was enhanced from leaf to plant scale under moderate soil water deficit liu et al 2005 furthermore unchanged c content and increased n content could be achieved in plants grown under mild soil drying condition in relation to fully irrigated plants resulting in decreased plant nue under moderate soil drought liu et al 2019 it is well known that e co2 could mitigate the negative effect of soil water deficit on plant growth yan et al 2017 on the other hand endogenous aba level played an important role in stomatal modulation under soil drying combined with e co2 engineer et al 2016 li et al 2020 the sensitivity of stomata response to e co2 was inverse for barley monocot and tomato dicot plants which had difference in stomatal morphology wei et al 2020 it has been reported that aba was involved in regulation of n signaling and plant n uptake kiba et al 2011 moreover the higher stomatal conductance hence transpiration rate in aba deficit mutant might lead to sustained mass flow under e co2 resulting in unchanged n concentration wue and nue in relation to wild type plants however to date there was no information about how endogenous aba level affects plant n nutrition wue and nue in response to soil drying under e co2 environment therefore the objective in this study was to investigate the modulation of endogenous aba level on water and nitrogen use efficiency in barley and tomato plants response to soil water deficit and e co2 potted plants were grown in climate controlled greenhouse cells with two atmospheric co2 concentrations 400 and 800 ppm respectively and were subjected to progressive soil water deficit water use leaf area aboveground dry matter c and n concentration of plant tissues were determined it was hypothesized that 1 e co2 would modulate the response of water and nitrogen use efficiency differently in barley monocot and tomato dicot plants and 2 endogenous aba level could be involved in mediating plant nitrogen and water use in response to e co2 environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and treatments the experiment was conducted in a climate controlled greenhouse at the experimental farm of the faculty of science university of copenhagen taastrup denmark 55 67 n 12 30 e the experimental setup and treatments have been detailed elsewhere wei et al 2020 and only a brief summary was given here barley hordeum vulgare and tomato solanum lycopersicum l plants were tested wild type wt genotypes steptoe barley and ac tomato and aba deficient mutants az34 barley and ac flacca the aba deficient mutants would produce notably lower aba concentration as compared with wt genotypes martin vertedor and dodd 2011 half of plants were grown in a greenhouse cell with ambient co2 concentration of 400 ppm a co2 and another half were grown in a cell with elevated co2 concentration of 800 ppm e co2 both barley and tomato plants were sowed and watered to 90 of pot holding capacity a pot weight of around 4 5 kg in 4 l pots five weeks later in each cell and genotype two irrigation treatments were set four barley and four tomato plants were well watered daily as ww plants others were subjected to progressive soil drying namely soil water deficit wd by withholding irrigation until leaf stomatal conductance g s decreased to around 10 of the ww plants at which the pot weight of the wd plant had decreased to about 2 5 kg during progressive soil drying soil water status was determined daily by weighing the pot with an analytical balance sartorius model qa35ede s the wd plants were harvested five times during the treatment period at different soil water status this was expressed as the fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw described in wei et al 2020 namely the pot weights at which the leaf g s of the wd plant was about 100 75 50 25 and 10 of that for the ww plant here the final harvest for each genotype four ww and wd plants were collected for further analysis 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 dry matter leaf area and water use efficiency at the first and the final harvests all leaf samples of barley leaf and stem samples of tomato plants were collected separately and dried in an oven at 70 c to constant weight for determining the dry matter aboveground dry matter adm was calculated as the leaf dry matter for barley the sum of stem and leaf dry matter for tomato plant during the first and the final harvests at final harvest the total leaf area of plant was measured with a leaf area meter li cor 3100 li cor

leaf area was affected only by g table 1 where wt tomato had greater leaf area than ac flacca at the final harvest for barley plants adm was significantly affected by co2 g and i fig 1a and b table 2

co2 and wt tomato was higher than that of a co2 and ac flacca respectively 4 discussion at the first harvest the aboveground dry matter and leaf area of aba deficient mutants were lower than that of the wild type wt in barley and tomato plants respectively table 1 this was mainly related to the mutant habitus as a result of reduced leaf development and biomass accumulation while at the final harvest the growth of both genotypes was largely increased especially for tomato plants and this could present the varied response to the different treatment factors and their combinations earlier studies have indicated that e co2 could promote the plant biomass due to the improved photosynthesis assimilation aranjuelo et al 2013 and the increment of c3 plant was around 40 reddy et al 2010 consistent with this as illustrated in fig 1 tables 1 and 2 the final harvested aboveground dry matter in both barley and tomato plants grown under e co2 environment were significantly enhanced the e co2 plant has been reported to increase leaf area resulted from the greater dry biomass bunce 2004 however in the present study fig 2 tables 2 and 3 a larger leaf area was only observed in tomato not in barley such phenomenon was probably induced by the photosynthesis acclimation of barley plant during e co2 condition leading to offset the positive growth effect at e co2 ainsworth and rogers 2007 besides no significant difference in leaf area was found in both aba deficient mutants between the two co2 treatments irrespective of wt plant or aba deficient mutant the leaf area of soil water deficit wd plants was smaller as compared with the well watered ww plants in all genotypes specific leaf area sla represents the thickness of plant leaves previous evidence has suggested that sla was decreased in plant grown at e co2 namely the leaf would be thicker and this was attributed to the enhancement of photosynthesis and carbon accumulation in the leaves gielen et al 2001 in good agreement with this here the sla of wt plants were lower under e co2 than a co2 resulted mainly from the increased dry mass fig 3a and c tables 2 and 3 however there was no difference in sla of aba deficient mutants between e co2 and a co2 environment fig 3b and d tables 2 and 3 which was corresponding to the above finding in leaf area in addition it was well documented that the sensitivity of soil water deficit on leaf expansion rate was earlier than that on carbon assimilation poorter et al 2009 which could induce a lower sla in drought stressed plant in relation to the well watered plant accordingly sla of all plants was decreased by soil water deficit in line with the earlier finding in amaranth liu and stützel 2004 it was widely believed that water use efficiency wue could be improved in e co2 environment pazzagli et al 2016 wei et al 2018 in accordance with this here the wue of the wt plant was significant greater at e co2 than at a co2 fig 7a and c tables 2 and 3 due to the increased plant dry biomass while this was not observed in the two aba deficient mutants fig 7b and d tables 2 and 3 additionally wue of plant under wd treatment was higher than that under ww treatment which was mainly attributed to the larger decline in water use fig 6 tables 2 and 3 as compared with plant mass liu et al 2005 here in the two aba deficient mutants no difference in plant growth la and sla and wue was found between the two co2 treatments this was due to the greater stomatal conductance and transpiration rate in the aba deficit mutant which could offset the decreased transpiration rate under e co2 leading to similar wue between plants grown under a co2 and e co2 environments while significant difference in these variables was only noticed between the two irrigation treatments all these indicate that at the whole plant level the low endogenous aba level in the mutants would have been involved in modulating the growth and physiological responses to e co2 previous study has suggested that plant c concentration would normally be enhanced in plant grown under e co2 condition due to the increased leaf photosynthetic rate souza et al 2008 at e co2 leaf c concentration of wt tomato was increased in this study while for other genotypes it was not affected fig 4 tables 2 and 3 this may be due to a dilution of c concentration in plant grown under e co2 butterly et al 2015 soil water deficit could also affect plant c concentration jacobsen et al 2009 reported that leaf c concentration was decreased in quinoa under water limited condition however here a reduction in leaf c concentration under soil water deficit was only observed in barley not in tomato furthermore compared to wt plant the leaf c concentration of aba deficient mutant was similar in barley monocot but was lower in tomato dicot fig 4 tables 2 and 3 these imply that the alternation of leaf c concentration in response to soil water deficit might be species dependent the n availability played an important role in influencing plant photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism thilakarathne et al 2015 accumulated evidence indicated that there was a reduction in plant n concentration when grown under e co2 environment which is mostly attributed to the dilution of n by the increased biomass and decreased in transpiration rate as well as depressed n absorption and allocation of root butterly et al 2015 loladze 2014 likewise compared with a co2 here the e co2 leaf had lower n concentration in wt barley and tomato fig 5a and c tables 2 and 3 as plant water use was not decreased under e co2 treatment in this study suggesting that there was no reduction of mass flow for n uptake thus the dilution effect due to enhanced dry biomass at e co2 could mainly be the cause for reduced leaf n concentration different from the wt plants the leaf n concentration of aba deficient mutants was unaffected by co2 growth environment fig 5b and d tables 2 and 3 indicating that endogenous aba level might take part in mediating the leaf n concentration response to e co2 concentration although there was no consensus on the relationship between endogenous aba levels and n status in diverse plants kiba et al 2011 it was accepted that a high aba concentration could restrict nitrate sensing resulting in decreased nitrate uptake léran et al 2015 consistent with this compared to wt plant here the aba deficient mutants showed similar barley or higher tomato in leaf n concentration fig 5 tables 2 and 3 soil water deficit often reduce plant n uptake leading to a low n concentration in leaves jacobsen et al 2009 disagrees with this in the current study leaf n concentration was not decreased in the soil water deficit plants in relation to their well watered counterparts fig 5 tables 2 and 3 this could be due to the fact that the reduction of leaf dry biomass was more pronounced than leaf n accumulation under soil water deficit plant nue was an important criteria for evaluating n requirement for maximizing c assimilation and this was mostly dependent on the n status of the plant fageria and baligar 2005 soil water deficit tends to decrease nue in plants wang et al 2010 while in this study plant nue was not significantly affected by soil water deficit fig 8 tables 2 and 3 moreover here the relative higher c accumulation than n uptake could contribute to enhanced nue by growth at e co2 in wt plants fig 8a and c tables 2 and 3 in consistent with the findings by reddy et al 2010 that e co2 could benefit the n uptake and enhance nue and in turn being conducive to improve photosynthetic rate without increasing transpiration rate leading to an enhanced plant wue nevertheless this was not evident in aba deficient mutants fig 8b and d tables 2 and 3 taken above together all these implies that the endogenous aba level could be involved in regulating plant n utilization response to e co2 5 conclusions compared with well watered treatment soil water deficit decreased adm la and sla while increased wue in all plants e co2 increased adm and la in tomato genotypes in both wt plants e co2 reduced sla leaf n concentration while increased wue and nue whereas in aba deficient mutants there was no difference in sla leaf n concentration wue and nue between the two co2 growth environments implying that the endogenous aba level could be taken part in mediating plant growth and n use response to e co2 these findings provide important knowledge on the mechanism of water and n use in barley and tomato plants response to soil

10156,atmospheric co2 elevation e co2 could alleviate the impact of soil water deficit yet the underlying mechanisms remains largely elusive this study aimed to investigate whether different endogenous abscisic acid aba level modulates the response of barley and tomato plants to soil water deficit combined with e co2 wild type wt genotypes steptoe barley and ac tomato and their corresponding aba deficient mutants az34 barley and ac flacca were grown in pots separately in greenhouse cells with ambient a co2 400 ppm and e co2 800 ppm and were either well watered or exposed to soil water deficit the results showed that compared to well watered regime soil water deficit decreased aboveground dry matter adm leaf area la and specific leaf area sla while enhanced water use efficiency wue in all genotypes e co2 increased adm and la in tomato genotypes moreover it reduced sla leaf n concentration while improved wue and nitrogen use efficiency nue in wt plants not in aba deficient mutants these results indicate that endogenous aba level played an important role in modulating the response of wue and nue of barley and tomato to e co2 environment which advances our knowledge on the physiological mechanisms of crop plants adapt to future climate changed scenarios keywords aba co2 water deficit water and nitrogen use barley tomato 1 introduction atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration co2 has risen at an accelerating pace in the past 100 years and is predicted to reach 550 ppm by 2050s and 800 ppm at the end of this century intergovernmental panel on climate change 2013 moreover decreased summer precipitation and increased temperature induced by global warming will cause severe seasonal drought in many agricultural areas wei et al 2018 therefore it is essential to understand the water and nitrogen use responses of different genotypes to soil water deficit at elevated co2 e co2 for sustainable crop production in the future climates earlier evidence has indicated that plants grown at e co2 possessed higher leaf photosynthesis rate lower stomatal conductance and transpiration rate and enhanced water use efficiency wue at leaf scale li et al 2017 wei et al 2018 accordingly at e co2 plant dry matter was increased and specific leaf area was generally decreased jones et al 1985 bunce 2004 while the total plant water consumption was probably not declined due to the increased leaf transpiring area when scaling up to canopy level fleisher et al 2008 nevertheless greater wue at plant scale has frequently been observed in crops grown at e co2 pazzagli et al 2016 moreover the magnitude of carbon c accumulation and nitrogen n uptake response to co2 elevation is tissue specific and highly dependent on plant n status and the greatest increases were obtained under a range of intermediate n availability gifford et al 2000 e co2 has often been reported to reduce the concentrations of minerals in wheat grains particularly n resulting in the problem of hidden hunger loladze 2002 2014 this reduction could mainly be caused by the dilution resulted from increased carbohydrate assimilation mcgrath and lobell 2013 and limitation of nutrients uptake from roots due to the lower mass flow rate under e co2 houshmandfar et al 2015 li et al 2016 whilst the plant n content may be not decrease as a result of increased biomass thereby nitrogen use efficiency nue was generally improved in e co2 plant related to greater c content and or lower n concentration reddy et al 2010 during soil water deficit the root to shoot hormonal signaling mainly xylem sap abscisic acid aba concentration was accumulated in the drying roots and transported to the leaf triggering partial stomatal closure and declining transpiration rate liu et al 2003 wilkinson and davies 2002 yan et al 2017 hence plant water status was maintained and wue was enhanced from leaf to plant scale under moderate soil water deficit liu et al 2005 furthermore unchanged c content and increased n content could be achieved in plants grown under mild soil drying condition in relation to fully irrigated plants resulting in decreased plant nue under moderate soil drought liu et al 2019 it is well known that e co2 could mitigate the negative effect of soil water deficit on plant growth yan et al 2017 on the other hand endogenous aba level played an important role in stomatal modulation under soil drying combined with e co2 engineer et al 2016 li et al 2020 the sensitivity of stomata response to e co2 was inverse for barley monocot and tomato dicot plants which had difference in stomatal morphology wei et al 2020 it has been reported that aba was involved in regulation of n signaling and plant n uptake kiba et al 2011 moreover the higher stomatal conductance hence transpiration rate in aba deficit mutant might lead to sustained mass flow under e co2 resulting in unchanged n concentration wue and nue in relation to wild type plants however to date there was no information about how endogenous aba level affects plant n nutrition wue and nue in response to soil drying under e co2 environment therefore the objective in this study was to investigate the modulation of endogenous aba level on water and nitrogen use efficiency in barley and tomato plants response to soil water deficit and e co2 potted plants were grown in climate controlled greenhouse cells with two atmospheric co2 concentrations 400 and 800 ppm respectively and were subjected to progressive soil water deficit water use leaf area aboveground dry matter c and n concentration of plant tissues were determined it was hypothesized that 1 e co2 would modulate the response of water and nitrogen use efficiency differently in barley monocot and tomato dicot plants and 2 endogenous aba level could be involved in mediating plant nitrogen and water use in response to e co2 environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and treatments the experiment was conducted in a climate controlled greenhouse at the experimental farm of the faculty of science university of copenhagen taastrup denmark 55 67 n 12 30 e the experimental setup and treatments have been detailed elsewhere wei et al 2020 and only a brief summary was given here barley hordeum vulgare and tomato solanum lycopersicum l plants were tested wild type wt genotypes steptoe barley and ac tomato and aba deficient mutants az34 barley and ac flacca the aba deficient mutants would produce notably lower aba concentration as compared with wt genotypes martin vertedor and dodd 2011 half of plants were grown in a greenhouse cell with ambient co2 concentration of 400 ppm a co2 and another half were grown in a cell with elevated co2 concentration of 800 ppm e co2 both barley and tomato plants were sowed and watered to 90 of pot holding capacity a pot weight of around 4 5 kg in 4 l pots five weeks later in each cell and genotype two irrigation treatments were set four barley and four tomato plants were well watered daily as ww plants others were subjected to progressive soil drying namely soil water deficit wd by withholding irrigation until leaf stomatal conductance g s decreased to around 10 of the ww plants at which the pot weight of the wd plant had decreased to about 2 5 kg during progressive soil drying soil water status was determined daily by weighing the pot with an analytical balance sartorius model qa35ede s the wd plants were harvested five times during the treatment period at different soil water status this was expressed as the fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw described in wei et al 2020 namely the pot weights at which the leaf g s of the wd plant was about 100 75 50 25 and 10 of that for the ww plant here the final harvest for each genotype four ww and wd plants were collected for further analysis 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 dry matter leaf area and water use efficiency at the first and the final harvests all leaf samples of barley leaf and stem samples of tomato plants were collected separately and dried in an oven at 70 c to constant weight for determining the dry matter aboveground dry matter adm was calculated as the leaf dry matter for barley the sum of stem and leaf dry matter for tomato plant during the first and the final harvests at final harvest the total leaf area of plant was measured with a leaf area meter li cor 3100 li cor inc lincoln nb specific leaf area sla was calculated as the ratio of leaf area la to leaf dry matter plant water use during irrigation treatment period was the sum of the amount of irrigation water that plant daily consumed for ww plants and the amount of decreased soil water held in the pot for wd plants plant water use efficiency wue was calculated as the ratio of adm to plant water use 2 2 2 c n concentration and nitrogen use efficiency at the final harvest the dry samples were ground into a fine powder for c n analysis using a mill retsch gmbh sm 2000 and a sample mill foss a s cyclotec 1093 for each sample 3 4 mg powder was weighed in tin capsule by using microbalance mettler toledo ax26 m comparator connected with a computer thermo scientific eager xperience version 1 2 january 2011 c and n concentrations were analyzed by using a chns o elemental analyzer flash 2000 thermo fisher scientific cambridge uk plant c and n content of each organ was calculated as the multiplication of c and n concentration with dry matter in barley leaf tomato stem and leaf respectively the plant c accumulation and n uptake was calculated as the sum of organ c and n content respectively plant nitrogen use efficiency nue was calculated as the ratio of plant c accumulation to n uptake meaning the amount of carbon assimilation per available nitrogen taken up into the biomass 2 2 3 statistical analyses at first harvest two way analysis of variance anova was performed using spss version 18 0 ibm electronics to analyze the effects of main factors namely co2 concentration co2 and genotype g as well as their interactions at the final harvest three way anova was used to analyze the main factor effects of co2 concentration co2 genotype g and irrigation regimes i as well as for their interactions 3 results 3 1 aboveground dry matter leaf area and specific leaf area at the first harvest for barley plants both aboveground dry matter adm and leaf area la were only affected by g table 1 adm and leaf area of wt barley were greater than those of az34 barley respectively for tomato plants adm was significantly affected by g and co2 g table 1 wt tomato had higher adm than ac flacca leaf area was affected only by g table 1 where wt tomato had greater leaf area than ac flacca at the final harvest for barley plants adm was significantly affected by co2 g and i fig 1a and b table 2 adms of e co2 wt barley and ww barley were greater than those of a co2 az34 barley and wd barley respectively leaf area was significantly affected by g i and g i fig 2a and b table 2 wt barley and ww barley had higher leaf area than az34 barley and wd barley respectively specific leaf area sla was affected by co2 g i and g i fig 3a and b table 2 a co2 and wt barley had greater sla than e co2 and az34 barley respectively across all treatments ww barley possessed higher sla than wd barley except for az34 barley at a co2 for tomato plant adm was significantly affected by co2 g i co2 g and g i

had greater ln than e co2 and wt tomato respectively 3 3 plant water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency at the final harvest for barley plants plant water use wu was significantly affected by co2 g i and g i fig 6a and b table 2 e co2 and ww barley had higher wu than a co2 and wd barley respectively under well watered condition wt barley had greater wu than az34 barley regardless of co2 environment water use efficiency wue was affected by co2 g i and g i fig 7a and b table 2 wue of e co2 and wd barley was higher than a co2 and ww barley respectively wue was greater in wt barley than az34 barley under water deficit nitrogen use efficiency nue was only affected by co2 fig 8a and b table 2 nue was greater in e co2 than a co2 barley for tomato plants wu was significantly affected by co2 g i and g i fig 6c and d table 3 wu of e co2 wt tomato and ww tomato was greater than that of a co2 ac flacca and wd tomato respectively wue was significantly affected by co2 g i co2 g and g i fig 7c and d table 3 wue of e co2 wt tomato and wd tomato was higher than that of a co2 ac flacca and ww tomato respectively nue was affected by co2 g co2 g g i and co2 g i fig 8c and d table 3 nue of e co2 and wt tomato was higher than that of a co2 and ac flacca respectively 4 discussion at the first harvest the aboveground dry matter and leaf area of aba deficient mutants were lower than that of the wild type wt in barley and tomato plants respectively table 1 this was mainly related to the mutant habitus as a result of reduced leaf development and biomass accumulation while at the final harvest the growth of both genotypes was largely increased especially for tomato plants and this could present the varied response to the different treatment factors and their combinations earlier studies have indicated that e co2 could promote the plant biomass due to the improved photosynthesis assimilation aranjuelo et al 2013 and the increment of c3 plant was around 40 reddy et al 2010 consistent with this as illustrated in fig 1 tables 1 and 2 the final harvested aboveground dry matter in both barley and tomato plants grown under e co2 environment were significantly enhanced the e co2 plant has been reported to increase leaf area resulted from the greater dry biomass bunce 2004 however in the present study fig 2 tables 2 and 3 a larger leaf area was only observed in tomato not in barley such phenomenon was probably induced by the photosynthesis acclimation of barley plant during e co2 condition leading to offset the positive growth effect at e co2 ainsworth and rogers 2007 besides no significant difference in leaf area was found in both aba deficient mutants between the two co2 treatments irrespective of wt plant or aba deficient mutant the leaf area of soil water deficit wd plants was smaller as compared with the well watered ww plants in all genotypes specific leaf area sla represents the thickness of plant leaves previous evidence has suggested that sla was decreased in plant grown at e co2 namely the leaf would be thicker and this was attributed to the enhancement of photosynthesis and carbon accumulation in the leaves gielen et al 2001 in good agreement with this here the sla of wt plants were lower under e co2 than a co2 resulted mainly from the increased dry mass fig 3a and c tables 2 and 3 however there was no difference in sla of aba deficient mutants between e co2 and a co2 environment fig 3b and d tables 2 and 3 which was corresponding to the above finding in leaf area in addition it was well documented that the sensitivity of soil water deficit on leaf expansion rate was earlier than that on carbon assimilation poorter et al 2009 which could induce a lower sla in drought stressed plant in relation to the well watered plant accordingly sla of all plants was decreased by soil water deficit in line with the earlier finding in amaranth liu and stützel 2004 it was widely believed that water use efficiency wue could be improved in e co2 environment pazzagli et al 2016 wei et al 2018 in accordance with this here the wue of the wt plant was significant greater at e co2 than at a co2 fig 7a and c tables 2 and 3 due to the increased plant dry biomass while this was not observed in the two aba deficient mutants fig 7b and d tables 2 and 3 additionally wue of plant under wd treatment was higher than that under ww treatment which was mainly attributed to the larger decline in water use fig 6 tables 2 and 3 as compared with plant mass liu et al 2005 here in the two aba deficient mutants no difference in plant growth la and sla and wue was found between the two co2 treatments this was due to the greater stomatal conductance and transpiration rate in the aba deficit mutant which could offset the decreased transpiration rate under e co2 leading to similar wue between plants grown under a co2 and e co2 environments while significant difference in these variables was only noticed between the two irrigation treatments all these indicate that at the whole plant level the low endogenous aba level in the mutants would have been involved in modulating the growth and physiological responses to e co2 previous study has suggested that plant c concentration would normally be enhanced in plant grown under e co2 condition due to the increased leaf photosynthetic rate souza et al 2008 at e co2 leaf c concentration of wt tomato was increased in this study while for other genotypes it was not affected fig 4 tables 2 and 3 this may be due to a dilution of c concentration in plant grown under e co2 butterly et al 2015 soil water deficit could also affect plant c concentration jacobsen et al 2009 reported that leaf c concentration was decreased in quinoa under water limited condition however here a reduction in leaf c concentration under soil water deficit was only observed in barley not in tomato furthermore compared to wt plant the leaf c concentration of aba deficient mutant was similar in barley monocot but was lower in tomato dicot fig 4 tables 2 and 3 these imply that the alternation of leaf c concentration in response to soil water deficit might be species dependent the n availability played an important role in influencing plant photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism thilakarathne et al 2015 accumulated evidence indicated that there was a reduction in plant n concentration when grown under e co2 environment which is mostly attributed to the dilution of n by the increased biomass and decreased in transpiration rate as well as depressed n absorption and allocation of root butterly et al 2015 loladze 2014 likewise compared with a co2 here the e co2 leaf had lower n concentration in wt barley and tomato fig 5a and c tables 2 and 3 as plant water use was not decreased under e co2 treatment in this study suggesting that there was no reduction of mass flow for n uptake thus the dilution effect due to enhanced dry biomass at e co2 could mainly be the cause for reduced leaf n concentration different from the wt plants the leaf n concentration of aba deficient mutants was unaffected by co2 growth environment fig 5b and d tables 2 and 3 indicating that endogenous aba level might take part in mediating the leaf n concentration response to e co2 concentration although there was no consensus on the relationship between endogenous aba levels and n status in diverse plants kiba et al 2011 it was accepted that a high aba concentration could restrict nitrate sensing resulting in decreased nitrate uptake léran et al 2015 consistent with this compared to wt plant here the aba deficient mutants showed similar barley or higher tomato in leaf n concentration fig 5 tables 2 and 3 soil water deficit often reduce plant n uptake leading to a low n concentration in leaves jacobsen et al 2009 disagrees with this in the current study leaf n concentration was not decreased in the soil water deficit plants in relation to their well watered counterparts fig 5 tables 2 and 3 this could be due to the fact that the reduction of leaf dry biomass was more pronounced than leaf n accumulation under soil water deficit plant nue was an important criteria for evaluating n requirement for maximizing c assimilation and this was mostly dependent on the n status of the plant fageria and baligar 2005 soil water deficit tends to decrease nue in plants wang et al 2010 while in this study plant nue was not significantly affected by soil water deficit fig 8 tables 2 and 3 moreover here the relative higher c accumulation than n uptake could contribute to enhanced nue by growth at e co2 in wt plants fig 8a and c tables 2 and 3 in consistent with the findings by reddy et al 2010 that e co2 could benefit the n uptake and enhance nue and in turn being conducive to improve photosynthetic rate without increasing transpiration rate leading to an enhanced plant wue nevertheless this was not evident in aba deficient mutants fig 8b and d tables 2 and 3 taken above together all these implies that the endogenous aba level could be involved in regulating plant n utilization response to e co2 5 conclusions compared with well watered treatment soil water deficit decreased adm la and sla while increased wue in all plants e co2 increased adm and la in tomato genotypes in both wt plants e co2 reduced sla leaf n concentration while increased wue and nue whereas in aba deficient mutants there was no difference in sla leaf n concentration wue and nue between the two co2 growth environments implying that the endogenous aba level could be taken part in mediating plant growth and n use response to e co2 these findings provide important knowledge on the mechanism of water and n use in barley and tomato plants response to soil

10157,mulched drip irrigation is regarded as an effective water saving irrigation technique that is adopted widely in dryland regions however due to the lack of efficient mulch film recovery residual plastic film fragments accumulating in soil nowadays pose a risk to agricultural production sustainability to mitigate the pollution result from polyethylene pe film mulching and demonstrate the

out to test five mulching practices sprayable degradable film mulching biodegradable transparent film with an 80 day induction period mulching biodegradable transparent film with a 100 day induction period mulching conventional transparent polyethylene film mulching no film mulching in xinjiang northwest china the results showed that mulching significantly increased soil water content and temperature by 23 83 and 15 01 average on two years in topsoil compared to the bare soil surface associated with a higher plant height leaf area index photosynthetic rate and aboveground biomass accumulation soil moisture temperature and crop height all significantly influenced cotton leaf photosynthetic rate and soil moisture had the most significant impact the direct path coefficient was 0

period was comparable with pe film in yield increased and reduction of water loss yield and wue was 5357 51 kg ha 1 and 1 29 kg m 3 respectively average on two years the sprayable biodegradable film also had good wetting and warming effects on soil but notably sprayable film performances were still weaker than that in solid films compared to solid degradable films mulching soil moisture soil temperature photosynthetic rate yield and wue in sprayable film mulching was decreased by 5 55 7 19 31 41 5 31 and 8 58 on average respectively in general biodegradable transparent film with a 100 day

control residual pe fragments pollution and maintained cotton yield keywords biodegradable film drip irrigation sprayable film arid and semi arid area water use efficiency crop development 1 introduction the mismatch between crop production and available water supply severely limits the growth of global agriculture unfortunately climate change global warming population growth urbanization expansion and industrial development increasingly intensify water scarcity issues threatening food security throughout the world mckenzie and williams 2015 yunusa et al 2018 to meet the increasing demand for food and fiber and ensure sustainable agricultural production development it is necessary to improve soil and water productivity agriculture water consumption accounts for 70 of total water use worldwide kang et al 2017 and is mostly used for irrigation so it is of utmost importance to conserve irrigation water to get higher agricultural produce china is a large agricultural country that feeds 21 of the population with just 6 of freshwater resources and 9 of arable land globally due to the extensive application of irrigation and fertilization nevertheless water deficiency enormously influences china s agricultural development especially in northwest china where the precipitation is only 28 13 of the national average ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2019 xinjiang is the typical dryland area in northwest china with 50 250 mm annual rainfall and larger than 1000 mm evaporation amount wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d to overcome the problem of scarce water resource drip irrigation under plastic film mulching which is considered an efficient water saving technique has been applied extensively in crop cultivation in this area consequently xinjiang becomes the largest cotton gossypium hirsutum l production area in china benefited from the advanced irrigation method and rich light heat resources national bureau of statistics of china 2019 drip irrigation under mulching is employed nearly in all crop field in xinjiang given the merits such as increasing yield and water fertilizer use efficiency controlling weeds saving labor input and decreasing soil erosion li et al 2020 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 on the other hand china is one of the biggest plastic film production and application country in the world where the national usage of the agricultural plastic film increases up to 2 5 million t in 2018 and more than one tenth of the plastic film is consumed by xinjiang national bureau of statistics of china 2019 however the plastic film usage in agriculture is difficult to degrade such that more and more residual plastic fragments accumulated in soil with years owing to lack of effective means yan et al 2014 he et al 2018 reported residual plastic film accumulation in the cotton field at a rate of 15 69 kg ha 1 in xinjiang which poses a risk to national and local sustainability of agricultural production to mitigate the soil pollution result from the accumulation of plastic film fragments the degradable film is broadly adopted in some areas as alternatives to conventional plastic mulches in enhancing crop growth chen et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019d however it is generally accepted that the performances of degradable films in boosting crop production and economic harvest are inefficient compared to conventional plastic films zhang et al 2020 previous studies showed soil moisture heat status in degradable films mulching was more comparable to conventional plastic mulches during early and middle periods of crop growth but significant lower moisture and temperature was observed at the late growth stage due to larger disintegrated area ali et al 2016a 2016b chen et al 2019a 2019b gu et al 2017 generally it is challenging to control film degradation rate accurately under various soil scenarios and faster degradation takes place frequently when soil microclimate ph soil moisture temperature microbial activity is suitable hah et al 2008 premature cracking failure of degradable mulches reduces irrigation water availability and excessive degradation period may decrease machine ploughed efficiency after harvest so it is critical to determine an optimal type of degradable film in various agriculture areas to maximize the benefits of degrading technology photosynthesis is recognized as a prominent activity of plant growth sun et al 2014 which is the major determinant in yield increasing it is well established that changes in photosynthesis rate are subjected to the variation in soil microclimate fan et al 2019 gyimah et al 2020 li et al 2020 gao et al 2010 indicated suitable soil water content significantly increased crop leaf photosynthetic capacity reich et al 2018 also pointed out that high soil moisture availability has positive effects on plant photosynthesis but such effects would be adverse when soil water deficit increased pettigrew and gerik 2007 illustrated an optimum temperature range and existing crop growth periods which could account for much of the improvement of leaf photosynthesis the better dry matter accumulation and greater harvest index could be observed as a result meanwhile increasing photosynthesis has primarily come from improved agronomic strategy fan et al 2019 li et al 2020 antony and singandhupe 2004 reported higher net photosynthesis rates were observed using drip irrigation than conventional surface irrigation choudhary et al 2012 detected the effects of various irrigation methods and mulches on crop physiological parameters they found that plants under drip irrigation with plastic film mulching had the maximal photosynthesis rate similar results were found by wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d 2020 however the effects of various degradable mulches in crop canopy photosynthesis especially in dryland remain unknown sprayable degradable films have been recognized with many positive effects and it is usually used in hillside fields wind gap uneven rough terrain land and other districts where solid films cannot be applied meanwhile crop seedlings can be directly broken out of the film without artificial membrane breaking which saves a lot of fieldwork the study s objective is to quantify the effects of various types of degradable mulches on soil climate and cotton canopy photosynthesis as well as yield and water use efficiency coupling with drip irrigation we compared crop plant response leaf area index dry matter accumulation photosynthesis rate soil moisture and temperature water consumption yield and water use efficiency to four types of mulches with drip irrigation in northwest china we hypothesize that degradable mulches have similar effects in boosting cotton photosynthesis rate and dry matter production based on the performance in heightening cotton yield and water use efficiency biodegradable transparent film with a 100 day induction period is recommended as an alternative to conventional plastics film adopted in xinjiang to increase water efficiency and mitigate the harmful effects of residual plastic film pollution 2 materials

effects of various mulching technologies on crop height over the period of 2 years crop height increased rapidly during 45 75 d after sowing with an average growth rate of 8 70 cm d 1 in 2013 and 7 25 cm d 1 in 2014 respectively the growth rate turned slower after 75 d due to top cutting and chemical control mulching materials had a significant effect on crop height compared with nf crop height in sf df1 df2 and pf was increased by 6 77 7 36 11 52 and 15 96 on 75 das days after sowing in 2013 and 4 52 6 13 10 83 and 17 05 in 2014 respectively crop height in pf was the highest and the difference between df2 and pf was of less significance over the two growing seasons 3 2 leaf area index lai of cotton increased with increasing time until 90 days after sowing and then gradually decreasing fig 4 various mulching materials had a significant effect on the lai of cotton a similar trend was obtained in lai with crop height mulching technologies increased the lai of cotton especially after 75 d after sowing lai of cotton in pf was the highest followed by df2 df1 and sf compared with non mulching sf df1 df2 and pf increased lai by 6 75 19 29 30 87 and 36 79 on 90 d in 2013 and 8 70 20 13 30 69 and 36 21 in 2014 respectively sprayable film mulching increased lai significantly but the solid film showed a better performance 3 3 dry matter accumulation significant differences in dry matter accumulation were observed in various mulching practices fig 5 compared with nf dry matter accumulation of cotton in sf df1 df2 and pf was increased by 9 10 13 21 20 66 and 28 66 on 120 days after sowing in 2013 and 8 08 12 36 17 70 and 25 42 in 2014 respectively pf performed the best in accumulating dry matter of cotton among four types of mulches 65 60 g plant 1 and 72 79 g plant 1 on 120 days after sowing in 2013 and 2014 cotton growing seasons the increase in cotton dry matter accumulation under sprayable film mulching was poor relative to solid film mulching but no significant differences were observed between sf and df2 in both years 3 4 soil moisture at the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil depth soil moisture was significantly greater in mulching than that in no mulching treatments fig 6 at 80 days after sowing compared with nf soil moisture in 0 20 soil layer in sf df1 df2 and pf was increased by 16 65 13 41 32 25 and increased by 39 01 in 2013 and 13 95 14 82 21 99 and 26 38 in 2014 respectively soil moisture in 20 40 cm soil layer was increased by 19 42 26 82 32 39 and 50 81 in 2013 and increased by 12 49 15 47 20 03 and 26 08 in 2014 respectively film mulching had a better performance in preventing soil moisture in the dry soil environment 28 85 higher than bare soil on average in 2013 than in wet soil condition 18 80 higher than bare soil on average in 2014 at harvest 175 das soil moisture in solid film mulching was higher than in sprayable film mulching but no significant difference was found among sf and df1 3 5 soil temperature soil temperature increased initially and then decreased as time passes by fig 7 soil temperature increased when film mulch was applied the order of soil temperature was substantially pf df2 df1 sf nf compared with nf soil temperature was improved by 5 00 11 76 14 61 and 21 63 in pf df2 df1 and sf on average in 2013 and 7 81 13 05 19 15 and 27 10 in 2014 respectively no significance was noticed among sf and nf after 80 days after sowing 3 6 photosynthetic rate the effects of various mulching technologies on the photosynthetic rate of cotton at the flower and boll stage in both years were observed to be of significance fig 8 similar results were obtained in 2013 and 2014 the photosynthetic rate of cotton in pf was the maximum over the two years which reached 14 93 μ mol m 2 s 1 in 2013 and 17 85 μ mol m 2 s 1 in 2014 respectively various types of mulching both enhanced cotton photosynthetic rate compared with nf photosynthetic rate in sf df1 df2 and pf was increased by 42 19 71 83 106 18 and 117 91 in 2013 and 34 73 77 43 94 50 and 114 79 respectively significantly strong positive correlations were found between photosynthetic rate and soil temperature lai crop height and soil moisture table 2 with the pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0 934 to 0 922 between photosynthetic rate and soil temperature and soil moisture respectively besides soil moisture soil temperature lai and crop height both have a significantly positive correlation with each other path analysis showed the direct effect of soil moisture on cotton photosynthetic rate was the highest followed by soil temperature and the direct effect of crop height was the lowest table 3 and soil moisture had a significant indirect effect on photosynthetic rate via soil temperature lai had no statistically significant effect on the photosynthetic rate so it did not exhibit in table 3 3 7 cotton yield and water use cotton yield is closely linked to a photosynthetic rate and there was a significant positive correlation between yield and photosynthetic rate fig 9 different mulching technologies exhibited significant effects on cotton yield et and wue table 4 cotton yield was the highest in pf which reached 5313 1 kg ha 1 in 2013 and 5548 08 kg ha 1 in 2014 respectively the lowest yield was observed in nf compare to no mulching sf df1 and df2 increased cotton yield by 8 41 11 73 and 15 80 in 2013 and 3 65 8 83 and 11 44 in 2014 respectively yield in df2 was lower than in pf but no differences were found between pe and df2 over the two years et during the whole growing season was affected significantly by various film mulching table 4 the highest et was recorded in nf and the lowest in pe in general the solid film achieved better performance in water conservation but the differences between sf and df1 were not of significance in 2013 and 2014 film mulching practices significantly increased wue over the two growing seasons compared with nf wue in sf df1 and df2 was increased by 18 56 23 71 30 93 and 34 02 in 2013 and 15 15 25 25 31 31 and 41 41 in 2014 respectively the highest wue was observed in conventional polyethylene film mulching intermediate in degradable film mulching with a rank of df2 df1 sf and the lowest in no mulching 4 discussion given the resistance to degradation pe plastic films are generally considered as a preferred material to improve soil microclimatic steinmetz et al 2016 however it must be removed from the soil after use because of its potential health risks hegan et al 2015 the types of biodegradable films texted in our study were reported to degrade to co2 h2o and some no nontoxic compounds via bulk erosion mechanism under the biochemical effects of soil microbe borrowman et al 2020 which the chemically intact of films was broken pe film showed the best performances improving soil moisture and temperature variable and followed by solid degradable films poor water retaining capacity was observed in biodegradable films mulching mainly due to the water vapor barrier associated with materials components lower than pe film the sprayable degradable film was compelling at soil moisture conservation but its heat maintaining capabilities were significantly lower than that of solid films braunack et al 2020 showed sprayable biodegradable films decreased evapotranspiration ranging from 2 8 to 15 5 compared to the bare soil surface and the availability of water conservation of sprayable biodegradable films increased with the application rate braunack et al 2020 in our study sprayable biodegradable film reduced et by 9 3 on average which is consistent with the results in braunack et al 2020 adhikari et al 2015 reported sprayable biodegradable film reduced soil evaporation by 10 50 larger than our founds the reasons for the differences may be the application rate and components of sprayable biodegradable film applied among present studies were independent adhikari et al 2019 furthermore braunack et al 2020 also found the effectiveness of soil water moisture conversation was influenced by soil water status and films using time i e films availability of water conservation reduced with time as soil drying meanwhile the water retention capability was subjected to environmental factors such as ambient temperature atmosphere humidity solar radiation and irrigation schedule for example li et al 2016 stated sprayable film had no significant effects on soil moisture or temperature in the maize growing season in the northwestern loess plateau china our study area has adequate solar and hot resources with an average sunshine duration is approximately 2865 h and soil dry wet status frequently changed due to the application of drip irrigation the application of sprayable biodegradable film needs to be understood the higher photosynthetic rate was significantly related to crop yield increasing sun et al 2014 path analysis was adopted widely to analyze the interaction between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables via a linear regression model stage et al 2004 in this study we examined the relationship of photosynthetic rate relative to soil temperature soil moisture lai and crop height we found that soil moisture had the most significant direct effect on the photosynthetic rate followed by soil temperature and crop height table 3 and the indirect influences of soil moisture on photosynthetic rate by soil temperature was also higher table 3 usually the lai was considered as a primary element of crop canopy characteristics but our results do not demonstrate the lai s significant effects on cotton photosynthesis table 3 the reason may be lai s role in photosynthetic activity was the synergistic function of soil moisture and temperature liu et al 2016 improved management practices are regarded as a useful approach to enhance leaf photosynthetic activity by regulating crop growth conditions to mitigate adverse environmental impacts pettigrew and gerik 2007 li et al 2020 found that films mulching enhanced crop chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate zhang et al 2019 reported that mulching technologies increased crop photosynthesis via facilitating stomatal opening and driving soil consumed by crop transpiration instead of field evaporation fan et al 2019 reported that appropriate soil moisture status could improve crop canopy structure which is the basis of increase photosynthetic and dry matter accumulation generally in this study a better soil microenvironment improved by pe film mulching had the maximal dry matter accumulation with the highest photosynthetic rate and the cotton biomass in df2 biodegradable transparent film with a 100 day induction period were slightly lower than pf treatment especially at initial and middle growth stages soil moisture and temperature were decreasing in the later crop growth stage as degrading of biodegradable films resulting in declining biomass accumulation with a low level of photosynthetic rate gu et al 2020 identified the most significant environmental factors the pe filmed could be replaced by the degradable film in cotton cultivation using a meta analysis i e thickness altitudes ambient temperature precipitation evaporation effective accumulated temperature was 10 µm 1000 1500 m 10 15 smaller than 500 mm larger than 2000 mm 3000 4000 respectively xinjiang meets such requirements except for altitudes in the same study area deng et al 2019 reported compared to bare soil without mulching degradable films increased cotton yield and wue by 67 2 and 77 7 respectively degradable films had good yield increasing effects on cotton which were similar with pf film and the differences were not significantly p 0 05 wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019d suggested yield and wue of cotton in degradable films mulching were higher by 16 7 and 20 5 than no mulching treatments and better performances of mulching practices were observed in a dry year in this study biodegradable films increased cotton yield ranged from 3 64 to 15 80 and increased wue ranged from 18 56 to 31 31 soil water content status is essential for increasing crop productivity in dryland increased soil moisture across rhizosphere environment by films mulching stimulated root absorption of water and nutrient crop yield and wue were lower under sprayable film mulching than that of solid mulches the results are consistent with li et al 2013 the application of sprayable film was also found to have a positive correlation with crop development for example adhikari et al 2015 reported sprayable mulches could maintain a similar yield with no mulching treatment reducing 28 irrigation amount fernández et al 2001 tested a hydrophobic polymer and the results revealed although hydrophobic polymer enhanced crop yield with 50 less irrigation water but no effects on soil temperature generally restriction of insufficient moisture resistance and low warming potentials for the sprayable film still threatened its popularization and application in crop cultivation due to its composition and mechanical properties adhikari et al 2016 5 conclusion a two year field experiment was carried out to study the effects of various mulching practices on cotton development soil microenvironment soil moisture and temperature canopy characteristics photosynthetic rate yield and water use efficiency of cotton under drip irrigation in a typical dryland area of xinjiang china the results revealed that mulching significantly optimized topsoil water content and heat status increased cotton crop height and lai associated with higher photosynthetic rate and dry matter accumulation leaf photosynthetic rate was positively correlated with soil moisture and heat status crop height lai and soil moisture which had the greatest direct effect in increasing cotton photosynthetic rate the highest cotton yield and wue were always observed in pe film mulching over the two growing seasons and biodegradable film with a long induction period 100 d was comparable to pe film sprayable film mulching effectively reduced soil water loss and increased upper soil temperature especially in the early growth stage compared with the bare soil surface but the performance was not as good as the solid films accordingly the biodegradable film with a 100 day induction period had good wetting and warming effects and may be considered a cotton cultivation option to control residual pe fragments pollution and maintain cotton yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10157,mulched drip irrigation is regarded as an effective water saving irrigation technique that is adopted widely in dryland regions however due to the lack of efficient mulch film recovery residual plastic film fragments accumulating in soil nowadays pose a risk to agricultural production sustainability to mitigate the pollution result from polyethylene pe film mulching and demonstrate the relationship between soil microenvironment photosynthetic capacity yield and water use efficiency of cotton gossypium hirsutum l in various mulching practices a two year field experiment was carried out to test five mulching practices sprayable degradable film mulching biodegradable transparent film with an 80 day induction period mulching biodegradable transparent film with a 100 day induction period mulching conventional transparent polyethylene film mulching no film mulching in xinjiang northwest china the results showed that mulching significantly increased soil water content and temperature by 23 83 and 15 01 average on two years in topsoil compared to the bare soil surface associated with a higher plant height leaf area index photosynthetic rate and aboveground biomass accumulation soil moisture temperature and crop height all significantly influenced cotton leaf photosynthetic rate and soil moisture had the most significant impact the direct path coefficient was 0 450 the highest cotton yield and wue were observed in pe film mulching 5480 59 kg ha 1 and 1 35 kg m 3 respectively average on two years and the biodegradable transparent film with a 100 day induction period was comparable with pe film in yield increased and reduction of water loss yield and wue was 5357 51 kg ha 1 and 1 29 kg m 3 respectively average on two years the sprayable biodegradable film also had good wetting and warming effects on soil but notably sprayable film performances were still weaker than that in solid films compared to solid degradable films mulching soil moisture soil temperature photosynthetic rate yield and wue in sprayable film mulching was decreased by 5 55 7 19 31 41 5 31 and 8 58 on average respectively in general biodegradable transparent film with a 100 day induction period could significantly improve soil water heat status enhance cotton development reduce water evaporation increase cotton yield and wue which provides a cotton cultivation option to control residual pe fragments pollution and maintained cotton yield keywords biodegradable film drip irrigation sprayable film arid and semi arid area water use efficiency crop development 1 introduction the mismatch between crop production and available water supply severely limits the growth of global agriculture unfortunately climate change global warming population growth urbanization expansion and industrial development increasingly intensify water scarcity issues threatening food security throughout the world mckenzie and williams 2015 yunusa et al 2018 to meet the increasing demand for food and fiber and ensure sustainable agricultural production development it is necessary to improve soil and water productivity agriculture water consumption accounts for 70 of total water use worldwide kang et al 2017 and is mostly used for irrigation so it is of utmost importance to conserve irrigation water to get higher agricultural produce china is a large agricultural country that feeds 21 of the population with just 6 of freshwater resources and 9 of arable land globally due to the extensive application of irrigation and fertilization nevertheless water deficiency enormously influences china s agricultural development especially in northwest china where the precipitation is only 28 13 of the national average ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2019 xinjiang is the typical dryland area in northwest china with 50 250 mm annual rainfall and larger than 1000 mm evaporation amount wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d to overcome the problem of scarce water resource drip irrigation under plastic film mulching which is considered an efficient water saving technique has been applied extensively in crop cultivation in this area consequently xinjiang becomes the largest cotton gossypium hirsutum l production area in china benefited from the advanced irrigation method and rich light heat resources national bureau of statistics of china 2019 drip irrigation under mulching is employed nearly in all crop field in xinjiang given the merits such as increasing yield and water fertilizer use efficiency controlling weeds saving labor input and decreasing soil erosion li et al 2020 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 on the other hand china is one of the biggest plastic film production and application country in the world where the national usage of the agricultural plastic film increases up to 2 5 million t in 2018 and more than one tenth of the plastic film is consumed by xinjiang national bureau of statistics of china 2019 however the plastic film usage in agriculture is difficult to degrade such that more and more residual plastic fragments accumulated in soil with years owing to lack of effective means yan et al 2014 he et al 2018 reported residual plastic film accumulation in the cotton field at a rate of 15 69 kg ha 1 in xinjiang which poses a risk to national and local sustainability of agricultural production to mitigate the soil pollution result from the accumulation of plastic film fragments the degradable film is broadly adopted in some areas as alternatives to conventional plastic mulches in enhancing crop growth chen et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019d however it is generally accepted that the performances of degradable films in boosting crop production and economic harvest are inefficient compared to conventional plastic films zhang et al 2020 previous studies showed soil moisture heat status in degradable films mulching was more comparable to conventional plastic mulches during early and middle periods of crop growth but significant lower moisture and temperature was observed at the late growth stage due to larger disintegrated area ali et al 2016a 2016b chen et al 2019a 2019b gu et al 2017 generally it is challenging to control film degradation rate accurately under various soil scenarios and faster degradation takes place frequently when soil microclimate ph soil moisture temperature microbial activity is suitable hah et al 2008 premature cracking failure of degradable mulches reduces irrigation water availability and excessive degradation period may decrease machine ploughed efficiency after harvest so it is critical to determine an optimal type of degradable film in various agriculture areas to maximize the benefits of degrading technology photosynthesis is recognized as a prominent activity of plant growth sun et al 2014 which is the major determinant in yield increasing it is well established that changes in photosynthesis rate are subjected to the variation in soil microclimate fan et al 2019 gyimah et al 2020 li et al 2020 gao et al 2010 indicated suitable soil water content significantly increased crop leaf photosynthetic capacity reich et al 2018 also pointed out that high soil moisture availability has positive effects on plant photosynthesis but such effects would be adverse when soil water deficit increased pettigrew and gerik 2007 illustrated an optimum temperature range and existing crop growth periods which could account for much of the improvement of leaf photosynthesis the better dry matter accumulation and greater harvest index could be observed as a result meanwhile increasing photosynthesis has primarily come from improved agronomic strategy fan et al 2019 li et al 2020 antony and singandhupe 2004 reported higher net photosynthesis rates were observed using drip irrigation than conventional surface irrigation choudhary et al 2012 detected the effects of various irrigation methods and mulches on crop physiological parameters they found that plants under drip irrigation with plastic film mulching had the maximal photosynthesis rate similar results were found by wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d 2020 however the effects of various degradable mulches in crop canopy photosynthesis especially in dryland remain unknown sprayable degradable films have been recognized with many positive effects and it is usually used in hillside fields wind gap uneven rough terrain land and other districts where solid films cannot be applied meanwhile crop seedlings can be directly broken out of the film without artificial membrane breaking which saves a lot of fieldwork the study s objective is to quantify the effects of various types of degradable mulches on soil climate and cotton canopy photosynthesis as well as yield and water use efficiency coupling with drip irrigation we compared crop plant response leaf area index dry matter accumulation photosynthesis rate soil moisture and temperature water consumption yield and water use efficiency to four types of mulches with drip irrigation in northwest china we hypothesize that degradable mulches have similar effects in boosting cotton photosynthesis rate and dry matter production based on the performance in heightening cotton yield and water use efficiency biodegradable transparent film with a 100 day induction period is recommended as an alternative to conventional plastics film adopted in xinjiang to increase water efficiency and mitigate the harmful effects of residual plastic film pollution 2 materials

effects of various mulching technologies on crop height over the period of 2 years crop height increased rapidly during 45 75 d after sowing with an average growth rate of 8 70 cm d 1 in 2013 and 7 25 cm d 1 in 2014 respectively the growth rate turned slower after 75 d due to top cutting and chemical control mulching materials had a significant effect on crop height compared with nf crop height in sf df1 df2 and pf was increased by 6 77 7 36 11 52 and 15 96 on 75 das days after sowing in 2013 and 4 52 6 13 10 83 and 17 05 in 2014 respectively crop height in pf was the highest and the difference between df2 and pf was of less significance over the two growing seasons 3 2 leaf area index lai of cotton increased with increasing time until 90 days after sowing and then gradually decreasing fig 4 various mulching materials had a significant effect on the lai of cotton a similar trend was obtained in lai with crop height mulching technologies increased the lai of cotton especially after 75 d after sowing lai of cotton in pf was the highest followed by df2 df1 and sf compared with non mulching sf df1 df2 and pf increased lai by 6 75 19 29 30 87 and 36 79 on 90 d in 2013 and 8 70 20 13 30 69 and 36 21 in 2014 respectively sprayable film mulching increased lai significantly but the solid film showed a better performance 3 3 dry matter accumulation significant differences in dry matter accumulation were observed in various mulching practices fig 5 compared with nf dry matter accumulation of cotton in sf df1 df2 and pf was increased by 9 10 13 21 20 66 and 28 66 on 120 days after sowing in 2013 and 8 08 12 36 17 70 and 25 42 in 2014 respectively pf performed the best in accumulating dry matter of cotton among four types of mulches 65 60 g plant 1 and 72 79 g plant 1 on 120 days after sowing in 2013 and 2014 cotton growing seasons the increase in cotton dry matter accumulation under sprayable film mulching was poor relative to solid film mulching but no significant differences were observed between sf and df2 in both years 3 4 soil moisture at the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil depth soil moisture was significantly greater in mulching than that in no mulching treatments fig 6 at 80 days after sowing compared with nf soil moisture in 0 20 soil layer in sf df1 df2 and pf was increased by 16 65 13 41 32 25 and increased by 39 01 in 2013 and 13 95 14 82 21 99 and 26 38 in 2014 respectively soil moisture in 20 40 cm soil layer was increased by 19 42 26 82 32 39 and 50 81 in 2013 and increased by 12 49 15 47 20 03 and 26 08 in 2014 respectively film mulching had a better performance in preventing soil moisture in the dry soil environment 28 85 higher than bare soil on average in 2013 than in wet soil condition 18 80 higher than bare soil on average in 2014 at harvest 175 das soil moisture in solid film mulching was higher than in sprayable film mulching but no significant difference was found among sf and df1 3 5 soil temperature soil temperature increased initially and then decreased as time passes by fig 7 soil temperature increased when film mulch was applied the order of soil temperature was substantially pf df2 df1 sf nf compared with nf soil temperature was improved by 5 00 11 76 14 61 and 21 63 in pf df2 df1 and sf on average in 2013 and 7 81 13 05 19 15 and 27 10 in 2014 respectively no significance was noticed among sf and nf after 80 days after sowing 3 6 photosynthetic rate the effects of various mulching technologies on the photosynthetic rate of cotton at the flower and boll stage in both years were observed to be of significance fig 8 similar results were obtained in 2013 and 2014 the photosynthetic rate of cotton in pf was the maximum over the two years which reached 14 93 μ mol m 2 s 1 in 2013 and 17 85 μ mol m 2 s 1 in 2014 respectively various types of mulching both enhanced cotton photosynthetic rate compared with nf photosynthetic rate in sf df1 df2 and pf was increased by 42 19 71 83 106 18 and 117 91 in 2013 and 34 73 77 43 94 50 and 114 79 respectively significantly strong positive correlations were found between photosynthetic rate and soil temperature lai crop height and soil moisture table 2 with the pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0 934 to 0 922 between photosynthetic rate and soil temperature and soil moisture respectively besides soil moisture soil temperature lai and crop height both have a significantly positive correlation with each other path analysis showed the direct effect of soil moisture on cotton photosynthetic rate was the highest followed by soil temperature and the direct effect of crop height was the lowest table 3 and soil moisture had a significant indirect effect on photosynthetic rate via soil temperature lai had no statistically significant effect on the photosynthetic rate so it did not exhibit in table 3 3 7 cotton yield and water use cotton yield is closely linked to a photosynthetic rate and there was a significant positive correlation between yield and photosynthetic rate fig 9 different mulching technologies exhibited significant effects on cotton yield et and wue table 4 cotton yield was the highest in pf which reached 5313 1 kg ha 1 in 2013 and 5548 08 kg ha 1 in 2014 respectively the lowest yield was observed in nf compare to no mulching sf df1 and df2 increased cotton yield by 8 41 11 73 and 15 80 in 2013 and 3 65 8 83 and 11 44 in 2014 respectively yield in df2 was lower than in pf but no differences were found between pe and df2 over the two years et during the whole growing season was affected significantly by various film mulching table 4 the highest et was recorded in nf and the lowest in pe in general the solid film achieved better performance in water conservation but the differences between sf and df1 were not of significance in 2013 and 2014 film mulching practices significantly increased wue over the two growing seasons compared with nf wue in sf df1 and df2 was increased by 18 56 23 71 30 93 and 34 02 in 2013 and 15 15 25 25 31 31 and 41 41 in 2014 respectively the highest wue was observed in conventional polyethylene film mulching intermediate in degradable film mulching with a rank of df2 df1 sf and the lowest in no mulching 4 discussion given the resistance to degradation pe plastic films are generally considered as a preferred material to improve soil microclimatic steinmetz et al 2016 however it must be removed from the soil after use because of its potential health risks hegan et al 2015 the types of biodegradable films texted in our study were reported to degrade to co2 h2o and some no nontoxic compounds via bulk erosion mechanism under the biochemical effects of soil microbe borrowman et al 2020 which the chemically intact of films was broken pe film showed the best performances improving soil moisture and temperature variable and followed by solid degradable films poor water retaining capacity was observed in biodegradable films mulching mainly due to the water vapor barrier associated with materials components lower than pe film the sprayable degradable film was compelling at soil moisture conservation but its heat maintaining capabilities were significantly lower than that of solid films braunack et al 2020 showed sprayable biodegradable films decreased evapotranspiration ranging from 2 8 to 15 5 compared to the bare soil surface and the availability of water conservation of sprayable biodegradable films increased with the application rate braunack et al 2020 in our study sprayable biodegradable film reduced et by 9 3 on average which is consistent with the results in braunack et al 2020 adhikari et al 2015 reported sprayable biodegradable film reduced soil evaporation by 10 50 larger than our founds the reasons for the differences may be the application rate and components of sprayable biodegradable film applied among present studies were independent adhikari et al 2019 furthermore braunack et al 2020 also found the effectiveness of soil water moisture conversation was influenced by soil water status and films using time i e films availability of water conservation reduced with time as soil drying meanwhile the water retention capability was subjected to environmental factors such as ambient temperature atmosphere humidity solar radiation and irrigation schedule for example li et al 2016 stated sprayable film had no significant effects on soil moisture or temperature in the maize growing season in the northwestern loess plateau china our study area has adequate solar and hot resources with an average sunshine duration is approximately 2865 h and soil dry wet status frequently changed due to the application of drip irrigation the application of sprayable biodegradable film needs to be understood the higher photosynthetic rate was significantly related to crop yield increasing sun et al 2014 path analysis was adopted widely to analyze the interaction between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables via a linear regression model stage et al 2004 in this study we examined the relationship of photosynthetic rate relative to soil temperature soil moisture lai and crop height we found that soil moisture had the most significant direct effect on the photosynthetic rate followed by soil temperature and crop height table 3 and the indirect influences of soil moisture on photosynthetic rate by soil temperature was also higher table 3 usually the lai was considered as a primary element of crop canopy characteristics but our results do not demonstrate the lai s significant effects on cotton photosynthesis table 3 the reason may be lai s role in photosynthetic activity was the synergistic function of soil moisture and temperature liu et al 2016 improved management practices are regarded as a useful approach to enhance leaf photosynthetic activity by regulating crop growth conditions to mitigate adverse environmental impacts pettigrew and gerik 2007 li et al 2020 found that films mulching enhanced crop chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate zhang et al 2019 reported that mulching technologies increased crop photosynthesis via facilitating stomatal opening and driving soil consumed by crop transpiration instead of field evaporation fan et al 2019 reported that appropriate soil moisture status could improve crop canopy structure which is the basis of increase photosynthetic and dry matter accumulation generally in this study a better soil microenvironment improved by pe film mulching had the maximal dry matter accumulation with the highest photosynthetic rate and the cotton biomass in df2 biodegradable transparent film with a 100 day induction period were slightly lower than pf treatment especially at initial and middle growth stages soil moisture and temperature were decreasing in the later crop growth stage as degrading of biodegradable films resulting in declining biomass accumulation with a low level of photosynthetic rate gu et al 2020 identified the most significant environmental factors the pe filmed could be replaced by the degradable film in cotton cultivation using a meta analysis i e thickness altitudes ambient temperature precipitation evaporation effective accumulated temperature was 10 µm 1000 1500 m 10 15 smaller than 500 mm larger than 2000 mm 3000 4000 respectively xinjiang meets such requirements except for altitudes in the same study area deng et al 2019 reported compared to bare soil without mulching degradable films increased cotton yield and wue by 67 2 and 77 7 respectively degradable films had good yield increasing effects on cotton which were similar with pf film and the differences were not significantly p 0 05 wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019d suggested yield and wue of cotton in degradable films mulching were higher by 16 7 and 20 5 than no mulching treatments and better performances of mulching practices were observed in a dry year in this study biodegradable films increased cotton yield ranged from 3 64 to 15 80 and increased wue ranged from 18 56 to 31 31 soil water content status is essential for increasing crop productivity in dryland increased soil moisture across rhizosphere environment by films mulching stimulated root absorption of water and nutrient crop yield and wue were lower under sprayable film mulching than that of solid mulches the results are consistent with li et al 2013 the application of sprayable film was also found to have a positive correlation with crop development for example adhikari et al 2015 reported sprayable mulches could maintain a similar yield with no mulching treatment reducing 28 irrigation amount fernández et al 2001 tested a hydrophobic polymer and the results revealed although hydrophobic polymer enhanced crop yield with 50 less irrigation water but no effects on soil temperature generally restriction of insufficient moisture resistance and low warming potentials for the sprayable film still threatened its popularization and application in crop cultivation due to its composition and mechanical properties adhikari et al 2016 5 conclusion a two year field experiment was carried out to study the effects of various mulching practices on cotton development soil microenvironment soil moisture and temperature canopy characteristics photosynthetic rate yield and water use efficiency of cotton under drip irrigation in a typical dryland area of xinjiang china the results revealed that mulching significantly optimized topsoil water content and heat status increased cotton crop height and lai associated with higher photosynthetic rate and dry matter accumulation leaf photosynthetic rate was positively correlated with soil moisture and heat status crop height lai and soil moisture which had the greatest direct effect in increasing cotton photosynthetic rate the highest cotton yield and wue were always observed in pe film mulching over the two growing seasons and biodegradable film with a long induction period 100 d was comparable to pe film sprayable film mulching effectively reduced soil water loss and increased upper soil temperature especially in the early growth stage compared with the bare soil surface but the performance was not as good as the solid films accordingly the biodegradable film with a 100 day induction period had good wetting and warming effects and may be considered a cotton cultivation option to control residual pe fragments pollution and maintain cotton yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10158,understanding and mitigating the adverse impacts of water stress on agriculture production have become global concern in water scarce environments particularly deccan plateau the largest semi arid zone of peninsular india is confronted with severe water resources conflicts and extensive pressure for food production under climate change scenario for sustainable agriculture it is critical to quantify the impact of water stress on major crops like winter onion allium cepa l which is grown under diverse water management practices on shallow basaltic soils of this region we conducted a field experiment during two growing seasons 2017 18 and 2018 19 for evaluating responses of different cultivars of red b raj b kiran b super b red and local fursangi and white b shubra b sweta and b safed

to water stress by keeping cooler canopy temperatures higher leaf relative water content and modulating the stomatal opening lower yield losses due to rotting 0 30 1 81 and splitting 4 4 6 5 of bulbs were observed in red and white cultivars this study further endorses the appropriate selection of onion cultivars reduces water requirements by 37 5 61 to attain similar water productivity 16 0 kg m 3 as with recommended irrigation level increased in water stress levels though reduced quality of physical traits of harvested bulbs viz mean weight average dia shape index si harvest index hi and firmness these improved the storage quality water deficit also increased accumulation of soluble solids total phenolics protein dry matter and elevated the ph and rehydration quality besides potentially affecting the enzymatic activity sod and pod of onion cultivars it was concluded that white onion cultivars like b shubra with higher wp under medium and severe water deficit stress and local red cultivar should be preferred for efficient utilisation of water resources both in terms of the productivity and post harvest quality of onion under drought prone and shallow basaltic regions of deccan plateau graphical abstract ga1 keywords onion cultivars water stress irrigation scheduling water productivity onion quality deccan plateau 1 introduction climate change induced water scarcity is becoming a major constraint to meet agriculture production and rapid socio economic development worldwide jin et al 2018 particularly the deccan plateau dp the largest semi arid region

2017 there has been an apparent rise in frequency of droughts of varying duration and severity along with sub regional shift of monsoons mallya et al 2016 in addition to conflicts over water for other anthropogenic activities the evapotranspirational demands increase during drought periods and these ultimately lead to severe reductions in agricultural productivity and production vasu et al 2017 bej 2018 paul et al 2018 these conditions demand for a focus on maximising water productivity rather than yields of major crops which are cultivated over larger area with limited irrigation greaves and wang 2017 abdelkhalik et al 2019 onion is mainly cultivated in high to extremely high water stressed areas of india contributing 20 of world production particularly dp region alone contributes more than half of india s onion production where it is being cultivated both as rainfed and irrigated crop in monsoon and winter seasons respectively latter is preferred by onion growers for its superior storage quality and lesser incidences of diseases lawande et al 2009 however crops during this period are more vulnerable to water stress as a consequence of irregular and deficient precipitation and limitations of soil water supplies both with shallowness of basaltic soil constraining rooting depth and insufficient soil moisture from the previous rainy season these circumstances often lead to mid season water deficits resulting in decline in growth and overall productivity wakchaure et al 2018 thus provision for supplemental irrigation becomes obligatory to sustain crop growth its yield potential and quality since the region is constrained by limited ground and surface waters resources naik and awasthi 2003 arulbalaji and maya 2019 the objectives should be to optimise irrigation needs for maximising the water productivity and minimising the water deficits being shallow rooted crop onion requires light and frequent irrigations khokhar 2018 even the low water stress impacts its photosynthesis and other physiological mechanisms both at intracellular and the whole plant level often leading to reduced growth bulb yields and overall productivity ghodke et al 2018 abdelkhalik et

growth cumulative weight losses rooting sprouting and physiological weight and bulb yield the overall inferences are that selection of region specific cultivars and efficient irrigation strategies can lead to water savings while sustaining onion yields amongst different strategies deficit irrigation di is an effective practice to reduce irrigation water and increase water productivity wp because plants can reduce their leaf transpiration and soil evaporation to minimise water consumption yang et al 2020 it also known for minimising adverse effects of water stress on crop yields via inducing

knox 2014 wakchaure et al 2018 particularly its feasibility need to be established for shallow root crops like onion keeping the above in view experiments were conducted with the specific objectives of i quantifying the impact of water deficits on canopy traits bulb yield and quality of white and red onions in shallow basaltic soils and water scarce zone of dp region and ii to develop water production functions for different red and white onion cultivars by inducing variable stress levels with deficit irrigation regimes 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site soil and meteorological

experimental site 2 2 experimental design and layout treatments seed and cultural practices the field experiments were laid out in split plot design with three replications comprising of 48 treatment combinations i e eight onion cultivars in main plots and six irrigation regimes in subplots created artificially using line source sprinkler lss the details of experimental treatments are described in table 2 the configured lss produces uniform irrigation application rate along the mainline which linearly decreases in perpendicular direction from the source thus maximum 17 mm water was distributed in nearby subplots to the mainline and the minimum was 0 3 0 5 mm h 1 in last subplots located at distance of 12 5 15 m the experimental layout of usable area 30 m 30 m and its allocation into main plots 12 m 1 5 m along with lss is given fig 2 further individual main plot was separated by 0 5 m distance into six subplots 2 5 m 1 5 m the detailed specifications of lss plot irrigation system have been given earlier by wakchaure et al 2016 the amount of water applied cm in each irrigation was quantified by measuring depth of irrigation water iw collected in series of cylindrical pvc catch canes 19 5 cm height 10 cm dia placed at centre of each subplots the details of quantities of iw and days of irrigation applied in onion during two consecutive onion growth periods have given in table 3 moreover water stress levels produced under irrigation regimes at iw cpe of 1 00 0 81 0 80 0 79 0 60 0 59 0 40 and 0 39 0 00 were classified as excess optimum low medium and severe stress respectively the seed materials of most popular three white onion cultivars i e bhima b shubra b sweta and b safed and five red onion cultivars i e b raj b kiran b super b red local as selected for experiments were obtained from icar directorate of onion and garlic pune and onion growers nearby to icar niasm baramati the local cultivar fursangi chosen for experiment is very popular in the region for tender onions the beds for transplanting were prepared after subsequent rotavator operations to pulverise the soil onion seedlings 40 days old of onion cultivars were transplanted on 20th and 23th november in 2017 and 2018 keeping row and plant spacing as 15 cm and 10 cm respectively two common irrigations were applied initially with interval of 21 days to ensure the better seedling establishment recommended doses of n p and k fertilisers were applied basal dose consisted of 110 kg n 40 kg p2o5 and 40 kg k2o ha 1 while rest 110 kg n was top dressed in two splits at 40 and 60 days after transplanting dat the onion bulbs were harvested at physiological maturity in approximately 135 dat during both seasons 2 3 soil and canopy traits yields and water productivity wp the different canopy traits viz plant height canopy air temperature difference catd leaf relative water content rwc and normalised difference vegetative index ndvi reflects relationship between plant water status and soil water deficit were measured from the 35 days after transplanting dat onwards with 25 days interval average plant height cm was measured from ground surface to the tip of the longest leaf of three randomly selected onion plants in individual subplots abdissa et al 2011 mean catd ºc was monitored in each subplot using handheld infrared thermometer agri therm iii 6210 l everest interscience inc usa as the average of three readings recorded from different plants these were recorded by holding device at an angle of 30 from the horizontal at right angle to sample row for viewing only plant canopy area between 13 00 and 15 00 h likewise the leaf relative water content rwc was estimated by standard method cited by tanentzap et al 2015 the ndvi simplest indicator interpreted the crop vigour greenness was measured by using handheld portable green seeker sensor trimble spltech pvt ltd india the bulbs were harvested manually after rolling operation performed at physiological maturity when at least 80 of total plants showed yellowing of leaves at harvest the total bulb yields mg ha 1 on fresh weight basis fwb was computed similarly marketable bulb yield mg ha 1 fwb was determined after discarding splitted centred and rotten bulbs from each subplots the splitted centred and rotted bulbs obtained in each subplot were weighed separately and expressed in per cent losses reference to normal bulbs weight total above ground biomass and soil moisture content were estimated by gravimetric method after drying in a hot air oven at 70 c and 105 c for 24 h respectively gardner et al 2001 the readings of total above ground biomass were taken at harvest from each subplots while each soil moisture reading is the average of the three observations recorded at 0 25 m depth in replication wise after 4 days of each irrigation and the time of harvesting of onion cultivars in both years water productivity wp kg m3 was computed according to zhao et al 2017 as expressed as ratio of total bulb yields tby to total water applied that includes iw and precipitation received during entire onion growing periods 2 4 bulb quality attributes and biochemical analysis the harvest index hi mean bulb weight g geometric mean bulb diameter dgm mm and shape index si was measured as per methods suggested by abdissa et al 2011 and dabhi and patel 2017 for 10 randomly selected onion samples after harvesting in each subplots bulb firmness indicated in term of penetration force g was measured by performing puncture test on the equatorial bulb diameter using a texture analyser model ta hd plus stable micro systems uk the leaves and roots of freshly harvested onion bulbs from the respective treatments were trimmed and shifted to lab for analysing the biochemical and functional quality characteristics the bulbs were dressed by tap water for removing the outer dry layer sliced into smaller pieces 3 5 mm and were mixed uniformly to get a representative sample the rehydration ratio and dry matter were measured by methods suggested by ranganna 2002 and sharma and lee 2016 respectively the soluble solids brix and ph of bulb tissues measurement was carried out with a portable digital refractometer erma japan and ph metre pc 700 eutech respectively total protein content mg g f w and total phenolics mg gae equi g f w in the bulb tissues were computed using lowry s method lowry et al 1951 and folin ciocalteu method radicetti et al 2016 respectively the superoxide dismutase unit mg protein and peroxidase unit 100 g fw activities in bulb tissue samples were quantified according to beauchamp and fridovich 1971 and chen and asada 1989 respectively 2 5 statistical analysis data from field experiments were statistically analysed using sas software ver 9 3 to study the water deficit stress impacts on canopy bulb yields and quality parameters of different onion cultivars statistical significance between onion cultivars cvs and their interaction with water stress ws iw cpe regimes in two years year was done by individual and combined analysis of variance since larger differences in ws regimes gomez and gomez 1984 however attention should be given to analyse small differences among adjoining irrigation regimes as the statistical analyses of ws effect are not strictly valid since ws applied thoroughly without randomisation in lss rao et al 2013 least significant differences lsd at p 0 05 were computed using student s t and duncan tests for comparing group means similarly periodic changes in canopy traits and biochemical characteristics at harvest were analysed in triplicates n 3 and data were expressed as mean with standard errors in excel plots 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of canopy traits for onion cultivars in water stress the overall vegetative growth of both seasons 2017 18 and 2018 19 as reflected in terms of canopy traits viz plant height normalised difference vegetation index ndvi leaf relative water content rwc and canopy air temperature difference catd varied significantly among the onion cultivars and water deficits fig 4a d the plant height and ndvi increased initially and varied between 35 9 and 60 3 cm and 0 48 0 62 for different cultivars at 35 60 days after transplanting dat respectively thereafter it stabilised and later got reduced to 29 9 62 2 cm and 0 14 0 57 until harvest leaf rwc decreased linearly during the monitoring period of onion growth interestingly white b shubra b sweta and b safed and local cultivars sustained comparatively higher plant height ndvi and leaf rwc than those of other red cultivars after bulb development stage indicating their better tolerance to water deficits fig 4a b d this also indicates that the white and local genotype supplied robust photo protective system against water stress when compared with other red genotypes these dissimilarities in different canopy growth traits among onion cultivars were strongly associated with their genetic makeup light interception ability photoperiod and temperature in growing degree days and adaptability to abiotic environmental conditions tesfay et al 2011 hanci and cebeci 2014 marino and alvino 2015 further the canopy growth was impacted by water stress e g plant height ndvi and leaf rwc at 85 dat were reduced from 64 1 cm 0 61 80 5 at iw cpe 1 0 respectively to 46 1 cm 0 37 and 52 5 under unirrigated conditions after initial common irrigations this was obviously due to non replenishment of water from depleted soil under water deficits regimes fig 2 major differences in vegetative growth were monitored until 35 60 dat and thereafter these were reduced considerably it endorses the ability of onion to retrieve against the adverse impact water stress in initial phases if cell multiplication and growth are not affected in the consequent stages as demonstrated by zheng et al 2013 the maximum differences of rwc 27 8 28 and ndvi 0 24 0 27 were noticed at 85 110 dat followed by in plant height 27 30 6 cm at 110 135 dat indicating highest sensitivity of onion to bulb development stage under water deficit until harvest this was related to reduction in chlorophyll content lower cell expansion and restricted root nutrient water uptake from soils that arrested crop growth via limited photosynthesis assani et al 2009 abdelkhalik et al 2019 yaser et al 2020 conversely catd improved upon growth and development of onion cultivars fig 4c the positive catd values reported at 77 85 103 and 108 dat for red cultivars viz b red b super b kiran and b raj respectively while catd remained negative 1 5 to 0 5 even after 110 dat for white b shubra and b safed and local cultivars indicating efficacy to better water usage via maintaining higher leaf rwc 52 6 68 3 moreover the maximum differences in catd 2 7 6 3 observed at different growth stages 60 110 dat signifying catd could be a vital factor for selection and identification of water stress tolerant onion cultivars these further indicate the ability of white and local cultivars for improving growth and bulb yields by maintenance of cooler canopy temperatures under water deficit al ghzawi et al 2018 reported similar trends of catd an indication of efficient transpiration in cooling leaves of different cultivars based on moisture content in leaf tissues under water stress environments the negative catd 0 5 to 7 6 at 60 dat shows that no water stress up to bulb initiation stage in all water regimes further catd improved to become positive at 63 79 82 104 117 and 124 dat for water stress regimes with iw cpe 0 00 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 1 00 representing commencement of water stress as result of limited water uptake from bulb development stage onwards this was also evidenced by lower leaf rwc 55 65 that controls the transpiration rate via maintaining higher canopy temperature under water deficit al ghzawi et al 2018 and parkash and singh 2020 demonstrated that how best variability in canopy temperature trends could be utilised for indicating plant water stress since its strongly correlated with transpiration rate midday leaf water potential stomatal conductance water usage and crop yields 3 2 total bulb yields marketable bulb yields and yield losses total bulb yields tby marketable bulb yields mby and yield losses for different cultivars and water stress regimes are summarised in table 4 and table 5 in both years onion bulb yield trends remained almost similar for different cultivars but their comparative values were significantly higher in 2017 18 than 2018 19 this was obviously due to relatively lower leaf evapotranspiration cooler and calm weather conditions as experienced by crop in 2017 18 particularly during 70 110 dat that were congenial to bulb development in onions table 1 zheng et al 2013 and lovelli et al 2017 earlier highlighted the metrological conditions markedly influenced the yields and quality of vegetable crops grown in water scarce regions of northwest china and mediterranean environments in pooled data both tby and mby values were significantly higher in local red genotype than the other onion cultivars among other red cultivars highest bulb yields were observed in b raj followed by b kiran b super and b red respectively same trends of yield variation were noted in white cultivars i e b shubra produced more bulb yield than b sweta and b safed these results corroborate with previous findings of abdel and al juboori 2006 who manifested highest growth and yield responses in local red cultivar over other white and red cultivars while comparing the effect of water stress the averaged tby and mby were declined with increasing water deficits the maximum bulb yields were observed between 0 80 and 1 00 iw cpe further individual and pooled analyses indicates the bulb yields obtained under excess 0 81 1 00 and optimum 0 80 water stress regimes were almost at par during both years 2017 18 and 2018 19 when referenced to maximum averaged tby 91 4 mg ha 1 relative bulb yields rby were 0 88 0 61 0 26 and 0 11 at iw cpe 0 60 0 40 0 20 and 0 00 respectively in other words tby were declined to 1 14 1 64 3 91 9 23 folds with increasing water deficit against the recommended optimum water level iw cpe 0 80 owing to limited supply of soil moisture under water stress conditions fig 3 similar yields responses to water deficit in red hot pepper and potato using lss have been reported by gencoglan et al 2006 and motalebifard 2019 this results of yield declination is in agreements with the analysed canopy growth dynamics which was highly influenced by limited water supply at development and bulbification stages leading to restricted cell multiplication and expansion and stomatal control in response to water stress bhatt et al 2006 further lisar et al 2013 and silva díaz et al 2020 reported the water stress damages photosynthetic apparatus inhibits chlorophyll synthesis lowers photosynthetic carbon assimilation and disrupts electron transport cycle in plants and thus reduced overall yields and productivity the interaction effects of onion cultivars and water stress regimes were also significant interestingly local and red onion cultivars performed better under excess water stress conditions local genotype was more tolerant in improving tby 19 0 under excess water conditions followed by b raj b super b red and b kiran where overall tby enhancement were 17 0 11 5 7 3 and 6 3 respectively over white cultivars conversely white onion cultivars were superior under water deficit conditions particularly cultivars b safed and b sweta were more effective in mitigating the adverse impact of water stress in medium and severe water deficits e g rby with iw cpe 0 40 were 3 6 and 12 9 for b sweta and b safed whereas enhancement at iw cpe 0 20 was 25 8 19 2 and 15 1 with b shubra b safed and b sweta respectively this indicates that the local and white cultivars have ability to extract soil moisture from lower layer under water deficits conditions due to its comparatively deeper and unbranched root system than fibrous and shallow roots of other red cultivars bailey et al 2002 ortola and knox 2014 overall crop tolerance to water scarcity is determined by multiple factors viz genotype sensitivity environment and plant biochemical mechanisms that increases water nutrients uptake chloroplast functionality photo assimilates translocation and source sink homoeostasis to improved yields ohashil et al 2000 toscano et al 2019 splitting and rotting behaviour of onion cultivars accountable for yield losses across water stress regimes were expressed in terms of percentage of splitted centred and rotten bulbs in table 5 yield losses due to rotten bulbs were significantly higher in white cultivars particularly at larger water regimes iw cpe 0 80 1 00 indicating their high vulnerability to excess water stress since surplus moisture accumulated in onion bulbs increases rotting losses with increased irrigation thresholds bhagyawant et al 2015 sidhu et al 2019 contrary highest percentage of splitted centred bulbs were found in red cultivars generally minimum yield losses owing to rotting 0 3 1 8 and splitting 4 4 6 5 of bulbs were observed in red and white cultivars irrespective to water stress respectively especially local and b shubra were onion cultivars which had smallest percentage of rotten 0 30 and di centred 4 4 bulbs respectively interestingly both splitted centred 18 1 and rotten bulbs 10 8 were significantly higher in b red specifying its sensitivity to water stress percentage of splitted centred bulbs increased with water deficit with average improvement equalled to 4 8 6 8 9 1 10 8 14 0 and 16 2 when water stress imposed at iw cpe 1 0 0 80 0 40 0 20 and 0 0 respectively similar trend of bulbs splitting was reported by pelter et al 2004 in onion grown during water scarce regions 3 3 physical quality of onion bulbs the physical quality which has important bearing on transportation marketability and storage of onion is usually expressed in terms of harvest index hi bulb firmness and size matrices mean bulb weight average bulb diameter and shape index these parameters were significantly different for both cultivars and water stress regimes table 6 being an important measure of reproductive efficiency and quality hi values 0 960 0 964 remained almost stable or rather improved with excess and optimum water stress regimes while it got reduced from 0 96 to 0 92 with water deficits these findings inferred with previous reports of hegde 1986 that the hi increased from 0 66 to 0 72 for onion grown in water deficits further our results differed from abdelkhalik et al 2019 who demonstrated the hi 0 84 0 85 were not affected by deficit irrigation strategy for onion cultivated in mediterranean conditions hi varied between 0 93 and 0 96 for different cultivars while the highest variability in hi was found among red cultivars over white cultivars these differences in hi were largely dependent on genetic variation within cultivars which distinguished crop yield response by altering assimilate allocation between roots and shoot in response to water deficits nakhforoosh et al 2015 in two years pooled data the mean bulb weight and bulb diameter dgm were declined to almost one fifth and three fifths respectively similarly shape index si and penetration force an indicators of bulbs firmness were reduced with increasing water deficits particularly penetration force reduced to half under severe water deficits iw cpe 0 40 overall lower values of these indices in excess stress iw cpe 0 80 indicating inferior bulb quality than those of optimum irrigations contrary maxima of these indices were obtained between optimum to low water stress conditions iw cpe 0 60 0 80 indicates superior bulbs quality similar declinations in mean bulb weight geometric diameter and shape index with water restrictions owing to shallow roots of onions were noticed by abdelkhalik et al 2019 and mubarak and hamdan 2018a in water scarce environment significant variations in mean bulb weight dgm and si were monitored between different onion cultivars the interaction effects of onion cultivars and water stress regimes were also significant the maximum bulbs weight 151 4 g dgm 64 9 mm and penetration force 2092 g were recorded with local red cultivar defining its highest water stress tolerant than others cultivars the higher bulb firmness and lower si values represents higher sphericity of bulbs in red cultivars indicates their utility for long terms bulb storage over white cultivars amongst white cultivars b shubra produced superior quality of onion bulbs under water stress and its corresponding values of quality indices were almost at par with red onion cultivars similar trends of variation in bulb size and other quality attributes for different onion varieties cultivated under water stress regimes were reported by bhatt et al 2006 obviously differential photosynthetic responses stomatal conductance osmatic adjustment and genetic makeup of different cultivars altered crop yields and quality under varied agronomic water and post harvest management practices mallor et al 2011 sekara et al 2017 3 4 relationship of water productivity onion cultivars and water stress regimes water productivity wp of onion differed with cultivars across the water stress regimes when averaged for two years 2017 19 as shown in fig 5 interestingly wp increased initially from 12 1 to 19 0 kg m 3 under excess to optimum water levels remained maximum and stable 16 2 20 2 kg m 3 under medium stress and then reduced drastically from 19 3 to 8 2 kg m 3 under severe stress conditions amongst onion cultivars highest increase in wp 14 9 19 2 kg m 3 was recorded in local and b raj under excess and optimum water levels in b shubra and local 20 2 kg m 3 under medium and then in b shubra and b safed 13 5 19 3 kg m 3 under severe water deficits respectively overall in terms of wp red cultivars 13 4 19 0 kg m 3 were found superior under excess and optimum water level while white onion cultivars 12 1 20 2 kg m 3 were performed better under medium to severe stress conditions this was obviously due to higher drought tolerant of white cultivars increases wp while the drought sensitivity of red cultivars decreases wp under water deficit conditions the similar characteristics trend of wue was investigated by boutraa et al 2010 in wheat cultivars under water stress conditions of saudi arabia the values of wp obtained under this study were within range of 9 2 15 9 kg m 3 with those obtained in ethiopia ramalan et al 2010 the relationship between wp onion cultivars and water stress regimes was developed by plotting the average yields against the total applied water aw in both seasons 2017 19 the quadratic equations r2 0 69 0 82 best defined relationship between average wp and seasonal aw when referred to maximum wp 16 0 kg m 3 computed at 48 7 cm with b red the same could be accomplished with aw equalling to 44 9 30 4 26 9 25 9 25 4 24 6 and 19 1 cm with b super b kiran b raj b sweta b safed b local and b shubra respectively this indicates efficacy of onion cultivars towards reducing the water use by 7 8 37 5 44 8 46 9 47 8 49 5 and 60 7 with b super b kiran b raj b sweta b safed b local and b shubra respectively in fig 5 if we marked the area between the points of maximum wp 16 0 18 9 kg m 3 on x axis and their corresponding values of aw 39 2 48 7 cm on y axis could be the most economic zone for farmers views here all the onion cultivars able to produce more bulb yields per monetary unit spent of aw similar curvilinear second degree quadratic relationships were obtained between wp and aw in squash igbaduna et al 2015 and onion el hady et al 2015 reveals efficient utilisation of applied water by the crop that improved the wp contrarily others showed that wp decreased linearly with related seasonal water deficits for different onion cultivars mubarak and hamdan 2018b abdelkhalik et al 2019 it was interpreted that white onion cultivars like b shubra and b safed with higher wp under medium to severe stress conditions although having comparatively lower yields should be preferred for further enhancing onion productivity in winter seasons this findings also supports our target of maximising wp while maintaining bulb quality rather than maximising yields within limited water resources in water scarce regions of deccan plateau 3 5 biochemical quality and antioxidant enzymes activity aoa consistent periodic changes in biochemical quality traits and antioxidant enzymes activities aoa of harvested onion bulbs are depicted in fig 6a h rr and dm were markedly increased with water deficit fig 6a b while white cultivars exhibited significantly higher rr 7 3 8 5 and dm 13 6 17 9 than those their respective values 6 7 7 9 and 11 16 3 of red cultivars increased rehydration capacity therefore shows lower degree of cellular damage and shrinkage thereby more dm content during drying by water deficit tadesse et al 2016 this phenomenon was further described by water stress greatly reduced the water accretion and air space between bulb cells particularly in white cultivars which in turn determined the dry matter accumulation liguori et al 2017 wakchaure et al 2018 bulb soluble solids of onion cultivars in various water stress regimes showed characteristic trend with first increase of 10 8 13 5 to 11 5 14 8 b in excess to optimum water level remained constant 11 4 14 7 to 10 9 14 5 b at low stress and at last reduced to 10 8 14 4 to 9 1 11 8 b under medium and severe stress fig 6c the initial rise and constant soluble solids trend could be attributed to translocation of starch into sugars kowitcharoen et al 2018 these results are in agreement with ge et al 2014 and taha et al 2019 who reported that optimum level of irrigation maintained at growing season notably enhanced soluble solids since it contributes less to osmotic adjustment of plants later reducing trend indicate the being a compatible solute soluble solids could be utilised to lowering cell osmotic potential generate positive pressures and retained a huge metabolic energy to initiate ionic movement thereby extracting water from dry soils and maintaining leaf cell turgor under medium and severe stress chaves et al 2003 further maximum differences 2 6 3 6 b in soluble solids amongst cultivars over water stress regimes 1 2 2 4 b endorsed the selection of appropriate cultivars could have larger beneficial effects in improving bulb sweetness of onion grown in water scarce environment overall soluble solids of white cultivars improved by 11 3 16 0 as compared to red cultivars specifying their better utility in processing industries while fresh consumption the highest soluble solids content found in b shubra 11 8 13 5 irrespective of water stress regimes rise in soluble solids mainly associated with glucose synthesis owing to larger accumulation photo assimilates in fruits bulbs compared with rest of other plant organs as identified by ho 1996 in tomato and abbas et al 2020 in onion under water deficits abbas et al 2020 also defined the similar soluble solids variations in bulbs between the different onion cultivars contrary pejic et al 2011 reported the irrigation had significant effects on soluble solids with the corresponding s non significant differences between the onion cultivars in novi sad regions of serbia bulb ph is depends on the numerous factors like cultivars cultural practices and environmental conditions in fact ph values increased with soil moisture depletion under water deficits the highest ph recorded 5 7 6 0 with red cultivars particularly in local whereas lower values 5 6 5 8 were recorded with white cultivars throughout water stress regimes fig 5d these results are supported by klunklin and savage 2017 where authors detected significant difference of ph between tomato cultivars under well irrigated and water stress conditions these changes in bulb ph also highlighted higher amounts of malic pyruvic and citric acids in different landraces of onions liguori et al 2017 it is reported that under upholding water stress conditions protein accumulation increases under upholding water stress conditions vidya et al 2019 in this study also the protein content of bulbs enhanced by 16 4 19 7 under severe water deficits in all cultivars when compared with excess water conditions fig 6e similar to dm and soluble solids considerably higher protein content was observed in white cultivars compared with red cultivars this might be due to slightly deeper roots of white cultivars that regulates nutrients uptake for protein and polysaccharide syntheses under water stress conditions moreover soil moisture depletion may reduce transport of water but not the photo assimilates which might have served as precursors for the synthesis of proteins moutot et al 1986 zegbe et al 2006 total phenolic content tpc in bulbs having unique antioxidant capacity in scavenging ros griffiths et al 2002 fig 6f demonstrates the tpc concentrations of all onion cultivars were continuously increased from 2 3 3 4 to 5 6 7 0 mg ga equi g fw under excess to medium stress iw cpe 1 00 0 40 then remained constant 5 5 7 5 mg ga equi g fw at severe stress iw cpe 0 40 in this way tpc protect cells from potential oxidative damage enhanced cell membranes stability and mitigating oxidative stress injuries yiu et al 2009 activation of phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal could be main reason for accumulation of phenolic compounds under abiotic stresses rivero et al 2001 further tpc extracted from bulbs of red cultivars is significantly higher than the white of onions which was similar to earlier reports of kaur et al 2009 and lu et al 2011 maximum tpc was found in local b kiran and b raj indicates their potential to maintain bulb quality with high antioxidant content during long term storage for offseason consumption further higher tpc concentration imposes limit on demand for larger bulb size under water stress thus we optimised strategy of identifying potential onion cultivars tolerant to both excess and water deficits where concentration of tpc can be improved without much decrease in marketable bulb yields onions possess high antioxidants activity aoa generally increased during water stress conditions and in many cases level of antioxidant enzymes correlated with improved tolerance of cultivars csiszar et al 2007 this study also described superoxide dismutase sod and peroxidase pod activities increased with water deficits fig 6g h in reality water stress over exacerbates ros production responsible for oxidative damage at cellular level disrupts cellular membranes leads to enzyme inactivation protein degradation and ionic imbalance in plants it can be regulated or alleviated by actions of non enzymatic and enzymatic sod pod cat etc anti oxidant defence system hussain et al 2016 further aoa of superoxide dismutase sod and peroxidase pod enzymes markedly varied between onion cultivars the values of sod and pod averaged between 141 8 and 180 2 unit mg protein and 80 9 92 6 unit g fw for red cultivars and showed significantly low in 137 6 164 5 unit mg protein and 79 4 85 1 unit 100 g fw in white cultivars maximum improvement of sod and pod was seen in local b kiran and b raj particularly under medium and severe stress conditions similar up regulation of aoa in red cultivars sel 383 n 53 pusa red and sel 126 was determined by kaur et al 2009 than other white cultivars pusa white flat pusa white round and early grano cultivated in north indian conditions thus mechanism of ros production and its scavenging by high aoa was also associated with genetic variability and tolerance of plants to abiotic stress environments liguori et al 2017 hussain et al 2018 it can inferred integrative approach of identifications of anti oxidant rich cultivars and optimum water stress regimes could offer unique advantages in water saving improving yields and functional quality of bulbs for fresh consumptions processing and storage in water scarce environments 4 conclusions the impacts of deficit irrigation were quantified in terms of canopy growth indices bulb yields tby water productivity wp physical and chemical and functional quality traits of white and red onion cultivars tby and wp improved by 5 20 4 and 12 20 kg m 3 under medium and severe stress regimes iw cpe 0 0 0 59 in white cultivars while the values were maximum with iw cpe 0 80 i e 6 3 19 and 13 4 19 0 kg m 3 more than recommended in red cultivars the quadratic relation between wp and aw revealed that efficient utilisation of applied water by onion cultivars that improved wp under water deficits onion cultivars like b kiran b raj b sweta b safed b local and b shubra which required 37 61 less water to attain same wp as with recommended irrigation should be appropriate choice for efficient irrigation the improvement in bulb quality traits like dm soluble solids and protein content of white cultivars at medium deficit iw cpe 0 40 0 59 further indicates their suitability for processing industries conversely higher firmness tpc and anti oxidants activity aoa and optimum bulb size of red onion cultivars at medium water deficit iw cpe 0 40 0 59 should suit for storage purpose the better performance of local cultivar both for water deficit and water logging conditions points out the reason for its preferred choice by farmers of the area on the whole it is concluded that a shift to onion varieties like b shubra b raj and b kiran under medium deficit irrigation iw cpe 0 60 can help in considerable water saving and thus extending area under irrigation with same water supplies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10158,understanding and mitigating the adverse impacts of water stress on agriculture production have become global concern in water scarce environments particularly deccan plateau the largest semi arid zone of peninsular india is confronted with severe water resources conflicts and extensive pressure for food production under climate change scenario for sustainable agriculture it is critical to quantify the impact of water stress on major crops like winter onion allium cepa l which is grown under diverse water management practices on shallow basaltic soils of this region we conducted a field experiment during two growing seasons 2017 18 and 2018 19 for evaluating responses of different cultivars of red b raj b kiran b super b red and local fursangi and white b shubra b sweta and b safed onion to variable water stress created using a line source sprinkler lss system there was a 1 1 1 6 3 9 9 2 fold decline in total bulb yields tby with increasing water deficit i e when depth of irrigation water iw applied equalled 0 60 0 40 0 20 and 0 00 times the cumulative open pan evaporation cpe as compared with the recommended practice iw cpe 0 80 the tby increased between 86 2 and 106 6 mg ha 1 in red cultivars when irrigation was scheduled at excess to optimum water regimes iw cpe 0 80 1 00 while it was improved by 5 0 20 4 for white cultivars under medium 0 40 0 59 to severe 0 0 0 39 water deficit stress further highest 4 3 16 2 improvement in tby of local cultivar was reported irrespective to different water stress levels local and white cultivars could have better tolerance to water stress by keeping cooler canopy temperatures higher leaf relative water content and modulating the stomatal opening lower yield losses due to rotting 0 30 1 81 and splitting 4 4 6 5 of bulbs were observed in red and white cultivars this study further endorses the appropriate selection of onion cultivars reduces water requirements by 37 5 61 to attain similar water productivity 16 0 kg m 3 as with recommended irrigation level increased in water stress levels though reduced quality of physical traits of harvested bulbs viz mean weight average dia shape index si harvest index hi and firmness these improved the storage quality water deficit also increased accumulation of soluble solids total phenolics protein dry matter and elevated the ph and rehydration quality besides potentially affecting the enzymatic activity sod and pod of onion cultivars it was concluded that white onion cultivars like b shubra with higher wp under medium and severe water deficit stress and local red cultivar should be preferred for efficient utilisation of water resources both in terms of the productivity and post harvest quality of onion under drought prone and shallow basaltic regions

2017 there has been an apparent rise in frequency of droughts of varying duration and severity along with sub regional shift of monsoons mallya et al 2016 in addition to conflicts over water for other anthropogenic activities the evapotranspirational demands increase during drought periods and these ultimately lead to severe reductions in agricultural productivity and production vasu et al 2017 bej 2018 paul et al 2018 these conditions demand for a focus on maximising water productivity rather than yields of major crops which are cultivated over larger area with limited irrigation greaves and wang 2017 abdelkhalik et al 2019 onion is mainly cultivated in high to extremely high water stressed areas of india contributing 20 of world production particularly dp region alone contributes more than half of india s onion production where it is being cultivated both as rainfed and irrigated crop in monsoon and winter seasons respectively latter is preferred by onion growers for its superior storage quality and lesser incidences of diseases lawande et al 2009 however crops during this period are more vulnerable to water stress as a consequence of irregular and deficient precipitation and limitations of soil water supplies both with shallowness of basaltic soil constraining rooting depth and insufficient soil moisture from the previous rainy season these circumstances often lead to mid season water deficits resulting in decline in growth and overall productivity wakchaure et al 2018 thus provision for supplemental irrigation becomes obligatory to sustain crop growth its yield potential and quality since the region is constrained by limited ground and surface waters resources naik and awasthi 2003 arulbalaji and maya 2019 the objectives should be to optimise irrigation needs for maximising the water productivity and minimising the water deficits being shallow rooted crop onion requires light and frequent irrigations khokhar 2018 even the low water stress impacts its photosynthesis and other physiological mechanisms both at intracellular and the whole plant level often leading to reduced growth bulb yields and overall productivity ghodke et al 2018 abdelkhalik et

pelter et al 2004 dhumal et al 2007 abbey and joyce 2008 jimenez et al 2010 recently bhagyawant et al 2015 reported that deficit irrigation 20 less applied at bulb development did not affect the growth cumulative weight losses rooting sprouting and physiological weight and bulb yield the overall inferences are that selection of region specific cultivars and efficient irrigation strategies can lead to water savings while sustaining onion yields amongst different strategies deficit irrigation di is an effective practice to reduce irrigation water and increase water productivity wp because plants can reduce their leaf transpiration and soil evaporation to minimise water consumption yang et al 2020 it also known for minimising adverse effects of water stress on crop yields via inducing water extraction from relatively lower soil depth farag 2019 zayton 2007 and patel and rajput 2013 reported improvements in onion yields with di but it is yet to be adapted commercially ortola and knox 2014 wakchaure et al 2018 particularly its feasibility need to be established for shallow root crops like onion keeping the above in view experiments were conducted with the specific objectives of i quantifying the impact of water deficits on canopy traits bulb yield and quality of white and red onions in shallow basaltic soils and water scarce zone of dp region and ii to develop water production functions for different red and white onion cultivars by inducing variable stress levels with deficit irrigation regimes 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site soil and meteorological

combinations i e eight onion cultivars in main plots and six irrigation regimes in subplots created artificially using line source sprinkler lss the details of experimental treatments are described in table 2 the configured lss produces uniform irrigation application rate along the mainline which linearly decreases in perpendicular direction from the source thus maximum 17 mm water was distributed in nearby subplots to the mainline and the minimum was 0 3 0 5 mm h 1 in last subplots located at distance of 12 5 15 m the experimental layout of usable area 30 m 30 m and its allocation into main plots 12 m 1 5 m along with lss is given fig 2 further individual main plot was separated by 0 5 m distance into six subplots 2 5 m 1 5 m the detailed specifications of lss plot irrigation system have been given earlier by wakchaure et al 2016 the amount of water applied cm in each irrigation was quantified by measuring depth of irrigation water iw collected in series of cylindrical pvc catch canes 19 5 cm height 10 cm dia placed at centre of each subplots the details of quantities of iw and days of irrigation applied in onion during two consecutive onion growth periods have given in table 3 moreover water stress levels produced under irrigation regimes at iw cpe of 1 00 0 81 0 80 0 79 0 60 0 59 0 40 and 0 39 0 00 were classified as excess optimum low medium and severe stress respectively the seed materials of most popular three white onion cultivars i e bhima b shubra b sweta and b safed and five red onion cultivars i e b raj b kiran b super b red local as selected for experiments were obtained from icar directorate of onion and garlic pune and onion growers nearby to icar niasm baramati the local cultivar fursangi chosen for experiment is very popular in the region for tender onions the beds for transplanting were prepared after subsequent rotavator operations to pulverise the soil onion seedlings 40 days old of onion cultivars were transplanted on 20th and 23th november in 2017 and 2018 keeping row and plant spacing as 15 cm and 10 cm respectively two common irrigations were applied initially with interval of 21 days to ensure the better seedling establishment recommended doses of n p and k fertilisers were applied basal dose consisted of 110 kg n 40 kg p2o5 and 40 kg k2o ha 1 while rest 110 kg n was top dressed in two splits at 40 and 60 days after transplanting dat the onion bulbs were harvested at physiological maturity in approximately 135 dat during both seasons 2 3 soil and canopy traits yields and water productivity wp the different canopy traits viz plant height canopy air temperature difference catd leaf relative water content rwc and normalised difference vegetative index ndvi reflects relationship between plant water status and soil water deficit were measured from the 35 days after transplanting dat onwards with 25 days interval average plant height cm was measured from ground surface to the tip of the longest leaf of three randomly selected onion plants in individual subplots abdissa et al 2011 mean catd ºc was monitored in each subplot using handheld infrared thermometer agri therm iii 6210 l everest interscience inc usa as the average of three readings recorded from different plants these were recorded by holding device at an angle of 30 from the horizontal at right angle to sample row for viewing only plant canopy area between 13 00 and 15 00 h likewise the leaf relative water content rwc was estimated by standard method cited by tanentzap et al 2015 the ndvi simplest indicator interpreted the crop vigour greenness was measured by using handheld portable green seeker sensor trimble spltech pvt ltd india the bulbs were harvested manually after rolling operation performed at physiological maturity when at least 80 of total plants showed yellowing of leaves at harvest the total bulb yields mg ha 1 on fresh weight basis fwb was computed similarly marketable bulb yield mg ha 1 fwb was determined after discarding splitted centred and rotten bulbs from each subplots the splitted centred and rotted bulbs obtained in each subplot were weighed separately and expressed in per cent losses reference to normal bulbs weight total above ground biomass and soil moisture content were estimated by gravimetric method after drying in a hot air oven at 70 c and 105 c for 24 h respectively gardner et al 2001 the readings of total above ground biomass were taken at harvest from each subplots while each soil moisture reading is the average of the three observations recorded at 0 25 m depth in replication wise after 4 days of each irrigation and the time of harvesting of onion cultivars in both years water productivity wp kg m3 was computed according to zhao et al 2017 as expressed as ratio of total bulb yields tby to total water applied that includes iw and precipitation received during entire onion growing periods 2 4 bulb quality attributes and biochemical analysis the harvest index hi mean bulb weight g geometric mean bulb diameter dgm mm and shape index si was measured as per methods suggested by abdissa et al 2011 and dabhi and patel 2017 for 10 randomly selected onion samples after harvesting in each subplots bulb firmness indicated in term of penetration force g was measured by performing puncture test on the equatorial bulb diameter using a texture analyser model ta hd plus stable micro systems uk the leaves and roots of freshly harvested onion bulbs from the respective treatments were trimmed and shifted to lab for analysing the biochemical and functional quality characteristics the bulbs were dressed by tap water for removing the outer dry layer sliced into smaller pieces 3 5 mm and were mixed uniformly to get a representative sample the rehydration ratio and dry matter were measured by methods suggested by ranganna 2002 and sharma and lee 2016 respectively the soluble solids brix and ph of bulb tissues measurement was carried out with a portable digital refractometer erma japan and ph metre pc 700 eutech respectively total protein content mg g f w and total phenolics mg gae equi g f w in the bulb tissues were computed using lowry s method lowry et al 1951 and folin ciocalteu method radicetti et al 2016 respectively the superoxide dismutase unit mg protein and peroxidase unit 100 g fw activities in bulb tissue samples were quantified according to beauchamp and fridovich 1971 and chen and asada 1989 respectively 2 5 statistical analysis data from field experiments were statistically analysed using sas software ver 9 3 to study the water deficit stress impacts on canopy bulb yields and quality parameters of different onion cultivars statistical significance between onion cultivars cvs and their interaction with water stress ws iw cpe regimes in two years year was done by individual and combined analysis of variance since larger differences in ws regimes gomez and gomez 1984 however attention should be given to analyse small differences among adjoining irrigation regimes as the statistical analyses of ws effect are not strictly valid since ws applied thoroughly without randomisation in lss rao et al 2013 least significant differences lsd at p 0 05 were computed using student s t and duncan tests for comparing group means similarly periodic changes in canopy traits and biochemical characteristics at harvest were analysed in triplicates n 3 and data were expressed as mean with standard errors in excel plots 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of canopy traits for onion cultivars in water stress the overall vegetative growth of both seasons 2017 18 and 2018 19 as reflected in terms of canopy traits viz plant height normalised difference vegetation index ndvi leaf relative water content rwc and canopy air temperature difference catd varied significantly among the onion cultivars and water deficits fig 4a d the plant height and ndvi increased initially and varied between 35 9 and 60 3 cm and 0 48 0 62 for different cultivars at 35 60 days after transplanting dat respectively thereafter it stabilised and later got reduced to 29 9 62 2 cm and 0 14 0 57 until harvest leaf rwc decreased linearly during the monitoring period of onion growth interestingly white b shubra b sweta and b safed and local cultivars sustained comparatively higher plant height ndvi and leaf rwc than those of other red cultivars after bulb development stage indicating their better tolerance to water deficits fig 4a b d this also indicates that the white and local genotype supplied robust photo protective system against water stress when compared with other red genotypes these dissimilarities in different canopy growth traits among onion cultivars were strongly associated with their genetic makeup light interception ability photoperiod and temperature in growing degree days and adaptability to abiotic environmental conditions tesfay et al 2011 hanci and cebeci 2014 marino and alvino 2015 further the canopy growth was impacted by water stress e g plant height ndvi and leaf rwc at 85 dat were reduced from 64 1 cm 0 61 80 5 at iw cpe 1 0 respectively to 46 1 cm 0 37 and 52 5 under unirrigated conditions after initial common irrigations this was obviously due to non replenishment of water from depleted soil under water deficits regimes fig 2 major differences in vegetative growth were monitored until 35 60 dat and thereafter these were reduced considerably it endorses the ability of onion to retrieve against the adverse impact water stress in initial phases if cell multiplication and growth are not affected in the consequent stages as demonstrated by zheng et al 2013 the maximum differences of rwc 27 8 28 and ndvi 0 24 0 27 were noticed at 85 110 dat followed by in plant height 27 30 6 cm at 110 135 dat indicating highest sensitivity of onion to bulb development stage under water deficit until harvest this was related to reduction in chlorophyll content lower cell expansion and restricted root nutrient water uptake from soils that arrested crop growth via limited photosynthesis assani et al 2009 abdelkhalik et al 2019 yaser et al 2020 conversely catd improved upon growth and development of onion cultivars fig 4c the positive catd values reported at 77 85 103 and 108 dat for red cultivars viz b red b super b kiran and b raj respectively while catd remained negative 1 5 to 0 5 even after 110 dat for white b shubra and b safed and local cultivars indicating efficacy to better water usage via maintaining higher leaf rwc 52 6 68 3 moreover the maximum differences in catd 2 7 6 3 observed at different growth stages 60 110 dat signifying catd could be a vital factor for selection and identification of water stress tolerant onion cultivars these further indicate the ability of white and local cultivars for improving growth and bulb yields by maintenance of cooler canopy temperatures under water deficit al ghzawi et al 2018 reported similar trends of catd an indication of efficient transpiration in cooling leaves of different cultivars based on moisture content in leaf tissues under water stress environments the negative catd 0 5 to 7 6 at 60 dat shows that no water stress up to bulb initiation stage in all water regimes further catd improved to become positive at 63 79 82 104 117 and 124 dat for water stress regimes with iw cpe 0 00 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 1 00 representing commencement of water stress as result of limited water uptake from bulb development stage onwards this was also evidenced by lower leaf rwc 55 65 that controls the transpiration rate via maintaining higher canopy temperature under water deficit al ghzawi et al 2018 and parkash and singh 2020 demonstrated that how best variability in canopy temperature trends could be utilised for indicating plant water stress since its strongly correlated with transpiration rate midday leaf water potential stomatal conductance water usage and crop yields 3 2 total bulb yields marketable bulb yields and yield losses total bulb yields tby marketable bulb yields mby and yield losses for different cultivars and water stress regimes are summarised in table 4 and table 5 in both years onion bulb yield trends remained almost similar for different cultivars but their comparative values were significantly higher in 2017 18 than 2018 19 this was obviously due to relatively lower leaf evapotranspiration cooler and calm weather conditions as experienced by crop in 2017 18 particularly during 70 110 dat that were congenial to bulb development in onions table 1 zheng et al 2013 and lovelli et al 2017 earlier highlighted the metrological conditions markedly influenced the yields and quality of vegetable crops grown in water scarce regions of northwest china and mediterranean environments in pooled data both tby and mby values were significantly higher in local red genotype than the other onion cultivars among other red cultivars highest bulb yields were observed in b raj followed by b kiran b super and b red respectively same trends of yield variation were noted in white cultivars i e b shubra produced more bulb yield than b sweta and b safed these results corroborate with previous findings of abdel and al juboori 2006 who manifested highest growth and yield responses in local red cultivar over other white and red cultivars while comparing the effect of water stress the averaged tby and mby were declined with increasing water deficits the maximum bulb yields were observed between 0 80 and 1 00 iw cpe further individual and pooled analyses indicates the bulb yields obtained under excess 0 81 1 00 and optimum 0 80 water stress regimes were almost at par during both years 2017 18 and 2018 19 when referenced to maximum averaged tby 91 4 mg ha 1 relative bulb yields rby were 0 88 0 61 0 26 and 0 11 at iw cpe 0 60 0 40 0 20 and 0 00 respectively in other words tby were declined to 1 14 1 64 3 91 9 23 folds with increasing water deficit against the recommended optimum water level iw cpe 0 80 owing to limited supply of soil moisture under water stress conditions fig 3 similar yields responses to water deficit in red hot pepper and potato using lss have been reported by gencoglan et al 2006 and motalebifard 2019 this results of yield declination is in agreements with the analysed canopy growth dynamics which was highly influenced by limited water supply at development and bulbification stages leading to restricted cell multiplication and expansion and stomatal control in response to water stress bhatt et al 2006 further lisar et al 2013 and silva díaz et al 2020 reported the water stress damages photosynthetic apparatus inhibits chlorophyll synthesis lowers photosynthetic carbon assimilation and disrupts electron transport cycle in plants and thus reduced overall yields and productivity the interaction effects of onion cultivars and water stress regimes were also significant interestingly local and red onion cultivars performed better under excess water stress conditions local genotype was more tolerant in improving tby 19 0 under excess water conditions followed by b raj b super b red and b kiran where overall tby enhancement were 17 0 11 5 7 3 and 6 3 respectively over white cultivars conversely white onion cultivars were superior under water deficit conditions particularly cultivars b safed and b sweta were more effective in mitigating the adverse impact of water stress in medium and severe water deficits e g rby with iw cpe 0 40 were 3 6 and 12 9 for b sweta and b safed whereas enhancement at iw cpe 0 20 was 25 8 19 2 and 15 1 with b shubra b safed and b sweta respectively this indicates that the local and white cultivars have ability to extract soil moisture from lower layer under water deficits conditions due to its comparatively deeper and unbranched root system than fibrous and shallow roots of other red cultivars bailey et al 2002 ortola and knox 2014 overall crop tolerance to water scarcity is determined by multiple factors viz genotype sensitivity environment and plant biochemical mechanisms that increases water nutrients uptake chloroplast functionality photo assimilates translocation and source sink homoeostasis to improved yields ohashil et al 2000 toscano et al 2019 splitting and rotting behaviour of onion cultivars accountable for yield losses across water stress regimes were expressed in terms of percentage of splitted centred and rotten bulbs in table 5 yield losses due to rotten bulbs were significantly higher in white cultivars particularly at larger water regimes iw cpe 0 80 1 00 indicating their high vulnerability to excess water stress since surplus moisture accumulated in onion bulbs increases rotting losses with increased irrigation thresholds bhagyawant et al 2015 sidhu et al 2019 contrary highest percentage of splitted centred bulbs were found in red cultivars generally minimum yield losses owing to rotting 0 3 1 8 and splitting 4 4 6 5 of bulbs were observed in red and white cultivars irrespective to water stress respectively especially local and b shubra were onion cultivars which had smallest percentage of rotten 0 30 and di centred 4 4 bulbs respectively interestingly both splitted centred 18 1 and rotten bulbs 10 8 were significantly higher in b red specifying its sensitivity to water stress percentage of splitted centred bulbs increased with water deficit with average improvement equalled to 4 8 6 8 9 1 10 8 14 0 and 16 2 when water stress imposed at iw cpe 1 0 0 80 0 40 0 20 and 0 0 respectively similar trend of bulbs splitting was reported by pelter et al 2004 in onion grown during water scarce regions 3 3 physical quality of onion bulbs the physical quality which has important bearing on transportation marketability and storage of onion is usually expressed in terms of harvest index hi bulb firmness and size matrices mean bulb weight average bulb diameter and shape index these parameters were significantly different for both cultivars and water stress regimes table 6 being an important measure of reproductive efficiency and quality hi values 0 960 0 964 remained almost stable or rather improved with excess and optimum water stress regimes while it got reduced from 0 96 to 0 92 with water deficits these findings inferred with previous reports of hegde 1986 that the hi increased from 0 66 to 0 72 for onion grown in water deficits further our results differed from abdelkhalik et al 2019 who demonstrated the hi 0 84 0 85 were not affected by deficit irrigation strategy for onion cultivated in mediterranean conditions hi varied between 0 93 and 0 96 for different cultivars while the highest variability in hi was found among red cultivars over white cultivars these differences in hi were largely dependent on genetic variation within cultivars which distinguished crop yield response by altering assimilate allocation between roots and shoot in response to water deficits nakhforoosh et al 2015 in two years pooled data the mean bulb weight and bulb diameter dgm were declined to almost one fifth and three fifths respectively similarly shape index si and penetration force an indicators of bulbs firmness were reduced with increasing water deficits particularly penetration force reduced to half under severe water deficits iw cpe 0 40 overall lower values of these indices in excess stress iw cpe 0 80 indicating inferior bulb quality than those of optimum irrigations contrary maxima of these indices were obtained between optimum to low water stress conditions iw cpe 0 60 0 80 indicates superior bulbs quality similar declinations in mean bulb weight geometric diameter and shape index with water restrictions owing to shallow roots of onions were noticed by abdelkhalik et al 2019 and mubarak and hamdan 2018a in water scarce environment significant variations in mean bulb weight dgm and si were monitored between different onion cultivars the interaction effects of onion cultivars and water stress regimes were also significant the maximum bulbs weight 151 4 g dgm 64 9 mm and penetration force 2092 g were recorded with local red cultivar defining its highest water stress tolerant than others cultivars the higher bulb firmness and lower si values represents higher sphericity of bulbs in red cultivars indicates their utility for long terms bulb storage over white cultivars amongst white cultivars b shubra produced superior quality of onion bulbs under water stress and its corresponding values of quality indices were almost at par with red onion cultivars similar trends of variation in bulb size and other quality attributes for different onion varieties cultivated under water stress regimes were reported by bhatt et al 2006 obviously differential photosynthetic responses stomatal conductance osmatic adjustment and genetic makeup of different cultivars altered crop yields and quality under varied agronomic water and post harvest management practices mallor et al 2011 sekara et al 2017 3 4 relationship of water productivity onion cultivars and water stress regimes water productivity wp of onion differed with cultivars across the water stress regimes when averaged for two years 2017 19 as shown in fig 5 interestingly wp increased initially from 12 1 to 19 0 kg m 3 under excess to optimum water levels remained maximum and stable 16 2 20 2 kg m 3 under medium stress and then reduced drastically from 19 3 to 8 2 kg m 3 under severe stress conditions amongst onion cultivars highest increase in wp 14 9 19 2 kg m 3 was recorded in local and b raj under excess and optimum water levels in b shubra and local 20 2 kg m 3 under medium and then in b shubra and b safed 13 5 19 3 kg m 3 under severe water deficits respectively overall in terms of wp red cultivars 13 4 19 0 kg m 3 were found superior under excess and optimum water level while white onion cultivars 12 1 20 2 kg m 3 were performed better under medium to severe stress conditions this was obviously due to higher drought tolerant of white cultivars increases wp while the drought sensitivity of red cultivars decreases wp under water deficit conditions the similar characteristics trend of wue was investigated by boutraa et al 2010 in wheat cultivars under water stress conditions of saudi arabia the values of wp obtained under this study were within range of 9 2 15 9 kg m 3 with those obtained in ethiopia ramalan et al 2010 the relationship between wp onion cultivars and water stress regimes was developed by plotting the average yields against the total applied water aw in both seasons 2017 19 the quadratic equations r2 0 69 0 82 best defined relationship between average wp and seasonal aw when referred to maximum wp 16 0 kg m 3 computed at 48 7 cm with b red the same could be accomplished with aw equalling to 44 9 30 4 26 9 25 9 25 4 24 6 and 19 1 cm with b super b kiran b raj b sweta b safed b local and b shubra respectively this indicates efficacy of onion cultivars towards reducing the water use by 7 8 37 5 44 8 46 9 47 8 49 5 and 60 7 with b super b kiran b raj b sweta b safed b local and b shubra respectively in fig 5 if we marked the area between the points of maximum wp 16 0 18 9 kg m 3 on x axis and their corresponding values of aw 39 2 48 7 cm on y axis could be the most economic zone for farmers views here all the onion cultivars able to produce more bulb yields per monetary unit spent of aw similar curvilinear second degree quadratic relationships were obtained between wp and aw in squash igbaduna et al 2015 and onion el hady et al 2015 reveals efficient utilisation of applied water by the crop that improved the wp contrarily others showed that wp decreased linearly with related seasonal water deficits for different onion cultivars mubarak and hamdan 2018b abdelkhalik et al 2019 it was interpreted that white onion cultivars like b shubra and b safed with higher wp under medium to severe stress conditions although having comparatively lower yields should be preferred for further enhancing onion productivity in winter seasons this findings also supports our target of maximising wp while maintaining bulb quality rather than maximising yields within limited water resources in water scarce regions of deccan plateau 3 5 biochemical quality and antioxidant enzymes activity aoa consistent periodic changes in biochemical quality traits and antioxidant enzymes activities aoa of harvested onion bulbs are depicted in fig 6a h rr and dm were markedly increased with water deficit fig 6a b while white cultivars exhibited significantly higher rr 7 3 8 5 and dm 13 6 17 9 than those their respective values 6 7 7 9 and 11 16 3 of red cultivars increased rehydration capacity therefore shows lower degree of cellular damage and shrinkage thereby more dm content during drying by water deficit tadesse et al 2016 this phenomenon was further described by water stress greatly reduced the water accretion and air space between bulb cells particularly in white cultivars which in turn determined the dry matter accumulation liguori et al 2017 wakchaure et al 2018 bulb soluble solids of onion cultivars in various water stress regimes showed characteristic trend with first increase of 10 8 13 5 to 11 5 14 8 b in excess to optimum water level remained constant 11 4 14 7 to 10 9 14 5 b at low stress and at last reduced to 10 8 14 4 to 9 1 11 8 b under medium and severe stress fig 6c the initial rise and constant soluble solids trend could be attributed to translocation of starch into sugars kowitcharoen et al 2018 these results are in agreement with ge et al 2014 and taha et al 2019 who reported that optimum level of irrigation maintained at growing season notably enhanced soluble solids since it contributes less to osmotic adjustment of plants later reducing trend indicate the being a compatible solute soluble solids could be utilised to lowering cell osmotic potential generate positive pressures and retained a huge metabolic energy to initiate ionic movement thereby extracting water from dry soils and maintaining leaf cell turgor under medium and severe stress chaves et al 2003 further maximum differences 2 6 3 6 b in soluble solids amongst cultivars over water stress regimes 1 2 2 4 b endorsed the selection of appropriate cultivars could have larger beneficial effects in improving bulb sweetness of onion grown in water scarce environment overall soluble solids of white cultivars improved by 11 3 16 0 as compared to red cultivars specifying their better utility in processing industries while fresh consumption the highest soluble solids content found in b shubra 11 8 13 5 irrespective of water stress regimes rise in soluble solids mainly associated with glucose synthesis owing to larger accumulation photo assimilates in fruits bulbs compared with rest of other plant organs as identified by ho 1996 in tomato and abbas et al 2020 in onion under water deficits abbas et al 2020 also defined the similar soluble solids variations in bulbs between the different onion cultivars contrary pejic et al 2011 reported the irrigation had significant effects on soluble solids with the corresponding s non significant differences between the onion cultivars in novi sad regions of serbia bulb ph is depends on the numerous factors like cultivars cultural practices and environmental conditions in fact ph values increased with soil moisture depletion under water deficits the highest ph recorded 5 7 6 0 with red cultivars particularly in local whereas lower values 5 6 5 8 were recorded with white cultivars throughout water stress regimes fig 5d these results are supported by klunklin and savage 2017 where authors detected significant difference of ph between tomato cultivars under well irrigated and water stress conditions these changes in bulb ph also highlighted higher amounts of malic pyruvic and citric acids in different landraces of onions liguori et al 2017 it is reported that under upholding water stress conditions protein accumulation increases under upholding water stress conditions vidya et al 2019 in this study also the protein content of bulbs enhanced by 16 4 19 7 under severe water deficits in all cultivars when compared with excess water conditions fig 6e similar to dm and soluble solids considerably higher protein content was observed in white cultivars compared with red cultivars this might be due to slightly deeper roots of white cultivars that regulates nutrients uptake for protein and polysaccharide syntheses under water stress conditions moreover soil moisture depletion may reduce transport of water but not the photo assimilates which might have served as precursors for the synthesis of proteins moutot et al 1986 zegbe et al 2006 total phenolic content tpc in bulbs having unique antioxidant capacity in scavenging ros griffiths et al 2002 fig 6f demonstrates the tpc concentrations of all onion cultivars were continuously increased from 2 3 3 4 to 5 6 7 0 mg ga equi g fw under excess to medium stress iw cpe 1 00 0 40 then remained constant 5 5 7 5 mg ga equi g fw at severe stress iw cpe 0 40 in this way tpc protect cells from potential oxidative damage enhanced cell membranes stability and mitigating oxidative stress injuries yiu et al 2009 activation of phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal could be main reason for accumulation of phenolic compounds under abiotic stresses rivero et al 2001 further tpc extracted from bulbs of red cultivars is significantly higher than the white of onions which was similar to earlier reports of kaur et al 2009 and lu et al 2011 maximum tpc was found in local b kiran and b raj indicates their potential to maintain bulb quality with high antioxidant content during long term storage for offseason consumption further higher tpc concentration imposes limit on demand for larger bulb size under water stress thus we optimised strategy of identifying potential onion cultivars tolerant to both excess and water deficits where concentration of tpc can be improved without much decrease in marketable bulb yields onions possess high antioxidants activity aoa generally increased during water stress conditions and in many cases level of antioxidant enzymes correlated with improved tolerance of cultivars csiszar et al 2007 this study also described superoxide dismutase sod and peroxidase pod activities increased with water deficits fig 6g h in reality water stress over exacerbates ros production responsible for oxidative damage at cellular level disrupts cellular membranes leads to enzyme inactivation protein degradation and ionic imbalance in plants it can be regulated or alleviated by actions of non enzymatic and enzymatic sod pod cat etc anti oxidant defence system hussain et al 2016 further aoa of superoxide dismutase sod and peroxidase pod enzymes markedly varied between onion cultivars the values of sod and pod averaged between 141 8 and 180 2 unit mg protein and 80 9 92 6 unit g fw for red cultivars and showed significantly low in 137 6 164 5 unit mg protein and 79 4 85 1 unit 100 g fw in white cultivars maximum improvement of sod and pod was seen in local b kiran and b raj particularly under medium and severe stress conditions similar up regulation of aoa in red cultivars sel 383 n 53 pusa red and sel 126 was determined by kaur et al 2009 than other white cultivars pusa white flat pusa white round and early grano cultivated in north indian conditions thus mechanism of ros production and its scavenging by high aoa was also associated with genetic variability and tolerance of plants to abiotic stress environments liguori et al 2017 hussain et al 2018 it can inferred integrative approach of identifications of anti oxidant rich cultivars and optimum water stress regimes could offer unique advantages in water saving improving yields and functional quality of bulbs for fresh consumptions processing and storage in water scarce environments 4 conclusions the impacts of deficit irrigation were quantified in terms of canopy growth indices bulb yields tby water productivity wp physical and chemical and functional quality traits of white and red onion cultivars tby and wp improved by 5 20 4 and 12 20 kg m 3 under medium and severe stress regimes iw cpe 0 0 0 59 in white cultivars while the values were maximum with iw cpe 0 80 i e 6 3 19 and 13 4 19 0 kg m 3 more than recommended in red cultivars the quadratic relation between wp and aw revealed that efficient utilisation of applied water by onion cultivars that improved wp under water deficits onion cultivars like b kiran b raj b sweta b safed b local and b shubra which required 37 61 less water to attain same wp as with recommended irrigation should be appropriate choice for efficient irrigation the improvement in bulb quality traits like dm soluble solids and protein content of white cultivars at medium deficit iw cpe 0 40 0 59 further indicates their suitability for processing industries conversely higher firmness tpc and anti oxidants activity aoa and optimum bulb size of red onion cultivars at medium water deficit iw cpe 0 40 0 59 should suit for storage purpose the better performance of local cultivar both for water deficit and water logging conditions points out the reason for its preferred choice by farmers of the area on the whole it is concluded that a shift to onion varieties like b shubra b raj and b kiran under medium deficit irrigation iw

10159,mongolian pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantations have ecological significance for desertification control and degraded land restoration in drought induced regions to date knowledge about the dynamics of transpiration and canopy stomatal conductance g s of mongolian pine in the semiarid deserts in northern china is quite limited thus better understanding its physical response to environmental factors and exploring the mechanisms of forest transpiration can offer a theoretical basis for a reasonable tree planting program in semi arid regions in this study transpiration and g s changes in mongolian pine plantations for a mature forest mmpp half mature forest hmpp and young forest ympp were obtained using sap flow observations while simultaneously monitoring the atmospheric

sensitivity for stomatal regulation than hmpp and the maximum g s was found in trees with both small and large tree diameters at breast height therefore mmpp and ympp were suspected to vary based on

decoupling dimensionless coefficient water regulation 1 introduction a combination of different types of anthropogenic uses of the land such as deforestation over cultivation urbanization wildland fire and adverse climate variations like drying and droughts has resulted in the degradation of semi arid lands worldwide huang et al 2015 2016 china has been challenged by desertification over vast areas approximately 2 61 billion ha because of the large human population and limited natural resources zheng et al 2012 song et al 2020 in the middle of the 20th century about 70 dust storms occurred leading to soil erosion in the mu us desert geo location of 107 20 111 30 e 37 30 39 20 n eventually affecting the lives of the people in northern china deng et al 2015 desertification developed rapidly in the mu us desert while marginal areas in the east and south were restored to some extent the mu us desert was defined as an agro pastoral transitional zone and the landscapes of this area changed significantly during the period from the 1950 s to the 1990 s wu and ci 2002 due to the overgrazing and overcutting in mu us sandy land shifting sandy land and semi fixed sandy land covered 45 and 21 respectively by the late 1990s wu and ci 2002 the horqin desert 118 35 123 30 e 42 21 42 21 n is also a major source of sand drift in northern china zheng et al 2012 the major form of sandy desertification in this area is the evolution of shifted dunes into semi fixed dunes soil degradation can be explained by vegetation deterioration and the limitation of water resources precipitation canopy interception and ground water supplement song et al 2017a 2017b in recent decades soil restoration and sand transformation methods such as mechanical sand barriers bo et al 2015 biological soil crust li et al 2011 and afforestation jiang et al 2006 deng et al 2018 2020 song et al 2020 have been carried out in the mu us and horqin deserts the latter indicates that afforestation is an effective method of wind prevention water conservation and microclimate adjustment zeng et al 2009 these artificial plantations have been successfully established in the interests of desertification control and to provide timber production in the mu us and horqin deserts as a feasible method of environmental management chen et al 2006 mongolian pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica is a main shelterbelt tree species on desert that is naturally distributed in the northern sandy plain areas of china 121 11 127 10 e 50 10 53 33 n and parts of russia and mongolia 118 00 130 08 e 46 30 53 59 n and its vertical distribution is in the range of approximately 1500 m above sea level asl deng 2020 p sylvestris has been largely introduced to northern china because of its advantages such as wind sheltering and drought resistance guo et al 2020 to date the coverage area of planted forest on desert is 7 0 105 ha in the northern part of china although the artificial plantations have adapted well declining phenomena such as unexpectedly slow growth and dieback have been found in the early stage of mongolian pine growth song et al 2016 these problems have raised serious concerns and researchers have pointed out that the main reason for the massive degeneration of p sylvestris is the large water consumption for transpiration by this tree species and the limitations of natural rainfall conditions in the region zhu et al 2008 song et al 2017a 2017b precipitation is intercepted by the canopy and the rest falls through into the ground and is absorbed by roots after which it is transpired and emitted to the atmosphere this constitutes a complete forest water cycle deutscher et al 2016 deng 2020 among these mechanisms transpiration accounts for the largest amount among the elements of water balance in a soil plant atmosphere continuum transpiration is vital to the survival of trees especially during the growing season and in regions of aridification hoelscher et al 2018 to date plant transpiration has been measured by various methods such as radioisotopes song et al 2017a 2017b lysimeters smith and allen 1996 and sap flow granier 1985 tie et al 2017 hoelscher et al 2018 however most of these techniques are expensive e g an isotope ratio mass spectrometer impracticable and may affect plant growth e g the water within the plant xylem has to be extracted and then subjected to stable isotope analysis to determine the water sources used by plants granier et al 1996 song et al 2020 among these the sap ﬂow method is superior to other methods for estimating tree transpiration because it is the most practical relatively inexpensive increasingly robust in features and can be extrapolated to stand scale granier et al 1996 xia et al 2008 bosch et al 2014 fuchs et al 2017 wang et al 2017 peters et al 2018 recently heat balance and thermal diffusion techniques have been widely used for continuous observation in sap flow studies and normal tree growth can be maintained throughout the growing season without damaging the tree samples edwards and warwick 1984 mcjannet et al 2007 qu et al 2007 furthermore accurate use of the penman monteith equation to estimate the canopy stomatal conductance g s is feasible smith and allen 1996 quentin et al 2011 naithani et al 2012 xu et al 2018 song et al 2020 which can provide a better understanding of the transpiration of plants in response to changing atmospheric and soil conditions through stomatal behavior xu et al 2018 in g s studies transpiration eco hydrological research indicates that plants

which trigger stomatal opening or closure to maintain the survival of trees gutschick and simonneau 2002 zhang et al 2017 it is also noted that the dieback and decline of forests has accelerated in recent decades at the regional and continental scales as t a is continuously rising and models predict a sharp decline in the strength of the terrestrial carbon sink in the next 100 years adams et al 2013 even if precipitation p remains consistent to the historical patterns continuous warming associated extremes raise the possibilities of dieback through direct impacts on the autotrophic respiration of plants affecting the metabolism and indirect effects on g s via the impact of rising vpd on plant hydraulics mcdowell et al 2013 there are different water regulation strategies for plants to cope with the different climates and soil water regimes zeng et al 2009 xu et al 2013 thus it is of great importance to probe the mechanisms of plant water relations regulation and reveal the underlying mechanisms for plant breeding water use efficiency water balance and vegetation restoration in semiarid desert regions luo et al 2017 currently there are only few studies focusing on the g s of p sylvestris throughout the growing season in china song et al 2020 more information is needed regarding the calculation of the transpiration and g s of p sylvestris and their relationship with environmental factors in typical semi arid deserts mu us and horqin in northern china our specific goals were as follows i to quantify transpiration and estimate g s from sap flow observations of mongolian pine plantations by inverting the penman monteith equation ii to evaluate the characteristics of the decoupling conditions to better understand the transpiration and g s response to environmental changes and iii to probe into the mechanisms of plant water relations regulation via g s response to vpd on a seasonal and diurnal scale during these experiments sap flux in three different stands was measured section 2 1 the stands varied not only in age but also in climate and thus comparing the results across stands becomes difficult however in this paper the stand densities of p sylvestris of the mature mongolian pine plantation mmpp 280 trees ha 1 half of a mature mongolian pine plantation hmpp 1475 trees ha 1 and a young mongolian pine plantation ympp 850 trees ha 1 all conformed to the reasonable afforestation densities of p sylvestris within the range of 350 1500 and 900 trees ha 1 respectively based on the forest water balance forest age and the main meteorological factors according to previous studies deng et al 2017a 2017b ma et al 2017 song et al 2017a 2017b moreover in our experimental sites soil nutrient statuses were at normal levels organic content in mmpp hypp and ympp 2 50 0 32 2 81 0 41 and 3 00 0 23 total nitrogen content 0 093 0 016 1 06 0 021 and 1 12 0 019 respectively therefore environmental variables exerted no restriction on plant transpiration and thus the sap fluxes of p sylvestris may not be restricted to the forest management and confounding age effects in this study we hypothesized that 1 mmpp and hmpp would have higher transpiration rates compared with that of ympp due to their larger tree sizes while ympp would maintain a certain level of transpiration because the planted introduction region has a higher temperature and evaporative demand meanwhile for the conifer forest the canopy was relatively open air could circulate with little obstruction in windy conditions and thus we hypothesize that there is no vertical gradient in vpd throughout the canopy and that vpd was close to the leaf to air vapor pressure deficit naithani et al 2012 considering this we hypothesized that 2 p sylvestris are generally strongly coupled to the atmosphere furthermore based on previous studies plants growing in warmer drier climates e g higher par and et 0 can show enhanced stomatal closure along with an increasing air vapor pressure deficit poyatos et al 2007 song et al 2020 thus we hypothesized that 3 mmpp and ympp should exhibit highly sensitive stomatal conductance to vpd compared to that of hmpp these results could provide a greater understanding of the transpiration of p sylvestris and thus provide useful information for improving afforestation desertification and environmental protections in the semiarid deserts in northern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 introduction to study sites and species three different stand ages of mongolian pine plantations were surveyed in this study fig 1 study site a was the magu forestry station 123 32 n 124 26 n 42 33 e 43 29 e with an altitude of 457 m asl the area is dominated by a continental monsoon influenced semi arid climate with p around 500 mm most of the p occurs from june to september accounting for approximately 70 of annual p the annual evaporation is 1078 mm t a averages 7 9 c the frostless period is 136 d and w s averages 2 6 m s 1 the landscape is characterized by fixed sand dunes which are identified as dark brown forest soil and eolian sandy soil the existing vegetation includes p sylvestris pinus tabuliformis carrière and populus l study site b was the rare psammophytes protection botanical base which has a semi arid continental climate 109 42 54 e 108 20 11 n and elevation of 1250 m asl p averages 400 mm t a averages 8 1 c and annual evaporation is 1150 mm the landscape is characterized by fixed desert existing natural vegetation includes shrubs such as caragana korshinskii and hedysarum scoparium deng et al 2017b 2018 study site c was the ningxia yanchi research station of state forestry administration 106 300 e 107 410 e 37 04 n 38 10 n with an altitude of 1354 m asl the climate is a semi arid continental monsoon of the mid temperate zone the annual p averages 300 mm t a averages 8 3 c annual potential evaporation averages 1273 mm and w s averages 2 5 m s 1 soils are primarily dark loessial soil eolian sandy soil and sierozem soil gao et al 2014 deng et al 2015 mongolian pine is a geographical variety of scots pine pinus sylvestris l that is distributed in northeast asia it is classified into two ecotypes according to preferred habitat an ecotype adapted to mountain habitats and another adapted to fixed sand dunes kang et al 2004 the latter ecotype known as sandy land mongolian pine is restricted to a forest belt of ca 200 km in length and 14 20 km in width in the fixed sand dunes of ne china zhu et al 2003 this sandy land mongolian pine tree species was first introduced for sand fixation in the 1950s in the horqin sandy land of china because of its strong adaptation to deep sandy soils zeng et al 1996 zhu et al 2003 song et al 2018 its seedlings were widely cultivated in the zhanggutai region liaoning province of the southeastern horqin sandy region at that time these saplings were then widely distributed to the research centers related enterprises local authorities and tree growers of ne china including yulin city rare psammophytes protection botanical base in the southern mu us desert region thus in this study the seed sources of the mmpp hmpp and ympp plantations come from the same region of provenance 2 2 sap flow measurements sapwood area and leaf area index determination the sap flow observations were conducted from may 1st to october 20th the entire growing season in mmpp the stand age was 45 years and stand density was 280 trees ha 1 at study site a 2018 hmpp the stand age was 30 years and the stand density was 1475 trees ha 1 at study site b 2014 and ympp the stand age was 11 years and the stand density was 850 trees ha 1 at study site c 2011 these stands were intact and unaffected by human disturbance according to the distribution frequency of diameter at breast height surveyed in april before sap flow measurement dbh cm fig 2 the selection criteria were tree height height under living branches crown width and shape and growth conditions of the sample trees which were superior to those of the average trees in the plot nine nine and three tree samples were selected from mmpp hmpp and ympp table 1 respectively for the ympp stand only three tree samples were selected as there were slight growth trait differences between sampled individuals under the dbh of 0 5 cm model sgb25 gauges were applied to the sample trees and unlike in the tdp method there was no need to consider the azimuthal and radial variations in the sap flux of the trunk moreover during our analysis there were low degrees of variations in sap fluxes during the seasonal the coefficient of variation value was 5 3 and diurnal the coefficient of variation value was 7 0 observations thus these sampling numbers met our requirements sap flux densities j s g cm 2 s 1 were measured using granier type thermal dissipation probes granier 1985 1987 in mmpp and hmpp each sensor consisted of a pair of probes 20 mm long and 2 mm in diameter respectively and a copper constantan thermocouple was placed and inserted into the sapwood on the north facing side of the sampled trees at a height of 1 3 m of the stem above the ground granier 1987 du et al 2011 the upper probe included a heater with a constant power of 0 15 w and the lower probe was unheated similar to the reference james et al 2002 the probes were wrapped in waterproof silicone and covered with an aluminum box cover to prevent exposure to precipitation thermal influences from radiation and to avoid physical damage song et al 2020 the temperature difference between the upper and lower probes δt a c was measured every 10 s and 15 min averages were recorded on a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa with a multiplexer am16 32 a campbell scientific standard un calibrated j s were calculated per du et al 2011 and granier 1987 for mmpp and hmpp j s was calculated as 1 j s 0 0119 δ t a max δ t a δ t a 1 231 where δt a max c is the maximum temperature difference between the sensors when j s is close to 0 zhu et al 2003 tdp techniques require a period of zero flow in order to calculate sap flow from raw heat velocity or input data smith and allen 1996 grime and sinclair 1999 vandegehuchte and steppe 2013 δt a max was determined and used as a reference for the following day wieser et al 2014 and it occurred at times of zero flow according to the calibration equation determined by granier 1987 and that revalidated by others clearwater et al 1999 james et al 2002 in practice zero flow is also assumed to occur at night or at some designated period during the night regalado and ritter 2007 this assumption of zero sap fluxes seems reasonable as night time vapor pressure deficits were mostly low and temperature courses of the sensors reached equilibrium on most nights suggesting that refilling of internal reserves was complete wieser et al 2014 during our study nocturnal sap flow continued to occur but was nearly zero therefore there cannot be an a priori assumption that night time represents zero flow but this period still can be used for an accurate assessment of sap flow forster 2014 moreover in previous studies since there was one pair of probes per sampling tree the azimuthal and radial variations in sap flux were not taken into account within the studied trees in the present study zhang et al 2018 song et al 2020 model sgb25 gauges flow32 meters dynamax inc houston tx usa were applied to the stems of ympp data were recorded at 10 s intervals and stored as 15 min averages using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific yue et al 2008 deng et al 2015 we installed gauges on the base of the stems following the manufacturer s instruction dynamax 2009 and procedures reported by other similar studies allen and grime 1995 hall et al 1998 shb could continue to give off heat to plant stems in a continuous manner as its sensors are not affected by external interferences and the sap flow computations are maintained during all conditions with reasonable limits deng et al 2015 since the additional heat is properly accounted for in the energy balance the user does not need any special computation to compensate for these events yue et al 2008 in ymmp j s was calculated as 2 j s q f c p δ t where q f is the energy of the sap flow and c p is the specific heat of water 4 17 jg 1 steinberg et al 1990 the total tree water consumption kg d 1 was estimated directly by multiplying j s with the sapwood area sa cm2 the sap flux density of a single tree may have significant variability in a study on the general sap flow characteristics of a typical region therefore the sapwood area weighted average sap flux density of all the sample trees was used clausnitzer et al 2011 then the canopy transpiration related to the ground surface area e c mm d 1 was estimated by multiplying the average j s of all sample trees by the sapwood area index sai sapwood area per stand ground surface according to tie et al 2017 the sai values were 10 02 13 56 and 5 27 cm2 cm 2 in mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively the canopy transpiration per unit leaf area e l mm d 1 was estimated directly by dividing e c by the leaf area index lai m2 m 2 tang et al 2006 in mmpp the lai profile was estimated using an optical plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 li cor lincoln ne usa in hmpp the lai was measured with hemispherical canopy photography by taking photographs through a hemispherical fisheye lens of a nikon d4000 in ympp the lai was determined directly by taking a statistically significant sample of foliage from a plant canopy measuring the leaf area per sample plot and dividing it by the plot land surface area the lai values were 1 42 1 54 and 0 96 m2 m 2 in mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively to avoid damage to the sample trees in the surveyed plots another 15 50 and 26 trees of different diameter classes were surveyed based on the results from fig 2 around the plots in mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively and tree core samples were obtained using an increment borer dbh was measured 1 3 m above the ground using a dbh ruler gao et al 2015 here the relationships between sa and dbh were analyzed and the coefficient of determination r 2 was above 0 88 0 90 and 0 79 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 3 the total sa in the plot for mmpp 10 000 m2 hmpp 900 m2 and ympp 900 m2 was 99 000 27 141 and 1338 cm2 respectively the slope of sa vs dbh was significantly higher for mmpp than that for hmpp and ympp p 0 01 whereas the slopes of sa vs dbh did not differ for hmpp and ympp p 0 05 2 3 atmospheric and soil moisture measurements at study site a the automatic weather station was approximately 85 0 m from the studied plots the average t a c w s m s 1 p mm rh and par µmol m 2 s 1 were measured by the automatic weather station at a height of 15 0 m in the platform at study site b the meteorological data were collected using a water vapor flux tower which was 30 0 m high and located 75 0 m away from the surveyed plot the water vapor flux tower measured t a w s rh par barometric pressure and p campbell scientific p was collected at a height of 25 m and the other meteorological data were collected at a height of 14 m from the ground at study site c meteorological data were obtained using a meteorological monitoring station campbell scientific that measured vpd t a w s rh par and p the variables at all three sites were measured with the same frequency and recording time as the sap flow measurements in both study sites a and c soil profiles 0 100 cm were dug every 15 days and extra measurements were taken after each precipitation

wilting point cm3 cm 3 and θ f is the soil water content at field capacity cm3 cm 3 and their values were obtained by the cutting ring method xu et al 2011 the diurnal reference evapotranspiration et

addington et al 2004 roman et al 2015 one way anova was used to analyze the significant differences 0 01 and 0 05 levels in transpiration and canopy stomatal conductance dynamics among mmpp hmpp and

transpiration per unit ground area and canopy transpiration per unit leaf area all environmental factors indicated distinct but similar seasonal changes in mmpp hmpp and ympp the daily mean t a ranged from 5 47 to 27 43 c in mmpp 8 00 28 97 c in hmpp and 5 21 24 51 c in ympp with mean values of 19 90 18 38 and 13 95 c respectively fig 4a the daily mean rh ranged from 20 89 to 97 41 for mmpp 31 26

nearly zero at late night fig 6 there were 0 5 1 5 h differences where the variables started to increase but 1 0 6 0 h differences where the variables started to decrease these may imply that the environmental factors have continuous influences on j s the seasonal g s averaged 105 27 mmol m 2 s 1 for mmpp with the greatest value at 127 71 mmol m 2 s 1 the g s reached 105 26 and 99 44 mmol m 2 s 1 for hmpp and ympp with the greatest values at 128 63 and 156 53 mmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig 7 the seasonal variations in g s were not obvious in mmpp hmpp and ympp the daily g s remained at a certain level throughout the growing season 3 3 seasonal variation in aerodynamic conductance and decoupling dimensionless coefficient the daily mean of g a was 1099 76 1152 30 and 1343 39 mmol m 2 s 1 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 8a the trend curves of g a were very noisy thus we used weekly moving averages filters to smoothen the curves and to show the trends clearly generally g a peaked in may and october but remained low in june july august and september fig 8b g a exhibited the same trend as w s the average ω was 0 041 greatest value of 0 70 0 15 greatest value of 0 96 and 0 18 greatest value of 0 75 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively the seasonal variation of ω showed a similar pattern for hmpp and ympp which peaked in august and was the lowest in may and october while ω peaked in may for mmpp fig 8c the low values of ω for mmpp hmpp and ympp indicated that the transpiration rate is imposed by the effects of the vpd here j s was more controlled by g s thus the transpiration rate in the present study was equated to the t r 3 4 environmental factors influencing the transpiration rate the daily e l increased linearly with increasing et 0 for mmpp hmpp and ympp and et 0 explained 23 82 and 10 of the variations in e l respectively fig 9a e l increased sharply with the changing t a and t a explained 57 82 and 57 of the variation in e l for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 9b e l decreased sharply with changing rh and rh explained 21 20 and 19 of the variation in e l for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 9c w s explained 10 38 and 9 of the variation in e l for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 9d e l displayed an exponential response to vpd and vpd explained 52 72 and 81 00 of the variation in e l for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 9e e l increased sharply with the par and par explained 62 9 and 31 of the variation in e l for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 9f e l was more affected by t a vpd and par than the other atmospheric factors here θ fell into the range of θ w and θ f e l et 0 explained 10 21 and 30 of the variations in θ for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 9g but e l et 0 was higher with increasing θ especially for mmpp compared to that of hmpp and ympp 3 5 sensitivity of canopy stomatal conductance to vpd according to the eq 10 and its description by roman et al 2015 g s decreases with vpd in the present study g s significantly decreased with vpd fig 10a the average b values in mmpp hmpp and ympp were 65 33 18 60 92 15 22 60 and 70 13 19 56 mmol m 2 s 1 kpa 1 respectively fig 10b b dg s dvpd 1 2 was higher for hmpp than that for mmpp and ympp p 0 05 while no significant differences in b were observed between mmpp and ympp p 0 05 the diurnal b change in mmpp hmpp and ympp showed a u shaped trend fig 10c moreover the minimum was reached one hour later in mmpp and hmpp than that in ympp this was similar to the diurnal variation trend of j s fig 6a and also proved that j s was dependent on g s 3 6 canopy stomatal conductance and canopy transpiration per unit leaf area in relation to tree size gao et al 2015 suggested that compared to tree age tree size was more important and crucial in determining water transport in this experiment g s max and e l max were used to examine sensitivity of p sylvestris to vpd which can prevent the effects of limited solar irradiance in the present study during the growing season for each sample tree both g s max and e l max were closely correlated with dbh fig 11 r 2 0 60 and 0 80 separately while g s max was found in both small and large trees notably dbh increased as the growing season progressed but such an increment had no influence on the relations between g s max and e l max zhang et al 2016a 4 discussion 4 1 transpiration dynamics of mongolian pine plantations this study quantified transpiration and estimated g s from sap flow observations of mongolian pine plantations by inverting the penman monteith equation evaluated the characteristics of the decoupling conditions to better understand the transpiration and g s response to environmental changes and probed into the mechanisms of plant water relations regulation via g s response to vpd on a seasonal and diurnal scale during our studies the daily mean e l ranged from 0 014 to 2 37 mm d 1 in mmpp 0 38 0 88 mm d 1 in hmpp and 0 019 1 07 mm d 1 in ympp with mean values of 0 97 0 60 and 0 45 mm d 1 respectively which was the same as the range of those reported for pines such as pinus banksiana lamb in thompson manitoba canada ewers et al 2005 pinus sylvestris var mongolica in a plantation forest in northern china song et al 2020 pinus ponderosa laws callaway et al 1994 delucia et al 2000 pinus sylvestris l mencuccini and grace 1995 mencuccini and bonosi 2001 pinus taeda l hacke et al 2000 and pinus palustris mill addington et al 2004 these values were higher than that for pinus sylvestris l stands in an inner alpine dry valley in tyrol austria 0 40 0 19 mm d 1 under conditions of non limiting soil water availability wieser et al 2014 the reason for this could be that e l for pinus sylvestris was higher in the drier and warmer regions than that in cooler and more humid regions due to the higher evaporative demand poyatos et al 2007 whereas when soil water availability was limited e l would be restricted to extreme climatic and or soil conditions luis et al 2005 nadezhdina et al 2007 poyatos et al 2008 kucerova et al 2010 wieser et al 2014 as in the case where our estimated e l was more than two times than that of a severe drought affected p sylvestris forest in northeastern germany lüttenschwager et al 1999 and a sparse pinus sylvestris forest in central siberia zimmermann et al 2000 urban et al 2019 the t r of mongolian pine increased from ympp to hmpp and then mmpp this result is different from the findings of philips et al 2002 who reported that the e l of pseudotsuga menziesii was higher in 20a than in 40a trees because of the lower g s in the 40a trees which was induced by tree height related hydraulic limitations in previous studies the hydraulic resistance increased with the length of the flow path for tree size or age and large old trees were probably under greater water stress than that of small young trees ryan and yoder 1997 meinzer et al 2001 phillips et al 2002 thus bigger trees usually close their stomata faster than that by smaller trees to minimize the intrinsic moisture deficit even under similar soil water status ryan and yoder 1997 irvine et al 2004 this theory is known as the hydraulic limitation hypothesis hlh which has been broadly tested in various plant physiology research studies liu et al 2018 and almost all studies relevant to hlh have focused on the relationships among tree size canopy transpiration per unit leaf area and leaf level gas exchange ryan et al 2006 in our study higher e l was accompanied by higher g s in mmpp compared to that in hmpp and ympp indicating that hlh as a mechanism does not sufficiently explain patterns in tree size and transpiration characteristics in artificial p sylvestris forests see figs 4 7 and 11 this is partly because leaf mass per area is greater in old bigger trees and the lai changed between mmpp hmpp and ympp lai 1 42 1 54 and 0 96 respectively ryan et al 2006 pointed out that hydraulic limitation of gas exchange with increasing dbh and hlh is common but not universal apart from the transpiration dynamics photosynthesis vessel scattering wood growth and height growth this leads to diversified tree transpiration resulting in species specific rates of transpiration oren et al 2001 thus in our future research more tests should be carried on to test hlh on pinus sylvestris forests in northern part of china in our study the e l for mmpp hmpp and ympp could be attributed to a higher evaporative demand the daily mean par averaged 207 09 190 45 and 323 90 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively et 0 averaged 5 14 1 77 and 3 79 mm in mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively see fig 4 which supports our first hypothesis e l increased with et 0 vpd and par and to a greater extent was explained by et 0 vpd and par than by rh and w s see fig 9 in particular an increased vpd due to a higher t a generally leads to a higher t r deng et al 2015 the vapor pressure within the leaves increases when the air and leaf temperatures rise thus the leaf to air vapor pressure gradient also increases which is the driving force for t r song et al 2020 these findings are the same as the variation patterns for p sylvestris forests in other regions wang et al 2017 urban et al 2019 song et al 2020 and other tree species ghimire et al 2014 deng et al 2015 liu et al 2017 atmospheric turbulence and stand structure stand age and density determined the aerodynamic transfer between the canopy and the atmosphere which may affect the t r of mongolian pine song et al 2020 however it is recognized that the latter factor has a relatively weak impact on the variation in t r compared with climatic factors and surface or canopy conductance song et al 2020 in the present study the daily mean g a was 1099 76 1152 30 and 1343 39 mmol m 2 s 1 in mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively see fig 8 g a exhibited the same trend as w s which is in accordance with eq 7 the obtained g a was lower than the values reported for eucalyptus urophylla 2567 00 305 40 mmol m 2 s 1 and schima superba 2244 40 142 20 mmol m 2 s 1 zhang et al 2016b and according to eq 8 the lower ω was because of the higher g a at a given g c in the present study the obtained ω values 0 041 0 15 and 0 18 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively were also lower than those reported for s superba 0 22 0 090 zhang et al 2016b the main reason is that a rise in lai lai 4 30 0 10 in s superba would lead to an increase in the canopy resistance which weakens the canopy atmosphere coupling katsoulas et al 2007 zhang et al 2016b in addition the vpd distribution within the canopy also depended on the lai because an increase in the canopy leaf area may impede air movement and a low lai tends to increase the w s which may indirectly change the vpd profile within the canopy granier and breda 1996 katsoulas et al 2007 kim et al 2014 similar to the conclusion of zhang et al 2016b who found that decreasing lai tended to increase the coupling extent and lower the ω indicating that a canopy is believed to be well coupled to the atmosphere soil moisture is another important factor that affects j s because lower soil water content may increase abscisic acid in the roots causing stomatal closure davies and zhang 1991 tognetti et al 2004 however during our study no evident relationship was found between daily e l and θ similar to the results of prior studies on e l and θ jiao et al 2016 wang et al 2017 song et al 2020 these results indicate that various environmental factors affect e l on a daily scale wang et al 2017 thus to eliminate the effects of weather conditions the correlations between the ratio of daily sap flux to the reference evapotranspiration and the amount of soil water were analyzed the relationship between e l et 0 and θ in mmpp hmpp and ympp showed that higher θ was associated with higher e l et 0 for p sylvestris because the sap flow of p sylvestris was also affected by the amount of soil water higher evaporative demand and higher soil moisture conditions research has pointed out that the absence of a significant relationship between θ and e l on a daily scale could be because the soil is usually moist within rainy days at which time t r is low similar to the lower values of t a vpd and par song et al 2018 all of which determine the energy availability for t r additionally et 0 only represents the non stressed evapotranspiration based on weather data thus the empirical crop coefficient k c was used to determine effective rainfall and to generate hypothetical irrigation schedules to estimate the seasonal or monthly evapotranspiration of applied water k c plus et 0 approach has been a preferred approach for estimation the evapotranspiration flux for most irrigation projects allen 2000 further research should consider the relations between e l and θ under rainfall periods by using the k c et 0 approach of irrigation needs that can better reflect the water stress suffered by plants 4 2 canopy stomatal conductance dynamics of mongolian pine plantations g s is a key physiological factor controlling the t r from tree canopies in the present study the average g s was 105 27 mmol m 2 s 1 for mmpp and the mean g s reached 105 26 and 99 44 mmol m 2 s 1 for hmpp and ympp respectively fig 7 which falls within the range for p sylvestris l tree species poyatos et al 2007 song et al 2020 in previous studies the inverse penman monteith equation monteith and unsworth 2007 has been widely used due to its accuracy in calculating g s the key point is to evaluate the decoupling dimensionless coefficient to test whether meteorological factors can affect transpiration rates directly or indirectly according to the results the average daylight hours of ω during the experiments was 0 041 0 15 and 0 18 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively researchers argue that intermediate ω values are driven by the evaporation related to the seasonal changes of net radiation saturation deficit and to some extent canopy conductance cabral et al 2010 zhang et al 2016b and lower ω values mean higher sensitivity of canopy transpiration to the saturation deficit than that to the net radiation zhang et al 2016b compared to the literature that was used to obtain decoupling coefficient of different forest types across a variety of conditions like acacia ampliceps ω 0 40 mielke et al 1999 eucalyptus grandis ω 0 25 mielke et al 1999 citrus limon l burm fil ω 0 14 nicolas et al 2008 quercusrobur l ω 0 40 stokes et al 2006 eucalyptus globulus ω 0 63 white et al 2000 and prunusarmenica l ω 0 20 barradas et al 2005 our results indicate that the transpiration dynamics of mongolian pine plantations mainly relied on vpd rather than par during the whole growing season canopy and the atmosphere were well coupled and g s was highly controlled the transpiration rate which confirms our second hypothesis therefore according to köstner et al 1992 g s can also be directly derived from sap flow measurements if the j s through the xylem changes as a result of the stomatal response to environmental variables however this approach is only valid when the following requirement is met water stored in the plant contributes little to t r compared to moisture uptake from soil mielke et al 1999 zhang et al 2016 during our research sap flow activity was nearly stopped in the evening but still existed thus the application of this approach should be further considered and tested in our study stomatal conductance decreased due to increasing evaporative demand in terms of vpd in p sylvestris it could evidently reduce tree water loss during periods of high evaporative demand this drought adaptation mechanism of p sylvestris characterizes a water saving strategy song et al 2018 as it has also been reported previously for other p sylvestris stands in austria switzerland mongolia and siberia sugimoto et al 2002 dulamsuren et al 2009 zweifel et al 2009 leo et al 2013 moreover quantifying the sensitivity of the g s of trees to vpd is important for understanding the role of its underlying physiological mechanisms song et al 2020 the sensitivity of g s to vpd b dg s dvpd 1 2 was determined throughout the growing season at three sites in northern china the results showed that plants with a lower b were associated with higher levels of t r at a higher vpd such a strategy represents an advantage of plants during adaptation to water deficit franks and farquhar 1999 but also represents the disadvantage of the risk of dehydration and even dieback under limited soil water conditions wu et al 2018 therefore hmpp with higher stomatal sensitivity higher b value to vpd may be superior with respect to growth when soil moisture is unfavorable whereas mmpp and ympp with relatively lower g s sensitivity to vpd may have had a higher risk of decline and dieback under limited soil water status see fig 10 which does not support our third hypothesis our research findings are the same as the theoretical models of optimal g s exchange which predict a decrease in g s with increasing evaporative demand james et al 2002 generally when t a increases the viscosity of water decreases by approximately twenty percent per ten celsius degrees and the mesophyll conductance increases at the same time which may improve the water supply to sites of evaporation to increase guard cell turgor and the stomatal aperture granier et al 2000 our findings also showed that g s max decreases with dbh at the early growth stage see fig 11 and this result is in contrast with a previous study indicated that tree dbh positively affected g s max and thus further controlled the minimum leaf water potential avoiding the potentially damaging effects of declining water potential delzon et al 2004 however the above obtained results were the same as the frequently observed parabolic mortality pattern with plant dbh highest dieback and declined rates occur for the smallest and largest trees mcdowell et al 2008 liu et al 2013 the reason further proved that the hydraulic limitation of gas exchange with increasing tree size was not suitable for the artificial p sylvestris forests barnard and ryan 2003 provided a concise statement of the hydraulic limitation hypothesis stating that bigger trees close stomata at a lower vpd than that do smaller trees while our study showed that mmpp had weak g s sensitivity to vpd and thus p sylvestris showed a more radical and dynamic regulation of plant water use during the growing season such risk taking behavior of plants may be beneficial when water is abundant as well as under moderately stressful conditions however under conditions of intense drought this behavior may endanger the plant mcdowell et al 2008 although the plantations in our study did not suffer great soil water stress θ w θ θ f it is necessary to explore water use efficiency on a large spatial scale before generalizing these results furthermore the mechanisms responsible for the effects of tree size on environmental coupling strategies and drought induced mortality and are not fully understood xu et al 2013 liu et al 2018 thus future research should be carried out on the hydraulics hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic safety margins of p sylvestris to provide a potential mechanistic explanation for regulation of the plant water use and die back reasons in the plantations of northern china overall the interaction of drought with dbh is important for seedling mortality and has a great impact on ecosystem structure and function bansal and germino 2010 mckinley et al 2011 in general increases in g s which regulate gas exchange can allow increased co2 uptake by trees and subsequently reinforce photosynthesis and plant growth poyatos et al 2007 liu et al 2018 song et al 2020 song et al 2020 and jiang et al 2006 indicated that when tree species are introduced into the new regions for vegetation restoration and reconstruction in semiarid regions the types of zonal climax vegetation in the new regions should be identified correctly and considered the restoration target however the current precipitation during the whole growing season cannot sufficiently support the water requirements of p sylvestris in these regions and the proportions of the canopy interception accounted for about 36 0 of p deng 2020 making this phenomenon much harsher in the semi arid deserts to effectively fix sand and improve the local environment mongolian pine had been planted in a large area pure plantation forest with high initial tree density jiao et al 2016 to maintain the stability of mongolian pine plantations the stand density should be thinned to decrease the canopy interception increasing the θ at the stand scale for the remaining trees and thereby reducing the water deficit thus p sylvestris could keep a higher transpiration rate and canopy stomatal conductance to maintain its survival and growth song et al 2018 our findings have certain implications for forest management in semi arid regions meanwhile additional studies on canopy transpiration combined with different tree densities and tree ages in the same study site would provide further insights into the eco hydrological processes reforestation and forest management in this region 5 conclusions in this study transpiration was quantified and canopy stomatal conductance was estimated and compared in mongolian pine for mature half mature and young forests in the mu su and horqin deserts of china the transpiration rates in the three forest stands were better correlated to air temperature photosynthetic active radiation and vapor pressure deficit and were attributed to evaporative demand soil moisture content and canopy stomatal conductance a lower decoupling coefficient indicated that the canopy was coupled to the atmosphere and vapor pressure deficit was the main driving factor that affected transpiration rates in addition the mature forest and young forest showed lower sensitivity of stomatal regulation to vapor pressure deficit compared with that of the half mature forest the maximum canopy stomatal conductance was found in both small and large trees therefore young small and old large trees would be more vulnerable to decline under super drought conditions these findings could be applied for forest management in semi arid regions

10159,mongolian pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantations have ecological significance for desertification control and degraded land restoration in drought induced regions to date knowledge about the dynamics of transpiration and canopy stomatal conductance g s of mongolian pine in the semiarid deserts in northern china is quite limited thus better understanding its physical response to environmental factors and exploring the mechanisms of forest transpiration can offer a theoretical basis for a reasonable tree planting program in semi arid regions in this study transpiration and g s changes in mongolian pine plantations for a mature forest mmpp half mature forest hmpp and young forest ympp were obtained using sap flow observations while simultaneously monitoring the atmospheric and soil moisture contents the results showed that the canopy transpiration per unit leaf area e l averaged 0 97 mm d 1 0 60 mm d 1 and 0 45 mm d 1 in mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively and the e l of mongolian pine could be attributed to evaporative demand soil moisture status and g s e l was obviously affected by air temperature photosynthetic active radiation par and vapor pressure deficit vpd with the highest determined coefficient the low values measured for the dimensionless coefficient ω 0 041 0 15 and 0 18 indicated that the canopy and the atmosphere were highly coupled g s had more control over e l and thus g s was more limited by vpd than that par the average g s was 105 27 105 26 and 99 44 mmol m 2 s 1 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively both mmpp and ympp had lower sensitivity for stomatal regulation than hmpp and the maximum g s was found in trees with both small and large tree diameters at breast height therefore mmpp and ympp were suspected to vary based on environmental conditions and were more susceptible to decline under mega drought conditions keywords mongolian pine plantations transpiration canopy stomatal conductance vapor pressure deficit

fire and adverse climate variations like drying and droughts has resulted in the degradation of semi arid lands worldwide huang et al 2015 2016 china has been challenged by desertification over vast areas approximately 2 61 billion ha because of the large human population and limited natural resources zheng et al 2012 song et al 2020 in the middle of the 20th century about 70 dust storms occurred leading to soil erosion in the mu us desert geo location of 107 20 111 30 e 37 30 39 20 n eventually affecting the lives of the people in northern china deng et al 2015 desertification developed rapidly in the mu us desert while marginal areas in the east and south were restored to some extent the mu us desert was defined as an agro pastoral transitional zone and the landscapes of this area changed significantly during the period from the 1950 s to the 1990 s wu and ci 2002 due to the overgrazing and overcutting in mu us sandy land shifting sandy land and semi fixed sandy land covered 45

effective method of wind prevention water conservation and microclimate adjustment zeng et al 2009 these artificial plantations have been successfully established in the interests of desertification

and its vertical distribution is in the range of approximately 1500 m above sea level asl deng 2020 p sylvestris has been largely introduced to northern china because of its advantages such as wind sheltering and drought resistance guo et al 2020 to date the coverage area of planted forest on desert is 7 0 105 ha in the northern part of china although the artificial plantations have adapted well declining phenomena such as unexpectedly slow growth and dieback have been found in the early stage of mongolian pine growth song et al 2016 these problems have raised serious concerns and researchers have pointed out that the main reason for the massive degeneration of p sylvestris is the large water consumption for transpiration by this tree species and the limitations of natural rainfall conditions in the region zhu et al 2008 song et al 2017a 2017b precipitation is intercepted by the canopy and the rest falls through into the ground and is absorbed by roots after which it is transpired and emitted to the atmosphere this constitutes a complete forest water cycle deutscher et al 2016 deng 2020 among these mechanisms transpiration accounts for the largest amount among the elements of water balance in a soil plant atmosphere continuum transpiration is vital to the survival of trees especially during the growing season and in regions of aridification hoelscher et al 2018 to date plant transpiration has been measured by various methods such as radioisotopes song et al 2017a 2017b lysimeters smith and allen 1996 and sap flow granier 1985 tie et al 2017 hoelscher et al 2018 however most of these techniques are expensive e g an isotope ratio mass spectrometer impracticable and may affect plant growth e g the water within the plant xylem has to be extracted and then subjected to stable isotope analysis to determine the water sources used by plants granier et al 1996 song et al 2020 among these the sap ﬂow method is superior to other methods for estimating tree transpiration because it is the most practical relatively inexpensive increasingly robust in features and can be extrapolated to stand scale granier et al 1996 xia et al 2008 bosch et al 2014 fuchs et

which trigger stomatal opening or closure to maintain the survival of trees gutschick and simonneau 2002 zhang et al 2017 it is also noted that the dieback and decline of forests has accelerated in recent decades at the regional and continental scales as t a is continuously rising and models predict a sharp decline in the strength of the terrestrial carbon sink in the next 100 years adams et al 2013 even if precipitation p remains consistent to the historical patterns continuous warming associated extremes raise the possibilities of dieback through direct impacts on the autotrophic respiration of plants affecting the metabolism and indirect effects on g s via the impact of rising vpd on plant hydraulics mcdowell et al 2013 there are different water regulation strategies for plants to cope with the different climates and soil water regimes zeng et al 2009 xu et al 2013 thus it is of great importance to probe the mechanisms of plant water relations regulation and reveal the underlying mechanisms for plant breeding water use efficiency water balance and vegetation restoration in semiarid desert regions luo et al 2017 currently there are only few studies focusing on the g s of p sylvestris throughout the growing season in china song et al 2020 more information is needed regarding the calculation of the transpiration and g s of p sylvestris and their relationship with environmental factors in typical semi arid deserts mu us and horqin in northern china our specific goals were as follows i to quantify transpiration and estimate g s from sap flow observations of mongolian pine plantations by inverting the penman monteith equation ii to evaluate the characteristics of the decoupling conditions to better understand the transpiration and g s response to environmental changes and iii to probe into the mechanisms of plant water relations regulation via g s response to vpd on a seasonal and diurnal scale during these experiments sap flux in three different stands was measured section 2 1 the stands varied not only in age but also in climate and thus comparing the results across stands becomes difficult however in this paper the stand densities of p sylvestris of the mature mongolian pine plantation mmpp 280 trees ha 1 half of a mature mongolian pine plantation hmpp 1475 trees ha 1 and a young mongolian pine plantation ympp 850 trees ha 1 all conformed to the reasonable afforestation densities of p sylvestris within the range of 350 1500 and 900 trees ha 1 respectively based on the forest water balance forest age and the main meteorological factors according to previous studies deng et al 2017a 2017b ma et al 2017 song et al 2017a 2017b moreover in our experimental sites soil nutrient statuses were at normal levels organic

plant transpiration and thus the sap fluxes of p sylvestris may not be restricted to the forest management and confounding age effects in this study we hypothesized that 1 mmpp and hmpp would have higher transpiration rates compared with that of ympp due to their larger tree sizes while ympp would maintain a certain level of transpiration because the planted introduction region has a higher temperature and evaporative demand meanwhile for the conifer forest the canopy was relatively open air could circulate with little obstruction in windy conditions and thus we hypothesize that there is no vertical gradient in vpd throughout the canopy and that vpd was close to the leaf to air vapor pressure deficit naithani et al 2012 considering this we hypothesized that 2 p sylvestris are generally strongly coupled to the atmosphere furthermore based on previous studies plants growing in warmer drier climates e g higher par and et 0 can show enhanced stomatal closure along with an increasing air vapor pressure deficit poyatos et al 2007 song et al 2020 thus we hypothesized that 3 mmpp and ympp should exhibit highly sensitive stomatal conductance to vpd compared to that of hmpp these results could provide a greater understanding of the transpiration of p sylvestris and thus provide useful information for improving afforestation desertification and environmental protections in the semiarid deserts in northern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 introduction to study sites and species three different stand ages of mongolian pine plantations were surveyed in this study fig 1 study site a was the magu forestry station 123 32 n 124 26 n 42 33 e 43 29 e with an altitude of 457 m asl the area is dominated by a continental monsoon influenced semi arid climate with p around 500 mm most of the p occurs from june to september accounting for approximately 70 of annual p the annual evaporation is 1078 mm t a averages 7 9 c the frostless period is 136 d and w s averages 2 6 m s 1 the landscape is characterized by fixed sand dunes which are identified as dark brown forest soil and eolian sandy soil the existing vegetation includes p sylvestris pinus tabuliformis carrière and populus l study site b was the rare psammophytes protection botanical base which has a semi arid continental climate 109 42 54 e 108 20 11 n and elevation of 1250 m asl p averages 400 mm t a averages 8 1 c and annual evaporation is 1150 mm the landscape is characterized by fixed desert existing natural vegetation includes shrubs such as caragana korshinskii and hedysarum scoparium deng et al 2017b 2018 study site c was the ningxia yanchi research station of state forestry administration 106 300 e 107 410 e 37 04 n 38 10 n with an altitude of 1354 m asl the climate is a semi arid continental monsoon of the mid temperate zone the annual p averages 300 mm t a averages 8 3 c annual potential evaporation averages 1273 mm and w s averages 2 5 m s 1 soils are primarily dark loessial soil eolian sandy soil and sierozem soil gao et al 2014 deng et al 2015 mongolian pine is a geographical variety of scots pine pinus sylvestris l that is distributed in northeast asia it is classified into two ecotypes according to preferred habitat an ecotype adapted to mountain habitats and another adapted to fixed sand dunes kang et al 2004 the latter ecotype known as sandy land mongolian pine is restricted to a forest belt of ca 200 km in length and 14 20 km in width in the fixed sand dunes of ne china zhu et al 2003 this sandy land mongolian pine tree species was first introduced for sand fixation in the 1950s in the horqin sandy land of china because of its strong adaptation to deep sandy soils zeng et al 1996 zhu et al 2003 song et al 2018 its seedlings were widely cultivated in the zhanggutai region liaoning province of the southeastern horqin sandy region at that time these saplings were then widely distributed to the research centers related enterprises local authorities and tree growers of ne china including yulin city rare psammophytes protection botanical base in the southern mu us desert region thus in this study the seed sources of the mmpp hmpp and ympp plantations come from the same region of provenance 2 2 sap flow measurements sapwood area and leaf area index determination the sap flow observations were conducted from may 1st to october 20th the entire growing season in mmpp the stand age was 45 years and stand density was 280 trees ha 1 at study site a 2018 hmpp the stand age was 30 years and the stand density was 1475 trees ha 1 at study site b 2014 and ympp the stand age was 11 years and the stand density was 850 trees ha 1 at study site c 2011 these stands were intact and unaffected by human disturbance according to the distribution frequency of diameter at breast height surveyed in april before sap flow measurement dbh cm fig 2 the selection criteria were tree height height under living branches crown width and shape and growth conditions of the sample trees which were superior to those of the average trees in the plot nine nine and three tree samples were selected from mmpp hmpp and ympp table 1 respectively for the ympp stand only three tree samples were selected as there were slight growth trait differences between sampled individuals under the dbh of 0 5 cm model sgb25 gauges were applied to the sample trees and unlike in the tdp method there was no need to consider the azimuthal and radial variations in the sap flux of the trunk moreover during our analysis there were low degrees of variations in sap fluxes during the seasonal the coefficient of variation value was 5 3 and diurnal the coefficient of variation value was 7 0 observations thus these sampling numbers met our requirements sap flux densities j s g cm 2 s 1 were measured using granier type thermal dissipation probes granier 1985 1987 in mmpp and hmpp each sensor consisted of a pair of probes 20 mm long and 2 mm in diameter respectively and a copper constantan thermocouple was placed and inserted into the sapwood on the north facing side of the sampled trees at a height of 1 3 m of the stem above the ground granier 1987 du et al 2011 the upper probe included a heater with a constant power of 0 15 w and the lower probe was unheated similar to the reference james et al 2002 the probes were wrapped in waterproof silicone and covered with an aluminum box cover to prevent exposure to precipitation thermal influences from radiation and to avoid physical damage song et al 2020 the temperature difference between the upper and lower probes δt a c was measured every 10 s and 15 min averages were recorded on a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa with a multiplexer am16 32 a campbell scientific standard un calibrated j s were calculated per du et al 2011 and granier 1987 for mmpp and hmpp j s was calculated as 1 j s 0 0119 δ t a max δ t a δ t a 1 231 where δt a max c is the maximum temperature difference between the sensors when j s is close to 0 zhu et al 2003 tdp techniques require a period of zero flow in order to calculate sap flow from raw heat velocity or input data smith and allen 1996 grime and sinclair 1999 vandegehuchte and steppe 2013 δt a max was determined and used as a reference for the following day wieser et al 2014 and it occurred at times of zero flow according to the calibration equation determined by granier 1987 and that revalidated by others clearwater et al 1999 james et al 2002 in practice zero flow is also assumed to occur at night or at some designated period during the night regalado and ritter 2007 this assumption of zero sap fluxes seems reasonable as night time vapor pressure deficits were mostly low and temperature courses of the sensors reached equilibrium on most nights suggesting that refilling of internal reserves was complete wieser et al 2014 during our study nocturnal sap flow continued to occur but was nearly zero therefore there cannot be an a priori assumption that night time represents zero flow but this period still can be used for an accurate assessment of sap flow forster 2014 moreover in previous studies since there was one pair of probes per sampling tree the azimuthal and radial variations in sap flux were not taken into account within the studied trees in the present study zhang et al 2018 song et al 2020 model sgb25 gauges flow32 meters dynamax inc houston tx usa were applied to the stems of ympp data were recorded at 10 s intervals and stored as 15 min averages using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific yue et al 2008 deng et al 2015 we installed gauges on the base of the stems following the manufacturer s instruction dynamax 2009 and procedures reported by other similar studies allen and grime 1995 hall et al 1998 shb could continue to give off heat to plant stems in a continuous manner as its sensors are not affected by external interferences and the sap flow computations are maintained during all conditions with reasonable limits deng et al 2015 since the additional heat is properly accounted for in the energy balance the user does not need any special computation to compensate for these events yue et al 2008 in ymmp j s was calculated as 2 j s q f c p δ t where q f is the energy of the sap flow and c p is the specific heat of water 4 17 jg 1 steinberg et al 1990 the total tree water consumption kg d 1 was estimated directly by multiplying j s with the sapwood area sa cm2 the sap flux density of a single tree may have significant variability in a study on the general sap flow characteristics of a typical region therefore the sapwood area weighted average sap flux density of all the sample trees was used clausnitzer et al 2011 then the canopy transpiration related to the ground surface area e c mm d 1 was estimated by multiplying the average j s of all sample trees by the sapwood area index sai sapwood area per stand ground surface according to tie et al 2017 the sai values were 10 02 13 56 and 5 27 cm2 cm 2 in mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively the canopy transpiration per unit leaf area e l mm d 1 was estimated directly by dividing e c by the leaf area index lai m2 m 2 tang et al 2006 in mmpp the lai profile was estimated using an optical plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 li cor lincoln ne usa in hmpp the lai was measured with hemispherical canopy photography by taking photographs through a hemispherical fisheye lens of a nikon d4000 in ympp the lai was determined directly by taking a statistically significant sample of foliage from a plant canopy measuring the leaf area per sample plot and dividing it by the plot land surface area the lai values were 1 42 1 54 and 0 96 m2 m 2 in mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively to avoid damage to the sample trees in the surveyed plots another 15 50 and 26 trees of different diameter classes were surveyed based on the results from fig 2 around the plots in mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively and tree core samples were obtained using an increment borer dbh was measured 1 3 m above the ground using a dbh ruler gao et al 2015 here the relationships between sa and dbh were analyzed and the coefficient of determination r 2 was above 0 88 0 90 and 0 79 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 3 the total sa in the plot for mmpp 10 000 m2 hmpp 900 m2 and ympp 900 m2 was 99 000 27 141 and 1338 cm2 respectively the slope of sa vs dbh was significantly higher for mmpp than that for hmpp and ympp p 0 01 whereas the slopes of sa vs dbh did not differ for hmpp and ympp p 0 05 2 3 atmospheric and soil moisture measurements at study site a the automatic weather station was approximately 85 0 m from the studied plots the average t a c w s m s 1 p mm rh and par µmol m 2 s 1 were measured by the automatic weather station at a height of 15 0 m in the platform at study site b the meteorological data were collected using a water vapor flux tower which was 30 0 m high and located 75 0 m away from the surveyed plot the water vapor flux tower measured t a w s rh par barometric pressure and p campbell scientific p was collected at a height of 25 m and the other meteorological data were collected at a height of 14 m from the ground at study site c meteorological data were obtained using a meteorological monitoring station campbell scientific that measured vpd t a w s rh par and p the variables at all three sites were measured with the same frequency and recording time as the sap flow measurements in both study sites a and c soil profiles 0 100 cm were dug every 15 days and extra measurements were taken after each precipitation

wilting point cm3 cm 3 and θ f is the soil water content at field capacity cm3 cm 3 and their values were obtained by the cutting ring method xu et al 2011 the diurnal reference evapotranspiration et

addington et al 2004 roman et al 2015 one way anova was used to analyze the significant differences 0 01 and 0 05 levels in transpiration and canopy stomatal conductance dynamics among mmpp hmpp and ympp statistical analyses were conducted using spss 22 0 spss inc chicago il usa origin pro 9 0 originlab usa was used to draw all of the figures 3 results 3 1 environmental variables canopy transpiration per unit ground area and canopy transpiration per unit leaf area all environmental factors indicated distinct but similar seasonal changes in mmpp hmpp and ympp the daily mean t a ranged from 5 47 to 27 43 c in mmpp 8 00 28 97 c in hmpp and 5 21 24 51 c in ympp with mean values of 19 90 18 38 and 13 95 c respectively fig 4a the daily mean rh ranged from 20 89 to 97 41 for mmpp 31 26 88 63 in hmpp and 34 27 97 60 in ympp with mean values of 69 36 58 82 and 66 63 respectively fig 4b the daily mean w s ranged from 0 16 to 2 13 m s 1 in mmpp 0 15 2 37 m s 1 in hmpp and 1 27 4 48 m s 1 in ympp with mean values of 0 73 1 15 and 2 63 m s 1 respectively fig 4c the daily mean vpd ranged from 0 62 to 1 75 kpa in mmpp 0 67 1 75 kpa in hmpp and 0 38 1 73 kpa in ympp with mean values of 0 93 1 04 and 1 06 kpa respectively fig 4d the daily par ranged from 22 14 to 341 14 μmol m 2 s 1 in mmpp 130 55 250 55 μmol m 2 s 1 in hmpp and 33 56 556 29 μmol m 2 s 1 in ympp with mean values of 207 09 190 45 and 323 90 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig 4e the daily mean et 0 ranged from 0 037 to 12 36 mm in mmpp 1 11 2 79 mm in hmpp and 0 060 9 10 mm in ympp with mean values of 5 14 1 77 and 3 79 mm respectively fig 4f table 2 mmpp and ympp had relatively warmer and drier climates than those of hmpp site the daily mean e l ranged from 0 014 to 2 37 mm in mmpp 0 38 0 88 mm in hmpp and 0 019 1 07 mm in ympp with mean values of 0 97 0 60 and 0 45 mm respectively fig 4g daily mean e l was higher for mmpp than that for hmpp and ympp p 0 05 while mean daily e l did not differ for hmpp and ympp p 0 05 the daily mean e c ranged from 0 022 to 3 45 mm in mmpp 0 54 1 25 mm in hmpp and 0 018 1 02 mm in ympp with mean values of 1 49 0 86 and 0 43 mm respectively fig 4h the accumulated e c was 230 53 137 28 and 24 63 mm for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively occupying 83 89 35 46 and 6 12 of the accumulated p and 28 91 48 36 and 4 33 of the accumulated et 0 respectively over the same period the p and θ at mmpp hmpp and ympp during the growing season are shown in fig 4 θ increased when p occurred and declined after the p event during our study p was evenly distributed throughout the year in mmpp and hmpp the accumulated p over the entire study period was 274 8 387 10 and 402 46 mm in mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively θ ranged from 2 60 to 20 33 cm3 cm 3 for mmpp fig 5a 9 00 27 00 cm3 cm 3 for hmpp fig 5b and 12 00 29 20 cm3 cm 3 for ympp fig 5c 3 2 sap flux density and canopy stomatal conductance in the present study five sunny days 21st may 1st jun 23rd aug 6th sept and 13th oct were selected the day before these selected days no precipitation event had occurred within 24 h and no heavy rain p 6 mm was recorded within the last 72 h diurnal courses of j s averaged 0 0024 0 00068 and 0 00016 g cm 2 s 1 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively t a averaged 22 45 18 92 and 22 13 c for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively par averaged 330 49 230 16 and 212 81 µmol m 2 s 1 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively and vpd averaged 1 18 1 20 and 1 32 kpa for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively diurnal courses of j s had a similar pattern for mmpp hmpp and ympp the pattern of the daily courses in j s were similar to the daily patterns of t a par and vpd generally j s increased in the morning as the t a par and vpd increased and reached a maximum value decreased in the afternoon and reached nearly zero at late night fig 6 there were 0 5 1 5 h differences where the variables started to increase but 1 0 6 0 h differences where the variables started to decrease these may imply that the environmental factors have continuous influences on j s the seasonal g s averaged 105 27 mmol m 2 s 1 for mmpp with the greatest value at 127 71 mmol m 2 s 1 the g s reached 105 26 and 99 44 mmol m 2 s 1 for hmpp and ympp with the greatest values at 128 63 and 156 53 mmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig 7 the seasonal variations in g s were not obvious in mmpp hmpp and ympp the daily g s remained at a certain level throughout the growing season 3 3 seasonal variation in aerodynamic conductance and decoupling dimensionless coefficient the daily mean of g a was 1099 76 1152 30 and 1343 39 mmol m 2 s 1 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 8a the trend curves of g a were very noisy thus we used weekly moving averages filters to smoothen the curves and to show the trends clearly generally g a peaked in may and october but remained low in june july august and september fig 8b g a exhibited the same trend as w s the average ω was 0 041 greatest value of 0 70 0 15 greatest value of 0 96 and 0 18 greatest value of 0 75 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively the seasonal variation of ω showed a similar pattern for hmpp and ympp which peaked in august and was the lowest in may and october while ω peaked in may for mmpp fig 8c the low values of ω for mmpp hmpp and ympp indicated that the transpiration rate is imposed by the effects of the vpd here j s was more controlled by g s thus the transpiration rate in the present study was equated to the t r 3 4 environmental factors influencing the transpiration rate the daily e l increased linearly with increasing et 0 for mmpp hmpp and ympp and et 0 explained 23 82 and 10 of the variations in e l respectively fig 9a e l increased sharply with the changing t a and t a explained 57 82 and 57 of the variation in e l for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 9b e l decreased sharply with changing rh and rh explained 21 20 and 19 of the variation in e l for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 9c w s explained 10 38 and 9 of the variation in e l for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 9d e l displayed an exponential response to vpd and vpd explained 52 72 and 81 00 of the variation in e l for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 9e e l increased sharply with the par and par explained 62 9 and 31 of the variation in e l for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 9f e l was more affected by t a vpd and par than the other atmospheric factors here θ fell into the range of θ w and θ f e l et 0 explained 10 21 and 30 of the variations in θ for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively fig 9g but e l et 0 was higher with increasing θ especially for mmpp compared to that of hmpp and ympp 3 5 sensitivity of canopy stomatal conductance to vpd according to the eq 10 and its description by roman et al 2015 g s decreases with vpd in the present study g s significantly decreased with vpd fig 10a the average b values in mmpp hmpp and ympp were 65 33 18 60 92 15 22 60 and 70 13 19 56 mmol m 2 s 1 kpa 1 respectively fig 10b b dg s dvpd 1 2 was higher for hmpp than that for mmpp and ympp p 0 05 while no significant differences in b were observed between mmpp and ympp p 0 05 the diurnal b change in mmpp hmpp and ympp showed a u shaped trend fig 10c moreover the minimum was reached one hour later in mmpp and hmpp than that in ympp this was similar to the diurnal variation trend of j s fig 6a and also proved that j s was dependent on g s 3 6 canopy stomatal conductance and canopy transpiration per unit leaf area in relation to tree size gao et al 2015 suggested that compared to tree age tree size was more important and crucial in determining water transport in this experiment g s max and e l max were used to examine sensitivity of p sylvestris to vpd which can prevent the effects of limited solar irradiance in the present study during the growing season for each sample tree both g s max and e l max were closely correlated with dbh fig 11 r 2 0 60 and 0 80 separately while g s max was found in both small and large trees notably dbh increased as the growing season progressed but such an increment had no influence on the relations between g s max and e l max zhang et al 2016a 4 discussion 4 1 transpiration dynamics of mongolian pine plantations this study quantified transpiration and estimated g s from sap flow observations of mongolian pine plantations by inverting the penman monteith equation evaluated the characteristics of the decoupling conditions to better understand the transpiration and g s response to environmental changes and probed into the mechanisms of plant water relations regulation via g s response to vpd on a seasonal and diurnal scale during our studies the daily mean e l ranged from 0 014 to 2 37 mm d 1 in mmpp 0 38 0 88 mm d 1 in hmpp and 0 019 1 07 mm d 1 in ympp with mean values of 0 97 0 60 and 0 45 mm d 1 respectively which was the same as the range of those reported for pines such as pinus banksiana lamb in thompson manitoba canada ewers et al 2005 pinus sylvestris var mongolica in a plantation forest in northern china song et al 2020 pinus ponderosa laws callaway et al 1994 delucia et al 2000 pinus sylvestris l mencuccini and grace 1995 mencuccini and bonosi 2001 pinus taeda l hacke et al 2000 and pinus palustris mill addington et al 2004 these values were higher than that for pinus sylvestris l stands in an inner alpine dry valley in tyrol austria 0 40 0 19 mm d 1 under conditions of non limiting soil water availability wieser et al 2014 the reason for this could be that e l for pinus sylvestris was higher in the drier and warmer regions than that in cooler and more humid regions due to the higher evaporative demand poyatos et al 2007 whereas when soil water availability was limited e l would be restricted to extreme climatic and or soil conditions luis et al 2005 nadezhdina et al 2007 poyatos et al 2008 kucerova et al 2010 wieser et al 2014 as in the case where our estimated e l was more than two times than that of a severe drought affected p sylvestris forest in northeastern germany lüttenschwager et al 1999 and a sparse pinus sylvestris forest in central siberia zimmermann et al 2000 urban et al 2019 the t r of mongolian pine increased from ympp to hmpp and then mmpp this result is different from the findings of philips et al 2002 who reported that the e l of pseudotsuga menziesii was higher in 20a than in 40a trees because of the lower g s in the 40a trees which was induced by tree height related hydraulic limitations in previous studies the hydraulic resistance increased with the length of the flow path for tree size or age and large old trees were probably under greater water stress than that of small young trees ryan and yoder 1997 meinzer et al 2001 phillips et al 2002 thus bigger trees usually close their stomata faster than that by smaller trees to minimize the intrinsic moisture deficit even under similar soil water status ryan and yoder 1997 irvine et al 2004 this theory is known as the hydraulic limitation hypothesis hlh which has been broadly tested in various plant physiology research studies liu et al 2018 and almost all studies relevant to hlh have focused on the relationships among tree size canopy transpiration per unit leaf area and leaf level gas exchange ryan et al 2006 in our study higher e l was accompanied by higher g s in mmpp compared to that in hmpp and ympp indicating that hlh as a mechanism does not sufficiently explain patterns in tree size and transpiration characteristics in artificial p sylvestris forests see figs 4 7 and 11 this is partly because leaf mass per area is greater in old bigger trees and the lai changed between mmpp hmpp and ympp lai 1 42 1 54 and 0 96 respectively ryan et al 2006 pointed out that hydraulic limitation of gas exchange with increasing dbh and hlh is common but not universal apart from the transpiration dynamics photosynthesis vessel scattering wood growth and height growth this leads to diversified tree transpiration resulting in species specific rates of transpiration oren et al 2001 thus in our future research more tests should be carried on to test hlh on pinus sylvestris forests in northern part of china in our study the e l for mmpp hmpp and ympp could be attributed to a higher evaporative demand the daily mean par averaged 207 09 190 45 and 323 90 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively et 0 averaged 5 14 1 77 and 3 79 mm in mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively see fig 4 which supports our first hypothesis e l increased with et 0 vpd and par and to a greater extent was explained by et 0 vpd and par than by rh and w s see fig 9 in particular an increased vpd due to a higher t a generally leads to a higher t r deng et al 2015 the vapor pressure within the leaves increases when the air and leaf temperatures rise thus the leaf to air vapor pressure gradient also increases which is the driving force for t r song et al 2020 these findings are the same as the variation patterns for p sylvestris forests in other regions wang et al 2017 urban et al 2019 song et al 2020 and other tree species ghimire et al 2014 deng et al 2015 liu et al 2017 atmospheric turbulence and stand structure stand age and density determined the aerodynamic transfer between the canopy and the atmosphere which may affect the t r of mongolian pine song et al 2020 however it is recognized that the latter factor has a relatively weak impact on the variation in t r compared with climatic factors and surface or canopy conductance song et al 2020 in the present study the daily mean g a was 1099 76 1152 30 and 1343 39 mmol m 2 s 1 in mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively see fig 8 g a exhibited the same trend as w s which is in accordance with eq 7 the obtained g a was lower than the values reported for eucalyptus urophylla 2567 00 305 40 mmol m 2 s 1 and schima superba 2244 40 142 20 mmol m 2 s 1 zhang et al 2016b and according to eq 8 the lower ω was because of the higher g a at a given g c in the present study the obtained ω values 0 041 0 15 and 0 18 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively were also lower than those reported for s superba 0 22 0 090 zhang et al 2016b the main reason is that a rise in lai lai 4 30 0 10 in s superba would lead to an increase in the canopy resistance which weakens the canopy atmosphere coupling katsoulas et al 2007 zhang et al 2016b in addition the vpd distribution within the canopy also depended on the lai because an increase in the canopy leaf area may impede air movement and a low lai tends to increase the w s which may indirectly change the vpd profile within the canopy granier and breda 1996 katsoulas et al 2007 kim et al 2014 similar to the conclusion of zhang et al 2016b who found that decreasing lai tended to increase the coupling extent and lower the ω indicating that a canopy is believed to be well coupled to the atmosphere soil moisture is another important factor that affects j s because lower soil water content may increase abscisic acid in the roots causing stomatal closure davies and zhang 1991 tognetti et al 2004 however during our study no evident relationship was found between daily e l and θ similar to the results of prior studies on e l and θ jiao et al 2016 wang et al 2017 song et al 2020 these results indicate that various environmental factors affect e l on a daily scale wang et al 2017 thus to eliminate the effects of weather conditions the correlations between the ratio of daily sap flux to the reference evapotranspiration and the amount of soil water were analyzed the relationship between e l et 0 and θ in mmpp hmpp and ympp showed that higher θ was associated with higher e l et 0 for p sylvestris because the sap flow of p sylvestris was also affected by the amount of soil water higher evaporative demand and higher soil moisture conditions research has pointed out that the absence of a significant relationship between θ and e l on a daily scale could be because the soil is usually moist within rainy days at which time t r is low similar to the lower values of t a vpd and par song et al 2018 all of which determine the energy availability for t r additionally et 0 only represents the non stressed evapotranspiration based on weather data thus the empirical crop coefficient k c was used to determine effective rainfall and to generate hypothetical irrigation schedules to estimate the seasonal or monthly evapotranspiration of applied water k c plus et 0 approach has been a preferred approach for estimation the evapotranspiration flux for most irrigation projects allen 2000 further research should consider the relations between e l and θ under rainfall periods by using the k c et 0 approach of irrigation needs that can better reflect the water stress suffered by plants 4 2 canopy stomatal conductance dynamics of mongolian pine plantations g s is a key physiological factor controlling the t r from tree canopies in the present study the average g s was 105 27 mmol m 2 s 1 for mmpp and the mean g s reached 105 26 and 99 44 mmol m 2 s 1 for hmpp and ympp respectively fig 7 which falls within the range for p sylvestris l tree species poyatos et al 2007 song et al 2020 in previous studies the inverse penman monteith equation monteith and unsworth 2007 has been widely used due to its accuracy in calculating g s the key point is to evaluate the decoupling dimensionless coefficient to test whether meteorological factors can affect transpiration rates directly or indirectly according to the results the average daylight hours of ω during the experiments was 0 041 0 15 and 0 18 for mmpp hmpp and ympp respectively researchers argue that intermediate ω values are driven by the evaporation related to the seasonal changes of net radiation saturation deficit and to some extent canopy conductance cabral et al 2010 zhang et al 2016b and lower ω values mean higher sensitivity of canopy transpiration to the saturation deficit than that to the net radiation zhang et al 2016b compared to the literature that was used to obtain decoupling coefficient of different forest types across a variety of conditions like acacia ampliceps ω 0 40 mielke et al 1999 eucalyptus grandis ω 0 25 mielke et al 1999 citrus limon l burm fil ω 0 14 nicolas et al 2008 quercusrobur l ω 0 40 stokes et al 2006 eucalyptus globulus ω 0 63 white et al 2000 and prunusarmenica l ω 0 20 barradas et al 2005 our results indicate that the transpiration dynamics of mongolian pine plantations mainly relied on vpd rather than par during the whole growing season canopy and the atmosphere were well coupled and g s was highly controlled the transpiration rate which confirms our second hypothesis therefore according to köstner et al 1992 g s can also be directly derived from sap flow measurements if the j s through the xylem changes as a result of the stomatal response to environmental variables however this approach is only valid when the following requirement is met water stored in the plant contributes little to t r compared to moisture uptake from soil mielke et al 1999 zhang et al 2016 during our research sap flow activity was nearly stopped in the evening but still existed thus the application of this approach should be further considered and tested in our study stomatal conductance decreased due to increasing evaporative demand in terms of vpd in p sylvestris it could evidently reduce tree water loss during periods of high evaporative demand this drought adaptation mechanism of p sylvestris characterizes a water saving strategy song et al 2018 as it has also been reported previously for other p sylvestris stands in austria switzerland mongolia and siberia sugimoto et al 2002 dulamsuren et al 2009 zweifel et al 2009 leo et al 2013 moreover quantifying the sensitivity of the g s of trees to vpd is important for understanding the role of its underlying physiological mechanisms song et al 2020 the sensitivity of g s to vpd b dg s dvpd 1 2 was determined throughout the growing season at three sites in northern china the results showed that plants with a lower b were associated with higher levels of t r at a higher vpd such a strategy represents an advantage of plants during adaptation to water deficit franks and farquhar 1999 but also represents the disadvantage of the risk of dehydration and even dieback under limited soil water conditions wu et al 2018 therefore hmpp with higher stomatal sensitivity higher b value to vpd may be superior with respect to growth when soil moisture is unfavorable whereas mmpp and ympp with relatively lower g s sensitivity to vpd may have had a higher risk of decline and dieback under limited soil water status see fig 10 which does not support our third hypothesis our research findings are the same as the theoretical models of optimal g s exchange which predict a decrease in g s with increasing evaporative demand james et al 2002 generally when t a increases the viscosity of water decreases by approximately twenty percent per ten celsius degrees and the mesophyll conductance increases at the same time which may improve the water supply to sites of evaporation to increase guard cell turgor and the stomatal aperture granier et al 2000 our findings also showed that g s max decreases with dbh at the early growth stage see fig 11 and this result is in contrast with a previous study indicated that tree dbh positively affected g s max and thus further controlled the minimum leaf water potential avoiding the potentially damaging effects of declining water potential delzon et al 2004 however the above obtained results were the same as the frequently observed parabolic mortality pattern with plant dbh highest dieback and declined rates occur for the smallest and largest trees mcdowell et al 2008 liu et al 2013 the reason further proved that the hydraulic limitation of gas exchange with increasing tree size was not suitable for the artificial p sylvestris forests barnard and ryan 2003 provided a concise statement of the hydraulic limitation hypothesis stating that bigger trees close stomata at a lower vpd than that do smaller trees while our study showed that mmpp had weak g s sensitivity to vpd and thus p sylvestris showed a more radical and dynamic regulation of plant water use during the growing season such risk taking behavior of plants may be beneficial when water is abundant as well as under moderately stressful conditions however under conditions of intense drought this behavior may endanger the plant mcdowell et al 2008 although the plantations in our study did not suffer great soil water stress θ w θ θ f it is necessary to explore water use efficiency on a large spatial scale before generalizing these results furthermore the mechanisms responsible for the effects of tree size on environmental coupling strategies and drought induced mortality and are not fully understood xu et al 2013 liu et al 2018 thus future research should be carried out on the hydraulics hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic safety margins of p sylvestris to provide a potential mechanistic explanation for regulation of the plant water use and die back reasons in the plantations of northern china overall the interaction of drought with dbh is important for seedling mortality and has a great impact on ecosystem structure and function bansal and germino 2010 mckinley et al 2011 in general increases in g s which regulate gas exchange can allow increased co2 uptake by trees and subsequently reinforce photosynthesis and plant growth poyatos et al 2007 liu et al 2018 song et al 2020 song et al 2020 and jiang et al 2006 indicated that when tree species are introduced into the new regions for vegetation restoration and reconstruction in semiarid regions the types of zonal climax vegetation in the new regions should be identified correctly and considered the restoration target however the current precipitation during the whole growing season cannot sufficiently support the water requirements of p sylvestris in these regions and the proportions of the canopy interception accounted for about 36 0 of p deng 2020 making this phenomenon much harsher in the semi arid deserts to effectively fix sand and improve the local environment mongolian pine had been planted in a large area pure plantation forest with high initial tree density jiao et al 2016 to maintain the stability of mongolian pine plantations the stand density should be thinned to decrease the canopy interception increasing the θ at the stand scale for the remaining trees and thereby reducing the water deficit thus p sylvestris could keep a higher transpiration rate and canopy stomatal conductance to maintain its survival and growth song et al 2018 our findings have certain implications for forest management in semi arid regions meanwhile additional studies on canopy transpiration combined with different tree densities and tree ages in the same study site would provide further insights into the eco hydrological processes reforestation and forest management in this region 5 conclusions in this study transpiration was quantified and canopy stomatal conductance was estimated and compared in mongolian pine for mature half mature and young forests in the mu su and horqin deserts of china the transpiration rates in the three forest stands were better correlated to air temperature photosynthetic active radiation and vapor pressure deficit and were attributed to evaporative demand soil moisture content and canopy stomatal conductance a lower decoupling coefficient indicated that the canopy was coupled to the atmosphere and vapor pressure deficit was the main driving factor that affected transpiration rates in addition the mature forest and young forest showed lower sensitivity of stomatal regulation to vapor pressure deficit compared with that of the half mature forest the maximum canopy stomatal conductance was found in both small and large trees therefore young small and old large trees would be more vulnerable to decline under super drought conditions these findings could be applied for forest management in semi arid regions
