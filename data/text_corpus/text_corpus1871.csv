9355,adopting environmentally and economically sustainable rice production systems is essential to achieve better results in terms of yield financial profitability and eco efficiency this study compares the ghg emissions and the financial analysis based on both costs and gross return and some financial indicators in eight rice paddy production systems in northern iran under the combination of three factors two water irrigation sources groundwater by wells and surface water by rivers two groups of rice cultivars low and high yielding and two transplanting methods traditional and mechanical the average total ghg emissions were 117 6 higher in groundwater than surface water systems 12 4 higher in mechanical than traditional systems and 20 8 higher in high yielding than low yielding rice cultivars the highest ghg share in groundwater systems was as average for electricity 52 2 while in surface water systems was diesel fuel 51 0 the best option for higher and more profitable yields among the studied rice production scenarios was the use of the surface water source for irrigation that however implies a higher water use considering irrigation water productivity traditional cultivation and high yielding rice cultivars coupled with irrigation from the surface water source could be preferred in terms of yield profitability that is summarized by the benefit cost ratio and the productivity index the best combination is irrigation with surface water mechanical cultivation and high yielding cultivars 1 99 and 1 36 kg us 1 respectively however net return in relation to global warming potential gwp indicated that irrigation with surface water source systems traditional cultivation and high yielding rice cultivars proved more eco efficient therefore policies should give priority to surface water use and high yielding cultivation keywords benefit cost ratio ghg emissions global warming potential rice sustainable agriculture 1 introduction sustainable agricultural production is crucial due to the increasing global population which is expected to increase global food demand in the future decades tilman et al 2011 generally food security in many parts of the world will face many challenges due to the negative impacts of climate change and the decreasing availability of land and water which are unequally distributed around the world jamali et al 2021a therefore the use of highly resource efficient practices along with lower inputs i e water chemical fertilizers and fossil fuel and limiting the costs of environmental effects are necessary to overcome these challenges liu et al 2016 rice oryza sativa l is the second highest grain production in the world with an annual production of 755 5 million tons which is produced from an area of 162 million ha fao 2020 and provides food for more than 50 of the world s population bakhshandeh et al 2018 in asia rice covers 35 60 of the daily calories requirement khush 2013 and is also known as the second most important staple food for the iranian dietary bakhshandeh et al 2020 vahedi 2021 it is estimated that 18 of the world s cultivated area consumes about 40 of global water resources which is supplied by exploiting groundwater and by rivers as a surface water source siebert et al 2010 however rice is often cultivated in lowland systems and 75 of rice production in the world is under continuously flooded conditions irri 2017 maraseni et al 2018 while it can be successfully grown under low water conditions bhatt et al 2019 based on the report by tuong and bouman 2003 by 2025 20 of rice cultivated areas will be exposed to physical water scarcity while 29 may take care of the economic water scarcity several factors influence rice production such as availability of natural resources climate conditions farming practices and socio economic circumstances bhatt et al 2019 among these factors water is known as the first important factor and is followed by nitrogen chen et al 2016 deng et al 2015 yao et al 2017 thus efficient management of land water and chemical fertilizers is necessary for ensuring food security along with reducing any negative influence on the environment li et al 2020 fernández et al 2020 in the past decade the agriculture sector has remarkably changed shifting towards high input based systems thus environmental impacts from high input farming have become a major concern astier et al 2014 on the other hand higher inputs also result in higher greenhouse gas ghg emissions and subsequently increase global warming jamali et al 2021b according to anon 2019 ghg emission from the agricultural sector increased more than 2 folds in the last 55 years mainly in developing countries the use of chemical fertilizer and ch4 emission from flooded paddy fields are two main factors for global warming with a contribution to the total agricultural ghg emissions of 13 and 10 respectively yao et al 2009 however agricultural inputs and ghg emissions depend on crop type and crop management as a consequence evaluating ghg emissions may provide specific information tailored to the different cropping systems about the environmental impacts and would support a more effective decision making process by agricultural managers and policy makers however considering only the global warming potential gwp does not provide a clear picture and gwp must be related to the financial of production to achieve a balanced analysis actually this area has been scarcely investigated but eco efficiency is frequently used as an indicator to relate the environmental impact of a production system and the financial aspects in the context of gwp eco efficiency is defined as the ratio of economic parameters and the release of ghg emissions sinha et al 2020 considering water productivity the economic benefits obtained from the output i e agricultural yield and the related costs of water use in agricultural production systems must be considered brar et al 2015 taking into account the ratio between the profit produced by a crop and the irrigation water applied fernández et al 2020 moreover kumar et al 2019 in punjab india proposed the ratio of gross return value to water supplied to calculate water productivity in rice paddy and wheat in southern california dinar 1993 proposed the ratio between the net value of output and the water supplied sutton and jones 1994 suggested adopting the net profit per unit of area at the crop field level consequently finding the best rice cropping system requires an economic evaluation of production costs and net returns along with higher profitable yields numerous studies worldwide focused on the impacts of farm management on rice production but few considered those of water source and technology on environmental and financial aspects on the other hand comprehensive studies on environmental and financial impacts linked to various rice production systems e g different in terms of water source variety and machinery were not studied in the world including northern iran this is necessary for deeper insights into achieving sustainable agricultural goals and also to guide future environmental and financial policies on irrigation and technology regulations therefore this study aimed to compare ghg emissions and financial analysis in different rice paddy production systems under the combination of three factors two water irrigation sources groundwater and surface two groups of rice cultivars low and high yielding and two transplanting methods traditional and mechanical 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the present study was carried out in the north of iran mazandaran province this province is located at between 35º 46 to 36º 58 latitude n and 50º 21 to 54º 08 longitude e with elevation from 0 to 5671 m a s l fig 1 the mean annual temperature and precipitation were 17 9 c and 789 mm respectively with about 21 of total precipitation occurring in the rice growing season the climate in mazandaran province is classified into four categories eastern regions with a mediterranean climate central regions humid western very humid and mountainous parts semi humid based on the de martonne climate classification rice is a main cultivated crop in this region due to favorable climate conditions and 77 of the total cultivated area with cereals in the province is under rice production 270000 ha vs 350000 ha 2 2 description of rice paddy production scenarios eight rice paddy production scenarios were considered in the current study these scenarios differed in terms of utilized water source for irrigation transplanting methods and cultivars the scenarios were gmh gml gth gtl smh sml sth and stl indicated by the following combinations g and s wells for the groundwater and river for the surface water source t and m traditional and mechanical transplanting methods and l and h low and high yielding rice cultivars respectively for this purpose 200 rice growers of mazandaran province were interviewed in 2020 and the data related to paddy fields management were collected using a face to face questionnaire in particular a total of 25 rice growers were randomly selected for each scenario sample size is consistent with other published studies on this topic in particular sample size is similar or even higher compared with the existing literature in detail alimagham et al 2017 and kazemi et al 2016 considered 26 and 36 farmers respectively truong et al 2017 canakci et al 2005 and cabasan et al 2019 interviewed 90 102 and 112 farmers respectively while quilty et al 2014 and jamali et al 2021b considered 222 and 250 farmers respectively in the province transplanting is the most used method for rice planting which is performed manually and more recently by machine since manual transplanting is a labor consuming operation however many smaller rice growers still adopt the traditional manual transplanting method the main rice paddy cultivars are neda and shiroodi as high yielding and tarom mahhalli and tarom hashemi as low yielding rice paddy cultivars in addition the two main water sources for rice paddy irrigation are rivers as surface water connected with a network of irrigation channels with paddy fields and groundwater wells besides rainfall the seedlings age at transplanting is 20 25 days and the rice paddy hill density is 12 25 hill per meter depending on the cultivar and cultivation method the nurseries are usually prepared during march may and the transplanting date is in april may while harvesting is performed during july and august depending on the cultivar and transplanting method urea 46 n potassium sulfate k2so4 50 k and 18 s triple superphosphate ca h2po4 46 p2o5 and a complex macro fertilizer 15 n 15 k2o 5 p2o5 5 s 1 si and 1 zn are the main chemical fertilizers used in this region at transplanting time one third of urea and total potassium sulfate and triple superphosphate are applied as basal fertilization and the rest of urea is commonly split twice as top dressing beginning of tillering and beginning of the anthesis stage depending on the farmer in addition fenvalerate diazinon and cypermethrin as insecticides tricyclazole beam and nativo tebuconazole 50 trifloxystrobin 25 as fungicides and butachlor bentazon and thiobencarb saturn 50 as herbicides are mainly applied by rice paddy growers in the study area 2 3 ghg emissions to determine the ghg emissions under the different rice paddy production scenarios carbon emission equivalents of the used agricultural inputs were considered table 1

in response to global warming studying ghg emissions from rice cropping systems is necessary because rice production contributes to about 55 of ghg emissions in the agricultural sector arunrat et al 2021 hwang et al 2021 ghg emissions were lower in paddy fields irrigated with the surface water source compared to those irrigated with the groundwater source which could be due to lower nitrogen fertilizer application and also no electricity consumption for irrigation on the other hand while surface water is directly diverted from the rivers through a network of irrigation channels irrigation with groundwater has a high electricity consumption for water pumping from the wells 50 similar results were reported by chaudhary et al 2017 who indicated that electricity consumption by rice farmers which is mainly used for irrigation had the highest contribution to total ghg emissions in addition ghg emissions were lower in low yielding cultivars that have a shorter growing period and lower fertilization input and in traditional methods for transplanting due to the lower diesel fuel used diesel fuel is considered as the second highest contributor in ghg emission directly and indirectly consumed for transplanting harvesting and seedling in rice production systems kasmaprapruet et al 2009 which is in agreement with our findings among the other production inputs the contribution of fertilizers did not show a marked difference concerning the water source used for irrigation and the cultivation system but was mainly related to the rice paddy cultivar showing about 30 lower ghg emissions in low yielding compared with high yielding rice cultivars this decrease was due to the lower inputs i e less irrigation fertilizer and machinery in low yielding cultivars in agreement with yadav et al 2017 indeed a significant positive correlation between ghg emissions and inputs was previously reported by other research pishgar komleh et al 2011 yadav et al 2017 gupta et al 2003 also reported that the higher ghg emission in rice production systems was due to electricity consumption for irrigation nitrogen fertilizer and diesel fuel elsoragaby et al 2019 showed that reducing nitrogen fertilizer consumption in wetland rice cultivation would be beneficial for mitigating global warming in malaysia in conclusion based on the different production inputs and the studied productive scenarios the use of surface water sources could be an important strategy for reducing ghg emissions in rice production systems also the use of traditional transplanting methods and low yielding cultivars could be a good option for mitigating global warming however there is a conflict between ghg emissions and rice self sufficiency through the cultivation of high yielding rice cultivars which may challenge the sustainable food security in developing countries amini et al 2020 therefore moving towards organic farming with lower inputs can be an option to reduce ghg emissions mansoori et al 2012 especially when mechanical transplanting methods and high yielding cultivars should be used for rice self sufficiency 4 2 financial analysis the sum of machinery and human labor inputs on one side agrochemicals and seedling materials inputs on the other contributed with a share of 50 to the total costs which is in agreement with the results found by jirapornvaree et al 2021 they reported that machinery and human labor were the main transaction costs in rice production systems however in our study the cost of machinery was more than two thirds of the total cost in mechanical systems fig 2a b e f and about one fourth in traditional systems fig 2c d g h human labor contributed to about one fourth of the total cost in traditional systems since transplanting was performed by hand conversely in mechanical systems no human labor was used for transplanting thus human labor contributed to just about one tenth of the total costs muazu et al 2014 found that in wetland paddy cultivation in malaysia the highest contribution from machinery derived from harvesting the lowest from fertilizing and spraying operations sharma and singh 2008 indicated that mechanical transplanting allows saving 72 0 and 33 3 in time and labor compared to manual transplanting respectively according to sharma et al 2002 mechanical transplanting in rice cultivation can save 66 of costs with only 7 of manual transplanting time the cost of agrochemicals and seedling materials inputs was rather constant in the different productive scenarios about 20 25 similarly khan et al 2009 reported that rice production cost mainly consists of agrochemicals 15 8 transplanting 25 7 land preparation and seed 10 and others 48 5 in other research the contribution of agrochemical in rice production were 24 9 and 22 6 for intensive and conventional rice systems respectively devi and ponnarasi 2009 in detail the comparison of average costs of the different scenarios indicated that machinery used in field operations including transplanting was the main contributor to total costs that was similar in rice paddy fields irrigated with groundwater and surface irrigation sources in tamil nadu southern india devi and ponnarasi 2009 found that the share of machinery cost was 21 0 and 9 19 under intensive and conventional rice systems respectively lower than those obtained in the present study similar to machinery the same contributions were found also in relation to the cost of seedling materials and human labor while the contribution of agrochemicals i e fertilizers and pesticides was much lower in rice paddy fields irrigated with surface water sources by about 21 particularly in the fields with mechanical cultivation and low yielding cultivars sml and traditional cultivation and high yielding cultivars sth with a contribution close to 22 in both scenarios the minimum contribution of agrochemicals was found in the fields with traditional cultivation and low yielding cultivars stl about 20 this is in relation to lower costs derived from nitrogen or potassium inputs particularly for low yielding cultivars similar results were reported by jirapornvaree et al 2021 who reported a share of agrochemical inputs ranging from 24 to 27 in different rice production systems ayambila et al 2008 indicated also that the contribution of human labor averaged 44 5 of the total cost of rice production in rainfed upland systems 20 8 in flat valleys and 36 9 on irrigated rice paddy field systems average total gross return derived from the sale of rice paddy and straw yield was higher in the fields irrigated with the surface water source compared to the groundwater source about 15300 vs 14200 us particularly in the productive scenarios with both mechanical and traditional systems coupled with high yielding cultivars smh and sth about 16500 us one of the main reasons for this change may be due to higher yields along with lower chemical inputs consumption in these conditions mojarad et al 2018 showed that the surface water supplied by channel networks had a positive effect on safflower productivity the best option to limit the cost of the different inputs while obtaining a higher yield gross return from rice paddy fields in the study area is the use of the surface water source for irrigation either with mechanical and traditional cultivation but coupled with high yielding cultivars and to a lesser extent with the mechanical and traditional cultivation of low yielding cultivars 4 3 yield water use and financial indicators rice paddy yield differed among the scenarios being higher in paddy fields irrigated with surface water sources in mechanical cultivation systems and in high yielding cultivars higher rice paddy yields under surface water sources systems could be expected because surface water in the channel network of the studied region is slightly enriched by nutrients derived from the penetration of soil solution into the surrounding open channels moreover the fields irrigated with surface water are mostly located in an area with intensive rice cultivation and high applied nitrogen fertilizers the nitrate as a common and mobile nitrogen form in soils is easily leached into the surface water channels leading to the enrichment of surface water by nitrate these are the reasons why the fields irrigated with surface water need less nitrogen fertilizer similar results were found by hou et al 2021 who reported that rice cultivation is a potential source of nutrient losses to water since any excess of nutrients from fertilizers can be lost mainly to surface water bodies by runoff up to 57 and 60 for n and p respectively singh et al 2006 reported that rice yield can increase up to 23 with mechanical versus manual transplanting mainly due to a higher plant density singh et al 2006 these results are strictly linked to the water use that was higher under irrigation with surface water source systems in mechanical cultivation and in high yielding cultivars the same results were found in kazakhstan by saltanat et al 2015 who reported that due to low irrigation water productivity the volume of water use increased by 30 when rice farmers supplied water from the rivers through a network of irrigation channels and was higher than those found in this study 10 higher under surface water source systems however irrigation water productivity was not much higher under irrigation with groundwater source systems 0 61 vs 0 60 due to the lower yields and water use in this system compared to the irrigation with surface water sources as well as not much higher under traditional cultivation 0 62 vs 0 59 due to the lower yields and water use compared to the mechanical system and much higher with high yielding rice cultivars 0 66 vs 0 55 due to the higher rice paddy yield per water use compared to low yielding cultivars average total cost of rice paddy production in us was lower in fields irrigated with surface water source systems with mechanical cultivation and with low yielding cultivars the average gross and net return in us were both higher with surface water source systems mechanical cultivation and high yielding cultivars these results are consistent with the benefit cost ratio and the productivity index that were higher under irrigation with surface water source systems mechanical cultivation and high yielding cultivars like our findings various rice cropping systems in northern iran showed different economic performance ranging from 1 3 to 1 6 for benefit cost ratio and 1 02 1 12 kg us 1 for productivity index depending on the paddy farm size and the use of inputs i e human labor machinery agrochemicals irrigation and seedling costs vahedi et al 2020 in guilan province of iran pishgar komleh et al 2011 the average reported benefit cost ratio was lower compared to our case study 1 29 vs 1 60 respectively the benefit cost ratio was instead similar to the findings of khan et al 2009 in china 1 68 but lower than the results obtained by khan et al 2010 in new south wales australia 3 33 as a fact costs and gross returns depend on country s economy and the benefit cost ratio can be higher when economy is more advanced compared to less developed countries where farmers have higher input costs which do not allow to achieve optimum benefits muazu et al 2014 the economic water use productivity was slightly higher in fields irrigated with surface water source systems and low yielding rice cultivars slightly lower in mechanical cultivation kumar et al 2019 in punjab india reported that the economic water productivity based on gross return were 5 32 10 1 r m 3 for rice paddy and 14 9 22 2 r m 3 for wheat finally the net return in relation to gwp expressed in kg co2eq ha 1 that can be considered an eco efficiency indicator that pools the economic return and the release of ghgs sinha et al 2020 was higher under irrigation with surface water source systems in traditional cultivation and in high yielding rice cultivars the reason is the higher net return of rice paddy fields coupled with a lower gwp under these conditions 5 conclusion the best option for higher and more profitable yields among the studied rice production scenarios is definitely the use of surface water sources for irrigation that however implies a higher water use considering irrigation water productivity traditional cultivation and high yielding rice cultivars coupled with irrigation from the surface water source for irrigation should be preferred in terms of financial benefits the best combination is irrigation with surface water mechanical cultivation and high yielding cultivars however net return in relation to global warming potential indicated that irrigation with surface water source systems traditional cultivation and high yielding rice cultivars proved more eco efficient from the financial point of view farmers using groundwater for irrigation have high costs that can be alleviated using surface water sources similarly costs of human labor can be reduced adopting mechanical transplanting that also provides higher plant densities and higher yields and gross returns thus results can support farmers in selecting more environmentally and economically sustainable rice production systems in iran and in other less developed countries where higher input costs are a limitation to achieve optimum benefits from agricultural activity the improvement of high yielding cultivation practices along with surface water availability needs to be prioritized by policy makers for pursuing the sustainable rice production at a large scale in northern iran reclamation of drainage channel for widespread use of the surface water across the paddy fields accompanied with regulating a minimum profitable purchasing high yielding price by policy makers in iran can potentially encourage the farmers to produce the high yielding rice varieties with surface water this policy strategy is more pronounced for farmers when the supplies are abundant during harvest seasons meanwhile the investment on improving the channel network infrastructure of the studied region for circulating the outlets of the upland paddy fields into drainage channel may enhance the use of surface water for irrigation in low lying areas leading to the considerable contribution of irrigation water productivity at province scale assessment we further suggest policy interventions according to scenarios including eliminating electricity and water subsidies to those farmers who implement the irrigation with ground water source the government should expand the irrigation network in the area for effective surface water source and provide free consulting services to farmers who implement surface water source to help them improve their gross return these suggestions are likely to be politically acceptable because increasing stakeholder s gross return yields is also a priority for the central government for a strategically important crop as rice credit authorship contribution statement esmaeil bakhshandeh conceptualization methodology

9355,adopting environmentally and economically sustainable rice production systems is essential to achieve better results in terms of yield financial profitability and eco efficiency this study compares the ghg emissions and the financial analysis based on both costs and gross return and some financial indicators in eight rice paddy production systems in northern iran under the combination of three factors two water irrigation sources groundwater by wells and surface water by rivers two groups of rice cultivars low and high yielding and two transplanting methods traditional and mechanical the average total ghg emissions were 117 6 higher in groundwater than surface water systems 12 4 higher in mechanical than traditional systems and 20 8 higher in high yielding than low yielding rice cultivars the highest ghg share in groundwater systems was as average for electricity 52 2 while in surface water systems was diesel fuel 51 0 the best option for higher and more profitable yields among the studied rice production scenarios was the use of the surface water source for irrigation that however implies a higher water use considering irrigation water productivity traditional cultivation and high yielding rice cultivars coupled with irrigation from the surface water source could be preferred in terms of yield profitability that is summarized by the benefit cost

sustainable agricultural production is crucial due to the increasing global population which is expected to increase global food demand in the future decades tilman et al 2011 generally food security in many parts of the world will face many challenges due to the negative impacts of climate change and the decreasing availability of land and water which are unequally distributed around the world jamali et al 2021a therefore the use of highly resource efficient practices along with lower inputs i e water chemical fertilizers and fossil fuel and limiting the costs of environmental effects are necessary to overcome these challenges liu et al 2016 rice oryza sativa l is the second highest grain production in the world with an annual production of 755 5 million tons which is produced from an area of 162 million ha fao 2020 and provides food for more than 50 of the world s population bakhshandeh et al 2018 in asia rice covers 35 60 of the daily calories requirement khush 2013 and is also known as the second most important staple food for the iranian dietary bakhshandeh et al 2020 vahedi 2021 it is estimated that 18 of the world s cultivated area consumes about 40 of global water resources which is supplied by exploiting groundwater and by rivers as a surface water source siebert et al 2010 however rice is often cultivated in lowland systems and 75 of rice production in the world is under continuously flooded conditions irri 2017 maraseni et al 2018 while it can be successfully grown under low water conditions bhatt et al 2019 based on the report by tuong and bouman 2003 by 2025 20 of rice cultivated areas will be exposed to physical water scarcity while 29 may take care of the economic water scarcity several factors influence rice production such as availability of natural resources climate conditions farming practices and socio economic circumstances bhatt et al 2019 among these factors water is known as the first important factor and is followed by nitrogen chen et al 2016 deng et al 2015 yao et al 2017 thus efficient management of land water and chemical fertilizers is necessary for ensuring food security along with reducing any negative influence on the environment li et al 2020 fernández et al 2020 in the past decade the agriculture sector has remarkably changed shifting towards high input based systems thus environmental impacts from high input farming have become a major concern astier et al 2014 on the other hand higher inputs also result in higher greenhouse gas ghg emissions and subsequently increase global warming jamali et al 2021b according to anon 2019 ghg emission from the agricultural sector increased more than 2 folds in the last 55 years mainly in developing countries the use of chemical fertilizer and ch4 emission from flooded paddy fields are two main factors for global warming with a contribution to the total agricultural ghg emissions of 13 and 10 respectively yao et al 2009 however agricultural inputs and ghg emissions depend on crop type and crop management as a consequence evaluating ghg emissions may provide specific information tailored to the different cropping systems about the environmental impacts and would support a more effective decision making process by agricultural managers and policy makers however considering only the global warming potential gwp does not provide a clear picture and gwp must be related to the financial of production to achieve a balanced analysis actually this area has been scarcely investigated but eco efficiency is frequently used as an indicator to relate the environmental impact of a production system and the financial aspects in the context of gwp eco efficiency is defined as the ratio of economic parameters and the release of ghg emissions sinha et al 2020 considering water productivity the economic benefits obtained from the output i e agricultural yield and the related costs of water use in agricultural production systems must be considered brar et al 2015 taking into account the ratio between the profit produced by a crop and the irrigation water applied fernández et al 2020 moreover kumar et al 2019 in punjab india proposed the ratio of gross return value to water supplied to calculate water productivity in rice paddy and wheat in southern california dinar 1993 proposed the ratio between the net value of output and the water supplied sutton and jones 1994 suggested adopting the net profit per unit of area at the crop field level consequently finding the best rice cropping system requires an economic evaluation of production costs and net returns along with higher profitable yields numerous studies worldwide focused on the impacts of farm management on rice production but few considered those of water source and technology on environmental and financial aspects on the other hand comprehensive studies on environmental and financial impacts linked to various rice production systems e g different in terms of water source variety and machinery were not studied in the world including northern iran this is necessary for deeper insights into achieving sustainable agricultural goals and also to guide future environmental and financial policies on irrigation and technology regulations therefore this study aimed to compare ghg emissions and financial analysis in different rice paddy production systems under the combination of three factors two water irrigation sources groundwater and surface two groups of rice cultivars low and high yielding and two transplanting methods traditional and mechanical 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the present study was carried out in the north of iran mazandaran province this province is located at between 35º 46 to 36º 58 latitude n and 50º 21 to 54º

growing season the climate in mazandaran province is classified into four categories eastern regions with a mediterranean climate central regions humid western very humid and mountainous parts semi humid based on the de martonne climate classification rice is a main cultivated crop in this region due to favorable climate conditions and 77 of the total cultivated area with cereals in the province is under rice production 270000 ha vs 350000 ha 2 2 description of rice paddy production scenarios eight rice paddy production scenarios were considered in the current study these scenarios differed

the groundwater and river for the surface water source t and m traditional and mechanical transplanting methods and l and h low and high yielding rice cultivars respectively for this purpose 200 rice growers of mazandaran province were interviewed in 2020 and the data related to paddy fields management were collected using a face to face questionnaire in particular a total of 25 rice growers were randomly selected for each scenario sample size is consistent with other published studies on this topic in particular sample size is similar or even higher compared with the existing literature in detail alimagham et al 2017 and kazemi et al 2016 considered 26 and 36 farmers respectively truong et al 2017 canakci et al 2005 and cabasan et al 2019 interviewed 90 102 and 112 farmers respectively while quilty et al 2014 and jamali et al 2021b considered 222 and 250 farmers respectively in the province transplanting is the most used method for rice planting which is performed manually and more recently by machine since manual transplanting is a labor consuming operation however many smaller rice growers still adopt the traditional manual transplanting method the main rice paddy cultivars are neda and shiroodi as high yielding and tarom mahhalli and tarom hashemi as low yielding rice paddy cultivars in addition the two main water sources for rice paddy irrigation are rivers as surface water connected with a network of irrigation channels with paddy fields and groundwater wells besides rainfall the seedlings age at transplanting is 20 25 days and the rice paddy hill density is 12 25 hill per meter depending on the cultivar and cultivation method the nurseries are usually prepared during march may and the transplanting date is in april may while harvesting is performed during july and august depending on the cultivar and transplanting method urea 46 n potassium sulfate k2so4 50 k and 18 s triple superphosphate ca h2po4 46 p2o5 and a complex macro fertilizer 15 n 15 k2o 5 p2o5 5 s 1 si and 1 zn are the main chemical fertilizers used in this region at transplanting time one third of urea and total potassium sulfate and triple superphosphate are applied as basal fertilization and the rest of urea is commonly split twice as top dressing beginning of tillering and beginning of the anthesis stage depending on the farmer in addition fenvalerate diazinon and cypermethrin as insecticides tricyclazole beam and nativo tebuconazole 50 trifloxystrobin 25 as fungicides and butachlor bentazon and thiobencarb saturn 50 as herbicides are mainly applied by rice paddy growers in the study area 2 3 ghg emissions to determine the ghg emissions under the different rice paddy production scenarios carbon emission equivalents of the used agricultural inputs were considered table 1

in response to global warming studying ghg emissions from rice cropping systems is necessary because rice production contributes to about 55 of ghg emissions in the agricultural sector arunrat et al 2021 hwang et al 2021 ghg emissions were lower in paddy fields irrigated with the surface water source compared to those irrigated with the groundwater source which could be due to lower nitrogen fertilizer application and also no electricity consumption for irrigation on the other hand while surface water is directly diverted from the rivers through a network of irrigation channels irrigation with groundwater has a high electricity consumption for water pumping from the wells 50 similar results were reported by chaudhary et al 2017 who indicated that electricity consumption by rice farmers which is mainly used for irrigation had the highest contribution to total ghg emissions in addition ghg emissions were lower in low yielding cultivars that have a shorter growing period and lower fertilization input and in traditional methods for transplanting due to the lower diesel fuel used diesel fuel is considered as the second highest contributor in ghg emission directly and indirectly consumed for transplanting harvesting and seedling in rice production systems kasmaprapruet et al 2009 which is in agreement with our findings among the other production inputs the contribution of fertilizers did not show a marked difference concerning the water source used for irrigation and the cultivation system but was mainly related to the rice paddy cultivar showing about 30 lower ghg emissions in low yielding compared with high yielding rice cultivars this decrease was due to the lower inputs i e less irrigation fertilizer and machinery in low yielding cultivars in agreement with yadav et al 2017 indeed a significant positive correlation between ghg emissions and inputs was previously reported by other research pishgar komleh et al 2011 yadav et al 2017 gupta et al 2003 also reported that the higher ghg emission in rice production systems was due to electricity consumption for irrigation nitrogen fertilizer and diesel fuel elsoragaby et al 2019 showed that reducing nitrogen fertilizer consumption in wetland rice cultivation would be beneficial for mitigating global warming in malaysia in conclusion based on the different production inputs and the studied productive scenarios the use of surface water sources could be an important strategy for reducing ghg emissions in rice production systems also the use of traditional transplanting methods and low yielding cultivars could be a good option for mitigating global warming however there is a conflict between ghg emissions and rice self sufficiency through the cultivation of high yielding rice cultivars which may challenge the sustainable food security in developing countries amini et al 2020 therefore moving towards organic farming with lower inputs can be an option to reduce ghg emissions mansoori et al 2012 especially when mechanical transplanting methods and high yielding cultivars should be used for rice self sufficiency 4 2 financial analysis the sum of machinery and human labor inputs on one side agrochemicals and seedling materials inputs on the other contributed with a share of 50 to the total costs which is in agreement with the results found by jirapornvaree et al 2021 they reported that machinery and human labor were the main transaction costs in rice production systems however in our study the cost of machinery was more than two thirds of the total cost in mechanical systems fig 2a b e f and about one fourth in traditional systems fig 2c d g h human labor contributed to about one fourth of the total cost in traditional systems since transplanting was performed by hand conversely in mechanical systems no human labor was used for transplanting thus human labor contributed to just about one tenth of the total costs muazu et al 2014 found that in wetland paddy cultivation in malaysia the highest contribution from machinery derived from harvesting the lowest from fertilizing and spraying operations sharma and singh 2008 indicated that mechanical transplanting allows saving 72 0 and 33 3 in time and labor compared to manual transplanting respectively according to sharma et al 2002 mechanical transplanting in rice cultivation can save 66 of costs with only 7 of manual transplanting time the cost of agrochemicals and seedling materials inputs was rather constant in the different productive scenarios about 20 25 similarly khan et al 2009 reported that rice production cost mainly consists of agrochemicals 15 8 transplanting 25 7 land preparation and seed 10 and others 48 5 in other research the contribution of agrochemical in rice production were 24 9 and 22 6 for intensive and conventional rice systems respectively devi and ponnarasi 2009 in detail the comparison of average costs of the different scenarios indicated that machinery used in field operations including transplanting was the main contributor to total costs that was similar in rice paddy fields irrigated with groundwater and surface irrigation sources in tamil nadu southern india devi and ponnarasi 2009 found that the share of machinery cost was 21 0 and 9 19 under intensive and conventional rice systems respectively lower than those obtained in the present study similar to machinery the same contributions were found also in relation to the cost of seedling materials and human labor while the contribution of agrochemicals i e fertilizers and pesticides was much lower in rice paddy fields irrigated with surface water sources by about 21 particularly in the fields with mechanical cultivation and low yielding cultivars sml and traditional cultivation and high yielding cultivars sth with a contribution close to 22 in both scenarios the minimum contribution of agrochemicals was found in the fields with traditional cultivation and low yielding cultivars stl about 20 this is in relation to lower costs derived from nitrogen or potassium inputs particularly for low yielding cultivars similar results were reported by jirapornvaree et al 2021 who reported a share of agrochemical inputs ranging from 24 to 27 in different rice production systems ayambila et al 2008 indicated also that the contribution of human labor averaged 44 5 of the total cost of rice production in rainfed upland systems 20 8 in flat valleys and 36 9 on irrigated rice paddy field systems average total gross return derived from the sale of rice paddy and straw yield was higher in the fields irrigated with the surface water source compared to the groundwater source about 15300 vs 14200 us particularly in the productive scenarios with both mechanical and traditional systems coupled with high yielding cultivars smh and sth about 16500 us one of the main reasons for this change may be due to higher yields along with lower chemical inputs consumption in these conditions mojarad et al 2018 showed that the surface water supplied by channel networks had a positive effect on safflower productivity the best option to limit the cost of the different inputs while obtaining a higher yield gross return from rice paddy fields in the study area is the use of the surface water source for irrigation either with mechanical and traditional cultivation but coupled with high yielding cultivars and to a lesser extent with the mechanical and traditional cultivation of low yielding cultivars 4 3 yield water use and financial indicators rice paddy yield differed among the scenarios being higher in paddy fields irrigated with surface water sources in mechanical cultivation systems and in high yielding cultivars higher rice paddy yields under surface water sources systems could be expected because surface water in the channel network of the studied region is slightly enriched by nutrients derived from the penetration of soil solution into the surrounding open channels moreover the fields irrigated with surface water are mostly located in an area with intensive rice cultivation and high applied nitrogen fertilizers the nitrate as a common and mobile nitrogen form in soils is easily leached into the surface water channels leading to the enrichment of surface water by nitrate these are the reasons why the fields irrigated with surface water need less nitrogen fertilizer similar results were found by hou et al 2021 who reported that rice cultivation is a potential source of nutrient losses to water since any excess of nutrients from fertilizers can be lost mainly to surface water bodies by runoff up to 57 and 60 for n and p respectively singh et al 2006 reported that rice yield can increase up to 23 with mechanical versus manual transplanting mainly due to a higher plant density singh et al 2006 these results are strictly linked to the water use that was higher under irrigation with surface water source systems in mechanical cultivation and in high yielding cultivars the same results were found in kazakhstan by saltanat et al 2015 who reported that due to low irrigation water productivity the volume of water use increased by 30 when rice farmers supplied water from the rivers through a network of irrigation channels and was higher than those found in this study 10 higher under surface water source systems however irrigation water productivity was not much higher under irrigation with groundwater source systems 0 61 vs 0 60 due to the lower yields and water use in this system compared to the irrigation with surface water sources as well as not much higher under traditional cultivation 0 62 vs 0 59 due to the lower yields and water use compared to the mechanical system and much higher with high yielding rice cultivars 0 66 vs 0 55 due to the higher rice paddy yield per water use compared to low yielding cultivars average total cost of rice paddy production in us was lower in fields irrigated with surface water source systems with mechanical cultivation and with low yielding cultivars the average gross and net return in us were both higher with surface water source systems mechanical cultivation and high yielding cultivars these results are consistent with the benefit cost ratio and the productivity index that were higher under irrigation with surface water source systems mechanical cultivation and high yielding cultivars like our findings various rice cropping systems in northern iran showed different economic performance ranging from 1 3 to 1 6 for benefit cost ratio and 1 02 1 12 kg us 1 for productivity index depending on the paddy farm size and the use of inputs i e human labor machinery agrochemicals irrigation and seedling costs vahedi et al 2020 in guilan province of iran pishgar komleh et al 2011 the average reported benefit cost ratio was lower compared to our case study 1 29 vs 1 60 respectively the benefit cost ratio was instead similar to the findings of khan et al 2009 in china 1 68 but lower than the results obtained by khan et al 2010 in new south wales australia 3 33 as a fact costs and gross returns depend on country s economy and the benefit cost ratio can be higher when economy is more advanced compared to less developed countries where farmers have higher input costs which do not allow to achieve optimum benefits muazu et al 2014 the economic water use productivity was slightly higher in fields irrigated with surface water source systems and low yielding rice cultivars slightly lower in mechanical cultivation kumar et al 2019 in punjab india reported that the economic water productivity based on gross return were 5 32 10 1 r m 3 for rice paddy and 14 9 22 2 r m 3 for wheat finally the net return in relation to gwp expressed in kg co2eq ha 1 that can be considered an eco efficiency indicator that pools the economic return and the release of ghgs sinha et al 2020 was higher under irrigation with surface water source systems in traditional cultivation and in high yielding rice cultivars the reason is the higher net return of rice paddy fields coupled with a lower gwp under these conditions 5 conclusion the best option for higher and more profitable yields among the studied rice production scenarios is definitely the use of surface water sources for irrigation that however implies a higher water use considering irrigation water productivity traditional cultivation and high yielding rice cultivars coupled with irrigation from the surface water source for irrigation should be preferred in terms of financial benefits the best combination is irrigation with surface water mechanical cultivation and high yielding cultivars however net return in relation to global warming potential indicated that irrigation with surface water source systems traditional cultivation and high yielding rice cultivars proved more eco efficient from the financial point of view farmers using groundwater for irrigation have high costs that can be alleviated using surface water sources similarly costs of human labor can be reduced adopting mechanical transplanting that also provides higher plant densities and higher yields and gross returns thus results can support farmers in selecting more environmentally and economically sustainable rice production systems in iran and in other less developed countries where higher input costs are a limitation to achieve optimum benefits from agricultural activity the improvement of high yielding cultivation practices along with surface water availability needs to be prioritized by policy makers for pursuing the sustainable rice production at a large scale in northern iran reclamation of drainage channel for widespread use of the surface water across the paddy fields accompanied with regulating a minimum profitable purchasing high yielding price by policy makers in iran can potentially encourage the farmers to produce the high yielding rice varieties with surface water this policy strategy is more pronounced for farmers when the supplies are abundant during harvest seasons meanwhile the investment on improving the channel network infrastructure of the studied region for circulating the outlets of the upland paddy fields into drainage channel may enhance the use of surface water for irrigation in low lying areas leading to the considerable contribution of irrigation water productivity at province scale assessment we further suggest policy interventions according to scenarios including eliminating electricity and water subsidies to those farmers who implement the irrigation with ground water source the government should expand the irrigation network in the area for effective surface water source and provide free consulting services to farmers who implement surface water source to help them improve their gross return these suggestions are likely to be politically acceptable because increasing stakeholder s gross return yields is also a priority for the central government for a strategically important crop as rice credit authorship contribution statement esmaeil bakhshandeh conceptualization methodology

9356,ammonium nh4 has been reported as the preferred mineral n source a preference for nh4 uptake over no3 for rice oryza sativa l the predominant supply of nh4 has been hypothesized as a means of increasing the n recovery efficiency nre however the contribution of nh4 preference to nre is unclear under different irrigation regimes to evaluate the nre of rice as affected by varied n supply forms rice cv suijing 18 was grown in a pot experiment with 15n nh4 or 15n no3 applied to flooded and water saving irrigation regimes at harvest plant biomass n accumulation and the fate of 15n labeled n in the plant soil system were assessed ammonium n application enhanced rice shoot growth compared with nitrate n under both irrigation regimes this enhancement by nh4 was further promoted under water saving irrigation in contrast nitrate n enhanced rice root growth more fertilizer derived n residues in the soil compared with those of nh4 treated regardless of the irrigation regimes ammonium enhanced the nre of rice compared with no3 treated under flooded irrigation however the so called preference for nh4 by rice did not always turn into high n recovery efficiency and there was no difference in nre of rice between varied n supply forms under water saving irrigation even if nh4 is preferred by the rice the n cycle in the paddy soil is complex and dynamic especially under water saving irrigation which resulted in a rapid conversion of the applied 15nh4 to no3 and hence less opportunities for rice to take up the applied 15nh4 therefore the nitrogen preference of plants is not the only critical factor in selecting a proper nitrogen fertilizer source for rice it is better to take the match of plant n preference n fertilizer type and irrigation regime into consideration to optimize irrigation and fertilization management and increase the nre of plants keywords rice water saving irrigation nitrogen recovery efficiency plant nitrogen preference data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is one of the most important cereal crops and the staple food for more than 50 of the world s population more than 135 million hectares of land worldwide is utilized for rice cultivation li et al 2014 wells et al 2014 nitrogen n input is a vital nutrient for achieving significant gains in rice production zhu et al 2018 however n recovery efficiency nre is as low as 20 40 in rice production jin 2012 zhang et al 2011 low nre is associated with severe environmental problems such as soil acidification eutrophication of surface waters nitrate pollution in groundwater and greenhouse gas emissions dimkpa et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 lee et al 2020 rankinen et al 2019 xu et al 2020 thus improving the nre is crucial to ensure the sustainability of the rice production system fertilizing crops with preferred n form generally ammonium n nh4 n or nitrate n no3 n is an important practice to improve crop yield and nre ma et al 2015 many studies have attempted to identify the preferred mineral forms of n fertilizer for different crops by investigating the direct impact on crop metabolism growth and yield andrews et al 2013 brackin et al 2015 britto and kronzucker 2013 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 generally rice is considered an ammonium preferring crop with a high assimilation capacity of this cation kirk 2001 ying hua et al 2006 this also generally infers that the nre of rice can be improved when supplied with ammonium based fertilizer baker et al 2001 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 several previous case studies argued that fertilization with rice s preferred n form did not always guarantee an improved nre kronzucker et al 1997 li et al 2013 even in flooded conditions nitrate is also found to be a major n source for rice as nitrification in the rhizosphere can result in 25 40 of the total crop n being taken up in the form of nitrate kirk and kronzucker 2005 however few studies have focused on the effect of the varied n supply form on rice nre which is vital to insight the rice adaptation to soil available nutrients under varied environment conditions furthermore the nre of plants depends not only on the form of external mineral n inputs ammonium or nitrate but also the soil n dynamics zhang et al 2016 the nitrogen fertilizer applied to the soil might firstly participate in the soil n cycling process to different degrees before it is taken up by plants ammonium nitrogen may be transformed into nitrate n by nitrification and the nitrate n may be transformed into ammonium n by assimilation remineralization or alienation reduction li et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 these processes vary among soils under different conditions affecting the direct availability of applied n fertilizer and its contribution to rice n uptake as well as its nre for rice cultivation water saving irrigation wsi such as controlled irrigation shallow wet irrigation and intermittent irrigation has been widely adopted by farmers to cope with the rapid increase in agricultural water consumption tied to the continuous increase in rice planting area zhuang et al 2019 chen et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 wsi is thought to meet the sustainable development goals sdgs and has been considered as a promising management practice for sustainable rice production agent for sustainable development 2019 in water saving irrigation paddies the n form changed from ammonium n dominated under traditional flooded irrigation to the ammonium nitro mixed state which also changed the fate of fertilizer n previous studies have shown that ammonium nitrogen fertilizer can enhance the water utilization efficiency photosynthesis and biomass of rice under water saving irrigation gao et al 2010 in contrast it has been demonstrated that no3 n is much more important than nh4 n for the promotion of nitrogen nutrition in rice and its nre li et al 2007 an 15n isotope tracer experiment showed that the cross membrane absorption of nitrate n in the rice root system is higher than that of ammonium n kronzucker et al 2001 although much progress has been achieved in understanding the mechanisms underlying no3 and nh4 uptake by rice and the effects of applying different n forms of fertilizer limited information is available regarding the relationship between the preference n forms of rice and nre under water saving irrigation in this study a pot experiment with water saving or flooded irrigation was conducted with a combination of 15n labeled fertilizers 15nh4 2so4 and na15no3 the objective of this study was to evaluate 1 the responses in rice growth to 15n labeled nh4 n and no3 n fertilizers under different irrigation regimes and 2 whether nh4 n fertilizers have implications for increasing the nre of rice compared with no3 n fertilizers under both water saving and flooded irrigation the results will improve our understanding on rice plant adaption to n supply forms as well as the interaction effect of irrigation regimes and nitrogen forms on rice nre that will be important for optimizing the irrigation and fertilization management in rice production 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil collection and properties soil for the experiment was collected from the state key station for irrigation experiment in the heping irrigation district 127 40 45 e 46 57 28 n

the graphs were plotted by origin 9 0 software origin lab corporation ma usa 3 results 3 1 rice growth significant interactions on rice leaf and stem growth between irrigation regimes and n forms were observed table 3 compared with no3 treatment nh4 application increased the dry weight of leaf stem and panicle by 25 8 27 9 and 21 9 respectively under water saving irrigation and by 8 1 11 7 and 12 0 respectively under flooded irrigation fig 3a b c in contrast no3 application enhanced the root growth under both irrigation regimes with the root dry weight increased by 31 6 under water saving irrigation and by 20 1 under flooded irrigation fig 3d compared with flooded irrigation water saving irrigation increased the leaf and stem dry weight by 21 5 and 13 8 respectively in response to nh4 supply and the root dry weight was found increases by 30 8 when no3 was applied water saving irrigation had little effect on the leaf and stem dry weight under no3 treatment the root dry weight under nh4 treatment and the panicle dry weight under both nh4 and no3 treatments fig 3 3 2 n uptake by rice no significant interactions on the n content of rice organs between irrigation regimes and n forms were observed table 4 there was no significant difference in rice leaf and root n contents between water saving and flooded irrigation regardless of nh4 or no3 supply fig 4 compared with no3 treatment nh4 application increased the rice stem n content and panicle n content by 23 2 and 22 4 respectively under water saving irrigation and by 19 1 and 27 9 respectively under fi fig 4b c compared with that of the flooded irrigation treatment water saving irrigation significantly p 0 05 increased the stem 17 4 21 4 and panicle 12 1 17 2 n content in the presence of nh4 and no3 supply fig 4b c n accumulation in the aboveground rice organs was much higher in the presence of nh4 than no3 under either water saving or flooded irrigation fig 5 the roots accumulated more n in the presence of no3 than nh4 under water saving or flooded irrigation fig 5d compared with flooded irrigation water saving irrigation increased n accumulation in the shoots but not in the roots regardless of nh4 and no3 supply fig 5a c these results suggest that nh4 input and water saving irrigation improve the total n uptake by rice 3 3 nre and the fate of fertilizer n in the rice soil system the n uptake from 15n labeled fertilizer was higher in the presence of nh4 than no3 under flooded irrigation in contrast no difference was detected between nh4 and no3 for 15n labeled fertilizer recovery in the whole plant under water saving irrigation p 0 1 fig 6a the residual soil n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer was lower in the presence of nh4 than no3 under both water saving and flooded irrigation regimes fig 6b although the loss of n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer was slightly higher for nh4 treatment than no3 treatment under both water saving and flooded irrigation regimes the difference was not significant fig 6c regardless of nh4 or no3 water saving irrigation increased the n uptake from 15n labeled fertilizer by rice and reduced the residual soil n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer irrigation had less of an effect on the loss of n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer table 5 the percentages of n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer in the rice plant soil and loss under the different treatments were calculated fig 7 most of the n from 15n labeled fertilizer was taken up by rice plants the proportion 58 72 62 43 of the nre of rice under water saving irrigation was much higher than under flooded irrigation 36 91 48 48 regardless of nh4 or no3 supply the nre of rice plant fertilized with nh4 was significantly higher than that of plants supplied with no3 under flooded irrigation however no significant difference in the nre of rice was observed between nh4 and no3 under water saving irrigation in addition a much higher proportion 19 0 34 4 of the n fertilizer remained in the soil n pool when no3 was applied than when nh4 was applied 12 6 20 7 under both water saving and flooded irrigation conditions fig 6 3 4 residual nh4 and no3 in soil at harvest the contents and 15n abundances of no3 and nh4 in the soil were determined at harvest table 6 among the four treatments the contents of total nh4 n and nh4 n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer under flooded irrigation with nh4 were the highest the contents of total no3 n and no3 n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer were higher with no3 n fertilization than nh4 n fertilization the sum of soil nh4 n and no3 n contents was 22 7 85 5 higher for treatments in which no3 was applied than when nh4 was applied under both irrigation regimes furthermore the sum of soil nh4 n and no3 n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer was 54 1 69 7 higher for treatments when no3 was applied than when nh4 was applied table 6 irrigation regimes and n fertilizer forms had significant effects on the sum of nh4 n and no3 n in the soil and significant interactions between irrigation regimes and n forms were observed p 0 05 compared with the flooded irrigation regime water saving irrigation increased the sum of nh4 n and no3 n by 16 1 27 4 regardless of whether nh4 or no3 was applied water saving irrigation significantly increased soil inorganic n content at harvest however the amount of n derived from fertilizer was similar between water saving irrigation and flooded irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 does rice s preference for ammonium turn into a higher nre the nre is an important indicator of fertilizer n uptake efficiency which can be used to evaluate the contribution of n fertilizer in the crop growing season many researchers have used the 15n enriched tracer technique to quantify the nre chen et al 2019 guo et al 2021 besides the nre does not require setting up a control treatment without fertilization and does not indicate whether the n taken up by the plant was converted into biomass which is unlike nitrogen use efficiency nue calculations generally rice is considered a typical ammonium preferring crop kirk 2001 ying hua et al 2006 kronzucker et al 2001 and tabuchi et al 2007 reported that the uptake rate of rice was initially faster for nh4 than no3 and rice preferred nh4 over no3 this generally infers that the nre of rice can be improved when ammonium based fertilizer is supplied the present results demonstrated that rice supplied with nh4 had a significantly enhanced nre under flooded irrigation yet no significant difference in the rice nre was observed between nh4 and no3 treatment under wsi conditions there are several explanations for this phenomenon i there was a higher n accumulation in rice with nh4 application compared to no3 application due to the growth preference of rice for nh4 but this does not imply a higher nre for 15nh4 than no3 although nh4 is preferred by rice the n cycle in the soil is complex and dynamic especially under water saving conditions where soil temperature and moisture conditions favor the process of nitrification a rapid conversion of 15nh4 to no3 girsang et al 2020 more 15nh4 was lost during this process resulting in less opportunity for rice to take up the applied 15nh4 as observed in this experiment the loss of n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer under wsi conditions was slightly higher with nh4 treatment than with no3 treatment fig 7 the same phenomenon was observed on sugarcane saccharum spp which also prefers ammonium the nre of 15no3 increased and was higher than that of 15nh4 when no3 dominated boschiero et al 2018 we can infer that the rate of soil no3 uptake by rice increased with decreasing applied 15nh4 availability in the soil ii previous investigations have shown that soil microorganisms could strongly compete with nh4 preferring plants for nh4 the nh4 may have been immobilized more intensely than no3 under water saving irrigation aerobic conditions he et al 2021 due to the aerobic soil environment likely enhanced soil microbial activities chen et al 2022 thus hindering the uptake of applied 15nh4 in rice furthermore a higher nre can be obtained even if plants do not grow in the preferred n form that dominates in their growth environment suggesting the importance of irrigation management for rice growth and n accumulation a much higher proportion 58 7 62 4 of the nre was observed in rice under water saving irrigation than under flooded irrigation condition 36 9 48 5 regardless of nh4 or no3 supply several arguments can explain this phenomenon i the soil nitrogen changed from ammonium n preference uptake by rice as the main form under traditional flooded irrigation to an ammonium nitro mixed state under water saving irrigation rice can adapt to a water saving irrigation soil environment by taking up more nitrate n which was supported by a high expression of the rice nitrate transporter osnrt2 3b fan et al 2016 ii the root morphology of rice was improved during the main growth period under water saving irrigation root physiological activity was strengthened xu et al 2018 and the degree of damage to the cell by the reducing substance such as fe2 and h2s was decreased ju et al 2015 yang et al 2004 which is beneficial for fertilizer n utilization in rice liang et al 2021 4 2 implications for rice n management with different irrigation our results indicate that the n management strategy might differ depending on irrigation management in rice paddies under flooded irrigation nh4 was the predominant inorganic n form in paddy soil nh4 toxicity effects may lead to plant growth retardation biomass reduction structural changes and the formation of short and dense root systems fang et al 2021 because even rice preferring nh4 might develop signs of nh4 toxicity britto and kronzucker 2002 improvement was found in rice root growth in fi paddies when no3 fertilizer was applied fig 3 thus the appropriate application of a few no3 fertilizers combined with nh4 fertilizer at a certain proportion of nh4 to no3 might be an efficient n management strategy to increase the nre of rice as wang et al 2018 and fan et al 2016 has been reported nitrate acts not only as an n nutrient for plants but also as an important signal optimizing rice plant development that can activate the aquaporin and potassium channel transporter to facilitate n uptake however considering the high leachability of no3 fertilizing fi rice with no3 fertilizer should be treated seriously in contrast for wsi paddies the improvement was more obvious in biomass production and n accumulation figs 2 and 4 when no3 fertilizer was replaced by nh4 fig 3 this indicates that rice has an ammonium deficiency and the preference for ammonium is further enhanced in wsi paddies fertilizing wsi rice with nh4 will improve rice growth this same phenomenon was observed in the no3 only conditions of dry land plants for example a mixture with 20 nh4 increased wheat growth by 54 and 80 increases in maize growth with 25 nh4 were observed cox and reisenauer 1973 wang et al 2019 due to the strong nitrification under water saving conditions the applied nh4 could have transformed rapidly into no3 and thus rice cannot effectively utilize nh4 in no3 prevalent circumstances it is better to incorporate nitrification inhibitors with nh4 fertilizer thus the applied nh4 fertilizer will be maintained in the form of nh4 for a longer time offering in more opportunities for rice to take up nh4 as zhang et al 2016 suggested nre can be increased by matching crops with preferred n forms or manipulating soil n transformations thus it is an important way to improve the nre of rice and reduce fertilizer n loss in plant soil systems by providing in depth insight into the relationship between plant n preference n fertilizer type and soil conditions irrigation regime and n transformation the rice nre can be further improved by adjusting the soil nitrogen transformation during the critical period of nitrogen demand to reduce the nitrification loss of fertilizer n and maintain more crop preferred n in the soil it should be noted that as environmental conditions are considerably different in the pot than in the field which may limit our ability to extrapolate our findings to other soils or environmental situations therefore in order to give practical recommendation on the management of fertilizer n forms and irrigation for rice production field experiments are necessary to verify the effects of nh4 and no3 under different irrigation regimes on rice growth and nre 5 conclusions ammonium n application enhanced rice shoot growth compared with those of no3 treated plants under both irrigation regimes in contrast nitrate n enhanced rice root growth compared with nh4 treated plants under both irrigation regimes however a substantial amount of no3 fertilizer remained in the soil after rice harvest rice supplied with nh4 significantly enhanced the nre of rice under flooded irrigation no significant difference in rice nre was observed between nh4 and no3 treatments under wsi conditions we concluded that nh4 enhancement of rice growth relative to no3 treated plants under the present experimental conditions was associated with the n uptake and growth preference of rice for nh4 over no3 this information may disprove the hypothesis that the preference of plants as a means of increasing higher 15n recovery of fertilizer sources especially for rice under water saving irrigation which favored the nitrification process the applied nh4 could have transformed rapidly into no3 and rice cannot effectively utilize nh4 in no3 prevalent circumstances thus a good match of crop n preference n fertilizer type and soil condition irrigation regime and n transformation is critical for enhancing nre and reducing n loss the present experimental results were obtained throughout the rice growing season under pot conditions therefore it is important to further evaluate the effects of nh4 and no3 at different application rates or combinations and field management practices on crop growth and nre under field

9356,ammonium nh4 has been reported as the preferred mineral n source a preference for nh4 uptake over no3 for rice oryza sativa l the predominant supply of nh4 has been hypothesized as a means of increasing the n recovery efficiency nre however the contribution of nh4 preference to nre is unclear under different irrigation regimes to evaluate the nre of rice as affected by varied n supply forms rice cv suijing 18 was grown in a pot experiment with 15n nh4 or 15n no3 applied to flooded and water saving irrigation regimes at harvest plant biomass n accumulation and the fate of 15n labeled n in the plant soil system were assessed ammonium n application enhanced rice shoot growth compared with nitrate n under both irrigation regimes this enhancement by nh4 was further promoted under water saving irrigation in contrast nitrate n enhanced rice root growth more fertilizer derived n residues in the soil compared with those of nh4 treated regardless of the irrigation regimes ammonium enhanced the nre of rice compared with no3 treated under flooded irrigation however the so called preference for nh4 by rice did not always turn into high n recovery efficiency and there was no difference in nre of rice between varied n supply forms under water saving irrigation even if nh4 is preferred by the rice the n cycle in the paddy soil is complex and dynamic especially under water saving irrigation which resulted in a rapid conversion of the applied 15nh4 to no3 and hence less opportunities for rice to take up the applied 15nh4 therefore the nitrogen preference of plants is not the only critical factor in selecting a proper nitrogen fertilizer source for rice it is better to take the match of plant n preference n fertilizer type and irrigation regime into consideration to optimize irrigation and fertilization management and increase the nre of plants keywords rice water saving irrigation nitrogen recovery efficiency plant nitrogen preference data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is one of the most important cereal crops and the staple food for more than 50 of the world s population more than 135 million hectares of land worldwide is utilized for rice cultivation li et al 2014 wells et al 2014 nitrogen n input is a vital nutrient for achieving significant gains in rice production zhu et al 2018 however n recovery efficiency nre is as low as 20 40 in rice production jin 2012 zhang et al 2011 low nre is associated with severe environmental problems such as soil acidification eutrophication of surface waters nitrate pollution in groundwater and greenhouse gas emissions dimkpa et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 lee et al 2020 rankinen et al 2019 xu et al 2020 thus improving the nre is crucial to ensure the sustainability of the rice production system fertilizing crops with preferred n form generally ammonium n nh4 n or nitrate n no3 n is an important practice to improve crop yield and nre ma et al 2015 many studies have attempted to identify the preferred mineral forms of n fertilizer for different crops by investigating the direct impact on crop metabolism growth and yield andrews et al 2013 brackin et al 2015 britto and kronzucker 2013 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 generally rice is considered an ammonium preferring crop with a high assimilation capacity of this cation kirk 2001 ying hua et al 2006 this also generally infers that the nre of rice can be improved when supplied with ammonium based fertilizer baker et al 2001 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 several previous case studies argued that fertilization with rice s preferred n form did not always guarantee an improved nre kronzucker et al 1997 li et al 2013 even in flooded conditions nitrate is also found to be a major n source for rice as nitrification in the rhizosphere can result in 25 40 of the total crop n being taken up in the form of nitrate kirk and kronzucker 2005 however few studies have focused on the effect of the varied n supply form on rice nre which is vital to insight the rice adaptation to soil available nutrients under varied environment conditions furthermore the nre of plants depends not only on the form of external mineral n inputs ammonium or nitrate but also the soil n dynamics zhang et al 2016 the nitrogen fertilizer applied to the soil might firstly participate in the soil n cycling process to different degrees before it is taken up by plants ammonium nitrogen may be transformed into nitrate n by nitrification and the nitrate n may be transformed into ammonium n by assimilation remineralization or alienation reduction li et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 these processes vary among soils under different conditions affecting the direct availability of applied n fertilizer and its contribution to rice n uptake as well as its nre for rice cultivation water saving irrigation wsi such as controlled irrigation shallow wet irrigation and intermittent irrigation has been widely adopted by farmers to cope with the rapid increase in agricultural water consumption tied to the continuous increase in rice planting area zhuang et al 2019 chen et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 wsi is thought to meet the sustainable development goals sdgs and has been considered as a promising management practice for sustainable rice production agent for sustainable development 2019 in water saving irrigation paddies the n form changed from ammonium n dominated under traditional flooded irrigation to the ammonium nitro mixed state which also changed the fate of fertilizer n previous studies have shown that ammonium nitrogen fertilizer can enhance the water utilization efficiency photosynthesis and biomass of rice under water saving irrigation gao et al 2010 in contrast it has been demonstrated that no3 n is much more important than nh4 n for the promotion of nitrogen nutrition in rice and its nre li et al 2007 an 15n isotope tracer experiment showed that the cross membrane absorption of nitrate n in the rice root system is higher than that of ammonium n kronzucker et al 2001 although much progress has been achieved in understanding the mechanisms underlying no3 and nh4 uptake by rice and the effects of applying different n forms of fertilizer limited information is available regarding the relationship between the preference n forms of rice and nre under water saving irrigation in this study a pot experiment with water saving or flooded irrigation was conducted with a combination of 15n labeled fertilizers 15nh4 2so4 and na15no3 the objective of this study was to evaluate 1 the responses in rice growth to 15n labeled nh4 n and no3 n fertilizers under different irrigation regimes and 2 whether nh4 n fertilizers have implications for increasing the nre of rice compared with no3 n fertilizers under both water saving and flooded irrigation the results will improve our understanding on rice plant adaption to n supply forms as well as the interaction effect of irrigation regimes and nitrogen forms on rice nre that will be important for optimizing the irrigation and fertilization management in rice production 2 materials and

observed table 3 compared with no3 treatment nh4 application increased the dry weight of leaf stem and panicle by 25 8 27 9 and 21 9 respectively under water saving irrigation and by 8 1 11 7 and 12 0 respectively under flooded irrigation fig 3a b c in contrast no3 application enhanced the root growth under both irrigation regimes with the root dry weight increased by 31 6 under water saving irrigation and by 20 1 under flooded irrigation fig 3d compared with flooded irrigation water saving irrigation increased the leaf and stem dry weight by 21 5 and 13 8 respectively in response to nh4 supply and the root dry weight was found increases by 30 8 when no3 was applied water saving irrigation had little effect on the leaf and stem dry weight under no3 treatment the root dry weight under nh4 treatment and the panicle dry weight under both nh4 and no3 treatments fig 3 3 2 n uptake by rice no significant interactions on the n content of rice organs between irrigation regimes and n forms were observed table 4 there was no significant difference in rice leaf and root n contents between water saving and flooded irrigation regardless of nh4 or no3 supply fig 4 compared with no3 treatment nh4 application increased the rice stem n content and panicle n content by 23 2 and 22 4 respectively under water saving irrigation and by 19 1 and 27 9 respectively under fi fig 4b c compared with that of the flooded irrigation treatment water saving irrigation significantly p 0 05 increased the stem 17 4 21 4 and panicle 12 1 17 2 n content in the presence of nh4 and no3 supply fig 4b c n accumulation in the aboveground rice organs was much higher in the presence of nh4 than no3 under either water saving or flooded irrigation fig 5 the roots accumulated more n in the presence of no3 than nh4 under water saving or flooded irrigation fig 5d compared with flooded irrigation water saving irrigation increased n accumulation in the shoots but not in the roots regardless of nh4 and no3 supply fig 5a c these results suggest that nh4 input and water saving irrigation improve the total n uptake by rice 3 3 nre and the fate of fertilizer n in the rice soil system the n uptake from 15n labeled fertilizer was higher in the presence of nh4 than no3 under flooded irrigation in contrast no difference was detected between nh4 and no3 for 15n labeled fertilizer recovery in the whole plant under water saving irrigation p 0 1 fig 6a the residual soil n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer was lower in the presence of nh4 than no3 under both water saving and flooded irrigation regimes fig 6b although the loss of n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer was slightly higher for nh4 treatment than no3 treatment under both water saving and flooded irrigation regimes the difference was not significant fig 6c regardless of nh4 or no3 water saving irrigation increased the n uptake from 15n labeled fertilizer by rice and reduced the residual soil n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer irrigation had less of an effect on the loss of n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer table 5 the percentages of n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer in the rice plant soil and loss under the different treatments were calculated fig 7 most of the n from 15n labeled fertilizer was taken up by rice plants the proportion 58 72 62 43 of the nre of rice under water saving irrigation was much higher than under flooded irrigation 36 91 48 48 regardless of nh4 or no3 supply the nre of rice plant fertilized with nh4 was significantly higher than that of plants supplied with no3 under flooded irrigation however no significant difference in the nre of rice was observed between nh4 and no3 under water saving irrigation in addition a much higher proportion 19 0 34 4 of the n fertilizer remained in the soil n pool when no3 was applied than when nh4 was applied 12 6 20 7 under both water saving and flooded irrigation conditions fig 6 3 4 residual nh4 and no3 in soil at harvest the contents and 15n abundances of no3 and nh4 in the soil were determined at harvest table 6 among the four treatments the contents of total nh4 n and nh4 n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer under flooded irrigation with nh4 were the highest the contents of total no3 n and no3 n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer were higher with no3 n fertilization than nh4 n fertilization the sum of soil nh4 n and no3 n contents was 22 7 85 5 higher for treatments in which no3 was applied than when nh4 was applied under both irrigation regimes furthermore the sum of soil nh4 n and no3 n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer was 54 1 69 7 higher for treatments when no3 was applied than when nh4 was applied table 6 irrigation regimes and n fertilizer forms had significant effects on the sum of nh4 n and no3 n in the soil and significant interactions between irrigation regimes and n forms were observed p 0 05 compared with the flooded irrigation regime water saving irrigation increased the sum of nh4 n and no3 n by 16 1 27 4 regardless of whether nh4 or no3 was applied water saving irrigation significantly increased soil inorganic n content at harvest however the amount of n derived from fertilizer was similar between water saving irrigation and flooded irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 does rice s preference for ammonium turn into a higher nre the nre is an important indicator of fertilizer n uptake efficiency which can be used to evaluate the contribution of n fertilizer in the crop growing season many researchers have used the 15n enriched tracer technique to quantify the nre chen et al 2019 guo et al 2021 besides the nre does not require setting up a control treatment without fertilization and does not indicate whether the n taken up by the plant was converted into biomass which is unlike nitrogen use efficiency nue calculations generally rice is considered a typical ammonium preferring crop kirk 2001 ying hua et al 2006 kronzucker et al 2001 and tabuchi et al 2007 reported that the uptake rate of rice was initially faster for nh4 than no3 and rice preferred nh4 over no3 this generally infers that the nre of rice can be improved when ammonium based fertilizer is supplied the present results demonstrated that rice supplied with nh4 had a significantly enhanced nre under flooded irrigation yet no significant difference in the rice nre was observed between nh4 and no3 treatment under wsi conditions there are several explanations for this phenomenon i there was a higher n accumulation in rice with nh4 application compared to no3 application due to the growth preference of rice for nh4 but this does not imply a higher nre for 15nh4 than no3 although nh4 is preferred by rice the n cycle in the soil is complex and dynamic especially under water saving conditions where soil temperature and moisture conditions favor the process of nitrification a rapid conversion of 15nh4 to no3 girsang et al 2020 more 15nh4 was lost during this process resulting in less opportunity for rice to take up the applied 15nh4 as observed in this experiment the loss of n derived from 15n labeled fertilizer under wsi conditions was slightly higher with nh4 treatment than with no3 treatment fig 7 the same phenomenon was observed on sugarcane saccharum spp which also prefers ammonium the nre of 15no3 increased and was higher than that of 15nh4 when no3 dominated boschiero et al 2018 we can infer that the rate of soil no3 uptake by rice increased with decreasing applied 15nh4 availability in the soil ii previous investigations have shown that soil microorganisms could strongly compete with nh4 preferring plants for nh4 the nh4 may have been immobilized more intensely than no3 under water saving irrigation aerobic conditions he et al 2021 due to the aerobic soil environment likely enhanced soil microbial activities chen et al 2022 thus hindering the uptake of applied 15nh4 in rice furthermore a higher nre can be obtained even if plants do not grow in the preferred n form that dominates in their growth environment suggesting the importance of irrigation management for rice growth and n accumulation a much higher proportion 58 7 62 4 of the nre was observed in rice under water saving irrigation than under flooded irrigation condition 36 9 48 5 regardless of nh4 or no3 supply several arguments can explain this phenomenon i the soil nitrogen changed from ammonium n preference uptake by rice as the main form under traditional flooded irrigation to an ammonium nitro mixed state under water saving irrigation rice can adapt to a water saving irrigation soil environment by taking up more nitrate n which was supported by a high expression of the rice nitrate transporter osnrt2 3b fan et al 2016 ii the root morphology of rice was improved during the main growth period under water saving irrigation root physiological activity was strengthened xu et al 2018 and the degree of damage to the cell by the reducing substance such as fe2 and h2s was decreased ju et al 2015 yang et al 2004 which is beneficial for fertilizer n utilization in rice liang et al 2021 4 2 implications for rice n management with different irrigation our results indicate that the n management strategy might differ depending on irrigation management in rice paddies under flooded irrigation nh4 was the predominant inorganic n form in paddy soil nh4 toxicity effects may lead to plant growth retardation biomass reduction structural changes and the formation of short and dense root systems fang et al 2021 because even rice preferring nh4 might develop signs of nh4 toxicity britto and kronzucker 2002 improvement was found in rice root growth in fi paddies when no3 fertilizer was applied fig 3 thus the appropriate application of a few no3 fertilizers combined with nh4 fertilizer at a certain proportion of nh4 to no3 might be an efficient n management strategy to increase the nre of rice as wang et al 2018 and fan et al 2016 has been reported nitrate acts not only as an n nutrient for plants but also as an important signal optimizing rice plant development that can activate the aquaporin and potassium channel transporter to facilitate n uptake however considering the high leachability of no3 fertilizing fi rice with no3 fertilizer should be treated seriously in contrast for wsi paddies the improvement was more obvious in biomass production and n accumulation figs 2 and 4 when no3 fertilizer was replaced by nh4 fig 3 this indicates that rice has an ammonium deficiency and the preference for ammonium is further enhanced in wsi paddies fertilizing wsi rice with nh4 will improve rice growth this same phenomenon was observed in the no3 only conditions of dry land plants for example a mixture with 20 nh4 increased wheat growth by 54 and 80 increases in maize growth with 25 nh4 were observed cox and reisenauer 1973 wang et al 2019 due to the strong nitrification under water saving conditions the applied nh4 could have transformed rapidly into no3 and thus rice cannot effectively utilize nh4 in no3 prevalent circumstances it is better to incorporate nitrification inhibitors with nh4 fertilizer thus the applied nh4 fertilizer will be maintained in the form of nh4 for a longer time offering in more opportunities for rice to take up nh4 as zhang et al 2016 suggested nre can be increased by matching crops with preferred n forms or manipulating soil n transformations thus it is an important way to improve the nre of rice and reduce fertilizer n loss in plant soil systems by providing in depth insight into the relationship between plant n preference n fertilizer type and soil conditions irrigation regime and n transformation the rice nre can be further improved by adjusting the soil nitrogen transformation during the critical period of nitrogen demand to reduce the nitrification loss of fertilizer n and maintain more crop preferred n in the soil it should be noted that as environmental conditions are considerably different in the pot than in the field which may limit our ability to extrapolate our findings to other soils or environmental situations therefore in order to give practical recommendation on the management of fertilizer n forms and irrigation for rice production field experiments are necessary to verify the effects of nh4 and no3 under different irrigation regimes on rice growth and nre 5 conclusions ammonium n application enhanced rice shoot growth compared with those of no3 treated plants under both irrigation regimes in contrast nitrate n enhanced rice root growth compared with nh4 treated plants under both irrigation regimes however a substantial amount of no3 fertilizer remained in the soil after rice harvest rice supplied with nh4 significantly enhanced the nre of rice under flooded irrigation no significant difference in rice nre was observed between nh4 and no3 treatments under wsi conditions we concluded that nh4 enhancement of rice growth relative to no3 treated plants under the present experimental conditions was associated with the n uptake and growth preference of rice for nh4 over no3 this information may disprove the hypothesis that the preference of plants as a means of increasing higher 15n recovery of fertilizer sources especially for rice under water saving irrigation which favored the nitrification process the applied nh4 could have transformed rapidly into no3 and rice cannot effectively utilize nh4 in no3 prevalent circumstances thus a good match of crop n preference n fertilizer type and soil condition irrigation regime and n transformation is critical for enhancing nre and reducing n loss the present experimental results were obtained throughout the rice growing season under pot conditions therefore it is important to further evaluate the effects of nh4 and no3 at different application rates or combinations and field management practices on crop growth and nre under field conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

9357,this study proposes a novel agri environmental payment scheme aimed at saving irrigation water the design incorporates an outcomes based reward system ensuring effective savings of water volumes in on farm uses a choice experiment ce was conducted with 259 farmers in a pilot study of a water stressed region with mediterranean climate values for each attribute were estimated using the random parameter logit model the environmental payment scheme resulted as receiving good acceptance by the interviewees the duration of the commitment has the highest relevance in the farmers choice behaviour followed by the water savings effort in general the findings show that farmers are willing to save water in response to the tested payment scheme based on the significance of covariates however the variable of the farm s crop specialisation is critical in the farmer s choice the main findings suggest that it is advisable to target the payment scheme based on crop profitability territorial dimension and taking into account the groundwater salinity map keywords irrigation farmer s preference payment scheme choice experiments willingness to accept data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction worldwide water resources are becoming increasingly scarce while locally demographic growth and climate change can threaten water security and ecosystem services given that agricultural withdrawals account for the largest share of water use carpenter et al 2011 any reduction in resource use for irrigation can magnify the impact on total water availability the issues of how to improve water use in agriculture and thereby enhance water saving however is controversial grafton et al 2018 in this regard whatever the specific measures put in place an effective water saving policy requires truly manifest incentives significant effort from farmers and the support of governments of national and or regional levels incentives backed by the public and private sectors are intended to induce behavioural change in farmer s choices the literature reports three major kinds of incentives for on farm adoption of sustainable practices piñeiro et al 2020 market regulation non market regulation and cross compliance incentives raising the in price is a long standing market incentive claimed as an effective way to achieve water savings improve water allocation and encourage conservation while irrigation water pricing has been promoted by national and international governmental organisations e g water framework directive of european commission its effectiveness in actual practice is quite controversial berbel and expósito 2020 this is particularly true in the presence of multiple uses of collective facilities or where use of on farm groundwater pumps could cause conflicting or unintended effects portoghese et al 2021 moreover in the case of volumetric water pricing lack of metering for irrigation water can undermine the effective implementation of in price incentive schemes lika et al 2017 regulatory incentive measures are those providing the assignment of water rights or permits that limit open access to water resources the rights are generally issued by a centralised agency also responsible for monitoring enforcement and eventually sanctioning uncompliant users when abstraction points are known and water uses fully metered a system of individual abstraction quotas can be implemented regulatory incentives suffer the general shortcoming common to command and control approaches indeed enforcing regulations entails the control of water access and the metering of water uses the will of governments to enforce rigorous regulations may be doubtful molle and closas 2020 and it is generally difficult and costly to implement point to point monitoring of usage of irrigation water particularly in the case of groundwater irrigation foster et al 2020 ursitti et al 2018 even when governments have tried to devote special attention to control of groundwater withdrawals these difficulties have still been causal in the failure of most regulatory initiatives de stefano and lopez gunn 2012 cross compliance incentives link direct payments with farmers compliance to basic standards concerning water related issues in this case mostly voluntary a good example of a cross compliance measure would be the agri environmental payment schemes that allow farmers to obtain subsidies conditional on adhering to certain practices throughout the european union eu agri environmental schemes aess have largely focused on biodiversity and only to a lesser extent on soil conservation water pollution and climate issues the 2014 2020 eu rural development programme was an example that included the proposal of specific payment schemes supporting adoption of climate smart agricultural practices the planned agri environmental schemes directly tackling agricultural water savings however have received very limited uptake pagliacci et al 2020 rouillard 2020 a further consideration is that other measures protecting biodiversity and reducing nitrogen or pesticide pollution such as crop diversification crop rotation and conversion of cereal crops into permanent grasslands could indirectly reduce abstraction pressures on water water quantitative issues have been more widely addressed in the eu through the introduction of economic incentives including within the rural development programme aimed at promoting on farm adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies kahil et al 2015 however scientific evidence grafton et al 2018 has long and substantially shown that increasing irrigation efficiency rarely delivers the presumed saved availability of water this is because from the farmers perspective rather than pursuing water savings the aim is to maximise economic returns unless water savings are economically convenient e g in contexts of very high extraction costs then the demand for irrigation water will continue to increase furthermore in the case of groundwater resources with large numbers of independent users none are encouraged to preserve the resources since others might continue to use them equally in which case water savings would not achieve exclusive individual benefits so called tragedy of the commons given this context the current research intends to outline the design of a new agri environmental payment scheme aimed at saving irrigation water in particular an outcome based reward system for reduction of on farm water use ensuring effective savings of volumes a choice experiment ce is conducted with farmers for elicitation of their preferences concerning a new scheme the research identifies the level of payment that would make farmers willing to reduce on farm water use considering two main design attributes of the agri environmental scheme i the targeted amount of on farm water saving and ii the duration of farmers participation in the compensatory scheme the research is expected to attain twofold results i revealing which policy attributes are relevant in enhancing farmer s uptake of schemes aimed at saving irrigation water ii estimation of the potential for irrigation water savings from economic incentivisation in view of farmers willingness to accept such schemes this latter information is highly relevant to policymakers interested in designing effective water saving policy for the agricultural sector through incentive based instruments and in planning programmes of measures aimed at achieving good ecological status for water bodies in this regard it should be noted that in the eu water resource management is entering a new phase expected to feature combinations of various tools and instruments among these voluntary agreements adoption of technologies trading in water rights multi actor governance planning and control measures berbel and expósito 2020 the study reports on the results from an explorative case study in the puglia region of south eastern italy within the italian context this area was chosen in view of its long history of joint use of surface and groundwater resources portoghese et al 2021 the findings of this research however are not limited to the pilot study area and indeed the policy implications extend to broader national and international contexts the following sections of the paper report first on data gathering and methodology then provide the main findings these are followed by a deeper discussion on the results and finally some concluding remarks with discussion of policy implications 2 data and research methodology 2 1 case study description currently 2 886 000 ha of italian land are irrigated representing 24 of the total used for agriculture faostat 2020 yet the irrigation function on this relatively small share consumes almost 50 of national water resources across all national territory the average annual rainfall is 942 mm making italy a country of mediterranean climate class that is rich in water resources however both water availability and irrigation uses are unevenly distributed among the national regions related to the fact that northern and inland areas have a continental wet climate while southern coastal areas face semi arid conditions in italy almost 65 of irrigated land is served by collective pipeline networks zucaro et al 2011 meaning that farmers can rely on external infrastructure for delivery to their field boundaries collective supply is managed by local water user associations called reclamation and irrigation consortia and generally sourced from river basins regulated by dam systems the area of the irrigation network is determined based on reservoir capacity while the amount of water available is dependent on the rain and snowfall patterns of previous seasons the tariffs for irrigation services are determined by the individual consortia meaning that viewed at the national level the tariff scheme is a jigsaw of different solutions in the case of non networked water supply irrigation services are managed by the farmer end user who may obtain water by direct diversion from rivers and or drawing from aquifers bearing all the relative costs the regulation of access to water resources is by the issue of permits by the governments of the italian regions 20 in all for which renewal generally requires sizable fees although the national administrative systems therefore do provide an environmental tax for water abstraction the lack of systematic metering means that in effect the tax is calculated based on areas of irrigable land rather than the actual amounts abstracted berbel et al 2019 the current case study concerns the region of puglia in south eastern italy the heel of the boot characterised by dry warm to hot summers and wet mild to cool winters with average annual rainfall of about 600 mm officially the region has 238 000 ha of irrigated land operated by 63 909 farms representing 18 5 of total farmland and 23 5 of total farms istat 2010 the large part of irrigated land however is operated by the 27 of farms holding more than 5 ha of this type the region has extensive network infrastructure operated by six reclamation and irrigation consortia named gargano and capitanata in the province of foggia arneo brindisi stornara and tara taranto terre d apulia bari and ugento lì foggi lecce in spite of this infrastructure almost 65 of irrigated land is operated by farmers self supplied groundwater services ursitti et al 2018 moreover the region is characterised by striking differences across the provinces foggia for example achieves the highest share of irrigated land serviced by collectively delivered surface water while for lecce almost 80 of total is served by on farm abstraction of groundwater overall more than 80 of the region s irrigated land is permanently operated in highly specialised production especially olive trees for oil and grape followed by fresh vegetables and processing tomatoes puglia is the leading region in national production of olive oil and table grape and accounts for a full third of processing tomato average irrigation volume for puglia is estimated of 655 million m3 lupia et al 2013 however groundwater abstraction increases considerably in periods of severe drought portoghese et al 2021 zingaro et al 2017 in many areas where groundwater is the main source pumping rates exceed the natural recharge rate leading to ongoing water table drawdown and well depletion as well as a situation in which the regional groundwater vulnerability map reports severe seawater intrusion in coastal areas 2015 2021 update to territorial monitoring decree of the regional government of puglia 16 07 2019 in view of the goals of the eu water framework directive for good ecological management of all surface water the regional government aims to increase the supply of reclaimed urban wastewater for agricultural uses in this regard the past decade has seen the planning of sizable expenditures for either installing or upgrading a total of 93 tertiary wastewater treatment systems within puglia giannoccaro et al 2019 meanwhile on the demand side the region has also implemented policy 1 1 consistent with the national regulatory updates for the quantification of volumes decreto mipaaf del 31 luglio 2015 and recovery of environmental and resource costs decreto mattm n 39 2015 respectively translated into regional laws regolamento n 2 del 28 febbraio 2017 della regione puglia e deliberazione della giunta regionale n 976 del 20 giugno 2017 for reducing water use especially groundwater use for irrigation in particular through establishing systematic metering of the actual water volumes extracted by farmers such policy also obviously implies the need for systems of rigorous control over groundwater access for prevention of illegal abstraction the current research analyses the potential of an incentive based instrument as a means of providing policy makers with a broader selection of measures for achieving the desired aims of agricultural water management 2 2 design of incentive based tool the study applies a choice experiment ce to elicit the farmers willingness to save irrigation water and in particular identify the level of payment that would make them willing to reduce on farm water use ce relies on hypothetical scenarios constructed in consideration of the main attributes and respective levels of the research subject the literature on the design of agri environmental schemes aes points out the positive effects of incentive mechanisms in increasing farmer participation in an extensive review on the attributes of contracts encouraging adoption of agri environmental practices mamine and minviel 2020 identifies two significant clauses of contract design commitments and economic incentives numerous studies apply the choice experiment model in analysis of farmers willingness to accept aes in which the schemes feature a trade off between commitments e g provision of effort duration and payments e g espinosa goded et al 2010 villanueva et al 2017 sardaro et al 2019 a main issue emerging is the heterogeneity in farmers willingness to engage in an aes consequently some authors have recently pointed out that targeting is a key issue in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of aes bartolini and vergamini 2019 vergamini et al 2020 have also observed that in this regard for aes where payments are linked with outcomes there have been very few studies analysing the effective performance of farmer s participation in view of this literature the design of our ce scheme assumes that for farmers to receive payment they must deliver measurable outcomes specifically savings of irrigation water at farm level in other words irrigators will receive an economic reward only for the actual on farm water saved concerning the time commitment under the scheme we consider that in rural development programmes adopters of aes have typically signed five year contracts but also note that more than with other schemes those concerning use of irrigation are more significantly affected by meteorological features such as temperature and rainfall pattern the duration of the commitment can affect the farmer s decision and therefore we consider this as a relevant feature in the design of the scheme furthermore to obtain monotonicity in outcomes the scheme lays out amounts of payment that increase proportionally with the level and duration of provision in this way for each attribute the scheme provides farmers with a broad set of different choice levels at different payments the design of the aes thus considers two main attributes i the targeted amount of on farm water saving i e provision of effort and ii the duration of farmers participation in the compensatory scheme table 1 levels for each attribute were elicited after conducing two focus groups with farmers technicians and experts from irrigation water agencies in puglia region using a d optimal experimental design four choice sets were drawn up each including three alternatives and the no choice option the experimental design aimed at avoiding difficult mental tasks for respondents involving potential issues of incentive compatibility as reported in barreiro hurle et al 2018 discrete choice experiments as a norm are designed with five attributes including the monetary attribute and on average 3 6 levels per attribute 17 levels the number of alternatives per choice card including status quo sq ranges from two to five however these are usually grouped in three alternatives a pre test pilot trial was carried out with eight farmers with the incentives framed on a per hectare equivalent basis rather than euros per cubic metre since during a focus group it had emerged that farmers were more familiar with such equivalents moreover at this time the participants had also strongly disputed the potential of achieving on farm water savings of 50 fig 1 shows an example of a payment card in the case of on farm water use up to 1500 m3 hectare year we set 2017 as the reference year for on farm water use given that this had been the latest very dry season for the region in addition to the influence of climatic conditions on farm irrigation volumes can depend on among other variable the nature of the irrigation systems crop requirements soil type as a consequence choice sets should be constructed accordingly with individual specific sq in most of the scientific literature discrete choice experiments rely on average or 0 sq value only a few papers deal with this issue e g guerrero baena et al 2019 in the context of valuation for water use and salazar ordóñez et al 2021 in the context of aess to account for a broad range of current irrigation volumes we laid out 12 payment cards ranging from 500 to 6000 m3 hectare year however each farmer was only shown the payment card with the volume closest to their current usage of on farm irrigation water the issue of individual specific sq was tackled directly in the survey by making the farmer immediately aware of the monetary reward m3 hectare year earn in each of the aes alternatives 2 3 surveying a questionnaire was designed to collect data from farmers on a range of topics including through the choice experiment the questioning was structured as follows a preliminary information farmer s awareness of current and foreseeable problems regarding the availability and quality of irrigation water in the region of puglia knowledge of regulations on access to water resources presence and type of access to water resource for the interviewee s farm b farm characteristics information concerning the geographic location e g altitude distance from the nearest inhabited centre structural e g irrigated and non irrigated area land tenancy and organisational characteristics i e type of management of the farm c types of crops and breeding distribution of the cultivated area among the different crops grown species of animal husbandry adoption of environmental certifications e g organic integrated pest management adoption of innovations in recent years mechanical managerial varietal and commercial d technical data concerning the irrigation practice general information e g distribution system water sources annual use of irrigation water characteristics of the water service quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the irrigation service operational costs of irrigation e technical data concerning wells characteristics of any wells present on the farm depth diameter flow rate etc f cost of land information regarding the value rental purchase sale prices of the specific farmland g willingness to accept compensation to reduce usage of irrigation water the respondents were presented with a choice experiment asking them to choose between three alternative options of aes in addition to the current situation called no choice option h personal information socio demographic and professional characteristics of the farm manager the sampling procedure was based on the identification of the most intensively irrigated areas of the region i e hot spot irrigated areas in particular the procedure was to calculate the share of irrigated utilised agricultural area uaa at the level of the municipalities italian agricultural census 2010 and then select those with the highest shares for which the sum of irrigated uaa would equal 66 of regional irrigated uaa the experiment was conducted on a sample of 300 farmers from the hot spot areas with the number selected for each hot spot proportion to the municipal share of irrigated uaa in each area the farms were selected on the basis of the criteria farmland size types of crops grown type of irrigation services i e collective self supplied a team of six trained members carried out the survey from december 2018 to february 2019 by means of face to face interviews in the municipalities the survey obtained fully answered questionnaires from 259 respondents fig 2 the characteristics of the universe of irrigators in the targeted region puglia and those of the sample are shown in table 2 although the sample size is small relative to the large number of irrigated farms in the region the main features of irrigated agriculture are fairly fitted of the different features the sample shows larger deviation in the extent of irrigated land being more heavily weighted to large sized farms while irrigated area of olive tree is underweighted given that this crop is more commonly cultivated by smallholders overall however the sample is a good representation of the regional patterns of irrigated crops on farm irrigation volume and irrigation services i e self supplied and collective 2 4 econometric modelling the ce theory is based on the concepts of lancaster 1966 according to which the farmer s utility deriving from a new payment scheme for saving irrigation water is the sum of the utilities related to the characteristics of the scheme furthermore the random utility theory underlying the stochastic utility models thurstone 1927 states that farmers express their individual preferences in order to maximise utility under the income constraint therefore the choice analysis requests the solution of a utility maximisation problem concerning a set of alternatives considering an individual n who chooses the alternative able to ensure the greatest utility among the j possible alternatives at a choice opportunity t the utility function is given by the following expression train 2009 1 u n j t v n j t e n j t n 1 n j 1 j t 1 t where v njt is the deterministic component while e njt is the random component specifically defined as an independent and identically gumbel distributed iid component given a finite set of j alternatives farmer n performs a series of pairwise comparisons between them so as to identify the alternative that maximises their utility in particular the alternative i will be preferred to j if u nit u njt j i due to the stochastic nature of the utility function the maximisation problem can be solved in probabilistic terms therefore considering a set of j alternative the probability that a farmer n chooses the alternative i is given by 2 p n i t p r o b v n i t ε n i t v n j t ε n j t 0 j i j whose estimation can be made using a discrete choice model mcfadden 1986 assuming a linear utility function in parameters for the deterministic component the expression 1 can be reformulated as 3 u n j t β n x n j t ε n j t n 1 n j 1 j t 1 t where β n is a k 1 vector of parameters to be estimated concerns utility and corresponds to k choice characteristics x njt instead is the k 1 vector of choice characteristics concerning the alternative j at the choice opportunity t carried out by the farmer n farmers may present similar attitudes in presence of different choice sets leading to correlation phenomena therefore to the violation of the assumption related to the independence of irrelevant alternatives iia to relax this assumption the expression 3 introduces a β n vector of specific parameters for farmers following a g β θ distribution whose vector θ indicates mean and variance this specification allows the formulation of the random parameter logit model rplm able to capture the heterogeneity of unobserved factors that are common to groups of farmers and are able to influence choices mamine and minviel 2020 the probability that a subject n chooses the alternative i at the choice opportunity t is calculated as train 2009 4 p n i t exp v n i t j exp v n j t f β d β where the distribution f of the random parameters β is specified by researcher in this regard a normal distribution for the price variable incentive and a triangular distribution for the remaining attributes were used for the form of the density functions of parameters greene and hensher 2003 final models were obtained using 1000 halton s draws halton 1960 an alternative specific constant asc was also included in the model to capture preferences for the no choice option finally willingness to accept wta was calculated as the ratio between each non monetary attribute and the attribute relating to price namely 5 w t a k β k β i where wta k is the willingness to accept for the k attribute β k is the estimated coefficient for the k attribute and β p is the estimated coefficient for the incentive attribute the 95 confidence intervals were calculated using the method proposed by krinsky and robb 1986 and the wta was estimated through the delta method 3 results 3 1 sample statistics overall the surveyed farms totalled 9176 ha of farmland including 7049 of irrigable land of which 4954 were irrigated in 2017 accounting for 2 of total irrigated area of puglia region on average the farm size reported is 35 ha of which 18 94 were irrigated in 2017 of the irrigated farms 59 rely on self supply services from groundwater on farm wells the total water volume for irrigation amounted to 6 414 million m3 while average irrigation volume was 2026 m3 ha table 3 the farmers of the sample are mostly male 80 and their average age is 51 years for 72 of respondents farming is the main economic activity for the remaining 28 off farm employment is more important olive tree is the most frequent irrigated crop followed by table grape and vegetables a sizable number of farms also crop processing tomato under irrigation half of the respondents expressed concerns over the status of the quality of water bodies and the quantity of water within the puglia region moreover almost 60 expect increasing water shortages in the near future nevertheless among those who have on farm access to groundwater only 42 out of 187 respondents recognised that their farmland were already affected by salinity the awareness of quantitative issues is higher since 48 of groundwater users self reported that they were already affected by well depletion almost 20 of farmers largely those who rely on self supplied irrigation groundwater did not know how much irrigation water they use 2 2 for these respondents ce was conducted setting as sq the standard irrigation requirements m3 ha year as provided by local technicians of most relevant on farm irrigated crop 3 2 estimated model when respondents appeared unwilling to participate at all in the aes also known in ce as serial non participation protest answers were distinguished from legitimate zero bids by means of follow up questions to check farmers motivations in investigating willingness to accept wta in relation to incentive based schemes contexts very few studies have provided coherent guidance on identifying protest responses however the concern in such cases is mainly that of distinguishing protest behaviour from very high taking villanueva et al 2017 at the close of ce section of the survey therefore serial non participants were provided with close ended answers for indication of possible motivations underlying their choices of 69 serial non participants those providing legitimate zero bid answers included 38 respondents who lack enough information and 12 who believe the incentives are much too low another three reasons generally seen in literature for identification of protests and also considered as protest in the current ce are do not think such measures are a good solution 14 respondents it s a problem of the state 3 respondents and do not trust regional government actions 2 respondents a total of 19 observations were excluded by the econometric regression in line with other analyses in the literature villanueva et al 2017 alcon et al 2019 it is worth mentioning that among those who claim that they have little information 23 did not know their on farm water use or cost for irrigation in general the farmers surveyed did not behave strategically in their responses average values per attribute were calculated at each level using the lowest level as baseline reference in the model the alternative specific constant asc takes the value zero when one alternative of aes is selected and 1 when the current status is selected table 4 reports the results of the random parameter logit model all attributes are significant and the asc is significant with negative sign meaning that the no choice option is less convenient for farmers random parameters in the utility function show no linearity overall the environmental payment scheme is well accepted by the interviewees to capture the heterogeneity of unobserved factors common to groups of farmers and able to influence choices a set of covariates was also tested all significant variables introduced as covariates are reported in table 6 some of the heterogeneity in farmers choices is explained by covariates found to be significant in econometric regression it is worth mentioning the salinity issue in particular that respondents who acknowledge already experiencing detrimental effects from salinity were more likely to accept the environmental scheme variables such as metering mulching and reservoir are all related to farmers already with good accounting services for irrigation water and the presence of all of these features makes it more likely that farmers will be willing to accept payment schemes aimed at saving on farm irrigation water in contrast farmers whose crop pattern includes processing tomato or table grape are less likely to accept any incentive for reducing on farm irrigation volumes table 5 reports the average marginal wta estimates at different levels of each attribute respective to baseline wta values range from 0 03625 to 0 07870 m3 at 20 and 30 water savings respectively while time attribute reports higher monetary values ranging from 0 25162 to 0 38565 m3 for three and five year periods of commitment respectively 4 discussion of results based on the ce findings duration of commitment i e time emerges as an attribute much more relevant of the percentage of water savings i e save this distinguishes the research results from those reported in vergamini et al 2020 which assumed the duration of the aes time window as a five year period as extensively reported in previous studies giannoccaro et al 2015 the value of irrigation water in fact changes over time depending on climatic conditions the least relevant attribute relates to the extent of savings or savings effort i e save furthermore in respect of the levels of choice neither save nor time show linearity in marginal wta values the survey data can serve as a basis for designing policy in more detail by estimating potential water savings associated with the implementation of the proposed aes type we assume that farmers will save on their annual water use according to the aes framework the water saving curve is estimated considering each farmer s response i e preferred savings effort duration and incentive and its current on farm water use m3 ha in detail the water saving curve is drawn by averaging the amounts that farmers are willing to save at each price on an annual base during a five years period fig 3 keeping in mind that for the sampled farms average yearly water use is 2026 m3 ha for savings of 300 m3 ha 15 of current water use farmers call for 0 40 m3 annually this sums up 120 ha while it does not take into account transaction costs of participation in such a scheme in general the findings show that there is room for implementing the proposed type of economic incentives perhaps within the upcoming eu 2023 2027 rural development programme however based on the significance of covariates the crop specialisations of the farm are critical in determining the farmer s choice sardaro et al 2020 farmers whose crops receive high added value from irrigation e g table grape processing tomato are not willing to enrol in the proposed aes while in irrigated olive tree for oil deficit irrigation below crop level requirements is already largely practiced expósito and berbel 2016 for processing tomato or table grape only marginal reductions in season by season water allotments would be possible gatta et al 2015 also in this regard pagliacci et al 2020 reported very low adoption of an aes for 25 reduction of irrigation volumes on corn and tobacco crops the most water intensive crops of the veneto region north eastern italy targeting payments on the basis of crop profitability would therefore be advisable as well as differentiated spatial payment in the manner proposed by bartolini and vergamini 2019 other potential shortcomings concern the possibility of adverse selection in the case that the farmer withdraws less profitable resources such as salt water as already reported in the australian water market zuo et al 2014 and in the californian land market mukherjee and schwabe 2014 indeed in the current research those farmers who have already experienced groundwater salt intrusion report higher probability of adhering to the aes a number of variables related to the opposite context of good practices of on farm irrigation management i e mulching on farm water metering on farm reservoir are linked to higher willingness to uptake the proposed aes instrument likewise of more educated farmers such positive interactions can be explained by lower transaction costs incurred for adhering to aes furthermore the presence of a collective pipeline networks also plays a key role in the farmer s decisions on irrigation management increasing the probability of adhering to the aes this effect is probably due to the lower economic value of water service from collective networks compared to on farm abstraction from groundwater mirra et al 2021 the proposed incentive based instrument is shown to have potential for savings in irrigation water with magnitudes of impact at the regional level but can also have other advantages and beneficial effects the payment scheme is not compulsory which makes monitoring and control actions easier for the regulator montginoul et al 2016 but there is also the further beneficial effect of encouraging greater diffusion of on farm volume metering the proposed aes can also serve in gathering in situ data on irrigation water volumes foster et al 2020 and of course such schemes cannot be drawn on by unauthorised water users meaning that the aes should also incentivise voluntary disclosure of farmers water use the current research has been conducted on the scale of a large region with great variability in irrigation water services collective and self supplied water sources surface and groundwater as well as on farm irrigation use current irrigation volumes this also results in high standard deviation for coefficients of the attributes future research needs to achieve more pinpoint estimations conducting surveys in the context of single crop patterns and single types of irrigation service thereby allowing identification of a specific sq for all the relative respondents improvements could also be made in the sense of reducing the number of alternatives and choice sets in the choice experiment making it easier for farmers trade off reasoning another relevant issue refers to the low level of knowledge of some farmers with regards to their actual water use to deal with this issue researchers should conduct blind and informed experimental games with irrigators 5 conclusions crop irrigation uses vast amounts of freshwater and therefore saving water for reallocation to other sectors among others including the natural environment has become an aim in policy agendas worldwide the importance of the issue becomes critically clear during periods of drought the current research conducts a pilot study eliciting responses to the design of a new agri environmental payment scheme aimed at saving irrigation water in a water stressed region with mediterranean climate according to the findings the farmers are willing to save water in response to the tested payment scheme importantly however the research shows that such schemes should be set up differently than has been the practice in particular by allowing for flexible duration of commitment in seeking to comply with the water framework directive wfd regulation italy faces critical challenges in accounting for water uses in agriculture in 2015 the italian ministry for agricultural policy opened the way for accounting of usages of irrigation water guidelines for the regional regulation of means of quantification of water volumes used in irrigation decreto mipaaf del 31 luglio 2015 but until now such accounting has not been achieved least of all in puglia in this regard the proposed aes is not compulsory which makes monitoring and control actions easier for the regional government indeed volumetric metering is a prerequisite to entering in the payment scheme under the instrument moreover the aes also provides economic incentive to farmers for voluntary disclosure and rectification of illegal access to groundwater in the proposed instrument the incentives are constructed in the manner of an outcomes based reward system thereby ensuring true savings in volumes moreover as with incentives based on market regulation the instrument achieves useful data collection such as on the monetary value of water saved by the farmers on the other hand a potential weakness is that the proposed instrument appears less effective in coping with intensive value added water usage on crops such as processing tomato and table grape there could also be potential adverse selection in cases where water quality is already suffering for example with higher salt content this economic instrument should not be seen as panacea for the problems in managing irrigation water usage the aim here is to provide policy makers with a broader range of

9357,this study proposes a novel agri environmental payment scheme aimed at saving irrigation water the design incorporates an outcomes based reward system ensuring effective savings of water volumes in on farm uses a choice experiment ce was conducted with 259 farmers in a pilot study of a water stressed region with mediterranean climate values for each attribute were estimated using the random parameter logit model the environmental payment scheme resulted as receiving good acceptance by the interviewees the duration of the commitment has the highest relevance in the farmers choice behaviour followed by the water savings effort in general the findings show that farmers are willing to save water in response to the tested payment scheme based on the significance of covariates however the variable of the farm s crop specialisation is critical in the farmer s choice the main findings suggest that it is advisable to target the payment scheme based on crop profitability territorial dimension and taking into account the groundwater salinity map keywords irrigation farmer s preference payment scheme choice experiments willingness to accept data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction worldwide water resources are becoming increasingly scarce while locally demographic growth and climate change can threaten water security and ecosystem services given that agricultural withdrawals account for the largest share of water use carpenter et al 2011 any reduction in resource use for irrigation can magnify the impact on total water availability the issues of how to improve water use in agriculture and thereby enhance water saving however is controversial grafton et al 2018 in this regard whatever the specific measures put in place an effective water saving policy requires truly manifest incentives significant effort from farmers and the support of governments of national and or regional levels incentives backed by the public and private sectors are intended to induce behavioural change in farmer s choices the literature reports three major kinds of incentives for on farm adoption of sustainable practices piñeiro et al 2020 market regulation non market regulation and cross compliance incentives raising the in price is a long standing market incentive claimed as an effective way to achieve water savings improve water allocation and encourage conservation while irrigation water pricing has been promoted by national and international governmental organisations e g water framework directive of european commission its effectiveness in actual practice is quite controversial berbel and expósito 2020 this is particularly true in the presence of multiple uses of collective facilities or where use of on farm groundwater pumps could cause conflicting or unintended effects portoghese et al 2021 moreover in the case of volumetric water pricing lack of metering for irrigation water can undermine the effective implementation of in price incentive schemes lika et al 2017 regulatory incentive measures are those providing the assignment of water rights or permits that limit open access to water resources the rights are generally issued by a centralised agency also responsible for monitoring enforcement and eventually sanctioning uncompliant users when abstraction points are known and water uses fully metered a system of individual abstraction quotas can be implemented regulatory incentives suffer the general shortcoming common to command and control approaches indeed enforcing regulations entails the control of water access and the metering of water uses the will of governments to enforce rigorous regulations may be doubtful molle and closas 2020 and it is generally difficult and costly to implement point to point monitoring of usage of irrigation water particularly in the case of groundwater irrigation foster et al 2020 ursitti et al 2018 even when governments have tried to devote special attention to control of groundwater withdrawals these difficulties have still been causal in the failure of most regulatory initiatives de stefano and lopez gunn 2012 cross compliance incentives link direct payments with farmers compliance to basic standards concerning water related issues in this case mostly voluntary a good example of a cross compliance measure would be the agri environmental payment schemes that allow farmers to obtain subsidies conditional on adhering to certain practices throughout the european union eu agri environmental schemes aess have largely focused on biodiversity and only to a lesser extent on soil conservation water pollution and climate issues the 2014 2020 eu rural development programme was an example that included the proposal of specific payment schemes supporting adoption of climate smart agricultural practices the planned agri environmental schemes directly tackling agricultural water savings however have received very limited uptake pagliacci et al 2020 rouillard 2020 a further consideration is that other measures protecting biodiversity and reducing nitrogen or pesticide pollution such as crop diversification crop rotation and conversion of cereal crops into permanent grasslands could indirectly reduce abstraction pressures on water water quantitative issues have been more widely addressed in the eu through the introduction of economic incentives including within the rural development programme aimed at promoting on farm adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies kahil et al 2015 however scientific evidence grafton et al 2018 has long and substantially shown that increasing irrigation efficiency rarely delivers the presumed saved availability of water this is because from the farmers perspective rather than pursuing water savings the aim is to maximise economic returns unless water savings are economically convenient e g in contexts of very high extraction costs then the demand for irrigation water will continue to increase furthermore in the case of groundwater resources with large numbers of independent users none are encouraged to preserve the resources since others might continue to use them equally in which case water savings would not achieve exclusive individual benefits so called tragedy of the commons given this context the current research intends to outline the design of a new agri environmental payment scheme aimed at saving irrigation water in particular an outcome based reward system for reduction of on farm water use ensuring effective savings of volumes a choice experiment ce is conducted with farmers for elicitation of their preferences concerning a new scheme the research identifies the level of payment that would make farmers willing to reduce on farm water use considering two main design attributes of the agri environmental scheme i the targeted amount of on farm water saving and ii the duration of farmers participation in the compensatory scheme the research is expected to attain twofold results i revealing which policy attributes are relevant in enhancing farmer s uptake of schemes aimed at saving irrigation water ii estimation of the potential for irrigation water savings from economic incentivisation in view of farmers willingness to accept such schemes this latter information is highly relevant to policymakers interested in designing effective water saving policy for the agricultural sector through incentive based instruments and in planning programmes of measures aimed at achieving good ecological status for water bodies in this regard it should be noted that in the eu water resource management is entering a new phase expected to feature combinations of various tools and instruments among these voluntary agreements adoption of technologies trading in water rights multi actor governance planning and control measures berbel and expósito 2020 the study reports on the results from an explorative case study in the puglia region of south eastern italy within the italian context this area was chosen in view of its long history of joint use of surface and groundwater resources portoghese et al 2021 the findings of this research however are not limited to the pilot study area and indeed the policy implications extend to broader national and international contexts the following sections of the paper report first on data gathering and methodology then provide the main findings these are followed by a deeper discussion on the results and finally some concluding remarks with discussion of policy implications 2 data and research methodology 2 1 case study description currently 2 886 000 ha of italian land are irrigated representing 24 of the total used for agriculture faostat 2020 yet the irrigation function on this relatively small share consumes almost 50 of national water resources across all national territory the average annual rainfall is 942 mm making italy a country of mediterranean climate class that is rich in water resources however both water availability and irrigation uses are unevenly distributed among the national regions related to the fact that northern and inland areas have a continental wet climate while southern coastal areas face semi arid conditions in italy almost 65 of irrigated land is served by collective pipeline networks zucaro et al 2011 meaning that farmers can rely on external infrastructure for delivery to their field boundaries collective supply is managed by local water user associations called reclamation and irrigation consortia and generally sourced from river basins regulated by dam systems the area of the irrigation network is determined based on reservoir capacity while the amount of water available is dependent on the rain and snowfall patterns of previous seasons the tariffs for irrigation services are determined by the individual consortia meaning that viewed at the national level the tariff scheme is a jigsaw of different solutions in the case of non networked water supply irrigation services are managed by the farmer end user who may obtain water by direct diversion from rivers and or drawing from aquifers bearing all the relative costs the regulation of access to water resources is by the issue of permits by the governments of the italian regions 20 in all for which renewal generally requires sizable fees although the national administrative systems therefore do provide an environmental tax for water abstraction the lack of systematic metering means that in effect the tax is calculated based on areas of irrigable land rather than the actual amounts abstracted berbel et al 2019 the current case study concerns the region of puglia in south eastern italy the heel of the boot characterised by dry warm to hot summers and wet mild to cool winters with average annual rainfall of about 600 mm officially the region has 238 000 ha of irrigated land operated by 63 909 farms representing 18 5 of total farmland and 23 5 of total farms istat 2010 the large part of irrigated land however is operated by the 27 of farms holding more than 5 ha of this type the region has extensive network infrastructure operated by six reclamation and irrigation consortia named gargano and capitanata in the province of foggia arneo brindisi stornara and tara taranto terre d apulia bari and ugento lì foggi lecce in spite of this infrastructure almost 65 of irrigated land is operated by farmers self supplied groundwater services ursitti et al 2018 moreover the region is characterised by striking differences across the provinces foggia for example achieves the highest share of irrigated land serviced by collectively delivered surface water while for lecce almost 80 of total is served by on farm abstraction of groundwater overall more than 80 of the region s irrigated land is permanently operated in highly specialised production especially olive trees for oil and grape followed by fresh vegetables and processing tomatoes puglia is the leading region in national production of olive oil and table grape and accounts for a full third of processing tomato average irrigation volume for puglia is estimated of 655 million m3 lupia et al 2013 however groundwater abstraction increases considerably in periods of severe drought portoghese et al 2021 zingaro et al 2017 in many areas where groundwater is the main source pumping rates exceed the natural recharge rate leading to ongoing water table drawdown and well depletion as well as a situation in which the regional groundwater vulnerability map reports severe seawater intrusion in coastal areas 2015 2021 update to territorial monitoring decree of the regional government of puglia 16 07 2019 in view of the goals of the eu water framework directive for good ecological management of all surface water the regional government aims to increase the supply of reclaimed urban wastewater for agricultural uses in this regard the past decade has seen the planning of sizable expenditures for either installing or upgrading a total of 93 tertiary wastewater treatment systems within puglia giannoccaro et al 2019 meanwhile on the demand side the region has also implemented policy 1 1 consistent with the national regulatory updates for the quantification of volumes decreto mipaaf del 31 luglio 2015 and recovery of environmental and resource costs decreto mattm n 39 2015 respectively translated into regional laws regolamento n 2 del 28 febbraio 2017 della regione puglia e deliberazione della giunta regionale n 976 del 20 giugno 2017 for reducing water use especially groundwater use for irrigation in particular through establishing systematic metering of the actual water volumes extracted by farmers such policy also obviously implies the need for systems of rigorous control over groundwater access for prevention of illegal abstraction the current research analyses the potential of an incentive based instrument as a means of providing policy makers with a broader selection of measures for achieving the desired aims of agricultural water management 2 2 design of incentive based tool the study applies a choice experiment ce to elicit the farmers willingness to save irrigation water and in particular identify the level of payment that would make them willing to reduce on farm water use ce relies on hypothetical scenarios constructed in consideration of the main attributes and respective levels of the research subject the literature on the design of agri environmental schemes aes points out the positive effects of incentive mechanisms in increasing farmer participation in an extensive review on the attributes of contracts encouraging adoption of agri environmental practices mamine and minviel 2020 identifies two significant clauses of contract design commitments and economic incentives numerous studies apply the choice experiment model in analysis of farmers willingness to accept aes in which the schemes feature a trade off between commitments e g provision of effort duration and payments e g espinosa goded et al 2010 villanueva et al 2017 sardaro et al 2019 a main issue emerging is the heterogeneity in farmers willingness to engage in an aes consequently some authors have recently pointed out that targeting is a key issue in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of aes bartolini and vergamini 2019 vergamini et al 2020 have also observed that in this regard for aes where payments are linked with outcomes there have been very few studies analysing the effective performance of farmer s participation in view of this literature the design of our ce scheme assumes that for farmers to receive payment they must deliver measurable outcomes specifically savings of irrigation water at farm level in other words irrigators will receive an economic reward only for the actual on farm water saved concerning the time commitment under the scheme we consider that in rural development programmes adopters of aes have typically signed five year contracts but also note that more than with other schemes those concerning use of irrigation are more significantly affected by meteorological features such as temperature and rainfall pattern the duration of the commitment can affect the farmer s decision and therefore we consider this as a relevant feature in the design of the scheme furthermore to obtain monotonicity in outcomes the scheme lays out amounts of payment that increase proportionally with the level and duration of provision in this way for each attribute the scheme provides farmers with a broad set of different choice levels at different payments the design of the aes thus considers two main attributes i the targeted amount of on farm water saving i e provision of effort and ii the duration of farmers participation in the compensatory scheme table 1 levels for each attribute were elicited after conducing two focus groups with farmers technicians and experts from irrigation water agencies in puglia region using a d optimal experimental design four choice sets were drawn up each including three alternatives and the no choice option the experimental design aimed at avoiding difficult mental tasks for respondents involving potential issues of incentive compatibility as reported in barreiro hurle et al 2018 discrete choice experiments as a norm are designed with five attributes including the monetary attribute and on average 3 6 levels per attribute 17 levels the number of alternatives per choice card including status quo sq ranges from two to five however these are usually grouped in three alternatives a pre test pilot trial was carried out with eight farmers with the incentives framed on a per hectare equivalent basis rather than euros per cubic metre since during a focus group it had emerged that farmers were more familiar with such equivalents moreover at this time the participants had also strongly disputed the potential of achieving on farm water savings of 50 fig 1 shows an example of a payment card in the case of on farm water use up to 1500 m3 hectare year we set 2017 as the reference year for on farm water use given that this had been the latest very dry season for the region in addition to the influence of climatic conditions on farm irrigation volumes can depend on among other variable the nature of the irrigation systems crop requirements soil type as a consequence choice sets should be constructed accordingly with individual specific sq in most of the scientific literature discrete choice experiments rely on average or 0 sq value only a few papers deal with this issue e g guerrero baena et al 2019 in the context of valuation for water use and salazar ordóñez et al 2021 in the context of aess to account for a broad range of current irrigation volumes we laid out 12 payment cards ranging from 500 to 6000 m3 hectare year however each farmer was only shown the payment card with the volume closest to their current usage of on farm irrigation water the issue of individual specific sq was tackled directly in the survey by making the farmer immediately aware of the monetary reward m3 hectare year earn in each of the aes alternatives 2 3 surveying a questionnaire was designed to collect data from farmers on a range of topics including through the choice experiment the questioning was structured as follows a preliminary information farmer s awareness of current and foreseeable problems regarding the availability and quality of irrigation water in the region of puglia knowledge of regulations on access to water resources presence and type of access to water resource for the interviewee s farm b farm characteristics information concerning the geographic location e g altitude distance from the nearest inhabited centre structural e g irrigated and non irrigated area land tenancy and organisational characteristics i e type of management of the farm c types of crops and breeding distribution of the cultivated area among the different crops grown species of animal husbandry adoption of environmental certifications e g organic integrated pest management adoption of innovations in recent years mechanical managerial varietal and commercial d technical data concerning the irrigation practice general information e g distribution system water sources annual use of irrigation water characteristics of the water service quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the irrigation service operational costs of irrigation e technical data concerning wells characteristics of any wells present on the farm depth diameter flow rate etc f cost of land information regarding the value rental purchase sale prices of the specific farmland g willingness to accept compensation to reduce usage of irrigation water the respondents were presented with a choice experiment asking them to choose between three alternative options of aes in addition to the current situation called no choice option h personal information socio demographic and professional characteristics of the farm manager the sampling procedure was based on the identification of the most intensively irrigated areas of the region i e hot spot irrigated areas in particular the procedure was to calculate the share of irrigated utilised agricultural area uaa at the level of the municipalities italian agricultural census 2010 and then select those with the highest shares for which the sum of irrigated uaa would equal 66 of regional irrigated uaa the experiment was conducted on a sample of 300 farmers from the hot spot areas with the number selected for each hot spot proportion to the municipal share of irrigated uaa in each area the farms were selected on the basis of the criteria farmland size types of crops grown type of irrigation services i e collective self supplied a team of six trained members carried out the survey from december 2018 to february 2019 by means of face to face interviews in the municipalities the survey obtained fully answered questionnaires from 259 respondents fig 2 the characteristics of the universe of irrigators in the targeted region puglia and those of the sample are shown in table 2 although the sample size is small relative to the large number of irrigated farms in the region the main features of irrigated agriculture are fairly fitted of the different features the sample shows larger deviation in the extent of irrigated land being more heavily weighted to large sized farms while irrigated area of olive tree is underweighted given that this crop is more commonly cultivated by smallholders overall however the sample is a good representation of the regional patterns of irrigated crops on farm irrigation volume and irrigation services i e self supplied and collective 2 4 econometric modelling the ce theory is based on the concepts of lancaster 1966 according to which the farmer s utility deriving from a new payment scheme for saving irrigation water is the sum of the utilities related to the characteristics of the scheme furthermore the random utility theory underlying the stochastic utility models thurstone 1927 states that farmers express their individual preferences in order to maximise utility under the income constraint therefore the choice analysis requests the solution of a utility maximisation problem concerning a set of alternatives considering an individual n who chooses the alternative able to ensure the greatest utility among the j possible alternatives at a choice opportunity t the utility function is given by the following expression train 2009 1 u n j t v n j t e n j t n 1 n j 1 j t 1 t where v njt is the deterministic component while e njt is the random component specifically defined as an independent and identically gumbel distributed iid component given a finite set of j alternatives farmer n performs a series of pairwise comparisons between them so as to identify the alternative that maximises their utility in particular the alternative i will be preferred to j if u nit u njt j i due to the stochastic nature of the utility function the maximisation problem can be solved in probabilistic terms therefore considering a set of j alternative the probability that a farmer n chooses the alternative i is given by 2 p n i t p r o b v n i t ε n i t v n j t ε n j t 0 j i j whose estimation can be made using a discrete choice model mcfadden 1986 assuming a linear utility function in parameters for the deterministic component the expression 1 can be reformulated as 3 u n j t β n x n j t ε n j t n 1 n j 1 j t 1 t where β n is a k 1 vector of parameters to be estimated concerns utility and corresponds to k choice characteristics x njt instead is the k 1 vector of choice characteristics concerning the alternative j at the choice opportunity t carried out by the farmer n farmers may present similar attitudes in presence of different choice sets leading to correlation phenomena therefore to the violation of the assumption related to the independence of irrelevant alternatives iia to relax this assumption the expression 3 introduces a β n vector of specific parameters for farmers following a g β θ distribution whose vector θ indicates mean and variance this specification allows the formulation of the random parameter logit model rplm able to capture the heterogeneity of unobserved factors that are common to groups of farmers and are able to influence choices mamine and minviel 2020 the probability that a subject n chooses the alternative i at the choice opportunity t is calculated as train 2009 4 p n i t exp v n i t j exp v n j t f β d β where the distribution f of the random parameters β is specified by researcher in this regard a normal distribution for the price variable incentive and a triangular distribution for the remaining attributes were used for the form of the density functions of parameters greene and hensher 2003 final models were obtained using 1000 halton s draws halton 1960 an alternative specific constant asc was also included in the model to capture preferences for the no choice option finally willingness to accept wta was calculated as the ratio between each non monetary attribute and the attribute relating to price namely 5 w t a k β k β i where wta k is the willingness to accept for the k attribute β k is the estimated coefficient for the k attribute and β p is the estimated coefficient for the incentive attribute the 95 confidence intervals were calculated using the method proposed by krinsky and robb 1986 and the wta was estimated through the delta method 3 results 3 1 sample statistics overall the surveyed farms totalled 9176 ha of farmland including 7049 of irrigable land of which 4954 were irrigated in 2017 accounting for 2 of total irrigated area of puglia region on average the farm size reported is 35 ha of which 18 94 were irrigated in 2017 of the irrigated farms 59 rely on self supply services from groundwater on farm wells the total water volume for irrigation amounted to 6 414 million m3 while average irrigation volume was 2026 m3 ha table 3 the farmers of the sample are mostly male 80 and their average age is 51 years for 72 of respondents farming is the main economic activity for the remaining 28 off farm employment is more important olive tree is the most frequent irrigated crop followed by table grape and vegetables a sizable number of farms also crop processing tomato under irrigation half of the respondents expressed concerns over the status of the quality of water bodies and the quantity of water within the puglia region moreover almost 60 expect increasing water shortages in the near future nevertheless among those who have on farm access to groundwater only 42 out of 187 respondents recognised that their farmland were already affected by salinity the awareness of quantitative issues is higher since 48 of groundwater users self reported that they were already affected by well depletion almost 20 of farmers largely those who rely on self supplied irrigation groundwater did not know how much irrigation water they use 2 2 for these respondents ce was conducted setting as sq the standard irrigation requirements m3 ha year as provided by local technicians of most relevant on farm irrigated crop 3 2 estimated model when respondents appeared unwilling to participate at all in the aes also known in ce as serial non participation protest answers were distinguished from legitimate zero bids by means of follow up questions to check farmers motivations in investigating willingness to accept wta in relation to incentive based schemes contexts very few studies have provided coherent guidance on identifying protest responses however the concern in such cases is mainly that of distinguishing protest behaviour from very high taking villanueva et al 2017 at the close of ce section of the survey therefore serial non participants were provided with close ended answers for indication of possible motivations underlying their choices of 69 serial non participants those providing legitimate zero bid answers included 38 respondents who lack enough information and 12 who believe the incentives are much too low another three reasons generally seen in literature for identification of protests and also considered as protest in the current ce are do not think such measures are a good solution 14 respondents it s a problem of the state 3 respondents and do not trust regional government actions 2 respondents a total of 19 observations were excluded by the econometric regression in line with other analyses in the literature villanueva et al 2017 alcon et al 2019 it is worth mentioning that among those who claim that they have little information 23 did not know their on farm water use or cost for irrigation in general the farmers surveyed did not behave strategically in their responses average values per attribute were calculated at each level using the lowest level as baseline reference in the model the alternative specific constant asc takes the value zero when one alternative of aes is selected and 1 when the current status is selected table 4 reports the results of the random parameter logit model all attributes are significant and the asc is significant with negative sign meaning that the no choice option is less convenient for farmers random parameters in the utility function show no linearity overall the environmental payment scheme is well accepted by the interviewees to capture the heterogeneity of unobserved factors common to groups of farmers and able to influence choices a set of covariates was also tested all significant variables introduced as covariates are reported in table 6 some of the heterogeneity in farmers choices is explained by covariates found to be significant in econometric regression it is worth mentioning the salinity issue in particular that respondents who acknowledge already experiencing detrimental effects from salinity were more likely to accept the environmental scheme variables such as metering mulching and reservoir are all related to farmers already with good accounting services for irrigation water and the presence of all of these features makes it more likely that farmers will be willing to accept payment schemes aimed at saving on farm irrigation water in contrast farmers whose crop pattern includes processing tomato or table grape are less likely to accept any incentive for reducing on farm irrigation volumes table 5 reports the average marginal wta estimates at different levels of each attribute respective to baseline wta values range from 0 03625 to 0 07870 m3 at 20 and 30 water savings respectively while time attribute reports higher monetary values ranging from 0 25162 to 0 38565 m3 for three and five year periods of commitment respectively 4 discussion of results based on the ce findings duration of commitment i e time emerges as an attribute much more relevant of the percentage of water savings i e save this distinguishes the research results from those reported in vergamini et al 2020 which assumed the duration of the aes time window as a five year period as extensively reported in previous studies giannoccaro et al 2015 the value of irrigation water in fact changes over time depending on climatic conditions the least relevant attribute relates to the extent of savings or savings effort i e save furthermore in respect of the levels of choice neither save nor time show linearity in marginal wta values the survey data can serve as a basis for designing policy in more detail by estimating potential water savings associated with the implementation of the proposed aes type we assume that farmers will save on their annual water use according to the aes framework the water saving curve is estimated considering each farmer s response i e preferred savings effort duration and incentive and its current on farm water use m3 ha in detail the water saving curve is drawn by averaging the amounts that farmers are willing to save at each price on an annual base during a five years period fig 3 keeping in mind that for the sampled farms average yearly water use is 2026 m3 ha for savings of 300 m3 ha 15 of current water use farmers call for 0 40 m3 annually this sums up 120 ha while it does not take into account transaction costs of participation in such a scheme in general the findings show that there is room for implementing the proposed type of economic incentives perhaps within the upcoming eu 2023 2027 rural development programme however based on the significance of covariates the crop specialisations of the farm are critical in determining the farmer s choice sardaro et al 2020 farmers whose crops receive high added value from irrigation e g table grape processing tomato are not willing to enrol in the proposed aes while in irrigated olive tree for oil deficit irrigation below crop level requirements is already largely practiced expósito and berbel 2016 for processing tomato or table grape only marginal reductions in season by season water allotments would be possible gatta et al 2015 also in this regard pagliacci et al 2020 reported very low adoption of an aes for 25 reduction of irrigation volumes on corn and tobacco crops the most water intensive crops of the veneto region north eastern italy targeting payments on the basis of crop profitability would therefore be advisable as well as differentiated spatial payment in the manner proposed by bartolini and vergamini 2019 other potential shortcomings concern the possibility of adverse selection in the case that the farmer withdraws less profitable resources such as salt water as already reported in the australian water market zuo et al 2014 and in the californian land market mukherjee and schwabe 2014 indeed in the current research those farmers who have already experienced groundwater salt intrusion report higher probability of adhering to the aes a number of variables related to the opposite context of good practices of on farm irrigation management i e mulching on farm water metering on farm reservoir are linked to higher willingness to uptake the proposed aes instrument likewise of more educated farmers such positive interactions can be explained by lower transaction costs incurred for adhering to aes furthermore the presence of a collective pipeline networks also plays a key role in the farmer s decisions on irrigation management increasing the probability of adhering to the aes this effect is probably due to the lower economic value of water service from collective networks compared to on farm abstraction from groundwater mirra et al 2021 the proposed incentive based instrument is shown to have potential for savings in irrigation water with magnitudes of impact at the regional level but can also have other advantages and beneficial effects the payment scheme is not compulsory which makes monitoring and control actions easier for the regulator montginoul et al 2016 but there is also the further beneficial effect of encouraging greater diffusion of on farm volume metering the proposed aes can also serve in gathering in situ data on irrigation water volumes foster et al 2020 and of course such schemes cannot be drawn on by unauthorised water users meaning that the aes should also incentivise voluntary disclosure of farmers water use the current research has been conducted on the scale of a large region with great variability in irrigation water services collective and self supplied water sources surface and groundwater as well as on farm irrigation use current irrigation volumes this also results in high standard deviation for coefficients of the attributes future research needs to achieve more pinpoint estimations conducting surveys in the context of single crop patterns and single types of irrigation service thereby allowing identification of a specific sq for all the relative respondents improvements could also be made in the sense of reducing the number of alternatives and choice sets in the choice experiment making it easier for farmers trade off reasoning another relevant issue refers to the low level of knowledge of some farmers with regards to their actual water use to deal with this issue researchers should conduct blind and informed experimental games with irrigators 5 conclusions crop irrigation uses vast amounts of freshwater and therefore saving water for reallocation to other sectors among others including the natural environment has become an aim in policy agendas worldwide the importance of the issue becomes critically clear during periods of drought the current research conducts a pilot study eliciting responses to the design of a new agri environmental payment scheme aimed at saving irrigation water in a water stressed region with mediterranean climate according to the findings the farmers are willing to save water in response to the tested payment scheme importantly however the research shows that such schemes should be set up differently than has been the practice in particular by allowing for flexible duration of commitment in seeking to comply with the water framework directive wfd regulation italy faces critical challenges in accounting for water uses in agriculture in 2015 the italian ministry for agricultural policy opened the way for accounting of usages of irrigation water guidelines for the regional regulation of means of quantification of water volumes used in irrigation decreto mipaaf del 31 luglio 2015 but until now such accounting has not been achieved least of all in puglia in this regard the proposed aes is not compulsory which makes monitoring and control actions easier for the regional government indeed volumetric metering is a prerequisite to entering in the payment scheme under the instrument moreover the aes also provides economic incentive to farmers for voluntary disclosure and rectification of illegal access to groundwater in the proposed instrument the incentives are constructed in the manner of an outcomes based reward system thereby ensuring true savings in volumes moreover as with incentives based on market regulation the instrument achieves useful data collection such as on the monetary value of water saved by the farmers on the other hand a potential weakness is that the proposed instrument appears less effective in coping with intensive value added water usage on crops such as processing tomato and table grape there could also be potential adverse selection in cases where water quality is already suffering for example with higher salt content this economic instrument should not be seen as panacea for the problems in managing irrigation water usage the aim here is to provide policy makers with a broader range of instruments for application in contexts of agricultural water management funding the survey of farmers reported in this study was carried out under the project economia delle risorse irrigue in puglia

9358,cottonseed as the main by product of cotton has important industrial utilization value due to the high protein content although previous studies found that high temperature or drought can affect cottonseed protein yield reports on the detailed physiological mechanisms are limited moreover the combination of the two stresses on cottonseed protein synthesis has received little attention to address this two cotton cultivars sumian 15 and phy370wr were exposed to two temperature regimes consisting of ambient temperature and elevated temperature ambient temperature plus 2 5 2 7 c and three water treatments including soil relative water content srwc 75 5 optimum soil moisture srwc 60 5 mild drought and srwc 45 5 severe drought were established under each temperature regime results showed that individual elevated temperature or drought had quite different effects on protein synthesis elevated temperature alone improved the kernel protein content by 3 90 8 53 for both cultivars compared with ambient temperature by increasing the maximum rate of protein accumulation vm moreover elevated temperature alone enhanced amino acid synthesis by increasing the activity of glutamine synthetase gs and glutamate synthase gogat and the expression of ghgs and ghgogat which was also good for increasing protein content mild drought slightly affected the protein accumulation during cottonseed kernel development although the duration of protein rapid accumulation increased severe drought significantly decreased the vm and the activity of gs and gogat as well as the expression of ghgs and ghgogat finally leading to lower protein content the interaction effect between the two stresses on protein synthesis was significant since elevated temperature promoted protein synthesis under mild drought by increasing the vm the activity of gs and gogat and the expression of ghgs and ghgogat however elevated temperature further reduced gs and gogat activities and ghgs and ghgogat expressions to inhibit protein synthesis under severe drought keywords cottonseed elevated temperature soil drought protein accumulation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction high temperature and soil drought are the major causes of abiotic stress impacting crop productivity challinor et al 2014 due to global warming the annual global temperature was projected to increase by 2 8 0 4 c by the end of the 21st century brown and caldeira 2017 in addition climate change will also lead to a notable increase in the frequency of drought events particularly in the arid and semi arid regions alqudah et al 2011 the climate change models predicted that heat and drought stresses would become more intense and widespread shortly soon and the probability of their concomitant occurrence will increase by orders of magnitude rosenzweig et al 2014 ipcc 2021 so their negative impacts on crop production are likely to become more pronounced mittler 2006 zandalinas et al 2020 cotton gossypium hirsutum l is susceptible to water deficit and high temperature especially in the reproduction stage wendel et al 2010 chai et al 2016 numerous previous studies have confirmed that exposure to above optimal temperatures or deficient water supply has adverse effects on physiological and biochemical metabolism and the final yield of cotton hu et al 2017b 2020 zhao et al 2020 these researches also showed that the impacts of constant heat and drought on cotton growth and development are strikingly different in many aspects hence the synthetic effects of high temperature and drought on cotton cannot be extrapolated from a single stress loka et al 2020 cottonseed has great economic value owing to a high content of proteins 45 50 lipids 25 30 and carbohydrates 10 dowd and wakelyn 2010 yang et al 2017 seed protein is high in essential amino acids and has been a good source of protein for industrial processing kumar et al 2021 in recent years global cottonseed production was around 40 million metric tons per year and protein yield was up to 10 million metric tons annually wedegaertner rathore 2015 making cotton the second largest potential resource of plant protein after soybean glycine max strengthening the research on cottonseed protein would help to improve cottonseed utilization and the economic benefits to meet the increasing demand of the protein industry however the research on the protein production of cottonseed has not received sufficient attention because protein synthesis is derived from amino acids the biosynthesis of amino acids is a rate limiting step muropastor and florencio 2003 glutamine synthetase gs and glutamate synthetase gogat cycle play key roles in amino acid synthesis muhitch 1991 hayakawa et al 1999 hirel et al 2001 and the enzymes of gs and gogat maintain high activities during protein accumulation potel et al 2009 hence gs gogat cycle is also closely related to protein synthesis the functional roles of gs and gogat in protein synthesis have been well studied in photosynthetic organs of arabidopsis potel et al 2009 rice oryza sativa l zhong et al 2017 and cotton wang et al 2017 in grains of maize zea mays l limami et al 2002 and wheat triticum aestivum l wei et al 2021 and in protein enriched cottonseed yang et al 2016 previous researches proved that 23 5 32 c is the optimal developmental temperature range for upland cotton and the cotton yield containing lint yield and cottonseed yield would reduce significantly when the temperature rises above the upper threshold 32 c burke et al 1988 pettigrew 2008 hu et al 2017b however the prolonged high temperature increased the protein content in cottonseed xu et al 2021 a previous study reported that gs activity was increased under heat stress contributing to the rapid consumption of glutamate and the generation of enough glutamine which finally led to increased contents of amino acids and proteins in wheat grains under high temperature zhang et al 2019 yang et al 2018 also noticed that heat increased protein content in maize due to the enhanced gs activity however the specific mechanism has not been explored for cottonseed although there is higher protein content in heat stressed cottonseed moreover it has been reported that soybean seed crude protein content was highly correlated with soil water availability to plants sabagh et al 2018 das et al 2017 reported that water deficit resulted in the lower activity of gs leading to the inhibition of glutamic acid synthesis which was not conducive to protein production michaletti et al 2018 also noticed that water deficient conditions caused severe decreases in glutamate and total protein contents in spring wheat with impairments mainly in enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism for cotton a recent study also reported that drought could alter amino acid concentration dry weight and protein concentration in cottonseed li et al 2022 however the previous research did not involve the exploration of detailed physiological processes numerous articles have reported that a combination of heat stress and soil drought could cause more damage to crops than single stress cairns et al 2013 loka et al 2020 for instance a previous study reported that combined high temperature and soil drought could further reduce nitrogen anabolism but augment protein catabolism in perennial grass compared with single stress chastain et al 2016 kaur et al 2014 also found that heat stress coupling with drought stress was more likely to cause protein changes in wheat compared with individual stress however some studies reported that depending on the conditions of the stress combination single stress may be dominant so that the plant response to combined stress is similar to that to single stress and even one stress exhibits protection against damage from another stress awasthi et al 2014 rivero et al 2014 however the interaction effects of heat stress and soil drought on the protein synthesis of cottonseed are still unclear we hypothesized that elevated temperature and drought stress would have an interactive effect on protein accumulation within cottonseed and the responses to different levels of soil moisture and elevated temperature combination would exhibit variously thus the objectives of this study were to reveal how the physiological changes of protein accumulation by exploring the substance contents enzyme activities and gene expression patterns involved in nitrogen metabolism in cottonseed during high temperature and drought stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental designs the experiment was carried out in ponds in a greenhouse structure having a transparent plastic top from 2016 to 2018 at the nanjing agricultural university experimental station 118 50 e 32 02 n gossypium hirsutum cultivars sumian 15 high temperature sensitive and phy370wr high temperature tolerant were used in this experiment as reported in a previous experiment xu et al 2019 cotton seedlings grew in a seedbed until three true leaves stage then the uniform and healthy seedlings were moved into the ponds the experiment arrangement was designed as a split plot design with three replications the main plot and subplot were temperature treatment and water treatment respectively each plot contained five rows with a spacing of 75 cm row spacing 25 cm interplant spacing finally there were 80 plants in each plot all plots were well watered and maintained at ambient temperature before the temperature and water treatments were established different temperature and water regimes were applied when 50 of plants had white flowers at the first note on the 6th 7th mainstem fruiting branches two temperature treatments included ambient temperature and elevated temperature ambient temperature plus about 2 5 c were designed and conducted by a temperature control system otc south east co ltd reported by xu et al 2022 the real time data of the two temperature regions were represented in fig s1 the mean daily temperature mdt in elevated temperature region was 2 7 c 2 6 c and 2 5 c higher than ambient temperature area in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively table s1 the mdt in elevated temperature region in each experimental year was above 32 c which is the upper threshold of the optimum temperature for boll growth burke et al 1988 meaning that the elevated temperature caused heat stress to boll development in this study the photosynthetically active radiation par showed few significant variations among treatments fig s2 three water regimes including srwc 75 5 optimum soil moisture srwc 60 5 mild drought and srwc 45 5 severe drought were set up under each temperature regime according to wang et al 2016 after the beginning of soil moisture treatments the irrigation under moderate and severe drought regimes was suspended meanwhile the drain valve at the bottom of pond was opened until the soil moisture level was near the target srwc threshold soil samples were collected with a soil corer between 18 00 and 19 00 the fresh weight fw was measured immediately then soil samples were oven dried and the dry weight was determined srwc was calculated as fw dw dw the srwc throughout the trial period was provided in fig s3 irrigation treatment significantly affected leaf water potential during the flowering and boll forming stage which was consistent with the trend for srwc fig s4 finally six treatments were established including i ambient temperature with optimum soil moisture srwc 75 5 donated as at75 control ii iii ambient temperature combined with mild drought srwc 60 5 and severe drought srwc 45 5 respectively donated as at60 at45 iv elevated temperature combined with optimum soil moisture srwc 75 5 donated as et75 v vi elevated

branches blooming on the day of establishment of different treatments were labeled with plastic tags to note the date different temperature and water treatments lasted until the tagged cotton bolls opened 2 2 sample collecting about 6 8 marked bolls were sampled at 7 day intervals from 10 days post anthesis dpa to bolls opening at 09 00 am 10 00 am after the seed kernels in cotton bolls were manually separated half of the kernels were immediately stored at 80 c for enzyme and gene analyses the other half was dried to constant weight 105 c for 30 min and 80 c for 10 h for substance determination 2 3 free amino acid content and protein content measurement powdered samples 1 0 g and 5 ml of 50 mm kh2po4 with a ph of 7 were crushed to homogenate before centrifuging for 15 min at 12

defatted samples 0 1 g and 5 ml of 6 m hcl were put into a 15 ml hydrolysis tube then the n2 gas was filled into the hydrolysis tubes as a protectant before heating at 110 c for 21 h after cooling to room temperature the hydrolysates were dried under vacuum conditions before being redissolved using sodium citrate buffer with a ph of 2 2 finally the solution was filtered through a 0 25 μm filter for amino acid component analysis the concentration of glutamate was assayed with an amino acid analyzer model l 8800 hitachi tokyo japan according to mu et al 2009 2 5 enzyme activity analysis gs ec 6 3 1 2 and gogat ec 1 4 7 1 were extracted as described previously lea et al 1990 with slight modification 0 5 g frozen kernels and 5 ml extraction buffer ph 7 2 containing 50 mm kh2po4 1 w v insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone pvpp 5 v v glycerol 2 mm edta and 2 mm dithiothreitol dtt were crushed before centrifuging at 12 000g at 4 c for 20 min the supernatant was used for the determination of gs and gogat activities for gs activity the reaction buffer consisted of 50 mm imidazole buffer with a ph of 7 0 30 mm mgcl2 25 mm hydroxylamine and 100 mm l glutamate the final reaction system contained 1 2 ml enzyme extraction 1 6 ml reaction buffer and 0 2 ml of 1 m nh2oh the absorbance values were measured at 540 nm for gogat assay the reaction mixture included 1 2 ml

analysis the effects of temperature treatment water treatment and temperature treatment water treatment interaction on all parameters of interest within each cultivar were assessed using a two way anova with spss 21 0 spss inc chicago il usa correlation analysis and principal component analysis pca were also conducted with spss 21 0 version figures were drawn by origin 9 0 originlab inc northampton ma usa the s shaped growth curve can be used to simulate protein accumulation in cottonseed yang et al 2016 as follows 1 w w m 1 ae b d pa where a and b are two coefficients w is the observed protein content and w m represents the theoretical maximum of protein content based on formula 1 the following formulas were developed 2 t 1 1 b ln 2 3 a 3 t 2 1 b ln 2 3 a 4 t t 2 t 1 5 v m bw m 4 where t 1 and t 2 represent the initial date and terminal date for the rapid accumulation phase of protein respectively t means the duration of protein rapid accumulation and v m indicates the maximum rate of protein accumulation in the cottonseed kernel 3 results 3 1 protein accumulation and free amino acid content compared with at75 mild drought at60 slightly decreased protein content in cottonseed kernels at 38 dpa except for phy370wr in 2018 fig 1a similarly protein concentration at 38 dpa was significantly decreased at severe drought at45 for both cultivars however et75 enhanced protein accumulation markedly in the three years the interaction effect between temperature and water treatment in both cultivars was significant table 3 since et60 increased the kernel protein content at 38 dpa for the two cultivars relative to at60 except for phy370wr in 2017 however et45 decreased the protein content at 38 dpa compared with at45 except for sumian 15 in 2017 and phy370wr in 2016 the results in table 2 showed that all the determination coefficients were significant p 0 01 indicating that the s shaped growth curve was effectively described the protein accumulation process et75 enhanced the vm and decreased the t value compared with at75 in contrast at60 and at45 lowered the vm and increased the t under the combined stress et60 increased the vm compared to at60 and et45 also increased the vm compared to at45 as shown in fig 1b the free amino acid content in the kernel reached the peak level at 17 dpa and then declined et75 during the flowering and boll forming stage significantly reduced free amino acid content compared with at75 table 3 in contrast free amino acid content increased pronouncedly with the decreasing of soil moisture besides a decrease in free amino acid content was observed in et60 compared with at60 however et45 increased significantly relative to at45 in sumian 15 from 2016 to 2018 there was no significant difference between et45 and at45 in phy370wr 3 2 glutamate concentration at 17 dpa the percentage of glutamate was significantly affected by soil drought alone elevated temperature alone and the interaction of water temperature in sumian 15 fig 2 for phy370wr glutamate concentration was only significantly affected by soil drought alone at 31 and 38 dpa the glutamate concentration was notably affected by individual stress or the combined stress in both cultivars at60 decreased glutamate concentration by 5 7 in sumian 15 and 2 8 in phy370wr respectively and at45 decreased glutamate concentration by 12 0 in sumian 15 and 6 8 in phy370wr respectively conversely et75 markedly increased the glutamate concentration by 6 9 in sumian 15 and 3 7 in phy370wr respectively interestingly et60 increased the glutamate concentration by 5 5 and 2 7 in sumian 15 and phy370wr at 38 dpa respectively relative to at60 yet the concentration of glutamate was decreased numerically under et45 in sumian 15 and phy370wr relative to at45 3 3 the correlations among protein content free amino acid content glutamate concentration and protein accumulation characteristics as shown in fig 3 kernel protein content had a significant positive correlation with the vm p 0 01 but had significant negative correlations with the t value and free amino acid content p 0 01 moreover protein content was positively correlated with glutamate concentration p 0 01 fig 4 whereas there was a significant negative correlation between free amino acid content and glutamate concentration p 0 01 3 4 enzyme activities in cottonseed the activity of gs in cottonseed kernels was decreased at 17 24 and 38 dpa in 2016 and 2018 for sumian 15 but was not significant lower for phy370wr in three years under at60 than at75 fig 5a and it was decreased markedly under at45 at each sampling day in the two cultivars except for phy370wr at 24 dpa in 2016 by contrast et75 significantly increased gs activity compared with at75 an interaction effect was observed at most measurement dates with the exception of 10 dpa table 4 compared to at60 gs activity was increased by 7 5 in sumian 15 and 3 9 in phy370wr under et60 respectively across the three years however the gs activity at et45 was lower than at45 in sumian 15 and no significant difference was detected between et45 and at45 in phy370wr similarly at60 did not significantly reduce gogat activity with the exception of 24 and 31 dpa in 2017 and 2018 for sumian 15 respectively however gogat activity was significantly reduced at most measurement dates in at45 for the two cultivars fig 5b table 4 in contrast gogat activity was increased notably under et75 from 17 to 38 dpa the interaction effect between temperature and water treatment was significant from 17 to 38 dpa compared to at60 et60 increased gogat activity for sumian 15 5 11 and phy370wr 4 06 in the three years respectively while et45 markedly decreased gogat activity compared with at45 in most measurement dates for sumian 15 and it was not significant for phy370wr 3 5 gene expressions both temperature and water regimes significantly affected the expression level of ghgs and ghgogat in cottonseed kernels fig 6 compared with at75 the ghgs expression was markedly down regulated with the decreasing of soil moisture at 17 and 24 dpa except for ghgs expression under at60 at 17 dpa in phy370wr conversely et75 induced a higher expression level of ghgs at 17 and 24 dpa relative to at75 under et60 the expression level of ghgs at 17 dpa was up regulated by 1 57 and 1 08 fold in sumian 15 and phy370wr compared to at60 respectively at 24 dpa ghgs expression had no significant differences between et60 and at60 under the treatment of et45 ghgs expression was down regulated at 17 and 24 dpa for both cultivars compared to at45 except for phy370wr at 17 dpa there was no significant change for the relative expression of ghgogat at at60 in sumian 15 at all sampling dates however at60 up regulated ghgogat expression in phy370wr at 17 dpa and showed no significant difference at 24 dpa the relative expression of ghgogat was significantly down regulated for the two cultivars when exposed to at45 down regulations of 0 70 and 0 88 folds at 17 dpa and 0 84 and 0 89 folds at 24 dpa were detected in sumian 15 and phy370wr respectively the expression of ghgogat was markedly up regulated under et75 and the effect was more evident on 17 dpa which showed 1 89 and 1 66 fold increases in sumian 15 and phy370wr respectively relative to at75 et60 up regulated the relative expression of ghgogat compared with at60 especially in sumian 15 however et45 down regulated the ghgogat expression in both cultivars 3 6 principal component analysis pca to further distinguish the impacts of soil drought elevated temperature and their combination on the protein accumulation in cottonseed kernels a pca was conducted using the data related to protein synthesis fig 7 the results showed that pc 1 and pc 2 could explain 82 5 and 11 7 of the total variance respectively the glutamate concentration protein content vm free amino acid content gogat activity and ghgogat expression have high scores on pc1 while pc 2 has large loading coefficients on t gs activity and ghgs expression the effects of water regimes were well separated by the pc 1 and the effects of temperature regimes were well separated by the pc 2 the effects of combined stresses were clearly distinguished in accordance with pc 1 and pc 2 4 discussion drought and heat stresses are the critical environmental factors limiting crop production seriously damaging crop yield and quality worldwide pettigrew 2004 juroszek et al 2020 the underlying mechanisms associated with physiological processes in the cotton in response to drought wang et al 2016 or elevated temperature dai et al 2015 in isolation have been addressed and the combined effects of these two factors on cotton yield and cottonseed yield have been previously described by our previous article gao et al 2021 xu et al 2022 drought and elevated temperature significantly reduced cotton yield and the decline in boll number was the primary driver of yield loss and the combination of severe drought and elevated temperature produced lower yields than any other treatment combination or any single abiotic stress factor gao et al 2021 which was consistent with the trend for cottonseed yield our previous article also found that drought stress and elevated temperature combination markedly reduced protein yield due to the cottonseed yield loss xu et al 2022 however prior to this study no studies focused on the coupled effects of the two stresses on protein accumulation mechanism within the cottonseed in the present research the reasons for the changes in protein content under drought and elevated temperature were further studied the protein accumulation in cottonseed kernels can be fitted by a s shaped growth curve and the results showed that kernel protein content at 38 dpa was positively and significantly correlated with the vm of protein concentration but had a negative correlation with the t of protein concentration meaning that the rate of protein accumulation may play a dominant role in determining the final protein content hence although elevated temperature et75 shortened the t of protein concentration increased vm finally resulted in the increased protein content which is in agreement with previous research conducted by li et al 2013 mild drought at60 treatment had no significant effect on protein accumulation while severe drought at45 notably restrained protein accumulation by reducing the vm meaning that protein accumulation in cottonseed was sensitive to severe water deficiency this was similar to the results found by singh 2007 on protein accumulation within soybean grain and singh 2007 speculated that this might be because the seed is less sensitive to water shortage than other organs only the water status in the seed body is significantly lower than the critical requirement which will inhibit the synthesis of seed protein however different from our results of the protein accumulation the final protein content was increased under drought stress in rapeseed brassica napus l and maize which should be that the response of protein synthesis in seed to water shortage varied with species ghassemi golezani et al 2015 li et al 2021 most studies reported that the relative effect of the combination of heat and drought stress treatment was consistently more dramatic than the influence of heat or drought applied separately chen et al 2019 mahalingam and bregitzer 2019 similarly in the present study elevated temperature and severe drought combination et45 significantly inhibited protein accumulation compared with any single stress however the combined elevated temperature and mild drought et60 promoted the protein content by increasing the vm relative to at60 indicating that elevated temperature had different effects on protein accumulation of cottonseed under different drought stress levels these results supported previous conclusion reported by cohen et al 2021 that the impact of combined stress relative to individual stress on certain parameters depends on many factors especially stress intensity the supply of free amino acids is an essential factor in protein synthesis and a large number of free amino acids would provide an adequate substrate for protein synthesis takahashi et al 2003 in the current study the free amino acid content was negatively and significantly correlated with protein content in cottonseed kernel fig 2 which was consistent with the results of a previous study under different soil n levels yang et al 2016 and they reported that this is because the relative contents of amino acids and proteins were affected by the conversion between them elevated temperature et75 significantly decreased the free amino acid content however free amino acid content was increased markedly when plants were exposed to drought especially for severe drought which illustrated that heat temperature and drought had opposite effects on the accumulation of free amino acids in support of our results good and zaplachinski 1994 reported higher free amino acid content in rapeseed under drought stress and zhao et al 2005 found that high temperature significantly reduced free amino acid content in grains at the late stage of grain filling moreover et60 had lower free amino acid content than at60 but et45 had higher free amino acid content than at45 indicating that elevated temperature further enhanced the influence of severe drought on free amino acid content of cottonseed but reduced the impact of mild drought heat stress has been found to increase glutamate level in wheat irmak et al 2008 while drought had a negative effect on glutamate concentration in alfalfa medicago sativa l aranjuelo et al 2011 similarly et75 significantly increased the glutamate concentration in cottonseed kernel however the glutamate concentration was decreased markedly under drought especially under severe drought suggesting that the effect of high temperature or drought alone on cottonseed kernel glutamate concentration were different correia et al 2018 reported high temperature further enhanced the effect of drought on glutamate concentration consistent with their observation at45 decreased the glutamate concentration in cottonseed kernel and et45 further decreased glutamate concentration relative to at45 however et60 improved glutamate concentration than at60 at 38 dpa although at60 decreased the glutamate concentration in cottonseed kernel which showed that high temperature enhanced glutamate synthesis under mild drought these results revealed that the effect of coupled stress on crops is closely related to the intensity of individual stress jiang et al 2020 as the initial amino acid formed by nitrogen metabolism glutamate is directly dependent on the gs gogat cycle and the two enzymes gs and gogat play a synergistic role in glutamate synthesis zhang et al 2014 in our study the activities of gs and gogat maintained higher levels under elevated temperature however gs and gogat activities were significantly decreased under drought which agreed with the previous results in soybean conducted by das et al 2016 2017 where the activities of gs and gogat decreased under drought situations and in apple malus domestica borkh plants conducted by liang et al 2018 where elevated temperature significantly increased gs and gogat activities moreover ghgs and ghgogat were the critical genes during the glutamate synthesis zhao and shi 2006 the expression of ghgs and ghgogat was down regulated as a response to drought stress but was markedly up regulated under elevated temperature suggesting that the effect of elevated temperature or water deficit on gs and gogat activities should be the result of changes in genes ghgs and ghgogat expressions hence the altered gs and gogat activities as well as ghgs and ghgogat expression under elevated temperature or drought directly influenced the synthesis of glutamate which could explain the above observations why glutamate concentration was increased under high temperature but was decreased markedly under drought unexpectedly the change of glutamate was not consistent with that of free amino acid under elevated temperature or drought and glutamate concentration was negatively correlated with free amino acid content however glutamate concentration was positively correlated with protein which let us speculate that high temperature may speed up the conversion of amino acids to proteins while drought will slow this process down in support of our speculation zhao et al 2005 found that high temperature could accelerate the utilization of amino acids in grains to form protein and tarighaleslami et al 2012 reported that extreme drought stress affected undesirably the protein forming in corn seed further there were significant interactions between temperature and water regimes on the activities of gs and gogat at most measurement dates and the expression levels of ghgs and ghgogat at 17 dpa since mild drought combined with elevated temperature improved the enzyme activities gs and gogat and the gene expressions ghgs and ghgogat in relation to mild drought but severe drought combined with elevated temperature was further inhibited these related enzymes activities and genes expressions these results suggested that elevated air temperature improved protein accumulation in cottonseed under mild drought but limited the protein synthesis when cotton plants were exposed to severe drought stress furthermore based on the results of pca of the protein synthesis process fig 7 the water deficit was well separated by the first pc and the scores of pc 1 for drought decreased with the intensification of drought in contrast elevated temperature caused a shift in sample position in accordance with pc2 water deficit and elevated temperature combination had a significant interaction effect according to the scores of pc1 and pc2 which indicated that the impact of mild drought coupling with elevated temperature on protein synthesis in cottonseed was mainly dominated by elevated temperature however the effect of severe drought coupling with elevated temperature was mainly affected by drought degree the pc 1 had high loading to glutamate concentration protein content vm free amino acid content and gogat activity and ghgogat expression the pc 2 mainly relied on t value gs activity and ghgs expression meaning that the combination of related parameters to protein accumulation could be used to describe the differences between soil drought and elevated temperature in face of global climate change 5 conclusion in conclusion soil drought and elevated temperature alone affected protein accumulation differently mild drought had no significant effect on protein accumulation in cottonseed kernels severe drought decreased the maximum rate of kernel protein accumulation vm the enzyme activities gs and gogat and the relative expressions ghgs and ghgogat compared with the control at75 inhibiting glutamate biosynthesis and reducing protein content conversely elevated temperature alone enhanced above enzyme activities gene expressions and vm finally obtaining a high protein content relative to at75 elevated temperature and drought stress combination had an interaction effect on protein accumulation mild drought combined with elevated temperature increased the vm enhanced the activities of gs and gogat and the expression levels of ghgs and ghgogat relative to mild drought alone promoting glutamate synthesis and improving protein content nevertheless severe drought and elevated temperature combination restrained protein accumulation relative to severe drought alone by decreasing the activities of gs and gogat and the expressions of ghgs and ghgogat thus the co effects of drought stress and elevated temperature on protein accumulation within cottonseed depended at least on the intensity of drought stress

cottonseed protein yield reports on the detailed physiological mechanisms are limited moreover the combination of the two stresses on cottonseed protein synthesis has received little attention to address this two cotton cultivars sumian 15 and phy370wr were exposed to two temperature regimes consisting of ambient temperature and elevated temperature ambient temperature plus 2 5 2 7 c and three water treatments including soil relative water content srwc 75 5 optimum soil moisture srwc 60 5 mild drought and srwc 45 5 severe drought were established under each temperature regime results showed that individual elevated temperature or drought had quite different effects on protein synthesis elevated temperature alone improved the kernel protein content by 3 90 8 53 for both cultivars compared with ambient temperature by increasing the maximum rate of protein accumulation vm moreover elevated temperature alone enhanced amino acid synthesis by increasing the activity of glutamine synthetase gs and glutamate synthase gogat and the expression of ghgs and ghgogat which was also good for increasing protein content mild drought slightly affected the protein accumulation during cottonseed kernel development although the duration of protein rapid accumulation increased severe drought significantly decreased the vm and the activity of gs and gogat as well as the expression of ghgs and ghgogat finally leading to lower protein content the interaction effect between the two stresses on protein synthesis was significant since elevated temperature promoted protein synthesis under mild drought by increasing the vm the activity of gs and gogat and the expression of ghgs and ghgogat however elevated temperature further reduced gs and gogat activities and ghgs and ghgogat expressions to inhibit protein synthesis under severe drought keywords cottonseed elevated temperature soil drought protein accumulation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction high temperature and soil drought are the major causes of abiotic stress impacting crop productivity challinor et al 2014 due to global warming the annual global temperature was projected to increase by 2 8 0 4 c by the end of the 21st century brown and caldeira 2017 in addition climate change will also lead to a notable increase in the frequency of drought events particularly in the arid and semi arid regions alqudah et al 2011 the climate change models predicted that heat and drought stresses would become more intense and widespread shortly soon and the probability of their concomitant occurrence will increase by orders of magnitude rosenzweig et al 2014 ipcc 2021 so their negative impacts on crop production are likely to become more pronounced mittler 2006 zandalinas et al 2020 cotton gossypium hirsutum l is susceptible to water deficit and high temperature especially in the reproduction stage wendel et al 2010 chai et al 2016 numerous previous studies have confirmed that exposure to above optimal temperatures or deficient water supply has adverse effects on physiological and biochemical metabolism and the final yield of cotton hu et al 2017b 2020 zhao et al 2020 these researches also showed that the impacts of constant heat and drought on cotton growth and development are strikingly different in many aspects hence the synthetic effects of high temperature and drought on cotton cannot be extrapolated from a single stress loka et al 2020 cottonseed has great economic value owing to a high content of proteins 45 50 lipids 25 30 and carbohydrates 10 dowd and wakelyn 2010 yang et al 2017 seed protein is high in essential amino acids and has been a good source of protein for industrial processing kumar et al 2021 in recent years global cottonseed production was around 40 million metric tons per year and protein yield was up to 10 million metric tons annually wedegaertner rathore 2015 making cotton the second largest potential resource of plant protein after soybean glycine max strengthening the research on cottonseed protein would help to improve cottonseed utilization and the economic benefits to meet the increasing demand of the protein industry however the research on the protein production of cottonseed has not received sufficient attention because protein synthesis is derived from amino acids the biosynthesis of amino acids is a rate limiting step muropastor and florencio 2003 glutamine synthetase gs and glutamate synthetase gogat cycle play key roles in amino acid synthesis muhitch 1991 hayakawa et al 1999 hirel et al 2001 and the enzymes of gs and gogat maintain high activities during protein accumulation potel et al 2009 hence gs gogat cycle is also closely related to protein synthesis the functional roles of gs and gogat in protein synthesis have been well studied in photosynthetic organs of arabidopsis potel et al 2009 rice oryza sativa l zhong et al 2017 and cotton wang et al 2017 in grains of maize zea mays l limami et al 2002 and wheat triticum aestivum l wei et al 2021 and in protein enriched cottonseed yang et al 2016 previous researches proved that 23 5 32 c is the optimal developmental temperature range for upland cotton and the cotton yield containing lint yield and cottonseed yield would reduce significantly when the temperature rises above the upper threshold 32 c burke et al 1988 pettigrew 2008 hu et al 2017b however the prolonged high temperature increased the protein content in cottonseed xu et al 2021 a previous study reported that gs activity was increased under heat stress contributing to the rapid consumption of glutamate and the generation of enough glutamine which finally led to increased contents of amino acids and proteins in wheat grains under high temperature zhang et al 2019 yang et al 2018 also noticed that heat increased protein content in maize due to the enhanced gs activity however the specific mechanism has not been explored for cottonseed although there is higher protein content in heat stressed cottonseed moreover it has been reported that soybean seed crude protein content was highly correlated with soil water availability to plants sabagh et al 2018 das et al 2017 reported that water deficit resulted in the lower activity of gs leading to the inhibition of glutamic acid synthesis which was not conducive to protein production michaletti et al 2018 also noticed that water deficient conditions caused severe decreases in glutamate and total protein contents in spring wheat with impairments mainly in enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism for cotton a recent study also reported that drought could alter amino acid concentration dry weight and protein concentration in cottonseed li et al 2022 however the previous research did not involve the exploration of detailed physiological processes numerous articles have reported that a combination of heat stress and soil drought could cause more damage to crops than single stress cairns et al 2013 loka et al 2020 for instance a previous study reported that combined high temperature and soil drought could further reduce nitrogen anabolism but augment protein catabolism in perennial grass compared with single stress chastain et al 2016 kaur et al 2014 also found that heat stress coupling with drought stress was more likely to cause protein changes in wheat compared with individual stress however some studies reported that depending on the conditions of the stress combination single stress may be dominant so that the plant response to combined stress is similar to that to single stress and even one stress exhibits protection against damage from another stress awasthi et al 2014 rivero et al 2014 however the interaction effects of heat stress and soil drought on the protein synthesis of cottonseed are still unclear we hypothesized that elevated temperature and drought stress would have an interactive effect on protein accumulation within cottonseed and the responses to different levels of soil moisture and elevated temperature combination would exhibit variously thus the objectives of this study were to reveal how the physiological changes of protein accumulation by exploring the substance contents enzyme activities and gene expression patterns involved in nitrogen metabolism in cottonseed during high temperature and drought stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental designs the experiment was carried out in ponds in a greenhouse structure having a transparent plastic top from 2016 to 2018 at the nanjing agricultural university experimental station 118 50 e 32 02 n gossypium hirsutum cultivars sumian 15 high temperature sensitive and phy370wr high temperature tolerant were used in this experiment as reported in a previous experiment xu et al 2019 cotton seedlings grew in a seedbed until three true leaves stage then the uniform and healthy seedlings were moved into the ponds the experiment arrangement was designed as a split plot design with three replications the main plot and subplot were temperature treatment and water treatment respectively each plot contained five rows with a spacing of 75 cm row spacing 25 cm interplant spacing finally there were 80 plants in each plot all plots were well watered and maintained at ambient temperature before the temperature and water treatments were established different temperature and water regimes were applied when 50 of plants had white flowers at the first note on the 6th 7th mainstem fruiting branches two temperature treatments included ambient temperature and elevated temperature ambient temperature plus about 2 5 c were designed and conducted by a temperature control system otc south east co ltd reported by xu et al 2022 the real time data of the two temperature regions were represented in fig s1 the mean daily temperature mdt in elevated temperature region was 2 7 c 2 6 c and 2 5 c higher than ambient temperature area in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively table s1 the mdt in elevated temperature region in each experimental year was above 32 c which is the upper threshold of the optimum temperature for boll growth burke et al 1988 meaning that the elevated temperature caused heat stress to boll development in this study the photosynthetically active radiation par showed few significant variations among treatments fig s2 three water regimes including srwc 75 5 optimum soil moisture srwc 60 5 mild drought and srwc 45 5 severe drought were set up under each temperature regime according to wang et al 2016 after the beginning of soil moisture treatments the irrigation under moderate and severe drought regimes was suspended meanwhile the drain valve at the bottom of pond was opened until the soil moisture level was near the target srwc threshold soil samples were collected with a soil corer between 18 00 and 19 00 the fresh weight fw was measured immediately then soil samples were oven dried and the dry weight was determined srwc was calculated as fw dw dw the srwc throughout the trial period was provided in fig s3 irrigation treatment significantly affected leaf water potential during the flowering and boll forming stage which was consistent with the trend for srwc fig s4 finally six treatments were established including i ambient temperature with optimum soil moisture srwc 75 5 donated as at75 control ii iii ambient temperature combined with mild drought srwc 60 5 and severe drought srwc 45 5 respectively donated as at60 at45 iv elevated temperature combined with optimum soil moisture srwc 75 5 donated as et75 v vi elevated temperature combined with mild drought srwc 60 5 and severe drought srwc 45 5 respectively donated as et60 et45 in addition these white flowers at the first note on the 6 7th mainstem fruiting branches blooming on the day of establishment of different treatments were labeled with plastic tags to note the date different temperature and water treatments lasted until the tagged cotton bolls opened 2 2 sample collecting about 6 8 marked bolls were sampled at 7 day intervals from 10 days post anthesis dpa to bolls opening at 09 00 am 10 00 am after the seed kernels in cotton bolls were

determination 2 3 free amino acid content and protein content measurement powdered samples 1 0 g and 5 ml of 50 mm kh2po4 with a ph of 7 were crushed to homogenate before centrifuging for 15 min at 12

defatted samples 0 1 g and 5 ml of 6 m hcl were put into a 15 ml hydrolysis tube then the n2 gas was filled into the hydrolysis tubes as a protectant before heating at 110 c for 21 h after cooling to room temperature the hydrolysates were dried under vacuum conditions before being redissolved using sodium citrate buffer with a ph of 2 2 finally the solution was filtered through a 0 25 μm filter for amino acid component analysis the concentration of glutamate was assayed with an amino acid analyzer model l 8800 hitachi tokyo japan according to mu et al 2009 2 5 enzyme activity analysis gs ec

analysis the effects of temperature treatment water treatment and temperature treatment water treatment interaction on all parameters of interest within each cultivar were assessed using a two way anova with spss 21 0 spss inc chicago il usa correlation analysis and principal component analysis pca were also conducted with spss 21 0 version figures were drawn by origin 9 0 originlab inc northampton ma usa the s shaped growth curve can be used to simulate protein accumulation in cottonseed yang et al 2016 as follows 1 w w m 1 ae b d pa where a and b are two coefficients w is the observed protein content and w m represents the theoretical maximum of protein content based on formula 1 the following formulas were developed 2 t 1 1 b ln 2 3 a 3 t 2 1 b ln 2 3 a 4 t t 2 t 1 5 v m bw m 4 where t 1 and t 2 represent the initial date and terminal date for the rapid accumulation phase of protein respectively t means the duration of protein rapid accumulation and v m indicates the maximum rate of protein accumulation in the cottonseed kernel 3 results 3 1 protein accumulation and free amino acid content compared with at75 mild drought at60 slightly decreased protein content in cottonseed kernels at 38 dpa except for phy370wr in 2018 fig 1a similarly protein concentration at 38 dpa was significantly decreased at severe drought at45 for both cultivars however et75 enhanced protein accumulation markedly in the three years the interaction effect between temperature and water treatment in both cultivars was significant table 3 since et60 increased the kernel protein content at 38 dpa for the two cultivars relative to at60 except for phy370wr in 2017 however et45 decreased the protein content at 38 dpa compared with at45 except for sumian 15 in 2017 and phy370wr in 2016 the results in table 2 showed that all the determination coefficients were significant p 0 01 indicating that the s shaped growth curve was effectively described the protein accumulation process et75 enhanced the vm and decreased the t value compared with at75 in contrast at60 and at45 lowered the vm and increased the t under the combined stress et60 increased the vm compared to at60 and et45 also increased the vm compared to at45 as shown in fig 1b the free amino acid content in the kernel reached the peak level at 17 dpa and then declined et75 during the flowering and boll forming stage significantly reduced free amino acid content compared with at75 table 3 in contrast free amino acid content increased pronouncedly with the decreasing of soil moisture besides a decrease in free amino acid content was observed in et60 compared with at60 however et45 increased significantly relative to at45 in sumian 15 from 2016 to 2018 there was no significant difference between et45 and at45 in phy370wr 3 2 glutamate concentration at 17 dpa the percentage of glutamate was significantly affected by soil drought alone elevated temperature alone and the interaction of water temperature in sumian 15 fig 2 for phy370wr glutamate concentration was only significantly affected by soil drought alone at 31 and 38 dpa the glutamate concentration was notably affected by individual stress or the combined stress in both cultivars at60 decreased glutamate concentration by 5 7 in sumian 15 and 2 8 in phy370wr respectively and at45 decreased glutamate concentration by 12 0 in sumian 15 and 6 8 in phy370wr respectively conversely et75 markedly increased the glutamate concentration by 6 9 in sumian 15 and 3 7 in phy370wr respectively interestingly et60 increased the glutamate concentration by 5 5 and 2 7 in sumian 15 and phy370wr at 38 dpa respectively relative to at60 yet the concentration of glutamate was decreased numerically under et45 in sumian 15 and phy370wr relative to at45 3 3 the correlations among protein content free amino acid content glutamate concentration and protein accumulation characteristics as shown in fig 3 kernel protein content had a significant positive correlation with the vm p 0 01 but had significant negative correlations with the t value and free amino acid content p 0 01 moreover protein content was positively correlated with glutamate concentration p 0 01 fig 4 whereas there was a significant negative correlation between free amino acid content and glutamate concentration p 0 01 3 4 enzyme activities in cottonseed the activity of gs in cottonseed kernels was decreased at 17 24 and 38 dpa in 2016 and 2018 for sumian 15 but was not significant lower for phy370wr in three years under at60 than at75 fig 5a and it was decreased markedly under at45 at each sampling day in the two cultivars except for phy370wr at 24 dpa in 2016 by contrast et75 significantly increased gs activity compared with at75 an interaction effect was observed at most measurement dates with the exception of 10 dpa table 4 compared to at60 gs activity was increased by 7 5 in sumian 15 and 3 9 in phy370wr under et60 respectively across the three years however the gs activity at et45 was lower than at45 in sumian 15 and no significant difference was detected between et45 and at45 in phy370wr similarly at60 did not significantly reduce gogat activity with the exception of 24 and 31 dpa in 2017 and 2018 for sumian 15 respectively however gogat activity was significantly reduced at most measurement dates in at45 for the two cultivars fig 5b table 4 in contrast gogat activity was increased notably under et75 from 17 to 38 dpa the interaction effect between temperature and water treatment was significant from 17 to 38 dpa compared to at60 et60 increased gogat activity for sumian 15 5 11 and phy370wr 4 06 in the three years respectively while et45 markedly decreased gogat activity compared with at45 in most measurement dates for sumian 15 and it was not significant for phy370wr 3 5 gene expressions both temperature and water regimes significantly affected the expression level of ghgs and ghgogat in cottonseed kernels fig 6 compared with at75 the ghgs expression was markedly down regulated with the decreasing of soil moisture at 17 and 24 dpa except for ghgs expression under at60 at 17 dpa in phy370wr conversely et75 induced a higher expression level of ghgs at 17 and 24 dpa relative to at75 under et60 the expression level of ghgs at 17 dpa was up regulated by 1 57 and 1 08 fold in sumian 15 and phy370wr compared to at60 respectively at 24 dpa ghgs expression had no significant differences between et60 and at60 under the treatment of et45 ghgs expression was down regulated at 17 and 24 dpa for both cultivars compared to at45 except for phy370wr at 17 dpa there was no significant change for the relative expression of ghgogat at at60 in sumian 15 at all sampling dates however at60 up regulated ghgogat expression in phy370wr at 17 dpa and showed no significant difference at 24 dpa the relative expression of ghgogat was significantly down regulated for the two cultivars when exposed to at45 down regulations of 0 70 and 0 88 folds at 17 dpa and 0 84 and 0 89 folds at 24 dpa were detected in sumian 15 and phy370wr respectively the expression of ghgogat was markedly up regulated under et75 and the effect was more evident on 17 dpa which showed 1 89 and 1 66 fold increases in sumian 15 and phy370wr respectively relative to at75 et60 up regulated the relative expression of ghgogat compared with at60 especially in sumian 15 however et45 down regulated the ghgogat expression in both cultivars 3 6 principal component analysis pca to further distinguish the impacts of soil drought elevated temperature and their combination on the protein accumulation in cottonseed kernels a pca was conducted using the data related to protein synthesis fig 7 the results showed that pc 1 and pc 2 could explain 82 5 and 11 7 of the total variance respectively the glutamate concentration protein content vm free amino acid content gogat activity and ghgogat expression have high scores on pc1 while pc 2 has large loading coefficients on t gs activity and ghgs expression the effects of water regimes were well separated by the pc 1 and the effects of temperature regimes were well separated by the pc 2 the effects of combined stresses were clearly distinguished in accordance with pc 1 and pc 2 4 discussion drought and heat stresses are the critical environmental factors limiting crop production seriously damaging crop yield and quality worldwide pettigrew 2004 juroszek et al 2020 the underlying mechanisms associated with physiological processes in the cotton in response to drought wang et al 2016 or elevated temperature dai et al 2015 in isolation have been addressed and the combined effects of these two factors on cotton yield and cottonseed yield have been previously described by our previous article gao et al 2021 xu et al 2022 drought and elevated temperature significantly reduced cotton yield and the decline in boll number was the primary driver of yield loss and the combination of severe drought and elevated temperature produced lower yields than any other treatment combination or any single abiotic stress factor gao et al 2021 which was consistent with the trend for cottonseed yield our previous article also found that drought stress and elevated temperature combination markedly reduced protein yield due to the cottonseed yield loss xu et al 2022 however prior to this study no studies focused on the coupled effects of the two stresses on protein accumulation mechanism within the cottonseed in the present research the reasons for the changes in protein content under drought and elevated temperature were further studied the protein accumulation in cottonseed kernels can be fitted by a s shaped growth curve and the results showed that kernel protein content at 38 dpa was positively and significantly correlated with the vm of protein concentration but had a negative correlation with the t of protein concentration meaning that the rate of protein accumulation may play a dominant role in determining the final protein content hence although elevated temperature et75 shortened the t of protein concentration increased vm finally resulted in the increased protein content which is in agreement with previous research conducted by li et al 2013 mild drought at60 treatment had no significant effect on protein accumulation while severe drought at45 notably restrained protein accumulation by reducing the vm meaning that protein accumulation in cottonseed was sensitive to severe water deficiency this was similar to the results found by singh 2007 on protein accumulation within soybean grain and singh 2007 speculated that this might be because the seed is less sensitive to water shortage than other organs only the water status in the seed body is significantly lower than the critical requirement which will inhibit the synthesis of seed protein however different from our results of the protein accumulation the final protein content was increased under drought stress in rapeseed brassica napus l and maize which should be that the response of protein synthesis in seed to water shortage varied with species ghassemi golezani et al 2015 li et al 2021 most studies reported that the relative effect of the combination of heat and drought stress treatment was consistently more dramatic than the influence of heat or drought applied separately chen et al 2019 mahalingam and bregitzer 2019 similarly in the present study elevated temperature and severe drought combination et45 significantly inhibited protein accumulation compared with any single stress however the combined elevated temperature and mild drought et60 promoted the protein content by increasing the vm relative to at60 indicating that elevated temperature had different effects on protein accumulation of cottonseed under different drought stress levels these results supported previous conclusion reported by cohen et al 2021 that the impact of combined stress relative to individual stress on certain parameters depends on many factors especially stress intensity the supply of free amino acids is an essential factor in protein synthesis and a large number of free amino acids would provide an adequate substrate for protein synthesis takahashi et al 2003 in the current study the free amino acid content was negatively and significantly correlated with protein content in cottonseed kernel fig 2 which was consistent with the results of a previous study under different soil n levels yang et al 2016 and they reported that this is because the relative contents of amino acids and proteins were affected by the conversion between them elevated temperature et75 significantly decreased the free amino acid content however free amino acid content was increased markedly when plants were exposed to drought especially for severe drought which illustrated that heat temperature and drought had opposite effects on the accumulation of free amino acids in support of our results good and zaplachinski 1994 reported higher free amino acid content in rapeseed under drought stress and zhao et al 2005 found that high temperature significantly reduced free amino acid content in grains at the late stage of grain filling moreover et60 had lower free amino acid content than at60 but et45 had higher free amino acid content than at45 indicating that elevated temperature further enhanced the influence of severe drought on free amino acid content of cottonseed but reduced the impact of mild drought heat stress has been found to increase glutamate level in wheat irmak et al 2008 while drought had a negative effect on glutamate concentration in alfalfa medicago sativa l aranjuelo et al 2011 similarly et75 significantly increased the glutamate concentration in cottonseed kernel however the glutamate concentration was decreased markedly under drought especially under severe drought suggesting that the effect of high temperature or drought alone on cottonseed kernel glutamate concentration were different correia et al 2018 reported high temperature further enhanced the effect of drought on glutamate concentration consistent with their observation at45 decreased the glutamate concentration in cottonseed kernel and et45 further decreased glutamate concentration relative to at45 however et60 improved glutamate concentration than at60 at 38 dpa although at60 decreased the glutamate concentration in cottonseed kernel which showed that high temperature enhanced glutamate synthesis under mild drought these results revealed that the effect of coupled stress on crops is closely related to the intensity of individual stress jiang et al 2020 as the initial amino acid formed by nitrogen metabolism glutamate is directly dependent on the gs gogat cycle and the two enzymes gs and gogat play a synergistic role in glutamate synthesis zhang et al 2014 in our study the activities of gs and gogat maintained higher levels under elevated temperature however gs and gogat activities were significantly decreased under drought which agreed with the previous results in soybean conducted by das et al 2016 2017 where the activities of gs and gogat decreased under drought situations and in apple malus domestica borkh plants conducted by liang et al 2018 where elevated temperature significantly increased gs and gogat activities moreover ghgs and ghgogat were the critical genes during the glutamate synthesis zhao and shi 2006 the expression of ghgs and ghgogat was down regulated as a response to drought stress but was markedly up regulated under elevated temperature suggesting that the effect of elevated temperature or water deficit on gs and gogat activities should be the result of changes in genes ghgs and ghgogat expressions hence the altered gs and gogat activities as well as ghgs and ghgogat expression under elevated temperature or drought directly influenced the synthesis of glutamate which could explain the above observations why glutamate concentration was increased under high temperature but was decreased markedly under drought unexpectedly the change of glutamate was not consistent with that of free amino acid under elevated temperature or drought and glutamate concentration was negatively correlated with free amino acid content however glutamate concentration was positively correlated with protein which let us speculate that high temperature may speed up the conversion of amino acids to proteins while drought will slow this process down in support of our speculation zhao et al 2005 found that high temperature could accelerate the utilization of amino acids in grains to form protein and tarighaleslami et al 2012 reported that extreme drought stress affected undesirably the protein forming in corn seed further there were significant interactions between temperature and water regimes on the activities of gs and gogat at most measurement dates and the expression levels of ghgs and ghgogat at 17 dpa since mild drought combined with elevated temperature improved the enzyme activities gs and gogat and the gene expressions ghgs and ghgogat in relation to mild drought but severe drought combined with elevated temperature was further inhibited these related enzymes activities and genes expressions these results suggested that elevated air temperature improved protein accumulation in cottonseed under mild drought but limited the protein synthesis when cotton plants were exposed to severe drought stress furthermore based on the results of pca of the protein synthesis process fig 7 the water deficit was well separated by the first pc and the scores of pc 1 for drought decreased with the intensification of drought in contrast elevated temperature caused a shift in sample position in accordance with pc2 water deficit and elevated temperature combination had a significant interaction effect according to the scores of pc1 and pc2 which indicated that the impact of mild drought coupling with elevated temperature on protein synthesis in cottonseed was mainly dominated by elevated temperature however the effect of severe drought coupling with elevated temperature was mainly affected by drought degree the pc 1 had high loading to glutamate concentration protein content vm free amino acid content and gogat activity and ghgogat expression the pc 2 mainly relied on t value gs activity and ghgs expression meaning that the combination of related parameters to protein accumulation could be used to describe the differences between soil drought and elevated temperature in face of global climate change 5 conclusion in conclusion soil drought and elevated temperature alone affected protein accumulation differently mild drought had no significant effect on protein accumulation in cottonseed kernels severe drought decreased the maximum rate of kernel protein accumulation vm the enzyme activities gs and gogat and the relative expressions ghgs and ghgogat compared with the control at75 inhibiting glutamate biosynthesis and reducing protein content conversely elevated temperature alone enhanced above enzyme activities gene expressions and vm finally obtaining a high protein content relative to at75 elevated temperature and drought stress combination had an interaction effect on protein accumulation mild drought combined with elevated temperature increased the vm enhanced the activities of gs and gogat and the expression levels of ghgs and ghgogat relative to mild drought alone promoting glutamate synthesis and improving protein content nevertheless severe drought and elevated temperature combination restrained protein accumulation relative to severe drought alone by decreasing the activities of gs and gogat and the expressions of ghgs and ghgogat thus the co effects of drought stress and elevated temperature on protein accumulation within cottonseed depended at least on the intensity of drought stress

increased and then decreased and the other forms of fertilizer derived n increased in the total residual fertilizer n in soil residual basal fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion under the two irrigation modes residual tillering fertilizer n accounted for the lowest proportion under fi and panicle fertilizer n accounted for the lowest proportion under ci no accounted for the highest proportion of the residual amount of each period fertilizer n under ci and fi while no3 n accounted for the lowest proportion under ci and fixed ammonium accounted for the lowest proportion under fi compared with fi ci increased the total residual fertilizer n amount and promoted the conversion of residual fertilizer n into no the present study suggested that ci as a water saving irrigation mode not only decreased agricultural water consumption but also increased fertilizer n retention in soil and enhanced the conversion of residual fertilizer n into no the establishment of appropriate water and n management has great potential for the regulation of residual fertilizer n in paddy soil keywords paddy irrigation mode residual fertilizer n n management 15n labeled data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction nitrogen n is one of the most important nutrient elements in agricultural production and crop productivity strongly depends on the application rate of fertilizer n cassman et al 2003 alam et al 2006 in recent years the amount of fertilizer n applied in china s agricultural production has continuously increased and china has become the largest fertilizer n consuming country in the world the amount of fertilizer n used each year accounts for approximately 32 of the total amount of fertilizer n worldwide of which approximately 18 is used for rice planting chen et al 2019 the large amount of applied fertilizer n cannot be completely absorbed by crops excessive application of fertilizer n causes greater n input than uptake in agroecosystems in china and a large amount of fertilizer n remains in the soil zhang et al 2008 the fertilizer derived n that remains in the soil can directly participate in the cycle and transformation processes of soil n and ultimately transform into different soil n pools and the different residual forms of fertilizer derived n will affect the availability to crops and risk of fertilizer n loss wang et al 2016 the residual no3 n and nh4 n enter water and the atmosphere through leaching nitrification and denitrification which harm the ecological environment chen et al 2013 wang et al 2014 he et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 residual fertilizer derived n in the forms of no and fixed ammonium is beneficial to increase the recovery of fertilizer n in soil and crops therefore the residual fertilizer n in soil must be considered in agricultural resource management which is of great significance to sustainable agricultural development and ecological environmental security it is of great significance to study the fate of fertilizer n to reduce fertilizer n loss and increase the retention of n in stable forms in crop soil systems which is important for establishing suitable n management modes specifically the fate of fertilizer n is affected by many aspects such as soil fertility soil types irrigation regimens and fertilizer n management practices peng et al 2011 found that under the conventional flooded irrigation mode the residual fertilizer n was mainly in the form of no followed by no3 n and nh4 n and the fixed ammonium residual fertilizer n form was the lowest the relevant study showed that the amount of fertilizer n applied would affect the fate of fertilizer n under the conventional flooded irrigation mode when the n application rate was high the fertilizer n remained mainly in the form of no3 n but when the n application rate was low the fertilizer n remained mainly in the form of no ju et al 2002a 2002b bhogal et al 2000 conducted a five year study at the rothamsted long term test station in the uk and found that when the n application rate exceeded a threshold most of the fertilizer n remained in the form of inorganic n the results of the 15n tracer study performed by zhao et al 2015 showed that the residual fertilizer n was mainly in the form of no under dry cultivation the amount of fertilizer n remaining in the form of fixed ammonium was higher under dry cultivation than under conventional irrigation the results of a 15n tracer study in four soils with different textures in southeastern england and a mountainous area with poor soil fertility in nepal showed that the lower the soil fertility the greater were the residual amounts of fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n and nh4 n macdonald et al 1997 pilbeam et al 2002 at present it is crucial to accurately evaluate the conversion of fertilizer n into different soil n pools under different agricultural management modes according to the geographical and climatic properties of specific regions because these factors will affect the recovery of fertilizer n in soil crop systems agricultural sustainability and environmental pollution risk de neve et al 2004 macdonald et al 2002 however few studies have focused on the different residual forms of fertilizer derived n especially on the residual forms of fertilizer n applied in different periods during the growth of rice under water saving irrigation modes china is an important rice producer globally accounting for 19 of the world s rice planting area and 32 of the world s rice yield fao 2016 it was reported that rice yield will be affected by regional and seasonal drought schewe et al 2014 in addition the shortage of agricultural water resources has become increasingly serious due to increased industrial and urban water consumption liu et al 2013 to overcome the challenge of ensuring food security under the current increasing shortage of water resources scholars have proposed many water saving modes such as controlled irrigation alternating wetting and moderate drying stabilizing or increasing the rice yield dong et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 however it has been reported that a part of water saving irrigation modes might increase the risk of fertilizer n loss but there is a lack of research on the fate of fertilizers under different irrigation modes at this stage zhang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to study the residual amounts and forms of fertilizer n under the water saving irrigation mode to explore an irrigation mode that can not only save water but also promote the conversion of residual fertilizer n to a stable residual form mollisols in northeast china have high organic matter contents and are the most fertile soil in china with physical and chemical properties suitable for planting various crops xu et al 2010 in 2021 the total grain yield of northeast china was close to 25 of the total grain yield of china wang et al 2021 the northeast mollisols white paper noted that this area has become china s largest grain production and commercial grain base it functions as a ballast and regulator to ensure china s food security however the predatory management mode adopted in the past few decades has caused a gradual soil degradation in this area excessive fertilizer input has caused a series of environmental problems which directly affect the stability of regional grain yield thus the protection of mollisols is urgently needed to implement the strategy of storing grain in land and by technology cheng et al 2018 moreover the management of irrigation in northeast china has been changing water saving irrigation has been widely adopted by farmers for the sustainable development of rice production chen et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to study the transformation of fertilizer n into different soil n pools under different irrigation modes in the mollisols area of northeast china in the process of rice planting the residual derived n amounts and forms of basal tillering and panicle fertilizer in soil are different due to different application time and rates therefore an experiment was conducted in mollisols in northeast china that combined a field plot test with a flied microplot 15n isotope test it was used to quantitatively study the soil residual forms of basal tillering and panicle fertilizer derived n under different irrigation modes and n application rates in addition the proportion of different period fertilizer derived n residues in different soil n pools was analyzed to formulate reasonable paddy water and n management modes and to further optimize the fertilization n proportions the results of this study can be used to improve the availability of soil residual fertilizer n reduce the risk of environmental pollution provide improved reference material and finally achieve the goals of water saving high yield high efficiency and emission reduction in paddy fields 2 materials and methods 2 1

design was adopted and two irrigation modes were set up table 2 controlled irrigation ci and flooded irrigation fi the n rate pure n was set at three levels n1 85 kg ha n2 110 kg ha and n3 135 kg ha the experimental treatment design is shown in table 3 each treatment was repeated 3 times with a total of 18 experimental plots each with an area of 100 m2 10 m 10 m to prevent the exchange of water and n between each plot plastic plates with a depth of 40 cm were inserted underground into the ridges between each plot under ci the paddy field water surface maintained a shallow water layer of 0 30 mm during the turning green stage and naturally dried out during the yellow ripening stage but no water layers were established during other growth stages the irrigation time and amount were determined by the soil moisture content of the root layer the upper limit of irrigation was the saturated water content of the soil and the lower limit of the soil moisture content in each growth stage was a different percentage of saturated moisture content at 7 00 and 18 00 every day a tpime pico64 32 soil moisture tester was used to measure the soil moisture content of each experimental plot when the soil water content was close to or below the lower limit of irrigation artificial irrigation was carried out until the upper limit of irrigation was reached the soil water content was kept between the upper limit of irrigation and the lower limit of irrigation at the corresponding growth stage every day and the corresponding irrigation amount of each treatment was recorded under fi except for proper drainage and sun drying during the late tiller stage to control ineffective tillers and natural drying during the yellow ripening stage a water layer of 3 5 cm was maintained in the paddy field during the growing stage of rice the depth of the water layer in the paddy field was measured by a preburied ruler at 8 00 every day in the test plot to determine whether irrigation was needed the 15n tracer microplots were set in the above experimental plots and one microplot was set in each experimental plot that is three microplot tests three sub treatments were performed under a single treatment the experimental treatment settings are shown in table 1 in subtreatment 1 m1 the 15n labeled urea was only used for tracking basal fertilizer n in subtreatment 2 m2 the 15n labeled

basal fertilizer rice seedlings with the same growth trend were selected for transplanting the plant spacing was 16 67 cm the row spacing was 30 cm three plants were set in each hill and the growth period was 126 days weeds were removed during each growth stage to preclude the effects of diseases and insect pests on the nutrient absorption of the rice 2 3 laboratory analysis and data analysis 2 3 1 soil bulk density in each layer according to the research of ju 2014 on the main movement and destination of fertilizer n in soil crop systems for many years the residual fertilizer n in paddy rice systems should be considered in the 0 20 cm soil layer and the residual fertilizer n in dry cultivation should be considered in the 0 60 cm soil layer the water saving irrigation mode used in this experiment is similar to the dry cultivation mode therefore based on available research results the 0 60 cm soil layer was considered for the residual fertilizer n in this experiment the soil samples were collected after the rice harvest the undisturbed soil samples were taken in layers according to the s shape inside and outside each treatment microplot with a 100 ml ring knife and the soil samples for elemental analysis were collected with a soil drill with a diameter of 3 5 cm the sampling layer depths were 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm three parallel samples were collected at

isotope mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific usa to determine the 15n abundance in the sample more accurately an empty control group was established during the sample preparation to correct the determination results the empty control group was the extract without addition of the sample which was diffused and cultured under the same conditions to estimate the amount

and amounts of fertilizer n under different water and n management modes according to fig 2 under the same n rate the amount of total soil residual fertilizer n under ci was higher than that under fi under different n rates of ci 61 49 72 56 of the residual fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 11 41 20 08 existed in the form of nh4 n 7 63 11 63 existed in the form of fixed ammonium and 6 79 8 39 existed in the form of no3 n under different n rates of fi 58 08 64 68 of the residual fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 19 06 20 93 existed in the form of no3 n 9 61 14 26 existed in the form of nh4 n and 5 35 7 45 existed in the form of fixed ammonium under different water and n management modes most of the residual fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no and the results showed that ci was conducive to the transformation of residual fertilizer n in paddy soil into no and to reducing the loss of soil residual fertilizer n as shown in table 4 the soil residual fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n nh4 n fixed ammonium and no showed significant differences between different water and n management modes p 0 05 under the two irrigation modes the soil residual fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n no3 n fixed ammonium and no increased with the increasing n rate a comparison between different irrigation modes showed that ci could increase the residual amounts of fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n fixed ammonium and no when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha the residual amounts of fertilizer n in the form of nh4 n under ci were 30 99 78 91 and 66 96 higher than those under fi respectively the residual fertilizer n in the form of fixed ammonium was 57 42 73 66 and 85 18 higher than those under fi respectively and the residual

rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha the amounts of residual fertilizer n in the form of no3 n under fi were 126 11 138 48 and 150 88 higher than those under ci respectively after rice harvest under different n rates of ci most of the fertilizer n remaining in the paddy field in different forms was concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil layer table 5 which increased the fertility of the paddy soil surface and was conducive to the recovery of the residual fertilizer n in soil crop systems under fi the residual amount of fertilizer n in the form of no3 n accounted for a large proportion in the 20 40 cm soil layer which increased the risk of n leaching 3 2 transformation of soil residual basal fertilizer n under different water and n management modes according to fig 3 under the same n rate the amount of residual basal fertilizer n under ci was higher than that under fi under the two irrigation modes the proportions of nh4 n and fixed ammonium derived from basal fertilizer n increased and the proportion of no decreased with the increasing n rate under different n rates of ci 84 32 87 62 of the residual basal fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 4 03 6 26 existed in the form of nh4 n 3 53 5 73 existed in the form of fixed ammonium and 3 69 4 82 existed in the form of no3 n under different n rates of fi 77 77 82 63 of the residual basal fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 9 55 11 09 existed in the form of no3 n 3 75 6 49 existed in the form of nh4 n and 2 52 5 70 existed in the form of fixed ammonium the results showed that ci could increase the soil residual basal fertilizer n reduce the proportion of basal fertilizer n in the form of no3 n and reduce the risk of leaching of basal fertilizer n as shown in table 6 the residual amounts of basal fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n nh4 n fixed ammonium and no in paddy soil were significantly different between different water and n management modes p 0 05 under the two irrigation modes the residual amounts of basal fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n no3 n fixed ammonium and no increased with increasing n rate a comparison between different irrigation modes showed that ci could improve the residual amounts of basal fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n fixed ammonium and no in paddy soil when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha under ci the residual amounts of basal fertilizer n in the form of nh4 n were 27 52 22 09 and 24 98 higher than those under fi respectively the residual basal fertilizer n in the form of fixed ammonium was 57 41 22 17 and 25 48 higher than those under fi respectively and the residual basal fertilizer n in the form of no was 19 05 24 27 and 35 36 higher than those under fi respectively the residual amounts of basal fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were higher under fi when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha the residual amounts of basal fertilizer n in the form of no3 n under fi were 105 05 112 47 and 118 25 higher than those under ci respectively after rice harvest under different n rates of ci the residual basal fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n and no was mostly concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil layer table 7 the residual basal fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n and fixed ammonium was mostly concentrated in the 20 60 cm soil layer whereas under fi the residual basal fertilizer n in the form of no3 n was concentrated in the 20 40 cm soil layer and the leaching of n from basal fertilizer was obvious which posed a threat to the safety of the groundwater environment 3 3 transformation of soil residual tillering fertilizer n under different water and n management modes according to fig 4 under the same n rate the amount of residual tillering fertilizer n under ci was higher than that under fi under ci the proportions of nh4 n and fixed ammonium derived from tillering fertilizer n increased with increasing n rate and the proportions of no and no3 n decreased with increasing n rate under different n rates of ci 39 43 54 45 of residual tillering fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 17 23 29 31 existed in the form of nh4 n 12 78 19 31 existed in the form of fixed ammonium and 11 95 15 55 existed in the form of no3 n under different n rates of fi 38 27 43 40 of the residual tillering fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 31 80 35 16 existed in the form of no3 n 11 68 17 31 existed in the form of nh4 n and 9 21 10 12 existed in the form of fixed ammonium compared with fi ci increased the proportion of residual tillering fertilizer n in the form of no but with increasing n rate an increasing amount of tillering fertilizer n remained in the form of inorganic n in the soil to reduce the loss of tillering fertilizer n in soil it is necessary to pay attention to the application proportion of tillering fertilizer as shown in table 8 the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n nh4 n fixed ammonium and no were significantly different under different water and n management modes p 0 05 under the two irrigation modes the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n no3 n fixed ammonium and no increased with increasing n rate a comparison between different irrigation modes showed that ci could increase the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n fixed ammonium and no when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha under ci the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the form of nh4 n were 61 07 128 01 and 109 66 higher than those under fi respectively the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the form of fixed ammonium were 37 92 94 44 and 158 20 higher than those under fi respectively and residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the form of no were 37 00 11 44 and 27 60 higher than those under fi respectively under fi the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were higher when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha under fi the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were 105 05 122 61 and 137 63 higher than those under ci respectively after rice harvest the residual tillering fertilizer n in different forms in different soil layers is shown in table 9 under fi a large amount of tillering fertilizer n remained in the 20 40 cm soil layer in the form of no3 n while ci effectively reduced the soil residual tillering fertilizer n in the form of no3 n and concentrated the residual tillering fertilizer n in the surface soil 0 20 cm which improved the fertility of the topsoil 3 4 transformation of soil residual panicle fertilizer n under different water and n management modes according to fig 5 under the same n rate compared with fi the amount of residual panicle fertilizer n in the soil under ci was higher under ci the proportions of nh4 n and fixed ammonium derived from panicle fertilizer n increased with increasing n rate and the proportion of no decreased with increasing n rate under different n rates 53 72 72 95 of the residual panicle fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 14 04 29 19 existed in the form of nh4 n 7 32 11 54 existed in the form of fixed ammonium and 5 54 5 80 existed in the form of no3 n under different n rates of fi 53 22 63 70 of the residual panicle fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 17 97 18 52 existed in the form of no3 n 13 85 20 57 existed in the form of nh4 n and 3 93 7 84 existed in the form of fixed ammonium as shown in table 10 the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n nh4 n and fixed ammonium in paddy soil exhibited significant differences under different water and n management modes p 0 05 while the residual panicle fertilizer n in the form of no exhibited no significant difference under the two irrigation modes the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n no3 n and fixed ammonium increased with increasing n rate a comparison between different irrigation modes showed that ci could improve the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n and fixed ammonium in paddy soil when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha under ci the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the form of nh4 n were 10 69 64 38 and 51 15 higher than those under fi respectively the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the form of fixed ammonium were 103 44 85 77 and 56 80 higher than those under fi respectively under fi the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were higher when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha under fi the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were 198 12 199 82 and 211 19 higher than those under ci respectively the residual panicle fertilizer n in different forms in different soil layers after rice harvest is shown in table 11 under ci the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n fixed ammonium and no decreased with increasing soil depth while the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the form of nh4 n increased with increasing soil depth under fi a large amount of panicle fertilizer n in the form of no3 n remained in the 0 40 cm soil layer which could easily threaten the ecological environmental security of paddy fields 3 5 proportion of each period fertilizer derived n in different n pools under different irrigation modes the results of the proportion of residual different period fertilizer n and the proportion of different forms of fertilizer derived n in the sum of residual amount of fertilizer n of three n rates under the two irrigation modes are shown in fig 6 under the two irrigation modes the proportion of basal fertilizer n was the highest in total residual n the proportion of tillering fertilizer n was the lowest under fi while panicle fertilizer n was the lowest under ci under the two irrigation modes basal fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion in the form of no and tillering fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion in the forms of no3 n and fixed ammonium tillering fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion of nh4 n under ci and panicle fertilizer accounted for the highest proportion of nh4 n under fi compared with fi tillering fertilizer derived n accounted for a higher proportion of residual fertilizer n in nh4 n no3 n and fixed ammonium forms and basal fertilizer derived n also accounted for a higher proportion of residual fertilizer n in no form under ci therefore more attention should be given to the applications of basal and tillering fertilizer under ci moreover the amounts of fertilizer n remaining in the forms of inorganic n and organic n after crop harvest can be controlled by adjusting the application ratio of basal fertilizer tillering fertilizer and panicle fertilizer to reduce the risk of leaching of residual fertilizer n and improve the effectiveness of residual fertilizer n 4 discussion li et al 2011 estimated the status of soil residual n in the mollisols area in heilongjiang province after crop harvest based on the data from the statistical yearbook of heilongjiang province from 1980 to 2004 the results showed that the input of farmland soil n in heilongjiang province increased by 77 8 with an average of 118 1 kg ha from 1980 to 2002 moreover the n output increased by 72 1 with an average of 74 8 kg ha and the soil residual n increased by 86 2 with an average of 43 3 kg ha a large amount of fertilizer n remained in farmland soil fertilizer n applied to soil is converted into different n forms such as fertilizer derived mineral n fertilizer derived newly synthesized organic n or recently clay mineral fixed nh4 n lu et al 2010a schneiders and scherer 1998 a previous study showed that the transformation of fertilizer n into no was very important for achieving the goal of improving n availability and reducing n loss in soil crop systems lu et al 2018 moreover the fixed fertilizer n in the soil could be regarded as a way to store n for subsequent crops burger and jackson 2003 our experiment was conducted at the heilongjiang rice irrigation experimental station by using 15n tracer technology and the diffusion method to prepare isotopic samples the interference of organic n decomposition and isotopic fractionation caused by traditional steam distillation on the measured values was precluded zhang et al 2017 wen et al 2016 the residual amounts and forms of basal tillering and panicle fertilizer n under different water and n management modes were quantitatively analyzed the present study showed that the residual fertilizer n under the two irrigation modes with different n rates mainly existed in the form of no which was consistent with the research results of jensen et al 1997 and li et al 2013 the amount of fertilizer derived n remaining in the form of no was high which could be attributed to the specific properties of mollisols which had a high organic matter content and a strong ability to maintain water and fertilizer a relevant study showed that the amount of soil inorganic n supply increased with increasing organic matter content li et al 2005 the amounts of residual fertilizer n in different forms increased with the increasing n rate which was consistent with the research results of ju et al 2007 although the change range of the n rate set in this experiment was small the changes in residual fertilizer n in different forms with different n rates were obvious compared with fi ci could increase the residual amount of fertilizer n in paddy soil increase the proportions of residual fertilizer n in the forms of no and fixed ammonium and reduce the residual amount of fertilizer n in the form of no3 n these phenomena might be due to the superior permeability and higher oxygen content of soil under the water saving irrigation mode which improved the activity of soil microorganisms and enzymes and was conducive to the transformation of fertilizer n thus enhancing the ability of soil to fix fertilizer n xiao et al 2013 in addition the decrease in soil moisture would lead to an increase in the ammonium concentration in the soil and some ammonium ions were fixed which could promote the transformation of residual fertilizer n to no and fixed ammonium sun and zhang 2002 the present study indicated that controlled irrigation could increase the residual amount of fertilizer n in soil and promote the transformation of residual fertilizer n into no to reduce the loss of fertilizer n and improve the recovery of n in soil and subsequent crops to further manage and fully utilize soil residual fertilizer n based on traditional research on total residual fertilizer n amounts and different derived forms the fertilizer applied during the crop growth period was further subdivided the 15n isotope was used to track the basal tillering and panicle fertilizer n and the residual amounts and forms of each period fertilizer n under different irrigation modes and n rates were studied the tracer test results showed that the residual amounts of basal tillering and panicle fertilizer n under ci were higher than those under fi which was consistent with the results of zhang et al 2018 it was confirmed that ci could improve the fertilizer retention ability of soil and supplement the soil n pool of paddy fields under different n rates of ci the residual amounts of each period fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were lower than those of fi among the residual nh4 n no3 n and fixed ammonium forms tillering fertilizer accounted for the highest proportion and basal fertilizer accounted for the highest proportion of the residual no form the reason for this result might be that the application time of basal fertilizer was the earliest and the residual time in the soil was the longest therefore the amount of residual basal fertilizer n transformed into no was high relevant studies have shown that with the passage of crop growth time fertilizer n mainly remains in the form of no ju et al 2002a 2002b the research results of li et al 2018 showed that compared with the loss amounts of tillering and panicle fertilizer the loss amount of basal fertilizer n was the highest the residual basal fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n and no3 n was initially lost through nitrification denitrification and leaching so the residual amounts of basal fertilizer in the forms of nh4 n and no3 n were low due to the low application proportion of panicle fertilizer the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n and no3 n were also low compared with that of tillering fertilizer the proportion of residual basal and panicle fertilizer n in fixed ammonium was relatively low which might be due to the application of potassium fertilizer in the early and 8 5 leaf age stages which increased the content of soil k caused the soil adsorption point to be occupied by k and reduced the fixation of soil to nh4 fan 1993 xie et al 2016 in conclusion under different irrigation modes the soil residual forms of fertilizer n could be further regulated by adjusting the application time and proportions of basal tillering and panicle fertilizers to promote the transformation of residual fertilizer n into no form and reduce the waste of fertilizer n 5 conclusion the challenge of managing the transformation and fate of fertilizer nitrogen is how to increase soil nitrogen retention and reduce nitrogen loss in soil crop systems our study indicated that controlled irrigation in mollisols in china could effectively increase the total residual amount of fertilizer n promote the conversion of residual fertilizer n to organic n and reduce the residual amount of no3 n the residual fertilizer n in the surface soil 0 20 cm under controlled irrigation was higher than that under flooded irrigation in addition the amount of organic nitrogen was the highest and the amount of no3 n was the lowest in different n forms derived from each period fertilizer n under the controlled irrigation mode therefore a controlled irrigation mode could not only supplement the surface soil fertility but also reduce the leaching loss of fertilizer n and ensure the recovery of n in soil and subsequent crops after rice harvest under the two irrigation modes the proportion of basal fertilizer n was the highest in total residual n the proportion of tillering fertilizer n was the lowest under the flooded irrigation mode and panicle fertilizer n was the lowest under the controlled irrigation mode under the two irrigation modes basal fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion in the form of organic nitrogen and tillering fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion in the forms of no3 n and fixed ammonium tillering fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion of nh4 n under the controlled irrigation mode and panicle fertilizer accounted for the highest proportion of nh4 n under the flooded irrigation mode therefore residual fertilizer n resources can be regulated by adjusting the application rates and time of different period fertilizer n thus regulating the transformation of each period fertilizer nitrogen into different soil nitrogen pools through a reasonable water and nitrogen management mode may be a potential means for increasing the retention of fertilizer nitrogen and reducing the loss

9359,for soil crop systems it is important to increase the retention of fertilizer n that is not effectively utilized by crops in stable forms in soil and reduce fertilizer n loss from agroecosystems through agricultural practices however it remains obscure how the fate of fertilizer n will be affected by water and n management to further clarify the effects of water and n management on the fate of each period fertilizer n and residual fertilizer n amounts of different derived forms a field experiment was conducted in mollisols in northeast china this experiment combined a field plot experiment with a flied microplot 15n isotope experiment and six treatments were performed two irrigation management modes controlled irrigation and flooded irrigation and three fertilizer n rates 85 110 and 135 kg ha additionally the basal tillering and panicle fertilizer n were tracked by 15n labeled urea to study the fate of each period fertilizer n the present study showed that under controlled irrigation ci fertilizer derived n in different forms increased with the increase n rate under flooded irrigation fi with the increase n rate the residual organic nitrogen no first increased and then decreased and the other forms of fertilizer derived n increased in the total residual fertilizer n in soil residual basal fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion under the two irrigation modes residual tillering fertilizer n accounted for the lowest proportion under fi and panicle fertilizer n accounted for the lowest proportion under ci no accounted for the highest proportion of the residual amount of each period fertilizer n under ci and fi while no3 n accounted for the lowest proportion under ci and fixed ammonium accounted for the lowest proportion under fi compared with fi ci increased the total residual fertilizer n amount and promoted the conversion of residual fertilizer n into no the present study suggested that ci as a water saving irrigation mode not only decreased agricultural water consumption but also increased fertilizer n retention in soil and enhanced the conversion of residual fertilizer n into no the establishment of appropriate water and n management has great potential for the regulation of residual fertilizer n in paddy soil keywords paddy irrigation mode residual fertilizer n n management 15n labeled data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction nitrogen n is one of the most important nutrient elements in agricultural production and crop productivity strongly depends on the application rate of fertilizer n cassman et al 2003 alam et al 2006 in recent years the amount of fertilizer n applied in china s agricultural production has continuously increased and china has become the largest fertilizer n consuming country in the world the amount of fertilizer n used each year accounts for approximately 32 of the total amount of fertilizer n worldwide of which approximately 18 is used for rice planting chen et al 2019 the large amount of applied fertilizer n cannot be completely absorbed by crops excessive application of fertilizer n causes greater n input than uptake in agroecosystems in china and a large amount of fertilizer n remains in the soil zhang et al 2008 the fertilizer derived n that remains in the soil can directly participate in the cycle and transformation processes of soil n and ultimately transform into different soil n pools and the different residual forms of fertilizer derived n will affect the availability to crops and risk of fertilizer n loss wang et al 2016 the residual no3 n and nh4 n enter water and the atmosphere through leaching nitrification and denitrification which harm the ecological environment chen et al 2013 wang et al 2014 he et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 residual fertilizer derived n in the forms of no and fixed ammonium is beneficial to increase the recovery of fertilizer n in soil and crops therefore the residual fertilizer n in soil must be considered in agricultural resource management which is of great significance to sustainable agricultural development and ecological environmental security it is of great significance to study the fate of fertilizer n to reduce fertilizer n loss and increase the retention of n in stable forms in crop soil systems which is important for establishing suitable n management modes specifically the fate of fertilizer n is affected by many aspects such as soil fertility soil types irrigation regimens and fertilizer n management practices peng et al 2011 found that under the conventional flooded irrigation mode the residual fertilizer n was mainly in the form of no followed by no3 n and nh4 n and the fixed ammonium residual fertilizer n form was the lowest the relevant study showed that the amount of fertilizer n applied would affect the fate of fertilizer n under the conventional flooded irrigation mode when the n application rate was high the fertilizer n remained mainly in the form of no3 n but when the n application rate was low the fertilizer n remained mainly in the form of no ju et al 2002a 2002b bhogal et al 2000 conducted a five year study at the rothamsted long term test station in the uk and found that when the n application rate exceeded a threshold most of the fertilizer n remained in the form of inorganic n the results of the 15n tracer study performed by zhao et al 2015 showed that the residual fertilizer n was mainly in the form of no under dry cultivation the amount of fertilizer n remaining in the form of fixed ammonium was higher under dry cultivation than under conventional irrigation the results of a 15n tracer study in four soils with different textures in southeastern england and a mountainous area with poor soil fertility in nepal showed that the lower the soil fertility the greater were the residual amounts of fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n and nh4 n macdonald et al 1997 pilbeam et al 2002 at present it is crucial to accurately evaluate the conversion of fertilizer n into different soil n pools under different agricultural management modes according to the geographical and climatic properties of specific regions because these factors will affect the recovery of fertilizer n in soil crop systems agricultural sustainability and environmental pollution risk de neve et al 2004 macdonald et al 2002 however few studies have focused on the different residual forms of fertilizer derived n especially on the residual forms of fertilizer n applied in different periods during the growth of rice under water saving irrigation modes china is an important rice producer globally accounting for 19 of the world s rice planting area and 32 of the world s rice yield fao 2016 it was reported that rice yield will be affected by regional and seasonal drought schewe et al 2014 in addition the shortage of agricultural water resources has become increasingly serious due to increased industrial and urban water consumption liu et al 2013 to overcome the challenge of ensuring food security under the current increasing shortage of water resources scholars have proposed many water saving modes such as controlled irrigation alternating wetting and moderate drying stabilizing or increasing the rice yield dong et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 however it has been reported that a part of water saving irrigation modes might increase the risk of fertilizer n loss but there is a lack of research on the fate of fertilizers under different irrigation modes at this stage zhang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to study the residual amounts and forms of fertilizer n under the water saving irrigation mode to explore an irrigation mode that can not only save water but also promote the conversion of residual fertilizer n to a stable residual form mollisols in northeast china have high organic matter contents and are the most fertile soil in china with physical and chemical properties suitable for planting various crops xu et al 2010 in 2021 the total grain yield of northeast china was close to 25 of the total grain yield of china wang et al 2021 the northeast mollisols white paper noted that this area has become china s largest grain production and commercial grain base it functions as a ballast and regulator to ensure china s food security however the predatory management mode adopted in the past few decades has caused a gradual soil degradation in this area excessive fertilizer input has caused a series of environmental problems which directly affect the stability of regional grain yield thus the protection of mollisols is urgently needed to implement the strategy of storing grain in land and by technology cheng et al 2018 moreover the management of irrigation in northeast china has been changing water saving irrigation has been widely adopted by farmers for the sustainable development of rice production chen et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to study the transformation of fertilizer n into different soil n pools under different irrigation modes in the mollisols area of northeast china in the process of rice planting the residual derived n amounts and forms of basal tillering and panicle fertilizer in soil are different due to different application time and rates therefore an experiment was conducted in mollisols in northeast china that combined a field plot test with a flied microplot 15n isotope test it was used to quantitatively study the soil residual forms of basal tillering and panicle fertilizer derived n under different irrigation modes and n application rates in addition the proportion of different period fertilizer derived n residues in different soil n pools was analyzed to formulate reasonable paddy water and n management modes and to further optimize the fertilization n proportions the results of this study can be used to improve the availability of soil residual fertilizer n reduce the risk of environmental pollution provide improved reference material and finally achieve the goals of water saving high yield high efficiency and emission reduction in paddy fields 2 materials and methods 2 1

design was adopted and two irrigation modes were set up table 2 controlled irrigation ci and flooded irrigation fi the n rate pure n was set at three levels n1 85 kg ha n2 110 kg ha and n3 135 kg ha the experimental treatment design is shown in table 3 each treatment was repeated 3 times with a total of 18 experimental plots each with an area of 100 m2 10 m 10 m to prevent the exchange of water and n between each plot plastic plates with a depth of 40 cm were inserted underground into the ridges between each plot under ci the paddy field water surface maintained a shallow water layer of 0 30 mm during the turning green stage and naturally dried out during the yellow ripening stage but no water layers were established during other growth stages the irrigation time and amount were determined by the soil moisture content of the root layer the upper limit of irrigation was the saturated water content of the soil and the lower limit of the soil moisture content in each growth stage was a different percentage of saturated moisture content at 7 00 and 18 00 every day a tpime pico64 32 soil moisture tester was used to measure the soil moisture content of each experimental plot when the soil water content was close to or below the lower limit of irrigation artificial irrigation was carried out until the upper limit of irrigation was reached the soil water content was kept between the upper limit of irrigation and the lower limit of irrigation at the corresponding growth stage every day and the corresponding irrigation amount of each treatment was recorded under fi except for proper drainage and sun drying during the late tiller stage to control ineffective tillers and natural drying during the yellow ripening stage a water layer of 3 5 cm was maintained in the paddy field during the growing stage of rice the depth of the water layer in the paddy field was measured by a preburied ruler at 8 00 every day in the test plot to determine whether irrigation was needed the 15n tracer microplots were set in the above experimental plots and one microplot was set in each experimental plot that is three microplot tests three sub treatments were performed under a single treatment the experimental treatment settings are shown in table 1 in subtreatment 1 m1 the 15n labeled urea was only used for tracking basal fertilizer n in subtreatment 2 m2 the 15n labeled urea was only used for tracking tillering fertilizer n and in subtreatment 3 m3 the 15n labeled urea was only used for tracking panicle fertilizer n after preparation of the paddy field and before application of basal fertilizer urea a bottomless pvc rectangular frame with a length of 1 m width of 1 m and height of 0 5 m was preburied in each plot the microplots were buried deep and under the plow bottom depth of 30 cm the applied labeled fertilizer was 15n labeled urea with an abundance of 10 22 produced by shanghai research institute of chemical industry the irrigation modes and amounts

basal fertilizer rice seedlings with the same growth trend were selected for transplanting the plant spacing was 16 67 cm the row spacing was 30 cm three plants were set in each hill and the growth period was 126 days weeds were removed during each growth stage to preclude the effects of diseases and insect pests on the nutrient absorption of the rice 2 3 laboratory analysis and data analysis 2 3 1 soil bulk density in each layer according to the research of ju 2014 on the main movement and destination of fertilizer n in soil crop systems for many years the residual fertilizer n in paddy rice systems should be considered in the 0 20 cm soil layer and the residual fertilizer n in dry cultivation should be considered in the 0 60 cm soil layer the water saving irrigation mode used in this experiment is similar to the dry cultivation mode therefore based on available research results the 0 60 cm soil layer was considered for the residual fertilizer n in this experiment the soil samples were collected after the rice harvest the undisturbed soil samples were taken in layers according to the s shape inside and outside each treatment microplot with a 100 ml ring knife and the soil samples for elemental analysis were collected with a soil drill with a diameter of 3 5 cm the sampling layer depths were 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm three parallel samples were collected at

dried at 105 to a constant weight and the soil bulk density was calculated 2 3 2 content of different forms of n in each layer after the soil samples were returned to the laboratory for elemental analysis under each treatment mode stones rhizomes and various new bodies and intrusions were carefully removed the soil samples were then placed on cardboard dried and ground in a porcelain mortar after grinding and screening portions of the soil samples were measured by the semimicro kjeldahl method li et al 2015 and the other portions of the samples were placed in sample bags and sealed for sample isotope determination the other portions of the soil samples with stones and other impurities removed were extracted with 2 mol l kcl and the contents of no3 n and nh4 n in each layer of the

and amounts of fertilizer n under different water and n management modes according to fig 2 under the same n rate the amount of total soil residual fertilizer n under ci was higher than that under fi under different n rates of ci 61 49 72 56 of the residual fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 11 41 20 08 existed in the form of nh4 n 7 63 11 63 existed in the form of fixed ammonium and 6 79 8 39 existed in the form of no3 n under different n rates of fi 58 08 64 68 of the residual fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 19 06 20 93 existed in the form of no3 n 9 61 14 26 existed in the form of nh4 n and 5 35 7 45 existed in the form of fixed ammonium under different water and n management modes most of the residual fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no and the results showed that ci was conducive to the transformation of residual fertilizer n in paddy soil into no and to reducing the loss of soil residual fertilizer n as shown in table 4 the soil residual fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n nh4 n fixed ammonium and no showed significant differences between different water and n management modes p 0 05 under the two irrigation modes the soil residual fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n no3 n fixed ammonium and no increased with the increasing n rate a comparison between different irrigation modes showed that ci could increase the residual amounts of fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n fixed ammonium and no when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha the residual amounts of fertilizer n in the form of nh4 n under ci were 30 99 78 91 and 66 96 higher than those under fi respectively the residual fertilizer n in the form of fixed ammonium was 57 42 73 66 and 85 18 higher than those under fi respectively and the residual fertilizer n in the form of no was 24 83 14 49 and 25 59 higher than those under fi respectively the amounts of residual fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were higher under fi when the amounts of n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha the amounts of residual fertilizer n in the form of no3 n under fi were 126 11 138 48 and 150 88 higher than those under ci respectively after rice harvest under different n rates of ci most of the fertilizer n remaining in the paddy field in different forms was concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil layer table 5 which increased the fertility of the paddy soil surface and was conducive to the recovery of the residual fertilizer n in soil crop systems under fi the residual amount of fertilizer n in the form of no3 n accounted for a large proportion in the 20 40 cm soil layer which increased the risk of n leaching 3 2 transformation of soil residual basal fertilizer n under different water and n management modes according to fig 3 under the same n rate the amount of residual basal fertilizer n under ci was higher than that under fi under the two irrigation modes the proportions of nh4 n and fixed ammonium derived from basal fertilizer n increased and the proportion of no decreased with the increasing n rate under different n rates of ci 84 32 87 62 of the residual basal fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 4 03 6 26 existed in the form of nh4 n 3 53 5 73 existed in the form of fixed ammonium and 3 69 4 82 existed in the form of no3 n under different n rates of fi 77 77 82 63 of the residual basal fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 9 55 11 09 existed in the form of no3 n 3 75 6 49 existed in the form of nh4 n and 2 52 5 70 existed in the form of fixed ammonium the results showed that ci could increase the soil residual basal fertilizer n reduce the proportion of basal fertilizer n in the form of no3 n and reduce the risk of leaching of basal fertilizer n as shown in table 6 the residual amounts of basal fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n nh4 n fixed ammonium and no in paddy soil were significantly different between different water and n management modes p 0 05 under the two irrigation modes the residual amounts of basal fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n no3 n fixed ammonium and no increased with increasing n rate a comparison between different irrigation modes showed that ci could improve the residual amounts of basal fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n fixed ammonium and no in paddy soil when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha under ci the residual amounts of basal fertilizer n in the form of nh4 n were 27 52 22 09 and 24 98 higher than those under fi respectively the residual basal fertilizer n in the form of fixed ammonium was 57 41 22 17 and 25 48 higher than those under fi respectively and the residual basal fertilizer n in the form of no was 19 05 24 27 and 35 36 higher than those under fi respectively the residual amounts of basal fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were higher under fi when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha the residual amounts of basal fertilizer n in the form of no3 n under fi were 105 05 112 47 and 118 25 higher than those under ci respectively after rice harvest under different n rates of ci the residual basal fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n and no was mostly concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil layer table 7 the residual basal fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n and fixed ammonium was mostly concentrated in the 20 60 cm soil layer whereas under fi the residual basal fertilizer n in the form of no3 n was concentrated in the 20 40 cm soil layer and the leaching of n from basal fertilizer was obvious which posed a threat to the safety of the groundwater environment 3 3 transformation of soil residual tillering fertilizer n under different water and n management modes according to fig 4 under the same n rate the amount of residual tillering fertilizer n under ci was higher than that under fi under ci the proportions of nh4 n and fixed ammonium derived from tillering fertilizer n increased with increasing n rate and the proportions of no and no3 n decreased with increasing n rate under different n rates of ci 39 43 54 45 of residual tillering fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 17 23 29 31 existed in the form of nh4 n 12 78 19 31 existed in the form of fixed ammonium and 11 95 15 55 existed in the form of no3 n under different n rates of fi 38 27 43 40 of the residual tillering fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 31 80 35 16 existed in the form of no3 n 11 68 17 31 existed in the form of nh4 n and 9 21 10 12 existed in the form of fixed ammonium compared with fi ci increased the proportion of residual tillering fertilizer n in the form of no but with increasing n rate an increasing amount of tillering fertilizer n remained in the form of inorganic n in the soil to reduce the loss of tillering fertilizer n in soil it is necessary to pay attention to the application proportion of tillering fertilizer as shown in table 8 the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n nh4 n fixed ammonium and no were significantly different under different water and n management modes p 0 05 under the two irrigation modes the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n no3 n fixed ammonium and no increased with increasing n rate a comparison between different irrigation modes showed that ci could increase the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n fixed ammonium and no when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha under ci the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the form of nh4 n were 61 07 128 01 and 109 66 higher than those under fi respectively the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the form of fixed ammonium were 37 92 94 44 and 158 20 higher than those under fi respectively and residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the form of no were 37 00 11 44 and 27 60 higher than those under fi respectively under fi the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were higher when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha under fi the residual amounts of tillering fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were 105 05 122 61 and 137 63 higher than those under ci respectively after rice harvest the residual tillering fertilizer n in different forms in different soil layers is shown in table 9 under fi a large amount of tillering fertilizer n remained in the 20 40 cm soil layer in the form of no3 n while ci effectively reduced the soil residual tillering fertilizer n in the form of no3 n and concentrated the residual tillering fertilizer n in the surface soil 0 20 cm which improved the fertility of the topsoil 3 4 transformation of soil residual panicle fertilizer n under different water and n management modes according to fig 5 under the same n rate compared with fi the amount of residual panicle fertilizer n in the soil under ci was higher under ci the proportions of nh4 n and fixed ammonium derived from panicle fertilizer n increased with increasing n rate and the proportion of no decreased with increasing n rate under different n rates 53 72 72 95 of the residual panicle fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 14 04 29 19 existed in the form of nh4 n 7 32 11 54 existed in the form of fixed ammonium and 5 54 5 80 existed in the form of no3 n under different n rates of fi 53 22 63 70 of the residual panicle fertilizer n in paddy soil existed in the form of no 17 97 18 52 existed in the form of no3 n 13 85 20 57 existed in the form of nh4 n and 3 93 7 84 existed in the form of fixed ammonium as shown in table 10 the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n nh4 n and fixed ammonium in paddy soil exhibited significant differences under different water and n management modes p 0 05 while the residual panicle fertilizer n in the form of no exhibited no significant difference under the two irrigation modes the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n no3 n and fixed ammonium increased with increasing n rate a comparison between different irrigation modes showed that ci could improve the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n and fixed ammonium in paddy soil when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha under ci the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the form of nh4 n were 10 69 64 38 and 51 15 higher than those under fi respectively the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the form of fixed ammonium were 103 44 85 77 and 56 80 higher than those under fi respectively under fi the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were higher when the n rates were 85 110 and 135 kg ha under fi the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were 198 12 199 82 and 211 19 higher than those under ci respectively the residual panicle fertilizer n in different forms in different soil layers after rice harvest is shown in table 11 under ci the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the forms of no3 n fixed ammonium and no decreased with increasing soil depth while the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the form of nh4 n increased with increasing soil depth under fi a large amount of panicle fertilizer n in the form of no3 n remained in the 0 40 cm soil layer which could easily threaten the ecological environmental security of paddy fields 3 5 proportion of each period fertilizer derived n in different n pools under different irrigation modes the results of the proportion of residual different period fertilizer n and the proportion of different forms of fertilizer derived n in the sum of residual amount of fertilizer n of three n rates under the two irrigation modes are shown in fig 6 under the two irrigation modes the proportion of basal fertilizer n was the highest in total residual n the proportion of tillering fertilizer n was the lowest under fi while panicle fertilizer n was the lowest under ci under the two irrigation modes basal fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion in the form of no and tillering fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion in the forms of no3 n and fixed ammonium tillering fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion of nh4 n under ci and panicle fertilizer accounted for the highest proportion of nh4 n under fi compared with fi tillering fertilizer derived n accounted for a higher proportion of residual fertilizer n in nh4 n no3 n and fixed ammonium forms and basal fertilizer derived n also accounted for a higher proportion of residual fertilizer n in no form under ci therefore more attention should be given to the applications of basal and tillering fertilizer under ci moreover the amounts of fertilizer n remaining in the forms of inorganic n and organic n after crop harvest can be controlled by adjusting the application ratio of basal fertilizer tillering fertilizer and panicle fertilizer to reduce the risk of leaching of residual fertilizer n and improve the effectiveness of residual fertilizer n 4 discussion li et al 2011 estimated the status of soil residual n in the mollisols area in heilongjiang province after crop harvest based on the data from the statistical yearbook of heilongjiang province from 1980 to 2004 the results showed that the input of farmland soil n in heilongjiang province increased by 77 8 with an average of 118 1 kg ha from 1980 to 2002 moreover the n output increased by 72 1 with an average of 74 8 kg ha and the soil residual n increased by 86 2 with an average of 43 3 kg ha a large amount of fertilizer n remained in farmland soil fertilizer n applied to soil is converted into different n forms such as fertilizer derived mineral n fertilizer derived newly synthesized organic n or recently clay mineral fixed nh4 n lu et al 2010a schneiders and scherer 1998 a previous study showed that the transformation of fertilizer n into no was very important for achieving the goal of improving n availability and reducing n loss in soil crop systems lu et al 2018 moreover the fixed fertilizer n in the soil could be regarded as a way to store n for subsequent crops burger and jackson 2003 our experiment was conducted at the heilongjiang rice irrigation experimental station by using 15n tracer technology and the diffusion method to prepare isotopic samples the interference of organic n decomposition and isotopic fractionation caused by traditional steam distillation on the measured values was precluded zhang et al 2017 wen et al 2016 the residual amounts and forms of basal tillering and panicle fertilizer n under different water and n management modes were quantitatively analyzed the present study showed that the residual fertilizer n under the two irrigation modes with different n rates mainly existed in the form of no which was consistent with the research results of jensen et al 1997 and li et al 2013 the amount of fertilizer derived n remaining in the form of no was high which could be attributed to the specific properties of mollisols which had a high organic matter content and a strong ability to maintain water and fertilizer a relevant study showed that the amount of soil inorganic n supply increased with increasing organic matter content li et al 2005 the amounts of residual fertilizer n in different forms increased with the increasing n rate which was consistent with the research results of ju et al 2007 although the change range of the n rate set in this experiment was small the changes in residual fertilizer n in different forms with different n rates were obvious compared with fi ci could increase the residual amount of fertilizer n in paddy soil increase the proportions of residual fertilizer n in the forms of no and fixed ammonium and reduce the residual amount of fertilizer n in the form of no3 n these phenomena might be due to the superior permeability and higher oxygen content of soil under the water saving irrigation mode which improved the activity of soil microorganisms and enzymes and was conducive to the transformation of fertilizer n thus enhancing the ability of soil to fix fertilizer n xiao et al 2013 in addition the decrease in soil moisture would lead to an increase in the ammonium concentration in the soil and some ammonium ions were fixed which could promote the transformation of residual fertilizer n to no and fixed ammonium sun and zhang 2002 the present study indicated that controlled irrigation could increase the residual amount of fertilizer n in soil and promote the transformation of residual fertilizer n into no to reduce the loss of fertilizer n and improve the recovery of n in soil and subsequent crops to further manage and fully utilize soil residual fertilizer n based on traditional research on total residual fertilizer n amounts and different derived forms the fertilizer applied during the crop growth period was further subdivided the 15n isotope was used to track the basal tillering and panicle fertilizer n and the residual amounts and forms of each period fertilizer n under different irrigation modes and n rates were studied the tracer test results showed that the residual amounts of basal tillering and panicle fertilizer n under ci were higher than those under fi which was consistent with the results of zhang et al 2018 it was confirmed that ci could improve the fertilizer retention ability of soil and supplement the soil n pool of paddy fields under different n rates of ci the residual amounts of each period fertilizer n in the form of no3 n were lower than those of fi among the residual nh4 n no3 n and fixed ammonium forms tillering fertilizer accounted for the highest proportion and basal fertilizer accounted for the highest proportion of the residual no form the reason for this result might be that the application time of basal fertilizer was the earliest and the residual time in the soil was the longest therefore the amount of residual basal fertilizer n transformed into no was high relevant studies have shown that with the passage of crop growth time fertilizer n mainly remains in the form of no ju et al 2002a 2002b the research results of li et al 2018 showed that compared with the loss amounts of tillering and panicle fertilizer the loss amount of basal fertilizer n was the highest the residual basal fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n and no3 n was initially lost through nitrification denitrification and leaching so the residual amounts of basal fertilizer in the forms of nh4 n and no3 n were low due to the low application proportion of panicle fertilizer the residual amounts of panicle fertilizer n in the forms of nh4 n and no3 n were also low compared with that of tillering fertilizer the proportion of residual basal and panicle fertilizer n in fixed ammonium was relatively low which might be due to the application of potassium fertilizer in the early and 8 5 leaf age stages which increased the content of soil k caused the soil adsorption point to be occupied by k and reduced the fixation of soil to nh4 fan 1993 xie et al 2016 in conclusion under different irrigation modes the soil residual forms of fertilizer n could be further regulated by adjusting the application time and proportions of basal tillering and panicle fertilizers to promote the transformation of residual fertilizer n into no form and reduce the waste of fertilizer n 5 conclusion the challenge of managing the transformation and fate of fertilizer nitrogen is how to increase soil nitrogen retention and reduce nitrogen loss in soil crop systems our study indicated that controlled irrigation in mollisols in china could effectively increase the total residual amount of fertilizer n promote the conversion of residual fertilizer n to organic n and reduce the residual amount of no3 n the residual fertilizer n in the surface soil 0 20 cm under controlled irrigation was higher than that under flooded irrigation in addition the amount of organic nitrogen was the highest and the amount of no3 n was the lowest in different n forms derived from each period fertilizer n under the controlled irrigation mode therefore a controlled irrigation mode could not only supplement the surface soil fertility but also reduce the leaching loss of fertilizer n and ensure the recovery of n in soil and subsequent crops after rice harvest under the two irrigation modes the proportion of basal fertilizer n was the highest in total residual n the proportion of tillering fertilizer n was the lowest under the flooded irrigation mode and panicle fertilizer n was the lowest under the controlled irrigation mode under the two irrigation modes basal fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion in the form of organic nitrogen and tillering fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion in the forms of no3 n and fixed ammonium tillering fertilizer n accounted for the highest proportion of nh4 n under the controlled irrigation mode and panicle fertilizer accounted for the highest proportion of nh4 n under the flooded irrigation mode therefore residual fertilizer n resources can be regulated by adjusting the application rates and time of different period fertilizer n thus regulating the transformation of each period fertilizer nitrogen into different soil nitrogen pools through a reasonable water and nitrogen management mode may be a potential means for increasing the retention of fertilizer nitrogen and reducing the loss
