16310,a local preschool installed nsf ansi 42 and 53 certified point of use pou filters in its classroom sinks and drinking fountains to protect children from the possibility of elevated lead pb levels in drinking water we examined the effects of these filters during flowing water and immediately following stagnation periods on pb chlorine and bacterial concentrations in the field and the laboratory before and after typical school stagnation periods we collected samples from filtered classroom sinks a filtered drinking fountain and nearby unfiltered sinks for a year no unfiltered samples exceeded illinois state limits of 5 µg l for pb in pre k through 5th grade schools however following stagnation periods as short as overnight 14 5 h over half of post stagnation filtered samples from classroom sinks exceeded 5 µg l while post stagnation unfiltered samples remained below 5 µg l laboratory testing showed no significant increases in pb with stagnation suggesting that the preschool classrooms may have had pb bearing plumbing downstream of the filters which released pb into the filtered drinking water the filters effectively removed free chlorine 99 decrease in both the preschool and laboratory installing the filters had the unintended consequence of significantly increasing the bacterial concentrations as measured by qpcr in the preschool s drinking water and in laboratory filter effluent legionella pneumophila pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium spp were not detected in pre stagnation unfiltered and post stagnation filtered samples these results suggest that the installation of pou filters be considered as one component of an overall strategy to decrease pb concentrations in school drinking water that holistically considers the premise plumbing system a 5 minute flush significantly decreased concentrations of pb and bacteria in filtered sinks replacing pb bearing plumbing components downstream of a pou filter may also be needed to combat pb

technology for decreasing pb in drinking water the combined effects of stagnation and filtration have not been studied extensively few studies have examined pou filters under conditions of actual use particularly in schools where children are especially vulnerable to pb in drinking water pou filters fed with synthetic tap water spiked with pb or with pure microbial culture may behave differently than pou filters in the field mulhern et al 2021 previous studies have not thoroughly investigated the unintended consequences of installing pou filters to remove pb and their resulting implications for public health to address these limitations we conducted an extensive study on the combined effects of stagnation and filtration throughout the filters lifetimes at a preschool in illinois this preschool had installed sbac pou filters to decrease pb concentrations typical stagnation periods for the preschool are overnight over weekends and over multi day school holidays we assessed the effects of stagnation and filtration on pb chlorine and bacteria concentrations and performed additional experiments on the same type of pou filters in the laboratory our study s results contribute new scientific information on the field performance of pou filters following stagnation provide pou filter users with recommendations for how to use the filters safely and present the tradeoffs associated with installing pou filters 2 material and methods 2 1 field work between march 2019 and march 2020 water samples were collected from a preschool in illinois fig 1 this preschool uses drinking water from a local lime softening treatment plant that treats groundwater from the mahomet aquifer using conventional drinking water treatment methods including aeration coagulation sedimentation granular filtration and free chlorine disinfection no corrosion inhibitors are added the treatment plant reports the typical ph as 8 5 8 9 with total hardness of 96 mg l as caco3 and alkalinity of 170 200 mg l as caco3 illinois american water 2019 the exact plumbing configuration of the preschool could not be obtained 2 1 1 field sampling sites for every sampling event eight sites were sampled classrooms in the preschool are equipped with benchtop sinks installed in 2003 when the preschool was constructed pre 2019 nsf ansi 42 and 53 certified pou filters elkay 51300c containing sbac and an ion exchanger are installed on the cold water line for these classroom benchtop sinks specifications recommend using filters for one year or 3000 gallons whichever comes first unfiltered bathroom sinks a few feet away from the filtered sampling sites were used as paired controls for each sink with a filter three classroom benchtop sinks and the corresponding bathroom sinks within the classrooms were used as six of the sampling sites the fourth pair of sampling sites was a drinking fountain sampled from the bubbler head not the attached water bottle filling station installed in 2017 that used the same pou filter model as those in the classrooms and an unfiltered sink in the bathroom nearest that drinking fountain the drinking fountain has its own cooling system but the refrigeration occurs downstream of the pou filter the pou filters did not have bypass systems that would have allowed influent water to be collected all benchtop sink and bathroom sink samples were collected from the cold water tap new filters also nsf ansi 42 and 53 certified were installed in october 2018 and in november 2019 2 1 2 field sampling events after regular school day usage filtered and unfiltered taps were flushed at 1500 1800 ml min for 5 min or the equivalent of 10 filter volumes to flush out whatever accumulated in the filter during stagnation next pre stagnation samples were collected from all eight sampling sites water stagnated in the filters for periods ranging from 14 5 h overnight and 62 5 h over the weekend to 134 5 h thanksgiving break and 230 5 h spring break post stagnation samples were collected from all eight sites immediately after the stagnation period there was no flushing directly prior to post stagnation sample collection these steps flushing sample collection stagnation and another sample collection were repeated a total of nine times such that nine pre stagnation and nine post stagnation samples from each of the eight sampling sites were collected at each of the sampling sites pre stagnation and post stagnation samples were collected in sterilized high density polyethylene hdpe bottles when sampling between march 2019 and august 2019 a total of 2 25 l was collected from each site four separate consecutive 250 ml samples were collected followed by two separate 500 ml samples followed by a final 250 ml sample for samples collected after august 2019 a total of 4 l was collected from each site a 250 ml sample was collected followed by a 3750 ml sample the change in method was made after the concentration of dna in samples from the 2 25 l method was determined to be too low for detection by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr both methods included a separate 250 ml first draw sample 2 1 3 field sample measurements we measured the concentrations of total pb free and total chlorine bacteria 0 1 50 µm particles and total organic carbon toc the ph and the temperature the university of illinois s microanalysis laboratory measured total pb using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkinelmer samples were acidified by addition of 70 hno3 v v and the acidified samples analyzed contained 14 hno3 for the 2 25 l method 10 ml aliquots were taken from a selection of the 1st 250 ml samples and 2nd 250 ml samples for the 4 l method 10 ml aliquots were taken from a selection of the 1st 250 ml samples and 2nd 3750 ml samples within one hour of sample collection free and total chlorine were measured after measuring chlorine at regular time intervals for two hours after collection at t 0 5 10 15 20 30 45 60 75 90 105 and 120 min chlorine concentrations did not change significantly within the first two hours p 0 85 chlorine measurements were performed with a portable spectrophotometer hach and n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd free chlorine and total chlorine reagent powder pillows hach for the 2 25 l method 10 ml aliquots were taken from the final 250 ml sample to measure only free chlorine for the 4 l method two 10 ml aliquots were taken from the 1st 250 ml sample to measure residual free and total chlorine the collection method had no significant effect on the chlorine measurements p 0 195 to measure bacterial dna the first 2 l 2 25 l method and the first 4 l 4 l method were pooled together as shown in fig 1 and passed through a sterile 0 22 µm polyethersulfone or cellulose nitrate filter millipore mdi membrane technologies dna was extracted from pooled samples using a kit mp biomedicals and qpcr was performed to test for total bacteria 16s rrna gene legionella pneumophila l pneumophila pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa and mycobacterium spp table s1 text s1 these specific bacteria were targeted because of their previously reported prevalence in drinking water distribution systems and their abilities to break through pou filters chaidez and gerba 2004 falkinham 2010 falkinham et al 2015 geldreich et al 1985 molloy et al 2007 wu et al 2017 2021 blank controls were made from unused sterile 0 22 µm filters and from empty lysing matrix tubes from the dna extraction kit the results of the blank controls were below the lower limit of detection lld table s2 all qpcr runs for each target gene included triplicate standard curves made up of serial dilutions ranging from 101 copies µl to 107 copies µl triplicate negative controls and triplicates of each sample being tested each reaction was 15 µl and included the following 2 µl of the sample or standard or negative control 4 3 µl of molecular grade water 0 6 µl of 10 µm forward primer 0 6 µl of 10 µm reverse primer and 7 5 µl of 2x powerup sybr green applied biosystems all qpcr runs were performed using quantstudio 3 real time pcr systems applied biosystems in optical 96 well reaction plates applied biosystems the qpcr efficiency was 95 100 for 16s rrna plates r2 1 86 98 for l pneumophila plates r2 1 87 92 for p aeruginosa plates r2 1 and 85 90 for mycobacterium spp r2 1 the concentration of 0 1 50 µm particles was measured using flow cytometry sysmex partec this instrument s detectors were incapable of distinguishing bacteria from other particles therefore these flow cytometer measurements are referred to as particles instrument background noise was minimized by rinsing the instrument with 10 bleach followed by filtered 0 22 µm distilled water in between each sample for the 2 25 l method 1 ml aliquots were taken from each of the first four 250 ml samples and the next two 500 ml samples for the 4 l method 1 ml aliquots were taken from the 1st 250 ml sample and the 2nd 3750 ml sample at a final concentration of 0 1 mm na2s2o3 fisher scientific was added to 1 ml aliquots before incubating samples at 37 c for 10 min samples were stained with 10 µl ml of 100x sybr green invitrogen and incubated in the dark for at least 10 min particle measurements were performed within 6 h of sample collection temperature was measured at the collection site from the final 250 ml sample for the 2 25 l method and the 1st 250 ml sample for the 4 l method sample ph was measured with an orion 2 star ph meter thermoscientific and toc was measured with a toc vcph analyzer shimadzu for the 2 25 l method the final 250 ml sample was used for measuring ph and the 1st 250 ml sample was used for measuring toc for the 4 l method the 2nd 3750 ml sample was used for measuring both ph and toc 2 2 laboratory based pou filter evaluation we performed three sets of experiments under controlled test conditions in the laboratory to complement our findings from the field tap water was passed through three replicate filters used for each test condition 1 low pb low bacteria new filters tap only 2 high pb low bacteria new filters loaded with pb tap pb and 3 low pb high bacteria year old used filters with biofilm tap biofilm all filters were of the same brand and model as those used in the preschool tracer tests were performed on all nine filters to determine the volume of the filter pores and filter cartridge figure s1 table s3 filters had an average volume of 800 ml 2 2 1 loading filters with pb to prepare the filters for the tap pb condition three new filters each received 10 l of a solution containing 2500 µg l of dissolved pb provided by pb no3 2 in ultrapure water particulate pb was not used in this laboratory setup because we did not have information about the particulate pb forms and the ratio of dissolved pb to particulate pb from the field the ph of the solution was kept at 5 1 to prevent precipitation of pb the 10 l solution was delivered in 10 increments of 1 l for every 1 l increment 1 l of 2500 µg l dissolved pb solution was pumped through a filter no other water chemistry parameters were adjusted this solution was supplied to the filter by a peristaltic pump at 5 ml min and all of the filtered effluent was collected the pb concentrations in the influent tank and effluent tank were monitored at the beginning and end of each 1 l increment figure s2 the masses of pb loaded onto the filters are listed in table s4 2 2 2 promoting further biofilm growth in year old filters for the tap biofilm condition three filters from the preschool were collected after one year of regular usage drained stored at 4 c for one year and then set up in the laboratory at room temperature in addition to any biofilm that had accumulated during the filters regular usage groundwater containing 10 mg l as sio2 sodium metasilicate was used to promote further biofilm growth in the filters huang et al 2020 biofilm grew from the indigenous microbial community and relied on organic matter present in the groundwater and adsorbed onto the filter s carbon surface for growth the groundwater silicate mixture was pumped through each of the filters at 120 ml min low shear conditions were used to supply the filters with the nutrient mixture without disturbing the existing biofilms horn et al 2003 rittman 1982 the filters were left to sit in a loosely sealed container filled with the groundwater silicate mixture for two months high concentrations of bacteria released from these year old filters support the presence of biofilm see results 3 3 2 2 3 laboratory sampling events for all three test conditions the sampling events were the same only the filters differed the laboratory faucet was flushed for 15 20 min to reach a steady ph and concentrations of chlorine and bacteria figure s3 the alkalinity and ph of the laboratory tap water were consistent with those reported by the drinking water treatment plant and the ph measured at the preschool each of the three replicate filters was connected to the laboratory faucet and flushed at 1500 ml min for 5 min the filters were detached and a 250 ml sample was collected from the influent faucet the filters were reattached and pre stagnation samples made up of four separate consecutive 250 ml samples were collected from each filter filters were then disconnected and left to sit at room temperature for 14 5 h the same length of time used for overnight stagnation at the preschool after the stagnation period the influent faucet was flushed for 15 20 min without flushing the filters a 250 ml sample from the influent faucet was collected and then post stagnation samples of four separate 250 ml samples were collected from each filter the flow rate of each filter was consistently 1500 ml min sixteen samples eight pre stagnation eight post stagnation from each of the three replicates under each filter test condition were collected 2 2 4 laboratory sampling measurements the 1st 250 ml sample was used to measure free chlorine and ph in all samples pb was measured in a selection of the influent samples and in the 1st 250 ml filtered samples from the second tap pb and third tap biofilm test conditions a flow cytometer sysmex partec that could distinguish bacteria from other particles was used to measure concentrations of total and intact bacteria in all 250 ml samples the free chlorine ph and pb measurement methods were the same as those used in the field work flow cytometry samples were prepared by adding na2s2o3 fisher scientific at a final concentration of 0 1 mm to the 250 ml samples and then taking two separate 700 µl aliquots for total and intact cell measurements for total cell counts tcc samples were stained to a final concentration of 1x with sybr green invitrogen that had been diluted from 10 000x stock with tris hcl hammes et al 2008 nescerecka et al 2016 for intact cell counts icc samples were stained with a mixture of sybr green and propidium iodide invitrogen at final concentrations of 1x and 30 µm respectively berney et al 2008 samples were incubated in the dark for at least 10 min total and intact bacteria were enumerated via electronic gating the fl1 channel fitc and fl3 channel pe cy5 were used to measure green and red fluorescence and had gain settings of 500 and 700 respectively hammes et al 2008 in between each sample the flow cytometer was rinsed with ultrapure water until no background was detected in the electronic gating regions 2 3 data analysis data were analyzed using the statistical software r version 3 6 3 shapiro wilk tests were performed to determine the normality of the data two sample t tests and paired sample t tests were performed on normal data wilcoxon signed rank tests and wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed on non normal data statistical tests were performed at a significance level of α 0 05 data points with values below the lld were set to be one half the lld for the statistical tests table s2 3 results and discussion a summary of total pb free chlorine bacteria particles and ph data from the preschool is shown in table 1 statistical test results are shown in table s5 3 1 pb release in preschool and laboratory filters as shown in fig 2 a all samples from the unfiltered sites had total pb concentrations below the 5 µg l limit but of the 28 filtered samples 12 exceeded 5 µg l and pb concentrations in filtered samples were significantly greater than those in unfiltered samples p 1 04 10 3 of the 12 filtered samples exceeding 5 µg l 11 were from post stagnation samples and 10 were from the 250 ml first draw of post stagnation samples post stagnation filtered samples had higher total pb concentrations than pre stagnation filtered samples p 9 0 10 4 for comparison pb concentrations in unfiltered samples did not significantly increase with stagnation p 0 65 all of the post stagnation filtered samples exceeding 5 µg l were from the classroom sinks sites 1 3 in fig 2a which were installed in 2003 and had significantly higher pb concentrations than the post stagnation filtered samples from the drinking fountain site 4 in fig 2a which was installed in 2017 p 7 0 10 3 in post stagnation filtered samples total pb in the 1st 250 ml sample was higher than the total pb in the subsequent 2nd 250 ml or 2nd 3750 ml samples p 9 7 10 5 after new filters replaced year old used filters the same trends applied there was no significant difference between post stagnation filtered samples before and after filters were replaced p 0 104 the results from the laboratory on the effects of stagnation on pb concentrations in water leaving filters did not reflect those found in the field only three filtered samples exceeded 5 µg l and those samples all came from the first experiment performed after the tap pb filters were loaded with pb fig 2b the filters probably had not yet reached steady state and the pb release is unlikely to be attributable to the same reason as the high pb concentrations found in filtered sites at the preschool those high pb concentrations exceeded 1 5 times the interquartile range of the samples collected under the same test conditions and were deemed outliers under both test conditions for which pb was measured tap pb tap biofilm the pb in filter influent was significantly greater than the pb in filter effluent pre stagnation p 5 1 10 3 p 9 8 10 5 and post stagnation p 1 01 10 3 p 9 5 10 5 there was no significant difference between pb concentrations in filter effluent pre and post stagnation in the tap pb samples p 0 193 or in the tap biofilm samples p 0 57 these results indicate that the filters removed pb and that pb was not released into the stagnant water within the filter or washed out following an overnight stagnation period the discrepancies between the results from the field and the laboratory suggested that there may have been case specific issues occurring in the preschool the reduction of lead in drinking water act went into effect in 2014 decreasing the allowable percentage of pb in lead free components from 8 to 0 25 us 100th congress 1988 us 111th congress 2011 the plumbing components leading from the water supply to the drinking fountain including the plumbing within the fountain upstream and downstream of the filter were installed after this act while the plumbing systems in the classrooms were installed before it the drinking fountain consistently had pb levels below 5 µg l the high concentrations of pb in classroom sinks with pou filters were likely due to pb bearing plumbing components that were present downstream of the filter but were not present in the drinking fountain or the nearby bathroom sinks unfiltered sites this hypothesis is also supported by the lack of pb release from pou filters in the laboratory studies the low pb concentrations in unfiltered samples that did not significantly increase with stagnation and the continued pb release from classroom sinks with pou filters even after the preschool replaced the filters decreases in ph induced by the water s contact with the pou filters could also increase the dissolved pb the mean and median decrease in ph with stagnation was 0 1 0 3 ph units in filtered samples given this ph change the dissolved pb in equilibrium with the expected solubility controlling solid could increase by about 6 µg l figure s4a however when considering all changes in filter effluent ph with stagnation the maximum observed decrease of 0 7 ph units could result in increases of dissolved pb of up to 24 µg l figure s4b a significant contribution to the observed increases in pb following stagnation given the ph changes that were observed with stagnation at the preschool the dissolution of solid pb due to decreases in ph could be partially responsible for the observed increases in pb concentration following water stagnation in the pou filters figure s4c d our laboratory studies demonstrating the pou filter s effective removal of pb align with previous studies bosscher et al 2019 boyd et al 2005 deshommes et al 2012 2010 mulhern and macdonald gibson 2020 the findings that the filters continued to remove pb following stagnation in the laboratory is also in agreement with previous work deshommes et al 2012 2010 flushing unfiltered drinking fountains significantly decreases concentrations of pb in school drinking water murphy 1993 flushing the classroom sinks for 5 min before collecting the pre stagnation filtered samples likely decreased the pb in the water coming from the pb components downstream of the filters in classroom sinks previous studies have demonstrated that pou filters containing sbac can effectively remove dissolved pb deshommes et al 2012 2010 pan et al 2020 but may struggle to effectively remove particulate pb doré et al 2021 pan et al 2021 purchase et al 2021 formation of solid pb in water containing chlorine has been shown previously edwards and dudi 2004 lin and valentine 2009 in this study we did not distinguish between particulate and dissolved pb in the preschool samples collected between march 2019 and march 2020 we intended to do so after march 2020 but restrictions to preschool access made necessary by the covid 19 pandemic prevented further sampling based on previous knowledge we suggest that the formation of particulate pb may have been favorable possibly leading to decreases in the pou filter s overall pb removal efficiency after stagnation water usage in other parts of a building and sampling protocol can affect pb concentrations in sampled tap water triantafyllidou et al 2021 post stagnation samples were collected before anyone else entered the building making the former unlikely we collected a 250 ml first draw to assess pb concentrations immediately after stagnation although the plumbing configuration in the preschool could not be obtained calculations based on the length and diameter of the pipes suggest that the volume between the pou filter and the faucet is at most 50 ml the filter pore and cartridge volume is around 800 ml therefore the 250 ml first draw is composed of 50 ml of water from the pipe and another 200 ml of water from the filter the 2nd 250 ml comes from the filter and the 2nd 3750 ml comes from the filter and the premise plumbing upstream of the filter the preschool installed these filters with the intention of reducing pb exposure to young children unfortunately installing pou filters is not a complete solution and the system must be considered holistically while a complete replacement of the plumbing infrastructure may be unrealistic installing pou filters alone can be ineffective if pb bearing plumbing downstream of the filter releases pb into the drinking water if significant concentrations of pb are detected even after filter installation replacing plumbing downstream of the filter may be needed in cases where this is not affordable flushing the filter for 10 filter volumes or 5 min depending on flow rate can reduce these pb concentrations admittedly decreasing the lifespan of the filter in the process 3 2 cl removal in preschool and laboratory filters as shown in fig 3 a chlorine concentrations decreased with filtration and stagnation regardless of filter age higher chlorine concentrations in post stagnation unfiltered samples are associated with shorter stagnation periods free chlorine concentrations in filtered samples were lower than those in unfiltered samples p 1 22 10 12 filters decreased chlorine concentrations by 99 and most filtered samples regardless of stagnation had chlorine concentrations below the lld year old and new filters removed chlorine and there was no significant difference between filtered samples before and after new filters were installed p 0 48 in unfiltered samples over all stagnation periods there was an average 65 decrease in free chlorine concentrations p 8 7 10 8 which occurs when chlorine reacts with organic and inorganic compounds and biofilms deborde and von gunten 2008 xu et al 2018 chlorine removal results from the laboratory experiments agreed with those from the preschool regardless of test condition tap only tap pb tap biofilm the filters significantly removed chlorine p 3 5 10 27 decreasing chlorine concentrations by 99 fig 3b the findings that the pou filters in the preschool and laboratory remove chlorine aligns with previous studies reporting significant chlorine removal by pou filters containing activated carbon deshommes et al 2010 geldreich et al 1985 wu et al 2017 total chlorine was lower in filtered samples than in unfiltered samples p 2 7 10 8 but free chlorine was less than total chlorine in filtered samples p 7 4 10 6 this observation indicates that filters removed total chlorine but less efficiently than they removed free chlorine concurring with previous findings tobin et al 1981 the filter specifications recommend changing the filter annually and this study confirms that the filters effectively remove chlorine throughout the filter s one year lifetime under normal usage the pou filter s effective removal of residual disinfectant and disinfectant consumption during stagnation likely favored bacterial accumulation within and downstream of the filter 3 3 bacterial and particle release in preschool and laboratory filters there were no detectable concentrations of l pneumophila p aeruginosa or mycobacterium spp in the pre stagnation unfiltered or post stagnation filtered samples from the preschool this observation indicates that if any of these bacteria were present in the influent they were below detectable levels 10 copies µl table s2 and did not grow to concentrations above the detection limit in the filters during stagnation as shown in fig 4 total bacteria concentrations as quantified by qpcr for 16s rrna increased with filtration and with stagnation in filtered samples for both pre and post stagnation samples filtered samples had significantly more bacteria than unfiltered samples p 1 17 10 13 bacteria in filtered samples increased with stagnation p 3 2 10 5 while bacteria in unfiltered samples did not significantly change with stagnation p 0 46 the increases in bacterial concentrations with stagnation occurred in both year old filters p 2 5 10 2 and new filters p 8 6 10 3 comparing the classroom filtered bacteria data to the drinking fountain filtered bacteria data we find that there is no significant difference between the two p 0 56 even after separating by stagnation there was still no significant difference p 0 05 similarly flow cytometry results showed the concentration of particles 0 1 50 µm increased with filtration p 1 09 10 24 and with stagnation in filtered samples p 1 51 10 6 a 5 minute flush preceded the collection of pre stagnation filtered samples which had lower bacteria and particle concentrations than post stagnation filtered samples the 250 ml first draw had a significantly higher concentration of particles than the subsequent 2nd 250 ml samples p 3 9 10 2 or 2nd 3750 ml samples p 1 53 10 5 changing the filter also helped decrease bacteria in filter effluent as evidenced by significantly higher bacterial concentrations in year old filter samples than in new filter samples p 3 0 10 5 the total and intact cell counts tcc icc from the laboratory tests agreed with the findings from the field fig 5 under all three test conditions tcc and icc increased with filtration p 0 05 the tcc and icc increased with stagnation in the filtered samples from the tap pb and tap biofilm conditions p 0 05 under the first test condition tap only the icc significantly increased with stagnation in filtered samples p 4 9 10 3 but the tcc did not p 0 49 for comparison the influent concentrations of total and intact cells were steady figure s3c and did not change significantly with stagnation p 0 05 for all test conditions the total and intact bacterial cells were significantly higher in the 1st 250 ml of filter effluent than in the 2nd 250 ml regardless of stagnation p 0 05 the old filters from the tap biofilm condition had significantly higher total and intact bacterial releases than the new filters from the tap only condition p 0 05 and the new filters from the tap pb condition p 0 05 some studies have reported breakthrough of l pneumophila p aeruginosa and mycobacterium spp for filters where tap water spiked with a challenge organism was provided as the influent geldreich et al 1985 molloy et al 2007 wu et al 2021 or in filters fed with unmodified tap water chaidez and gerba 2004 falkinham 2010 wu et al 2017 given the undetectable concentrations of these microorganisms in the unfiltered samples from the preschool these microorganisms may not have been present in high enough concentrations to accumulate in the filters and break through to detectable concentrations in filter effluent in addition there are likely to be more complicated microbial colonization processes and biofilm interactions in real world situations than in tap water spiked with pure pathogenic culture these differences could also impact the prevalence and relative abundance of pathogenic microorganisms and the probability of filter breakthrough seeing the same trends in the laboratory and the preschool using two different methods for total bacterial quantification suggests that the results from the preschool were not isolated events the observed increases in bacteria with filtration and stagnation are also in agreement with previous results chaidez and gerba 2004 nriagu et al 2018 tobin et al 1981 wu et al 2017 during regular usage interception could allow some bacteria and other particles to accumulate in the filter while others pass through the filter entirely during stagnation some bacteria and particles likely diffuse into the stagnant water that then get washed out after stagnation the shear forces from the sudden use of the filter following stagnation could mobilize the loose bacteria and particles from the filter s sbac surface resulting in further bacterial and particle release into the filter effluent in year old filters there is another source of bacteria that can be released into the filter effluent biofilm bacteria bacteria can detach from a mature ripened biofilm and bacteria can slough off a biofilm s surface under the shear forces when the filter is used after stagnation shear forces could mobilize bacteria that are in the early stages of biofilm attachment and are not yet secured to the sbac surface however it is unlikely that the formation of a biofilm and subsequent release of biofilm bacteria contributed significantly to the bacteria released after a stagnation period as short as overnight previous studies on biofilm growth using groundwater in illinois reported that it took several months to grow and form stable biofilms huang et al 2020 janjaroen et al 2013 and our ongoing research confirmed this although the preschool installed pou filters to remove pb an unintended consequence of these filters is their removal of chlorine and resulting amplification of bacterial release flushing a filtered faucet for 10 filter volumes or 5 min depending on flow rate can decrease the concentration of bacteria in filtered tap water 3 4 changes in ph temperature and toc with filtration and stagnation the ph in the preschool drinking water ranged from 7 5 to 9 0 and had equal mean and median values of 8 6 the minimum ph of 7 5 is an outlier from a filtered sample and the ph was mostly steady with a standard deviation of 0 2 ph units in the preschool the ph decreased with filtration p 1 17 10 8 and with stagnation in filtered samples p 5 6 10 5 matching the findings from the preschool the ph in laboratory tests also significantly decreased with filtration p 1 88 10 9 and with stagnation in filtered samples p 6 7 10 10 these results match a previous study s finding in which ph decreased after passing through pour through activated carbon pou filters deshommes et al 2010 the median differences between filtered and unfiltered samples and between the pre stagnation filtered and post stagnation filtered samples were 0 1 0 3 ph units as noted above these decreases in ph could partially explain the increase in pb concentrations based on the predicted solubility of a pb hydroxycarbonate that could be the solubility controlling solid figure s4 the drinking water treatment plant does not add corrosion inhibitors and relies on alkalinity and ph to minimize the amount of pb released into the drinking water while this method was sufficient for the unfiltered bathroom sinks the classroom sinks that likely had pb bearing components still released pb into the drinking water preschool sample temperatures ranged from 9 5 c to 27 c and had mean and median values of 18 c and 19 c respectively temperature varied slightly with season and increased with stagnation in both filtered p 3 4 10 7 and unfiltered p 2 7 10 16 samples possibly affecting bacterial growth nap 2006 the concentration of toc in the preschool ranged from non detect below 0 5 mg c l to 4 1 mg c l and had an average of 2 0 mg c l although ph temperature and toc can influence pb solubility chlorine decay and bacterial growth it is unlikely that the small differences in these parameters had major impacts on the performance of the pou filters in the preschool or laboratory 4 conclusions in this study we expanded beyond existing literature to investigate the effectiveness of installing pou filters following stagnation of water within the filter in both the field and laboratory their ability to protect the most vulnerable and the tradeoffs and unintended consequences associated with adding pou filters to a premise plumbing system installing pou filters alone did not completely achieve the preschool s goal to remove pb because classroom sinks likely had pb bearing plumbing components downstream of the filter that released pb into the drinking water replacing pb bearing plumbing components removes pb at the source and should be considered for any plumbing downstream of a pou filter in addition the pou filters contain sbac which effectively removes the disinfectant free chlorine throughout the filters lifetime thereby allowing bacteria to accumulate and biofilms to develop over time although l pneumophila p aeruginosa and mycobacterium spp were not detected in the preschool the increase of total bacteria in the filter effluent following filtration and stagnation periods as short as overnight may have concerning public health implications if pathogenic bacteria were to be present in the influent the health risk from pathogenic bacteria released from pou filters has yet to be quantified and is a subject of our current research a method of addressing unintended consequences of pou installation on bacteria

16310,a local preschool installed nsf ansi 42 and 53 certified point of use pou filters in its classroom sinks and drinking fountains to protect children from the possibility of elevated lead pb levels in drinking water we examined the effects of these filters during flowing water and immediately following stagnation periods on pb chlorine and bacterial concentrations in the field and the laboratory before and after typical school stagnation periods we collected samples from filtered classroom sinks a filtered drinking fountain and nearby unfiltered sinks for a year no unfiltered samples exceeded illinois state limits of 5 µg l for pb in pre k through 5th grade schools however following stagnation periods as short as overnight 14 5 h over half of post stagnation filtered samples from classroom sinks exceeded 5 µg l while post stagnation unfiltered samples remained below 5 µg l laboratory testing showed no significant increases in pb with stagnation suggesting that the preschool classrooms may have had pb bearing plumbing downstream of the filters which released pb into the filtered drinking water the filters effectively removed free chlorine 99 decrease in both the preschool and laboratory installing the filters had the unintended consequence of significantly increasing the bacterial concentrations as measured by qpcr in the preschool s drinking water and in laboratory filter effluent legionella pneumophila pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium spp were not detected in pre stagnation unfiltered and post stagnation filtered samples these results suggest that the installation of pou filters be considered as one component of an overall strategy to decrease pb concentrations in school drinking water that holistically considers the premise plumbing system a 5 minute flush significantly decreased concentrations of pb and bacteria in filtered sinks replacing pb bearing plumbing components downstream of a pou filter may also be needed to combat pb

technology for decreasing pb in drinking water the combined effects of stagnation and filtration have not been studied extensively few studies have examined pou filters under conditions of actual use particularly in schools where children are especially vulnerable to pb in drinking water pou filters fed with synthetic tap water spiked with pb or with pure microbial culture may behave differently than pou filters in the field mulhern et al 2021 previous studies have not thoroughly investigated the unintended consequences of installing pou filters to remove pb and their resulting implications for public health to address these limitations we conducted an extensive study on the combined effects of stagnation and filtration throughout the filters lifetimes at a preschool in illinois this preschool had installed sbac pou filters to decrease pb concentrations typical stagnation periods for the preschool are overnight over weekends and over multi day school holidays we assessed the effects of stagnation and filtration on pb chlorine and bacteria concentrations and performed additional experiments on the same type of pou filters in the laboratory our study s results contribute new scientific information on the field performance of pou filters following stagnation provide pou filter users with recommendations for how to use the filters safely and present the tradeoffs associated with installing pou filters 2 material and methods 2 1 field work between march 2019 and march 2020 water samples were collected from a preschool in illinois fig 1 this preschool uses drinking water from a local lime softening treatment plant that treats groundwater from the mahomet aquifer using conventional drinking water treatment methods including aeration coagulation sedimentation granular filtration and free chlorine disinfection no corrosion inhibitors are added the treatment plant reports the typical ph as 8 5 8 9 with total hardness of 96 mg l as caco3 and alkalinity of 170 200 mg l as caco3 illinois american water 2019 the exact plumbing configuration of the preschool could not be obtained 2 1 1 field sampling sites for every sampling event eight sites were sampled classrooms in the preschool are equipped with benchtop sinks installed in 2003 when the preschool was constructed pre 2019 nsf ansi 42 and 53 certified pou filters elkay 51300c containing sbac and an ion exchanger are installed on the cold water line for these classroom benchtop sinks specifications recommend using filters for one year or 3000 gallons whichever comes first unfiltered bathroom sinks a few feet away from the filtered sampling sites were used as paired controls for each sink with a filter three classroom benchtop sinks and the corresponding bathroom sinks within the classrooms were used as six of the sampling sites the fourth pair of sampling sites was a drinking fountain sampled from the bubbler head not the attached water bottle filling station installed in 2017 that used the same pou filter model as those in the classrooms and an unfiltered sink in the bathroom nearest that drinking fountain the drinking fountain has its own cooling system but the refrigeration occurs downstream of the pou filter the pou filters did not have bypass systems that would have allowed influent water to be collected all benchtop sink and bathroom sink samples were collected from the cold water tap new filters also nsf ansi 42 and 53 certified were installed in october 2018 and in november 2019 2 1 2 field sampling events after regular school day usage filtered and unfiltered taps were flushed at 1500 1800 ml min for 5 min or the equivalent of 10 filter volumes to flush out whatever accumulated in the filter during stagnation next pre stagnation samples were collected from all eight sampling sites water stagnated in the filters for periods ranging from 14 5 h overnight and 62 5 h over the weekend to 134 5 h thanksgiving break and 230 5 h spring break post stagnation samples were collected from all eight sites immediately after the stagnation period there was no flushing directly prior to post stagnation sample collection these steps flushing sample collection stagnation and another sample collection were repeated a total of nine times such that nine pre stagnation and nine post stagnation samples from each of the eight sampling sites were collected at each of the sampling sites pre stagnation and post stagnation samples were collected in sterilized high density polyethylene hdpe bottles when sampling between march 2019 and august 2019 a total of 2 25 l was collected from each site four separate consecutive 250 ml samples were collected followed by two separate 500 ml samples followed by a final 250 ml sample for samples collected after august 2019 a total of 4 l was collected from each site a 250 ml sample was collected followed by a 3750 ml sample the change in method was made after the concentration of dna in samples from the 2 25 l method was determined to be too low for detection by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr both methods included a separate 250 ml first draw sample 2 1 3 field sample measurements we

chlorine for the 4 l method two 10 ml aliquots were taken from the 1st 250 ml sample to measure residual free and total chlorine the collection method had no significant effect on the chlorine measurements p 0 195 to measure bacterial dna the first 2 l 2 25 l method and the first 4 l 4 l method were pooled together as shown in fig 1 and passed through a sterile 0 22 µm polyethersulfone or

pneumophila l pneumophila pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa and mycobacterium spp table s1 text s1 these specific bacteria were targeted because of their previously reported prevalence in drinking water distribution systems and their abilities to break through pou filters chaidez and gerba 2004 falkinham 2010 falkinham et al 2015 geldreich et al 1985 molloy et al 2007 wu et al 2017 2021 blank

measurements are referred to as particles instrument background noise was minimized by rinsing the instrument with 10 bleach followed by filtered 0 22 µm distilled water in between each sample for the 2 25 l method 1 ml aliquots were taken from each of the first four 250 ml samples and the next two 500 ml samples for the 4 l method 1 ml aliquots were taken from the 1st 250 ml sample and the 2nd 3750 ml sample at a final concentration of 0 1 mm na2s2o3 fisher scientific was added to 1 ml aliquots before incubating samples at 37 c for 10 min samples were stained with 10 µl ml of 100x sybr green invitrogen and incubated in the dark for at least 10 min particle measurements were performed within 6 h of sample collection temperature was measured at the collection site from the final 250 ml sample for the 2 25 l method and the 1st 250 ml sample for the 4 l method sample ph was measured with an orion 2 star ph meter thermoscientific and toc was measured with a toc vcph analyzer shimadzu for the 2 25 l method the final 250 ml sample was used for measuring ph and the 1st 250 ml sample was used for measuring toc for the 4 l method the 2nd 3750 ml sample was used for measuring both ph and toc 2 2 laboratory based pou filter evaluation we performed three sets of experiments under controlled test conditions in the laboratory to complement our findings from the field tap water was passed through three replicate filters used for each test condition 1 low pb low bacteria new filters tap only 2 high pb low bacteria new filters loaded with pb tap pb and 3 low pb high bacteria year old used filters with biofilm tap biofilm all filters were of the same brand and model as those used in the preschool tracer tests were performed on all nine filters to determine the volume of the filter pores and filter cartridge figure s1 table s3 filters had an average volume of 800 ml 2 2 1 loading filters with pb to prepare the filters for the tap pb condition three new filters each received 10 l of a solution containing 2500 µg l of dissolved pb provided by pb no3 2 in ultrapure water particulate pb was not used in this laboratory setup because we did not have information about the particulate pb forms and the ratio of dissolved pb to particulate pb from the field the ph of the solution was kept at 5 1 to prevent precipitation of pb the 10 l solution was delivered in 10 increments of 1 l for every 1 l increment 1 l of 2500 µg l dissolved pb solution was pumped through a filter no other water chemistry parameters were adjusted this solution was supplied to the filter by a peristaltic pump at 5 ml min and all of the filtered effluent was collected the pb concentrations in the influent tank and effluent tank were monitored at the beginning and end of each 1 l increment figure s2 the masses of pb loaded onto the filters are listed in table s4 2 2 2 promoting further biofilm growth in year old filters for the tap biofilm condition three filters from the preschool were collected after one year of regular usage drained stored at 4 c for one year and then set up in the laboratory at room temperature in addition to any biofilm that had accumulated during the filters regular usage groundwater containing 10 mg l as sio2 sodium metasilicate was used to promote further biofilm growth in the filters huang et al 2020 biofilm grew from the indigenous microbial community and relied on organic matter present in the groundwater and adsorbed onto the filter s carbon surface for growth the groundwater silicate mixture was pumped through each of the filters at 120 ml min low shear conditions were used to supply the filters with the nutrient mixture without disturbing the existing biofilms horn et al 2003 rittman 1982 the filters were left to sit in a loosely sealed container filled with the groundwater silicate mixture for two months high concentrations of bacteria released from these year old filters support the presence of biofilm see results 3 3 2 2 3 laboratory sampling events for all three test conditions the sampling events were the same only the filters differed the laboratory faucet was flushed for 15 20 min to reach a steady ph and concentrations of chlorine and bacteria figure s3 the alkalinity and ph of the laboratory tap water were consistent with those reported by the drinking water treatment plant and the ph measured at the preschool each of the three replicate filters was connected to the laboratory faucet and flushed at 1500 ml min for 5 min the filters were detached and a 250 ml sample was collected from the influent faucet the filters were reattached and pre stagnation samples made up of four separate consecutive 250 ml samples were collected from each filter filters were then disconnected and left to sit at room temperature for 14 5 h the same length of time used for overnight stagnation at the preschool after the stagnation period the influent faucet was flushed for 15 20 min without flushing the filters a 250 ml sample from the influent faucet was collected and then post stagnation samples of four separate 250 ml samples were collected from each filter the flow rate of each filter was consistently 1500 ml min sixteen samples eight pre stagnation eight post stagnation from each of the three replicates under each filter test condition were collected 2 2 4 laboratory sampling measurements the 1st 250 ml sample was used to measure free chlorine and ph in all samples pb was measured in a selection of the influent samples and in the 1st 250 ml filtered samples from the second tap pb and third tap biofilm test conditions a flow cytometer sysmex partec that could distinguish bacteria from other particles was used to measure concentrations of total and intact bacteria in all 250 ml samples the free chlorine ph and pb measurement methods were the same as those used in the field work flow cytometry samples were prepared by adding na2s2o3 fisher scientific at a final concentration of 0 1 mm to the 250 ml samples and then taking two separate 700 µl aliquots for total and intact cell measurements for total cell counts tcc samples were stained to a final concentration of 1x with sybr green invitrogen that had been diluted from 10 000x stock with tris hcl hammes et al 2008 nescerecka et al 2016 for intact cell counts icc samples were stained with a mixture of sybr green and propidium iodide invitrogen at final concentrations of 1x and 30 µm respectively berney et al 2008 samples were incubated in the dark for at least 10 min total and intact bacteria were enumerated via electronic gating the fl1 channel fitc and fl3 channel pe cy5 were used to measure green and red fluorescence and had gain settings of 500 and 700 respectively hammes et al 2008 in between each sample the flow cytometer was rinsed with ultrapure water until no background was detected in the electronic gating regions 2 3 data analysis data were analyzed using the statistical software r version 3 6 3 shapiro wilk tests were performed to determine the normality of the data two sample t tests and paired sample t tests were performed on normal data wilcoxon signed rank tests and wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed on non normal data statistical tests were performed at a significance level of α 0 05 data points with values below the lld were set to be one half the lld for the statistical tests table s2 3 results and discussion a summary of total pb free chlorine bacteria particles and ph data from the preschool is shown in table 1 statistical test results are shown in table s5 3 1 pb release in preschool and laboratory filters as shown in fig 2 a all samples from the unfiltered sites had total pb concentrations below the 5 µg l limit but of the 28 filtered samples 12 exceeded 5 µg l and pb concentrations in filtered samples were significantly greater than those in unfiltered samples p 1 04 10 3 of the 12 filtered samples exceeding 5 µg l 11 were from post stagnation samples and 10 were from the 250 ml first draw of post stagnation samples post stagnation filtered samples had higher total pb concentrations than pre stagnation filtered samples p 9 0 10 4 for comparison pb concentrations in unfiltered samples did not significantly increase with stagnation p 0 65 all of the post stagnation filtered samples exceeding 5 µg l were from the classroom sinks sites 1 3 in fig 2a which were installed in 2003 and had significantly higher pb concentrations than the post stagnation filtered samples from the drinking fountain site 4 in fig 2a which was installed in 2017 p 7 0 10 3 in post stagnation filtered samples total pb in the 1st 250 ml sample was higher than the total pb in the subsequent 2nd 250 ml or 2nd 3750 ml samples p 9 7 10 5 after new filters replaced year old used filters the same trends applied there was no significant difference between post stagnation filtered samples before and after filters were replaced p 0 104 the results from the laboratory on the effects of stagnation on pb concentrations in water leaving filters did not reflect those found in the field only three filtered samples exceeded 5 µg l and those samples all came from the first experiment performed after the tap pb filters were loaded with pb fig 2b the filters probably had not yet reached steady state and the pb release is unlikely to be attributable to the same reason as the high pb concentrations found in filtered sites at the preschool those high pb concentrations exceeded 1 5 times the interquartile range of the samples collected under the same test conditions and were deemed outliers under both test conditions for which pb was measured tap pb tap biofilm the pb in filter influent was significantly greater than the pb in filter effluent pre stagnation p 5 1 10 3 p 9 8 10 5 and post stagnation p 1 01 10 3 p 9 5 10 5 there was no significant difference between pb concentrations in filter effluent pre and post stagnation in the tap pb samples p 0 193 or in the tap biofilm samples p 0 57 these results indicate that the filters removed pb and that pb was not released into the stagnant water within the filter or washed out following an overnight stagnation period the discrepancies between the results from the field and the laboratory suggested that there may have been case specific issues occurring in the preschool the reduction of lead in drinking water act went into effect in 2014 decreasing the allowable percentage of pb in lead free components from 8 to 0 25 us 100th congress 1988 us 111th congress 2011 the plumbing components leading from the water supply to the drinking fountain including the plumbing within the fountain upstream and downstream of the filter were installed after this act while the plumbing systems in the classrooms were installed before it the drinking fountain consistently had pb levels below 5 µg l the high concentrations of pb in classroom sinks with pou filters were likely due to pb bearing plumbing components that were present downstream of the filter but were not present in the drinking fountain or the nearby bathroom sinks unfiltered sites this hypothesis is also supported by the lack of pb release from pou filters in the laboratory studies the low pb concentrations in unfiltered samples that did not significantly increase with stagnation and the continued pb release from classroom sinks with pou filters even after the preschool replaced the filters decreases in ph induced by the water s contact with the pou filters could also increase the dissolved pb the mean and median decrease in ph with stagnation was 0 1 0 3 ph units in filtered samples given this ph change the dissolved pb in equilibrium with the expected solubility controlling solid could increase by about 6 µg l figure s4a however when considering all changes in filter effluent ph with stagnation the maximum observed decrease of 0 7 ph units could result in increases of dissolved pb of up to 24 µg l figure s4b a significant contribution to the observed increases in pb following stagnation given the ph changes that were observed with stagnation at the preschool the dissolution of solid pb due to decreases in ph could be partially responsible for the observed increases in pb concentration following water stagnation in the pou filters figure s4c d our laboratory studies demonstrating the pou filter s effective removal of pb align with previous studies bosscher et al 2019 boyd et al 2005 deshommes et al 2012 2010 mulhern and macdonald gibson 2020 the findings that the filters continued to remove pb following stagnation in the laboratory is also in agreement with previous work deshommes et al 2012 2010 flushing unfiltered drinking fountains significantly decreases concentrations of pb in school drinking water murphy 1993 flushing the classroom sinks for 5 min before collecting the pre stagnation filtered samples likely decreased the pb in the water coming from the pb components downstream of the filters in classroom sinks previous studies have demonstrated that pou filters containing sbac can effectively remove dissolved pb deshommes et al 2012 2010 pan et al 2020 but may struggle to effectively remove particulate pb doré et al 2021 pan et al 2021 purchase et al 2021 formation of solid pb in water containing chlorine has been shown previously edwards and dudi 2004 lin and valentine 2009 in this study we did not distinguish between particulate and dissolved pb in the preschool samples collected between march 2019 and march 2020 we intended to do so after march 2020 but restrictions to preschool access made necessary by the covid 19 pandemic prevented further sampling based on previous knowledge we suggest that the formation of particulate pb may have been favorable possibly leading to decreases in the pou filter s overall pb removal efficiency after stagnation water usage in other parts of a building and sampling protocol can affect pb concentrations in sampled tap water triantafyllidou et al 2021 post stagnation samples were collected before anyone else entered the building making the former unlikely we collected a 250 ml first draw to assess pb concentrations immediately after stagnation although the plumbing configuration in the preschool could not be obtained calculations based on the length and diameter of the pipes suggest that the volume between the pou filter and the faucet is at most 50 ml the filter pore and cartridge volume is around 800 ml therefore the 250 ml first draw is composed of 50 ml of water from the pipe and another 200 ml of water from the filter the 2nd 250 ml comes from the filter and the 2nd 3750 ml comes from the filter and the premise plumbing upstream of the filter the preschool installed these filters with the intention of reducing pb exposure to young children unfortunately installing pou filters is not a complete solution and the system must be considered holistically while a complete replacement of the plumbing infrastructure may be unrealistic installing pou filters alone can be ineffective if pb bearing plumbing downstream of the filter releases pb into the drinking water if significant concentrations of pb are detected even after filter installation replacing plumbing downstream of the filter may be needed in cases where this is not affordable flushing the filter for 10 filter volumes or 5 min depending on flow rate can reduce these pb concentrations admittedly decreasing the lifespan of the filter in the process 3 2 cl removal in preschool and laboratory filters as shown in fig 3 a chlorine concentrations decreased with filtration and stagnation regardless of filter age higher chlorine concentrations in post stagnation unfiltered samples are associated with shorter stagnation periods free chlorine concentrations in filtered samples were lower than those in unfiltered samples p 1 22 10 12 filters decreased chlorine concentrations by 99 and most filtered samples regardless of stagnation had chlorine concentrations below the lld year old and new filters removed chlorine and there was no significant difference between filtered samples before and after new filters were installed p 0 48 in unfiltered samples over all stagnation periods there was an average 65 decrease in free chlorine concentrations p 8 7 10 8 which occurs when chlorine reacts with organic and inorganic compounds and biofilms deborde and von gunten 2008 xu et al 2018 chlorine removal results from the laboratory experiments agreed with those from the preschool regardless of test condition tap only tap pb tap biofilm the filters significantly removed chlorine p 3 5 10 27 decreasing chlorine concentrations by 99 fig 3b the findings that the pou filters in the preschool and laboratory remove chlorine aligns with previous studies reporting significant chlorine removal by pou filters containing activated carbon deshommes et al 2010 geldreich et al 1985 wu et al 2017 total chlorine was lower in filtered samples than in unfiltered samples p 2 7 10 8 but free chlorine was less than total chlorine in filtered samples p 7 4 10 6 this observation indicates that filters removed total chlorine but less efficiently than they removed free chlorine concurring with previous findings tobin et al 1981 the filter specifications recommend changing the filter annually and this study confirms that the filters effectively remove chlorine throughout the filter s one year lifetime under normal usage the pou filter s effective removal of residual disinfectant and disinfectant consumption during stagnation likely favored bacterial accumulation within and downstream of the filter 3 3 bacterial and particle release in preschool and laboratory filters there were no detectable concentrations of l pneumophila p aeruginosa or mycobacterium spp in the pre stagnation unfiltered or post stagnation filtered samples from the preschool this observation indicates that if any of these bacteria were present in the influent they were below detectable levels 10 copies µl table s2 and did not grow to concentrations above the detection limit in the filters during stagnation as shown in fig 4 total bacteria concentrations as quantified by qpcr for 16s rrna increased with filtration and with stagnation in filtered samples for both pre and post stagnation samples filtered samples had significantly more bacteria than unfiltered samples p 1 17 10 13 bacteria in filtered samples increased with stagnation p 3 2 10 5 while bacteria in unfiltered samples did not significantly change with stagnation p 0 46 the increases in bacterial concentrations with stagnation occurred in both year old filters p 2 5 10 2 and new filters p 8 6 10 3 comparing the classroom filtered bacteria data to the drinking fountain filtered bacteria data we find that there is no significant difference between the two p 0 56 even after separating by stagnation there was still no significant difference p 0 05 similarly flow cytometry results showed the concentration of particles 0 1 50 µm increased with filtration p 1 09 10 24 and with stagnation in filtered samples p 1 51 10 6 a 5 minute flush preceded the collection of pre stagnation filtered samples which had lower bacteria and particle concentrations than post stagnation filtered samples the 250 ml first draw had a significantly higher concentration of particles than the subsequent 2nd 250 ml samples p 3 9 10 2 or 2nd 3750 ml samples p 1 53 10 5 changing the filter also helped decrease bacteria in filter effluent as evidenced by significantly higher bacterial concentrations in year old filter samples than in new filter samples p 3 0 10 5 the total and intact cell counts tcc icc from the laboratory tests agreed with the findings from the field fig 5 under all three test conditions tcc and icc increased with filtration p 0 05 the tcc and icc increased with stagnation in the filtered samples from the tap pb and tap biofilm conditions p 0 05 under the first test condition tap only the icc significantly increased with stagnation in filtered samples p 4 9 10 3 but the tcc did not p 0 49 for comparison the influent concentrations of total and intact cells were steady figure s3c and did not change significantly with stagnation p 0 05 for all test conditions the total and intact bacterial cells were significantly higher in the 1st 250 ml of filter effluent than in the 2nd 250 ml regardless of stagnation p 0 05 the old filters from the tap biofilm condition had significantly higher total and intact bacterial releases than the new filters from the tap only condition p 0 05 and the new filters from the tap pb condition p 0 05 some studies have reported breakthrough of l pneumophila p aeruginosa and mycobacterium spp for filters where tap water spiked with a challenge organism was provided as the influent geldreich et al 1985 molloy et al 2007 wu et al 2021 or in filters fed with unmodified tap water chaidez and gerba 2004 falkinham 2010 wu et al 2017 given the undetectable concentrations of these microorganisms in the unfiltered samples from the preschool these microorganisms may not have been present in high enough concentrations to accumulate in the filters and break through to detectable concentrations in filter effluent in addition there are likely to be more complicated microbial colonization processes and biofilm interactions in real world situations than in tap water spiked with pure pathogenic culture these differences could also impact the prevalence and relative abundance of pathogenic microorganisms and the probability of filter breakthrough seeing the same trends in the laboratory and the preschool using two different methods for total bacterial quantification suggests that the results from the preschool were not isolated events the observed increases in bacteria with filtration and stagnation are also in agreement with previous results chaidez and gerba 2004 nriagu et al 2018 tobin et al 1981 wu et al 2017 during regular usage interception could allow some bacteria and other particles to accumulate in the filter while others pass through the filter entirely during stagnation some bacteria and particles likely diffuse into the stagnant water that then get washed out after stagnation the shear forces from the sudden use of the filter following stagnation could mobilize the loose bacteria and particles from the filter s sbac surface resulting in further bacterial and particle release into the filter effluent in year old filters there is another source of bacteria that can be released into the filter effluent biofilm bacteria bacteria can detach from a mature ripened biofilm and bacteria can slough off a biofilm s surface under the shear forces when the filter is used after stagnation shear forces could mobilize bacteria that are in the early stages of biofilm attachment and are not yet secured to the sbac surface however it is unlikely that the formation of a biofilm and subsequent release of biofilm bacteria contributed significantly to the bacteria released after a stagnation period as short as overnight previous studies on biofilm growth using groundwater in illinois reported that it took several months to grow and form stable biofilms huang et al 2020 janjaroen et al 2013 and our ongoing research confirmed this although the preschool installed pou filters to remove pb an unintended consequence of these filters is their removal of chlorine and resulting amplification of bacterial release flushing a filtered faucet for 10 filter volumes or 5 min depending on flow rate can decrease the concentration of bacteria in filtered tap water 3 4 changes in ph temperature and toc with filtration and stagnation the ph in the preschool drinking water ranged from 7 5 to 9 0 and had equal mean and median values of 8 6 the minimum ph of 7 5 is an outlier from a filtered sample and the ph was mostly steady with a standard deviation of 0 2 ph units in the preschool the ph decreased with filtration p 1 17 10 8 and with stagnation in filtered samples p 5 6 10 5 matching the findings from the preschool the ph in laboratory tests also significantly decreased with filtration p 1 88 10 9 and with stagnation in filtered samples p 6 7 10 10 these results match a previous study s finding in which ph decreased after passing through pour through activated carbon pou filters deshommes et al 2010 the median differences between filtered and unfiltered samples and between the pre stagnation filtered and post stagnation filtered samples were 0 1 0 3 ph units as noted above these decreases in ph could partially explain the increase in pb concentrations based on the predicted solubility of a pb hydroxycarbonate that could be the solubility controlling solid figure s4 the drinking water treatment plant does not add corrosion inhibitors and relies on alkalinity and ph to minimize the amount of pb released into the drinking water while this method was sufficient for the unfiltered bathroom sinks the classroom sinks that likely had pb bearing components still released pb into the drinking water preschool sample temperatures ranged from 9 5 c to 27 c and had mean and median values of 18 c and 19 c respectively temperature varied slightly with season and increased with stagnation in both filtered p 3 4 10 7 and unfiltered p 2 7 10 16 samples possibly affecting bacterial growth nap 2006 the concentration of toc in the preschool ranged from non detect below 0 5 mg c l to 4 1 mg c l and had an average of 2 0 mg c l although ph temperature and toc can influence pb solubility chlorine decay and bacterial growth it is unlikely that the small differences in these parameters had major impacts on the performance of the pou filters in the preschool or laboratory 4 conclusions in this study we expanded beyond existing literature to investigate the effectiveness of installing pou filters following stagnation of water within the filter in both the field and laboratory their ability to protect the most vulnerable and the tradeoffs and unintended consequences associated with adding pou filters to a premise plumbing system installing pou filters alone did not completely achieve the preschool s goal to remove pb because classroom sinks likely had pb bearing plumbing components downstream of the filter that released pb into the drinking water replacing pb bearing plumbing components removes pb at the source and should be considered for any plumbing downstream of a pou filter in addition the pou filters contain sbac which effectively removes the disinfectant free chlorine throughout the filters lifetime thereby allowing bacteria to accumulate and biofilms to develop over time although l pneumophila p aeruginosa and mycobacterium spp were not detected in the preschool the increase of total bacteria in the filter effluent following filtration and stagnation periods as short as overnight may have concerning public health implications if pathogenic bacteria were to be present in the influent the health risk from pathogenic bacteria released from pou filters has yet to be quantified and is a subject of our current research a method of addressing unintended consequences of pou installation on bacteria accumulation and downstream pb concentrations is flushing the pou filters following stagnation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16311,bacterial removal by sand filtration system is commonly inefficient due to the low bacterial adsorption capacity of sand to improve the bacterial removal performance biochar fabricated at different temperatures 400 c 550 c and 700 c and arginine modified biochar were added into sand filtration columns as filter layers 0 5 and 1 wt addition of biochar into sand columns could improve the removal efficiency for both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis under both slow 4 m day and fast 240 m day filtration conditions bacterial removal efficiency in sand columns with the addition of biochar fabricated at 700 c were higher than those fabricated at 400 c and 550 c due to its best bacterial adsorption capacity modification of biochar with arginine could further improve the bacterial removal performance specifically complete bacterial removal 1 35 107 10 cells ml could be achieved under both slow and fast filtration conditions in sand columns with 1 wt arginine functionalized biochar amendment the enhanced bacterial adsorption capacity mainly contributed to the increased bacterial capture performance in columns with addition of arginine modified biochar bacteria more tightly bounded with arginine modified biochar than bulk biochar moreover complete bacterial removal with the copresence of 5 mg l humic acid in suspensions was acquired in columns with addition of 1 wt arginine modified biochar efficient bacterial removal in actual river water multiple filtration cycles as well as longtime injection duration 100 pore volumes injection was also obtained the results of this study demonstrated that arginine modified biochar had great potential to treat water contaminated by pathogenic bacteria graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bacterial

irrigation water has been a global threat to human health garvey et al 2016 mashe et al 2021 sher et al 2021 the report of world health organization who showed that diarrhoea caused by unsafe drinking water contaminated by pathogenic bacteria would lead to 829 000 deaths of people per year who 2019 great efforts thus have been devoted to removing pathogenic bacteria from water okaikue woodi et al 2020 ramchander et al 2021 wang et al 2021 different types of technologies such as sand filtration napotnik et al 2021 nilsson et al 2013 rambags et al 2019 adsorption fang et al 2016 2017 jin et al 2014 membrane bioreactor fujioka and boivin 2020 fujioka et al 2018 zhang and farahbakhsh 2007 advanced oxidation process ding et al 2019 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2012 have been employed to remove pathogenic bacteria from water due to easy operation and low cost sand filtration is the most feasible and commonly employed technique to capture pathogen from water however the bacterial removal efficiency by sand filtration system is often limited because of the low bacterial adsorption capacity of sand rahman et al 2020 hence it is imperative to improve the bacterial removal performance of sand filtration system as a wide sourced and low cost material with high adsorption capacity biochar has been widely applied for water soil contamination remediation oliveira et al 2017 wang et al 2020 zou et al 2021 a few studies have investigated the bacterial removal performance in biochar amended sand columns and found that addition of biochar into column filtration systems could improve bacterial removal efficiency abit et al 2012 guan et al 2020 guo et al 2021 mohanty and boehm 2014 2015 sasidharan et al 2016 these studies have mainly attributed the enhanced bacterial removal in biochar amended sand columns to the higher bacterial adsorption capacity of biochar relative to sand due to the presence of attractive forces such as hydrophobic and steric interactions the improved bacterial attachment by straining due to the rougher surface and irregular shape of biochar than sand as well as the alteration in the bacterial zeta potentials resulted from the change of solution chemistry by the addition of biochar it is worth pointing out that these previous researches were conducted at slow filtration conditions with flow rates typically at serval m day note that in addition to slow flow rate fast flow velocity with filtration rate in the range of 120 2040 m day based on american water work association edzwald 2010 is also commonly employed in sand filter process in drinking water sewage treatment plants with increasing flow velocities the bacterial retention removal in porous media would be inhibited bradford et al 2006 yu et al 2019 the bacterial removal efficiencies in sand columns with biochar amendment at high flow conditions thus would be lowered however the bacterial removal performance in biochar amended sand columns at fast filtration condition e g a few hundred m day has not been examined thus requires investigation although the previous studies have concluded that biochar could improve bacterial removal from seeded deionized water or synthetic stormwater it is not clear whether biochar could efficiently capture bacteria from actual river water that contains different types of cations anions as well as natural organic matter nom moreover most of previous studies commonly mixed biochar with a doping ratio and sand as the filter media to remove bacteria yet it is not easy to recollect recover the biochar from the sand columns after their use it would be easier to recover biochar if they were used as porous media layer very recent study guan et al 2020 showed that when biochar was added into column as filter layer 10 cm biochar layer total sand column 60 cm the bacterial e coli removal efficiency in biochar amended columns yet was lower than that in sand columns without biochar amendment to improve the bacterial removal performance in sand columns it is necessary to modify the biochar e g to increase the bacterial adsorption capacity that added into columns different methods such as acid alkali modification metal oxide loading and oxidant functionalization have been previously employed to modify biochar to improve their removal performance of heavy metals organic contaminants and microplastic particles ding et al 2016 inyang and dickenson 2015 tong et al 2020 due to its strong positive charged side chains and high isoelectric point pi 10 76 zhang et al 2014 l arginine arg one of the natural amino acids has the capability of binding with bacteria and thus has been previously employed to modify fe3o4 particles to improve their bacterial capture performance jin et al 2014 it is expected that biochar modified by arginine would also have the improved bacterial capture capability however to the best of our knowledge arg modified biochar has not been fabricated and has not been employed for bacterial removal especially be used as filter medium in sand filtration system in this study biochar and arg modified biochar were fabricated and well characterized biochar modified biochar was then added into sand column as filter layer to remove both escherichia coli e coli typical gram negative bacteria and bacillus subtilis b subtilis typical gram positive bacteria since cellulose the major component of plants also the major solid wastes from paper production industry is one of the most popular biomass employed to fabricate biochar nanda et al 2016 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 cellulose based biochar was considered in present study previous studies abit et al 2012 bolster and abit 2012 have shown that pyrolysis condition would affect the physical and chemical properties of biochar which would then influence the bacterial adsorption capacity of biochar three types of biochar synthesized at different temperature were employed in this study particularly the effects of pyrolysis temperature and application rate of biochar on the removal of bacteria were investigated under both slow and fast filtration velocity conditions the bacterial removal mechanisms of biochar and arg modified biochar were systematically explored nom widely present in natural waters would adsorb onto biochar surfaces and decreased the sites for bacterial adsorption lowering the bacterial removal in biochar amended sand columns mohanty et al 2014 the bacterial removal performance of biochar and arg modified biochar amended columns with the presence of different concentrations of humic acid major component of nom ranging from 0 2 to 5 mg l were also investigated in present study in addition bacterial removal performance by the biochar arg modified biochar amended sand columns in actual river water in multiple filtration cycles as well as longtime filtration process 100 pore volumes were also testified 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of biochar and arginine modified biochar by heating cellulose 50 μm purchased from j k scientific cas 9004 34 6 under oxygen limited conditions in a muffle furnace at 400 c 550 c and 700 c for 6 h three types of biochar were synthesized yang et al 2016 which were named as 400bc 550bc and 700bc respectively the average size of 400bc 550bc and 700bc was 15 12 15 42 and 15 98 μm respectively fig s1 to prepare arginine modified biochar 5 g 700bc was added into a 300 ml conical flask containing 250 ml 10 g l arginine solution and then stirred for 3 h at room temperature following that the composites were collected by vacuum filtration and washed with ultrapure water for three times to remove excess arginine subsequently arginine modified 700bc was obtained after the drying process at 60 c for 12 h the composites named as 700mbc were stored in a vacuum drier for future use the reason why we add arginine modified biochar instead of physical mixture of arginine and biochar into sand columns to remove bacteria was provided in supplementary materials different techniques including scanning electron microscopy sem atomic force microscopy afm powder x ray diffraction xrd analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir brunauer emmette teller bet adsorption isotherms elemental analysis ea and thermogravimetric analysis tga were utilized to characterize the biochar modified biochar the zeta potentials as well as the contact angles of biochar modified biochar materials were measured detailed characterization methods can be found in supplementary materials 2 2 bacterial preparation a gram negative strain of e coli and a gram positive strain of b subtilis were utilized as the representative bacteria to investigate the bacterial removal performance in columns with biochar arginine modified biochar amendment before the transport and batch experiments the concentration of influent bacterial suspensions was adjusted to be 1 35 107 10 cells ml by diluting the initial bacterial stock solution contains approximate 109 1010 cells ml the bacterial concentration was counted by using a counting chamber buerker tuerk chamber marienfeld laboratory glassware germany with an inverted fluorescent ti e microscope nikon japan under a bright field more details on cell growth harvesting and concentration determination are provided in the supplementary materials 2 3 column experiments the cleaned quartz sand 250 420 μm ultrapure with 99 8 sio2 was used as model porous media and wet packed into cylindrical plexiglas column with 10 cm length and 2 cm inner diameter to improve the bacterial removal performance of sand filtration system a certain weight of biochar modified biochar was inserted into the porous media to form layer of filtration media in the middle of column the application rates of biochar modified biochar were defined as the mass ratio of biochar to dry sand which was set as 0 5 wt 0 22 cm height depth or 1 wt 0 44 cm height depth in present study the diagrams of column devices are shown in fig s2 the detailed sand cleaning and column packing procedures can be found in the supplementary materials for the typical bacterial removal experiments with fully saturated porous media after pre equilibrated the column with sterile background electrolyte solution 10 pore volumes pvs 1 pv equals to 13 ml slight different for columns without with biochar amendment 5 mm nacl ph 6 3 pvs bacterial suspensions 1 35 107 10 cells ml 5 mm nacl ph 6 were injected to the columns in up flow mode using a syringe pump harvard phd 2000 harvard apparatus inc holliston usa which was then followed by elution with 5 pvs sterile background salt solution during the removal experiments effluent samples at desired interval time were collected in sterilized centrifuge tubes the concentrations of bacteria in all effluent samples were determined to obtain the breakthrough curves btcs the pore velocities were set as 4 m day and 240 m day to simulate the representative fluid rate of slow filtration and fast filtration during the water treatment process respectively edzwald 2010 the hydraulic residence time hrt of the column system at 4 and 240 m day was 0 60 h and 0 01 h respectively for selected experiments the layer of biochar modified biochar was replaced by fine quartz sand with the same particle size as biochar to determine the contribution to bacteria removal by the changes of local flow path and grain to grain contacts back flush experiments were conducted to determine whether bacteria were loosely bounded with sand biochar modified biochar detailed information about back flush was provided in the supplementary materials moreover the influence of natural organic matter on the bacterial removal performance was investigated by adding humic acid ha with concentrations of 0 2 mg l 1 mg l and 5 mg l into the bacterial influent suspensions the bacterial removal performance in actual river water during three transport elution cycles as well as during the longtime injection process was also testified details can be found in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of biochar and arginine modified biochar xrd ftir tga sem ea and bet were employed to characterize biochar and arginine modified biochar the detailed results are provided in supplementary information the main results from characterization showed that the pyrolysis temperature could affect the property characteristic of biochar moreover biochar has been successfully modified by arginine zeta potential measurements showed that all three bulk biochar were negatively charged in 5 mm nacl solutions at ph 6 table s1 moreover zeta potentials became less negative with increasing charring temperature due to the decline or loss of negatively charged functional groups on the surface such as cooh at higher temperature coating the positively surface charged arginine on biochar decreased the negative zeta potential from 19 8 2 0 mv of 700bc to 8 9 3 6 mv of 700mbc the contact angles of bulk and modified biochar showed no significant difference table s2 indicating the similar hydrophobicity of bulk and arginine modified biochar 3 2 bacterial removal in sand columns with biochar modified biochar amendment without addition of biochar into sand columns the removal efficiencies for both types of cells at slow filtration condition were low as indicated by the high breakthrough curves of e coli 99 2 and b subtilis 79 1 in saturated quartz sand columns at the pore velocity of 4 m day fig 1 table s3 the low bacterial removal efficiencies by sand columns were consistent with classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory fig s3a and b with the addition of 0 5 wt biochar as permeable filter barrier in the middle of sand columns the percentages of bacteria both e coli and b subtilis passing through the column greatly decreased fig 1a and b table s3 for example the breakthrough percentage of e coli decreased from 99 2 without biochar to 44 7 36 1 and 27 8 at the pore velocity of 4 m day with the addition of 0 5 wt biochar synthesized at 400 c 550 c and 700 c respectively the observation indicated that the addition of bulk biochar layer in sand columns could enhance the removal of bacteria in slow filtration system increasing the mass percentage of biochar to 1 wt could further increase the bacterial both e coli and b subtilis removal efficiencies in columns fig 1c and d specifically the breakthrough percentages of e coli were 13 7 7 5 and 1 0 in the columns with 1 wt application rates of 400bc 550bc and 700bc respectively the percentages of b subtilis passed through the columns also decreased to 4 7 0 6 and 0 8 when the addition mass rate of 400bc 550bc and 700bc increased to 1 wt respectively fig 1 table s3 portion of bacteria both cell types could still pass through the sand column with addition of even 1wt of 400bc at the flow rate of 4 m day the addition of 1 wt 550bc into columns yet could retain vast majority of e coli 92 5 and almost all of b subtilis 99 4 in contrast almost all bacteria both e coli and b subtilis could be retained in sand columns with addition of 1 wt 700bc at 4 m day the above observations showed that for both types of cells 700bc biochar fabricated 700 c exhibited the best bacterial removal performance relative to 400bc and 500bc the relatively stronger inhibition of bacterial transport by biochar fabricated at higher temperature has also been reported previously abit et al 2012 sasidharan et al 2016 moreover increasing the amount of 700bc to 1 wt could retain almost all bacteria for both types in sand columns in slow filtration system in addition to slow flow rate fast flow velocity is also commonly employed in water treatment process especially the sand filter process in drinking water sewage treatment plant previous studies have shown that bacterial retention in sand columns would be inhibited by increasing flow rates bradford et al 2006 yu et al 2019 to testify bacterial removal efficiencies in sand columns with filter layers consisting of 400bc 550bc and 700bc under fast filtration condition transport experiments of both e coli and b subtilis were conducted in sand columns with addition of 0 5 wt and 1 wt biochar at the flow rate of 240 m day almost all bacteria both e coli and b subtilis passed through the sand column without addition of biochar at high flow rate fig 2 the observation indicated that fast sand filtration system was ineffective to remove bacteria similar to slow flow rate addition of biochar into sand columns could also increase the removal of bacteria in fast filtration system as indicated by the lower breakthrough curve plateaus of both gram negative and gram positive bacteria with addition of biochar in sand columns relative to those without biochar addition fig 2 the cell removal efficiencies by the columns with addition of biochar still followed the order of 700bc 550bc 400bc at fast filtration velocity which further confirmed that biochar fabricated at high temperature exhibited the best bacterial adsorption performance consistent with low flow rate further increasing the addition rates of biochar to 1 wt could also promote the removal percentages of bacteria both e coli and b subtilis at high flow rate fig 2c and d specifically with the addition ratio of biochar increased from 0 5 wt to 1 wt the breakthrough percentages of e coli under fast filtration velocity for columns with 400bc 550bc and 700bc decreased from 79 0 58 0 and 46 1 to 54 6 45 4 and 30 0 respectively and those of b subtilis decreased from 73 4 63 5 and 36 4 to 52 2 39 8 and 20 8 respectively table s3 it is worth pointing out that even for columns with addition of 1 wt 700bc 20 bacteria could still pass through the columns the observation indicated that although the addition of biochar into sand columns could enhance the bacterial capture efficiencies yet their bacterial removal performance should be further improved especially at high flow rates arginine a ubiquitous natural amino acid that has high isoelectric point was utilized to modify biochar in order to further enhance the bacterial capture performance since biochar fabricated at 700 c 700bc exhibited the best bacterial removal performance 700bc thus was modified by arginine and the modified biochar was named as 700mbc the addition of 700mbc into sand columns as a layer of filtration medium could greatly improve the bacterial removal efficiencies although 27 7 of e coli could pass through the column with addition of 0 5 wt 700bc fig 1a diamond yet 100 of e coli were captured in columns with addition of 0 5 wt 700mbc at flow velocity 4 m day as indicated by the negligible breakthrough of e coli fig 3 a upward triangle similarly negligible b subtilis passed the column with 0 5 wt 700mbc fig 3b upward triangle despite that 10 4 b subtilis passed through the column with 0 5 wt 700bc fig 1b diamond under slow filtration condition the bacterial capture efficiencies at high flow rate of 240 m day fast flow filtration condition by the addition of 0 5 wt 700mbc in porous media were also greatly improved fig 3c and d upward triangle specifically at filtration velocity of 240 m day the percentage of e coli passing through the columns decreased from 46 1 in 0 5 wt 700bc amended columns to 12 4 in columns with 0 5 wt 700mbc amendment similarly the percentage of b subtilis exiting from the columns decreased from 36 4 with addition of 0 5 wt 700bc to 9 3 with addition of the same amount of 700mbc clearly modification of biochar with arginine could improve the bacterial capture efficiency with the addition of 1 wt 700mbc into sand columns nearly complete capture of both e coli and b subtilis could be achieved at both low and high flow rates fig 3 downward triangle the above results showed that 700mbc could be used as efficient filter media for the removal of bacteria both gram negative and gram positive bacteria under both slow and fast filtration conditions 3 3 mechanisms for the enhanced bacterial removal by biochar modified biochar 3 3 1 contribution by the changes in effluent properties previous studies have shown that the addition of biochar into sand soil systems would slightly change the effluent solution chemistry abit et al 2012 bolster and abit 2012 to verify whether the introduction of biochar into the sand columns would change the column effluent properties both influent and effluent solutions of the columns without and with the addition of 1 wt biochar either bulk or modified were collected after the pre equilibration by 5 pvs sterile background solutions prior to the injection of bacterial suspensions for sand columns without addition of biochar the effluent solution chemistry was nearly identical as that of influent as indicated by the negligible difference of ph conductivities and metal ions concentrations k ca2 mg2 and mn cations between influent and effluent collected from sand columns table s4 the observation indicated that the solution chemistry did not change during passing through the quartz sand columns the addition of 700bc or 700mbc in sand columns did not change the effluent solution ph and the concentration of mn cations yet slightly increase concentrations of ions including k ca2 and mg2 thus the solution conductivity correspondingly increased the zeta potentials of bacteria during their transport processes in biochar modified biochar amendment columns might be changed which would influence bacterial transport behaviors in porous media zeta potentials of bacteria both e coli and b subtilis in effluents from columns without quartz sand amendment were similar with those in influents while bacterial zeta potentials in effluents from columns with addition of 700bc were less negative than those in influents table s5 noting complete removal of bacteria was achieved in columns with addition of 700mbc bacterial zeta potentials in effluents from columns with 700mbc thus could not be determined due to the absence of bacteria the less repulsive interaction force between bacteria and porous media would be expected in columns with biochar addition fig s3a and b which theoretically supported the higher bacterial removal efficiencies in columns with 700bc or 700mbc amended relative to those without biochar amendment previous studies also found that the changes in properties of effluents affected the transport and deposition of colloids in porous media guan et al 2020 tong et al 2020 it should be noted that solution chemistry including ph conductivity as well as metal ions concentration in effluent from 700mbc amended column were similar with those from column amended with 700bc yet the bacterial capture efficiencies in 700mbc amended column were greater than those in column amended with 700bc clearly other mechanisms also contributed to the enhanced bacterial removal by arginine modified biochar 3 3 2 contribution by the decreasing of porosity changing of porous media porosity would affect the transport behaviors of colloids reducing porosity inhibited colloidal transport peulen and wilkinson 2011 zhang et al 2021 to testify whether the addition of biochar in columns would alter the porosity of porous media the porosities of sole sand column as well as 0 5 wt and 1 wt biochar amended columns were determined detailed process can be found in supplement materials the porosity of quartz sand columns without biochar was 0 424 0 005 while the porosity of biochar layer was 0 232 0 102 the porosity of sand columns with 0 5 wt biochar and with 1 wt biochar thus decreased to 0 419 0 004 and 0 414 0 003 respectively the slightly decreased porosity of sand columns with the addition of biochar might increase the retention of bacteria by the increase of narrow flow channels and grain to grain contacts in the layer of biochar to determine the contribution of the slightly decreased porosity by the addition of biochar to the enhanced bacteria removal obtained in biochar amended columns fine quartz sand with the same particle size and the same thickness of biochar was used to replace the biochar layer in the amended column the interesting observation is that the breakthrough curves of bacteria both e coli and b subtilis in columns with the addition of fine sand were lower than those in quartz sand columns without amendment fig 4 a and b table s6 unlike the nearly 100 breakthrough of both types of bacteria in columns without amendment the percentages of bacteria broke through the columns with a layer of fine sand decreased to 85 for both types of cells in 5 mm nacl solutions under fast filtration condition as representative the observation suggested that decreasing local porosity of columns by replacing the normal sand with fine sand could increase the retention of bacteria previous studies have found that the amount of narrow flow channels as well as grain to grain contacts would be increased via the decrease of porosity resulted from the decreasing porous media sizes which thus would increase the retention of colloids in porous media tong et al 2008 zhang et al 2021 clearly more narrow flow channels and grain to grain contacts would be present in fine sand layer relative to those without addition of biochar which would cause the greater deposition of bacteria via straining previous studies also reported that straining of bacteria at small pores contributed to the bacterial removal in biochar amended columns abit et al 2012 bolster and abit 2012 mohanty et al 2014 thus it is reasonable for us to deduce that the enhanced bacterial removal via the addition of biochar modified biochar would be partially contributed by the enhanced straining effect via the increase of small pores e g grain to grain contacts and narrow flow channels resulted from the smaller biochar sizes relative to quartz sand however the bacterial removal efficiencies in biochar modified biochar amended columns were greater than those in columns with fine sand amendment clearly other mechanisms would also contribute to the greater bacterial deposition in biochar modified biochar amended columns 3 3 3 contribution by adsorption onto biochar modified biochar surfaces previous studies have shown that biochar have great adsorption capacities towards pollutants qian et al 2016 shen et al 2019 tong et al 2020 the enhanced bacterial removal efficiencies by the biochar or arginine modified biochar amended columns might be also due to the stronger bacterial adsorption of biochar modified biochar relative to sand batch experiments were conducted to testify the adsorption capacities of both e coli and b subtilis by either quartz sand or biochar modified biochar in 5 mm nacl solutions at ph 6 after 4 h adsorption the adsorption factions of e coli and b subtilis by quartz sand were 1 4 and 3 1 respectively fig 4c and d the observation indicated that quartz sand could barely adsorb bacteria in contrast biochar modified biochar exhibited great bacterial adsorption capacities in batch experiments for example the adsorption percentages of e coli by 400bc 550bc 700bc were 36 3 44 6 and 63 3 respectively similar to e coli the adsorption capacity of b subtilis by biochar fabricated at different temperature was also in the order of 400bc 550bc 700bc it should be noted that the trends of bacterial adsorption capacities for biochar synthesized at different temperature agreed with the observation of bacterial removal obtained in columns with addition of biochar fabricated at different temperature figs 1 and 2 clearly the adsorption capacity of biochar had great influence on removal of bacteria in porous media moreover bacterial adsorption percentages by arginine modified biochar were greater than those by bulk biochar without modification which also explained the greater removal efficiencies acquired in columns with addition of modified biochar previous studies found that increasing porous media surface roughness would reduce the repulsive energy barrier between colloids and porous media resulting in the enhanced colloidal deposition jin et al 2017 rasmuson et al 2019 tong et al 2020 comparing with quartz sand fig s4a the surface of bulk biochar was relatively rougher and the roughness increased with the elevation of fabricated temperature fig s5d e and f afm measurement fig s6 further confirmed that biochar was rougher than quartz sand and increasing pyrolysis temperature would further increase the roughness of biochar specifically the root mean square values of surface roughness feature of quartz sand was 33 3 1 8 nm consistent with previous study 33 4 nm han et al 2016 while the corresponding values of 400bc 550bc and 700bc was 82 6 7 9 nm 127 0 11 1 nm and 187 7 4 2 nm respectively interaction energy between bacteria and sand biochar with the consideration of roughness was calculated details about calculation was provided in supplementary materials as expected the energy barrier between bacteria and sand biochar with the consideration of roughness was lower than that without consideration of roughness fig s3 moreover for both types of bacteria the energy barrier with different surfaces followed the order of 700bc 550bc 400bc sand with the consideration of roughness the observations could qualitatively explain the bacterial adsorption capacity trend of sand 400bc 550bc 700bc bet surface area of bulk biochar increased with increasing charring temperature table s7 which suggested that the available bacterial adsorption sites of biochar also followed the order of 400bc 550bc 700bc as a result greater bacterial removal efficiency in columns with amendment of biochar charring at higher temperature was achieved however comparing with that of 700bc 187 7 4 2 nm the root mean square value of surface roughness feature of 700mbc yet was slightly smaller 162 8 8 9 nm fig s6e moreover bet surface area of 700mbc was also slightly smaller than that of 700bc table s7 the observations indicated that the alteration in surface roughness and bet surface area due to the coating of arginine onto biochar surfaces could not theoretically explain the higher bacterial adsorption and removal capacity of 700mbc than 700bc clearly other mechanisms would contribute to the improved bacterial adsorption capacity of 700mbc under the experimental conditions the zeta potentials of both bulk and modified biochar were less negative relative to those of bare quartz sand table s1 which could result in lower repulsive force between bacteria both e coli and b subtilis that also showed surface electronegativity and bulk modified biochar than that between bacteria and quartz sand based on the dlvo theory without or with consideration of roughness fig s3 accordingly biochar either bulk or modified exhibited better adsorption capacity for bacteria than quartz sand fig 4c and d resulting in the high bacterial removal efficiency with the addition of biochar into sand columns moreover with the enhancement of pyrolysis temperature the zeta potential of biochar became less negative leading to lower repulsive force between bacteria and biochar the bacterial adsorption capacity of biochar thus increased with increasing biochar charring temperature leading to the larger bacterial removal efficiency in columns with addition of biochar fabricated at high temperature the zeta potential of arginine modified biochar 700mbc was less negative than that of 700bc table s1 the energy barrier between bacteria and 700mbc thus was lower than that between bacteria and 700bc fig s3 which theoretically supported the larger bacterial adsorption capacity of 700mbc and higher bacterial removal percentage in 700mbc amended column relative to 700bc without modification the increased deposition via the changing of porous media zeta potentials have also been observed for bacteria urfer 2017 plastic particles tong et al 2020 and engineering nanomaterials chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 sem images of 700bc fig s7a as well as 700mbc fig s7b collected from columns after bacterial transport experiments of e coli showed that bacteria deposited on the surfaces and cavities of biochar during their transport process to investigate whether bacteria were tightly bounded by biochar modified biochar backwashing experiments were conducted after the transport experiments of e coli and b subtilis in columns with 1 wt 700bc and 700mbc amended in 5 mm nacl solutions at ph 6 under fast filtration condition fig 4e and f backwashing experiments were also performed in column without biochar amendment as control since nearly 100 bacteria both e coli and b subtilis broke through sand columns without biochar amendment negligible bacteria were flushed out from the columns during backwashing process however 7 2 and 2 4 e coli were washed out from columns with amendment of 1 wt 700bc and 700mbc respectively based on the number of bacteria retained in the column after the original orientation elution similarly based on the amount of bacteria retained in columns 7 2 and 2 2 b subtilis were flushed out during the backwashing process in columns with addition of 1 wt 700bc and 700mbc respectively the observation indicated that in columns amended with 700bc and 700mbc small portions of e coli and b subtilis loosely deposited onto the surface of bulk and modified biochar which could be eluted out of columns by additional back flushing moreover for both e coli and b subtilis the percentages of bacteria washed out from 700bc amended columns were higher than those from columns with 700mbc amendment during the backwashing process obviously 700mbc could retain bacteria more tightly comparing with 700bc note that the portion of retained bacteria by straining would be not easily to elute from the columns by backwashing since the porosities of biochar and arg modified biochar amended columns were equivalent we presumed that the amount of bacteria deposited in the layer of biochar arg modified biochar by straining would be similar clearly the decreased energy barrier or less repulsive electrostatic force between bacteria and 700mbc relative to that between bacteria and 700bc fig s3 might lead to the tight attachment of bacteria in primary energy minima on 700mbc which could not be eluted out by backwashing and thus the percentage of bacteria washed out from 700mbc was lower 3 4 bacterial removal in simulated water with humic acid and actual river water nom is widely present in natural water as well in wastewater the bacterial removal performance with the copresence of nom in suspensions in columns both without and with biochar modified biochar amendment was examined since nearly 100 of both e coli and b subtilis passed through the column at the filtration velocity of 240 m day the presence of ha as representative nom regardless of its concentrations did not affect the removal of bacteria in sand columns fig s8 the presence of ha yet increased the transport and decreased the removal of e coli and b subtilis in columns with 1 wt 700bc at fast filter velocity fig 5 a and c table s8 moreover the percentages of bacterial removal in columns decreased with increasing ha concentrations from 0 2 to 5 mg l as indicated by the increasing breakthrough plateaus of both types of bacteria with increasing ha concentrations fig 5a and c table s8 by site competition and repelling deposition previous study also found that ha coexisting in suspensions could enhance the transport of bacteria in bare quartz sand yang et al 2012 nevertheless in the columns with amendment of 1 wt 700mbc negligible bacteria for both cell types with the copresence of ha in suspensions even at concentration of 5 mg l passed through the columns at filter velocity of 240 m day fig 5b and d the results clearly showed that regardless the presence of ha in suspensions the addition of 1 wt arginine modified 700bc into sand columns could 100 retain both types of cells even under fast filtration condition the bacterial removal performance in river water taken from xiaojiahe river beijing china was also examined the details and main physico chemical parameters of river water can be found in supplementary materials and table s9 100 of e coli and b subtilis could move through the sole sand columns in river water at filter velocity of 240 m day fig 5e and f circle which suggested that bacteria spiked in river water could not be removed by quartz sand 16 3 e coli and 4 6 b subtilis passed through the columns with the amendment of 1 wt 700bc under fast filtration condition fig 5e and f upward triangle table s10 the observation indicated that 700bc could remove large amount of bacteria from river water at fast velocity nearly complete removal of both types of cells from river water could be achieved in columns with addition of 1 wt 700mbc under fast filtration condition fig 5e and f downward triangle table s10 the above results clearly showed that arginine modified 700bc had great potential as filter media for bacterial removal in actual water treatment process 3 5 bacterial removal performance in multiple cycles and longtime injection process the bacterial removal efficiencies of 1 wt 700bc and 700mbc amended columns were investigated through three transport elution cycles under both slow and fast filtration conditions since e coli was more difficult to be removed than b subtilis figs 1 and 2 the former strain was chosen as representative cell for the cycle to cycle removal performance test in all three cycles under both slow and fast flow conditions 100 e coli could break through the sand columns without biochar amendment fig 6 a and b table s11 although negligible e coli passed through the columns with 1 wt 700bc amendment in all three cycles under slow flow rate condition yet portion of e coli passed through the columns with 1 wt 700bc amendment and the percentage of bacteria exiting these columns increasing from 34 7 in 1st cycle to 38 3 in 2nd cycle and 42 9 in 3rd cycle under fast filtration condition fig 6b increasing flow rate would increase hydrodynamic shear stress torkzaban et al 2015 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 bacteria breaking through columns with 1 wt 700bc at high flow rate thus was greater than those at low flow rate the increased percentages of bacteria passing through biochar amended columns with increasing filtration cycles suggested the sites onto biochar for subsequent bacterial deposition decreased with increasing bacterial deposition cycles and blocking occurred in these columns in contrast regardless under slow or fast flow rate conditions 100 removal percentages of e coli in all three filtration cycles were obtained in columns with 1 wt 700mbc amendment comparing with 700bc 700mbc with less negatively charged surfaces should have more positive sites for bacterial deposition the observations clearly showed that arginine modified biochar had great bacterial removal capacity in multiple cycles under both slow and fast filtration conditions to test the longtime bacterial removal performance in 1 wt 700bc and 700mbc amended columns the injection volume of e coli suspensions was increased to 100 pvs since negligible e coli broke through the columns with 1 wt 700bc 700mbc amendment even in the third transport elution cycle under slow flow rate condition the longtime injection process was then conducted under slow flow rate condition similar to the cycle experiment 100 e coli passed through the sand columns without biochar amendment under slow filtration condition during longtime filtration process fig 6c table s11 during the first 50 pvs bacterial suspension filtration processes e coli could be completely retained in 1 wt 700bc amended columns which was consistent with cycle experiments small portion of e coli started to break through the columns at 50 pvs and the amounts of bacteria in effluents gradually increased with increasing filtration volumes from 50 to 100 pvs in 1 wt 700bc amended columns due to blocking 50 e coli passed through the columns when the filtration volume reached 100 pvs in contrast 100 bacteria could be removed in columns with 1 wt 700mbc amendment during the whole process of 100 pvs bacterial suspension injection clearly modification of biochar by arginine could greatly improve the bacterial removal capacity note that the bacterial concentrations in actual water were typically about 102 106 cells ml jarde et al 2018 miralles cuevas et al 2021 which was lower than that considered in present study 107 cells ml biochar especially arg modified biochar thus exhibited great potential for the longtime bacteria removal in actual water treatment process 4 conclusion the results of present study showed that biochar arg modified biochar added into columns as permeable filter layer could improve the bacterial removal both e coli and b subtilis in sand filtration system under both slow and fast filtration conditions with increasing pyrolysis temperature and application rate of biochar the bacterial removal efficiencies could be enhanced comparing with biochar without modification arg modified biochar exhibited better bacterial removal performance 100 removal efficiency under both slow and fast filtration condition the addition of biochar modified biochar into sand columns would increase sites such as narrow flow channels and grain to grain contacts for the physical entrapment of bacteria partially contributing to the improved bacterial removal performance more importantly the larger bacterial adsorption capacity of biochar especially arg modified biochar had great contribution to the enhanced bacterial removal performance observed in columns with biochar modified biochar amendment bacteria were more tightly bounded with arginine modified biochar comparing with biochar columns with arginine modified biochar amendment exhibited excellent bacterial removal performance with the copresence of ha in bacterial suspensions nearly complete bacterial removal was also achieved in actual river water as well as in three filtration cycles under both slow and fast filtration conditions moreover negligible bacteria broke through the columns with arg modified biochar amendment during the whole process of 100 pvs injection duration under slow filtration condition clearly arginine modified biochar has great potential to efficiently remove bacteria from water note that in present study for both quartz sand columns and sand columns with biochar arg modified biochar amendment bacterial suspensions were injected into columns at either pore velocity of 4 m day to simulate slow filtration condition or 240 m day to simulate fast filtration condition by using a syringe pump the difference in hydraulic conductivities of quartz sand 1 77 10 2 cm sec and biochar 1 02 10 4 cm sec thus did not have great effect on the overall flow conditions e g flow durations however in filtration processes with flow solely driven by gravity such as stormwater filtration treatment process the lower hydraulic conductivity of biochar with sizes of 15 µm would enhance the process duration although the increase in sites such as narrow flow channels and grain to grain contacts resulted from the small sizes of biochar could partially enhance the bacterial retention via physical entrapment of bacteria its contribution to the overall bacterial retention yet was minor enhanced 15 retention in fine sand with same size of biochar added columns under fast flow condition comparing to that of bacterial adsorption capacity of biochar arg modified biochar thus in order to reduce eliminate the negative effects of lower hydraulic conductivity of biochar arg modified biochar layer on the flow rate or process duration biochar arg modified biochar with larger sizes might be better choices in practical filtration processes if whose flow was solely driven by gravity however the bacterial removal performance in sand columns with larger sized biochar arg modified biochar should be investigated prior to the real application as the bacterial adsorption capacity and physical entrapment of bacteria via straining at narrow flow channels grain to grain contacts regardless its minor contribution might be affected by the sizes of biochar arg modified biochar it is also worth pointing out that the recovery and the reuse of biochar arg modified biochar after their fully saturation by bacteria as well as the potential degradation of arginine by bacteria during the longtime operation process should be considered in the future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

16311,bacterial removal by sand filtration system is commonly inefficient due to the low bacterial adsorption capacity of sand to improve the bacterial removal performance biochar fabricated at different temperatures 400 c 550 c and 700 c and arginine modified biochar were added into sand filtration columns as filter layers 0 5 and 1 wt addition of biochar into sand columns could improve the removal efficiency for both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis under both slow 4 m day and fast 240 m day filtration conditions bacterial removal efficiency in sand columns with the addition of biochar fabricated at 700 c were higher than those fabricated at 400 c and 550 c due to its best bacterial adsorption capacity modification of biochar with arginine could further improve the bacterial removal performance specifically complete bacterial removal 1 35 107 10 cells ml could be achieved under both slow and fast filtration conditions in sand columns with 1 wt arginine functionalized biochar amendment the enhanced bacterial adsorption capacity mainly contributed to the increased bacterial capture performance in columns with addition of arginine modified biochar bacteria more tightly bounded with arginine modified biochar than bulk biochar moreover complete bacterial removal with the copresence of 5 mg l humic acid in suspensions was acquired in columns with addition of 1 wt arginine modified biochar efficient bacterial removal in actual river water multiple filtration cycles as well as longtime injection duration 100 pore volumes injection was also obtained the results of this study demonstrated that arginine modified biochar had great potential to treat water contaminated by pathogenic bacteria graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bacterial

irrigation water has been a global threat to human health garvey et al 2016 mashe et al 2021 sher et al 2021 the report of world health organization who showed that diarrhoea caused by unsafe drinking water contaminated by pathogenic bacteria would lead to 829 000 deaths of people per year who 2019 great efforts thus have been devoted to removing pathogenic bacteria from water okaikue woodi et al 2020 ramchander et al 2021 wang et al 2021 different types of technologies such as sand filtration napotnik et al 2021 nilsson et al 2013 rambags et al 2019 adsorption fang et al 2016 2017 jin et al 2014 membrane bioreactor fujioka and boivin 2020 fujioka et al 2018 zhang and farahbakhsh 2007 advanced oxidation process ding et al 2019 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2012 have been employed to remove pathogenic bacteria from water due to easy operation and low cost sand filtration is the most feasible and commonly employed technique to capture pathogen from water however the bacterial removal efficiency by sand filtration system is often limited because of the low bacterial adsorption capacity of sand rahman et al 2020 hence it is imperative to improve the bacterial removal performance of sand filtration system as a wide sourced and low cost material with high adsorption capacity biochar has been widely applied for water soil contamination remediation oliveira et al 2017 wang et al 2020 zou et al 2021 a few studies have investigated the bacterial removal performance in biochar amended sand columns and found that addition of biochar into column filtration systems could improve bacterial removal efficiency abit et al 2012 guan et al 2020 guo et al 2021 mohanty and boehm 2014 2015 sasidharan et al 2016 these studies have mainly attributed the enhanced bacterial removal in biochar amended sand columns to the higher bacterial adsorption capacity of biochar relative to sand due to the presence of attractive forces such as hydrophobic and steric interactions the improved bacterial attachment by straining due to the rougher surface and irregular shape of biochar than sand as well as the alteration in the bacterial zeta potentials resulted from the change of solution chemistry by the addition of biochar it is worth pointing out that these previous researches were conducted at slow filtration conditions with flow rates typically at serval m day note that in addition to slow flow rate fast flow velocity with filtration rate in the range of 120 2040 m day based on american water work association edzwald 2010 is also commonly employed in sand filter process in drinking water sewage treatment plants with increasing flow velocities the bacterial retention removal in porous media would be inhibited bradford et al 2006 yu et al 2019 the bacterial removal efficiencies in sand columns with biochar amendment at high flow conditions thus would be lowered however the bacterial removal performance in biochar amended sand columns at fast filtration condition e g a few hundred m day has not been examined thus requires investigation although the previous studies have concluded that biochar could improve bacterial removal from seeded deionized water or synthetic stormwater it is not clear whether biochar could efficiently capture bacteria from actual river water that contains different types of cations anions as well as natural organic matter nom moreover most of previous studies commonly mixed biochar with a doping ratio and sand as the filter media to remove bacteria yet it is not easy to recollect recover the biochar from the sand columns after their use it would be easier to recover biochar if they were used as porous media layer very recent study guan et al 2020 showed that when biochar was added into column as filter layer 10 cm biochar layer total sand column 60 cm the bacterial e coli removal efficiency in biochar amended columns yet was lower than that in sand columns without biochar amendment to improve the bacterial removal performance in sand columns it is necessary to modify the biochar e g to increase the bacterial adsorption capacity that added into columns different methods such as acid alkali modification metal oxide loading and oxidant functionalization have been previously employed to modify biochar to improve their removal performance of heavy metals organic contaminants and microplastic particles ding et al 2016 inyang and dickenson 2015 tong et al 2020 due to its strong positive charged side chains and high isoelectric point pi 10 76 zhang et al 2014 l arginine arg one of the natural amino acids has the capability of binding with bacteria and thus has been previously employed to modify fe3o4 particles to improve their bacterial capture performance jin et al 2014 it is expected that biochar modified by arginine would also have the improved bacterial capture capability however to the best of our knowledge arg modified biochar has not been fabricated and has not been employed for bacterial removal especially be used as filter medium in sand filtration system in this study biochar and arg modified biochar were fabricated and well characterized biochar modified biochar was then added into sand column as filter layer to remove both escherichia coli e coli typical gram negative bacteria and bacillus subtilis b subtilis typical gram positive bacteria since cellulose the major component of plants also the major solid wastes from paper production industry is one of the most popular biomass employed to fabricate biochar nanda et al 2016 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 cellulose based biochar was considered in present study previous studies abit et al 2012 bolster and abit 2012 have shown that pyrolysis condition would affect the physical and chemical properties of biochar which would then influence the bacterial adsorption capacity of biochar three types of biochar synthesized at different temperature were employed in this study particularly the effects of pyrolysis temperature and application rate of biochar on the removal of bacteria were investigated under both slow and fast filtration velocity conditions the bacterial removal mechanisms of biochar and arg modified biochar were systematically explored nom widely present in natural waters would adsorb onto biochar surfaces and decreased the sites for bacterial adsorption lowering the bacterial removal in biochar amended sand columns mohanty et al 2014 the bacterial removal performance of biochar and arg modified biochar amended columns with the presence of different concentrations of humic acid major component of nom ranging from 0 2 to 5 mg l were also investigated in present study in addition bacterial removal performance by the biochar arg modified biochar amended sand columns in actual river water in multiple filtration cycles as well as longtime filtration process 100 pore volumes were also testified 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of biochar and arginine modified biochar by heating cellulose 50 μm purchased from j k scientific cas 9004 34 6 under oxygen limited conditions in a muffle furnace at 400 c 550 c and 700 c for 6 h three types of biochar were synthesized yang et al 2016 which were named as 400bc 550bc and 700bc respectively the average size of 400bc 550bc and 700bc was 15 12 15 42 and 15 98 μm respectively fig s1 to prepare arginine modified biochar 5 g 700bc was added into a 300 ml conical flask containing 250 ml 10 g l arginine solution and then stirred for 3 h at room temperature following that the composites were collected by vacuum filtration and washed with ultrapure water for three times to remove excess arginine subsequently arginine modified 700bc was obtained after the drying process at 60 c for 12 h the composites named as 700mbc were stored in a vacuum drier for future use the reason why we add arginine modified biochar instead of physical mixture of arginine and biochar into sand columns to remove bacteria was provided in supplementary materials different techniques including scanning electron microscopy sem atomic force microscopy afm powder x ray diffraction xrd analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir brunauer emmette teller bet adsorption isotherms elemental analysis ea and thermogravimetric analysis tga were utilized to characterize the biochar modified biochar the zeta potentials as well as the contact angles of biochar modified biochar materials were measured detailed characterization methods can be found in supplementary materials 2 2 bacterial preparation a gram negative strain of e coli and a gram positive strain of b subtilis were utilized as the representative bacteria to investigate the bacterial removal performance in columns with biochar arginine modified biochar amendment before the transport and batch experiments the concentration of influent bacterial suspensions was adjusted to be 1 35 107 10 cells ml by diluting the initial bacterial stock solution contains approximate 109 1010 cells ml the bacterial concentration was counted by using a counting chamber buerker tuerk chamber marienfeld laboratory glassware germany with an inverted fluorescent ti e microscope nikon japan under a bright field more details on cell growth harvesting and concentration determination are provided in the supplementary materials 2 3 column experiments the cleaned quartz sand 250 420 μm ultrapure with 99 8 sio2 was used as model porous media and wet packed into cylindrical plexiglas column with 10 cm length and 2 cm inner diameter to improve the bacterial removal performance of sand filtration system a certain weight of biochar modified biochar was inserted into the porous media to form layer of filtration media in the middle of column the application rates of biochar modified biochar were defined as the mass ratio of biochar to dry sand which was set as 0 5 wt 0 22 cm height depth or 1 wt 0 44 cm height depth in present study the diagrams of column devices are shown in fig s2 the detailed sand cleaning and column packing procedures can be found in the supplementary materials for the typical bacterial removal experiments with fully saturated porous media after pre equilibrated the column with sterile background electrolyte solution 10 pore volumes pvs 1 pv equals to 13 ml slight different for columns without with biochar amendment 5 mm nacl ph 6 3 pvs bacterial suspensions 1 35 107 10 cells ml 5 mm nacl ph 6 were injected to the columns in up flow mode using a syringe pump harvard phd 2000 harvard apparatus inc holliston usa which was then followed by elution with 5 pvs sterile background salt solution during the removal experiments effluent samples at desired interval time were collected in sterilized centrifuge tubes the concentrations of bacteria in all effluent samples were determined to obtain the breakthrough curves btcs the pore velocities were set as 4 m day and 240 m day to simulate the representative fluid rate of slow filtration and fast filtration during the water treatment process respectively edzwald 2010 the hydraulic residence time hrt of the column system at 4 and 240 m day was 0 60 h and 0 01 h respectively for selected experiments the layer of biochar modified biochar was replaced by fine quartz sand with the same particle size as biochar to determine the contribution to bacteria removal by the changes of local flow path and grain to grain contacts back flush experiments were conducted to determine whether bacteria were loosely bounded with sand biochar modified biochar detailed information about back flush was provided in the supplementary materials moreover the influence of natural organic matter on the bacterial removal performance was investigated by adding humic acid ha with concentrations of 0 2 mg l 1 mg l and 5 mg l into the bacterial influent suspensions the bacterial removal performance in actual river water during three transport elution cycles as well as during the longtime injection process was also testified details can be found in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of biochar and arginine modified biochar xrd ftir tga sem ea and bet were employed to characterize biochar and arginine modified biochar the detailed results are provided in supplementary information the main results from characterization showed that the pyrolysis temperature could affect the property characteristic of biochar moreover biochar has been successfully modified by arginine zeta potential measurements showed that all three bulk biochar were negatively charged in 5 mm nacl solutions at ph 6 table s1 moreover zeta potentials became less negative with increasing charring temperature due to the decline or loss of negatively charged functional groups on the surface such as cooh at higher temperature coating the positively surface charged arginine on biochar decreased the negative zeta potential from 19 8 2 0 mv of 700bc to 8 9 3 6 mv of 700mbc the contact angles of bulk and modified biochar showed no significant difference table s2 indicating the similar hydrophobicity of bulk and arginine modified biochar 3 2 bacterial removal in sand columns with biochar modified biochar amendment without addition of biochar into sand columns the removal efficiencies for both types of cells at slow filtration condition were low as indicated by the high breakthrough curves of e coli 99 2 and b subtilis 79 1 in saturated quartz sand columns at the pore velocity of 4 m day fig 1 table s3 the low bacterial removal efficiencies by sand columns were consistent with classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory fig s3a and b with the addition of 0 5 wt biochar as permeable filter barrier in the middle of sand columns the percentages of bacteria both e coli and b subtilis passing through the column greatly decreased fig 1a and b table s3 for example the breakthrough percentage of e coli decreased from 99 2 without biochar to 44 7 36 1 and 27 8 at the pore velocity of 4 m day with the addition of 0 5 wt biochar synthesized at 400 c 550 c and 700 c respectively the observation indicated that the addition of bulk biochar layer in sand columns could enhance the removal of bacteria in slow filtration system increasing the mass percentage of biochar to 1 wt could further increase the bacterial both e coli and b subtilis removal efficiencies in columns fig 1c and d specifically the breakthrough percentages of e coli were 13 7 7 5 and 1 0 in the columns with 1 wt application rates of 400bc 550bc and 700bc respectively the percentages of b subtilis passed through the columns also decreased to 4 7 0 6 and 0 8 when the addition mass rate of 400bc 550bc and 700bc increased to 1 wt respectively fig 1 table s3 portion of bacteria both cell types could still pass through the sand column with addition of even 1wt of 400bc at the flow rate of 4 m day the addition of 1 wt 550bc into columns yet could retain vast majority of e coli 92 5 and almost all of b subtilis 99 4 in contrast almost all bacteria both e coli and b subtilis could be retained in sand columns with addition of 1 wt 700bc at 4 m day the above observations showed that for both types of cells 700bc biochar fabricated 700 c exhibited the best bacterial removal performance relative to 400bc and 500bc the relatively stronger inhibition of bacterial transport by biochar fabricated at higher temperature has also been reported previously abit et al 2012 sasidharan et al 2016 moreover increasing the amount of 700bc to 1 wt could retain almost all bacteria for both types in sand columns in slow filtration system in addition to slow flow rate fast flow velocity is also commonly employed in water treatment process especially the sand filter process in drinking water sewage treatment plant previous studies have shown that bacterial retention in sand columns would be inhibited by increasing flow rates bradford et al 2006 yu et al 2019 to testify bacterial removal efficiencies in sand columns with filter layers consisting of 400bc 550bc and 700bc under fast filtration condition transport experiments of both e coli and b subtilis were conducted in sand columns with addition of 0 5 wt and 1 wt biochar at the flow rate of 240 m day almost all bacteria both e coli and b subtilis passed through the sand column without addition of biochar at high flow rate fig 2 the observation indicated that fast sand filtration system was ineffective to remove bacteria similar to slow flow rate addition of biochar into sand columns could also increase the removal of bacteria in fast filtration system as indicated by the lower breakthrough curve plateaus of both gram negative and gram positive bacteria with addition of biochar in sand columns relative to those without biochar addition fig 2 the cell removal efficiencies by the columns with addition of biochar still followed the order of 700bc 550bc 400bc at fast filtration velocity which further confirmed that biochar fabricated at high temperature exhibited the best bacterial adsorption performance consistent with low flow rate further increasing the addition rates of biochar to 1 wt could also promote the removal percentages of bacteria both e coli and b subtilis at high flow rate fig 2c and d specifically with the addition ratio of biochar increased from 0 5 wt to 1 wt the breakthrough percentages of e coli under fast filtration velocity for columns with 400bc 550bc and 700bc decreased from 79 0 58 0 and 46 1 to 54 6 45 4 and 30 0 respectively and those of b subtilis decreased from 73 4 63 5 and 36 4 to 52 2 39 8 and 20 8 respectively table s3 it is worth pointing out that even for columns with addition of 1 wt 700bc 20 bacteria could still pass through the columns the observation indicated that although the addition of biochar into sand columns could enhance the bacterial capture efficiencies yet their bacterial removal performance should be further improved especially at high flow rates arginine a ubiquitous natural amino acid that has high isoelectric point was utilized to modify biochar in order to further enhance the bacterial capture performance since biochar fabricated at 700 c 700bc exhibited the best bacterial removal performance 700bc thus was modified by arginine and the modified biochar was named as 700mbc the addition of 700mbc into sand columns as a layer of filtration medium could greatly improve the bacterial removal efficiencies although 27 7 of e coli could pass through the column with addition of 0 5 wt 700bc fig 1a diamond yet 100 of e coli were captured in columns with addition of 0 5 wt 700mbc at flow velocity 4 m day as indicated by the negligible breakthrough of e coli fig 3 a upward triangle similarly negligible b subtilis passed the column with 0 5 wt 700mbc fig 3b upward triangle despite that 10 4 b subtilis passed through the column with 0 5 wt 700bc fig 1b diamond under slow filtration condition the bacterial capture efficiencies at high flow rate of 240 m day fast flow filtration condition by the addition of 0 5 wt 700mbc in porous media were also greatly improved fig 3c and d upward triangle specifically at filtration velocity of 240 m day the percentage of e coli passing through the columns decreased from 46 1 in 0 5 wt 700bc amended columns to 12 4 in columns with 0 5 wt 700mbc amendment similarly the percentage of b subtilis exiting from the columns decreased from 36 4 with addition of 0 5 wt 700bc to 9 3 with addition of the same amount of 700mbc clearly modification of biochar with arginine could improve the bacterial capture efficiency with the addition of 1 wt 700mbc into sand columns nearly complete capture of both e coli and b subtilis could be achieved at both low and high flow rates fig 3 downward triangle the above results showed that 700mbc could be used as efficient filter media for the removal of bacteria both gram negative and gram positive bacteria under both slow and fast filtration conditions 3 3 mechanisms for the enhanced bacterial removal by biochar modified biochar 3 3 1 contribution by the changes in effluent properties previous studies have shown that the addition of biochar into sand soil systems would slightly change the effluent solution chemistry abit et al 2012 bolster and abit 2012 to verify whether the introduction of biochar into the sand columns would change the column effluent properties both influent and effluent solutions of the columns without and with the addition of 1 wt biochar either bulk or modified were collected after the pre equilibration by 5 pvs sterile background solutions prior to the injection of bacterial suspensions for sand columns without addition of biochar the effluent solution chemistry was nearly identical as that of influent as indicated by the negligible difference of ph conductivities and metal ions concentrations k ca2 mg2 and mn cations between influent and effluent collected from sand columns table s4 the observation indicated that the solution chemistry did not change during passing through the quartz sand columns the addition of 700bc or 700mbc in sand columns did not change the effluent solution ph and the concentration of mn cations yet slightly increase concentrations of ions including k ca2 and mg2 thus the solution conductivity correspondingly increased the zeta potentials of bacteria during their transport processes in biochar modified biochar amendment columns might be changed which would influence bacterial transport behaviors in porous media zeta potentials of bacteria both e coli and b subtilis in effluents from columns without quartz sand amendment were similar with those in influents while bacterial zeta potentials in effluents from columns with addition of 700bc were less negative than those in influents table s5 noting complete removal of bacteria was achieved in columns with addition of 700mbc bacterial zeta potentials in effluents from columns with 700mbc thus could not be determined due to the absence of bacteria the less repulsive interaction force between bacteria and porous media would be expected in columns with biochar addition fig s3a and b which theoretically supported the higher bacterial removal efficiencies in columns with 700bc or 700mbc amended relative to those without biochar amendment previous studies also found that the changes in properties of effluents affected the transport and deposition of colloids in porous media guan et al 2020 tong et al 2020 it should be noted that solution chemistry including ph conductivity as well as metal ions concentration in effluent from 700mbc amended column were similar with those from column amended with 700bc yet the bacterial capture efficiencies in 700mbc amended column were greater than those in column amended with 700bc clearly other mechanisms also contributed to the enhanced bacterial removal by arginine modified biochar 3 3 2 contribution by the decreasing of porosity changing of porous media porosity would affect the transport behaviors of colloids reducing porosity inhibited colloidal transport peulen and wilkinson 2011 zhang et al 2021 to testify whether the addition of biochar in columns would alter the porosity of porous media the porosities of sole sand column as well as 0 5 wt and 1 wt biochar amended columns were determined detailed process can be found in supplement materials the porosity of quartz sand columns without biochar was 0 424 0 005 while the porosity of biochar layer was 0 232 0 102 the porosity of sand columns with 0 5 wt biochar and with 1 wt biochar thus decreased to 0 419 0 004 and 0 414 0 003 respectively the slightly decreased porosity of sand columns with the addition of biochar might increase the retention of bacteria by the increase of narrow flow channels and grain to grain contacts in the layer of biochar to determine the contribution of the slightly decreased porosity by the addition of biochar to the enhanced bacteria removal obtained in biochar amended columns fine quartz sand with the same particle size and the same thickness of biochar was used to replace the biochar layer in the amended column the interesting observation is that the breakthrough curves of bacteria both e coli and b subtilis in columns with the addition of fine sand were lower than those in quartz sand columns without amendment fig 4 a and b table s6 unlike the nearly 100 breakthrough of both types of bacteria in columns without amendment the percentages of bacteria broke through the columns with a layer of fine sand decreased to 85 for both types of cells in 5 mm nacl solutions under fast filtration condition as representative the observation suggested that decreasing local porosity of columns by replacing the normal sand with fine sand could increase the retention of bacteria previous studies have found that the amount of narrow flow channels as well as grain to grain contacts would be increased via the decrease of porosity resulted from the decreasing porous media sizes which thus would increase the retention of colloids in porous media tong et al 2008 zhang et al 2021 clearly more narrow flow channels and grain to grain contacts would be present in fine sand layer relative to those without addition of biochar which would cause the greater deposition of bacteria via straining previous studies also reported that straining of bacteria at small pores contributed to the bacterial removal in biochar amended columns abit et al 2012 bolster and abit 2012 mohanty et al 2014 thus it is reasonable for us to deduce that the enhanced bacterial removal via the addition of biochar modified biochar would be partially contributed by the enhanced straining effect via the increase of small pores e g grain to grain contacts and narrow flow channels resulted from the smaller biochar sizes relative to quartz sand however the bacterial removal efficiencies in biochar modified biochar amended columns were greater than those in columns with fine sand amendment clearly other mechanisms would also contribute to the greater bacterial deposition in biochar modified biochar amended columns 3 3 3 contribution by adsorption onto biochar modified biochar surfaces previous studies have shown that biochar have great adsorption capacities towards pollutants qian et al 2016 shen et al 2019 tong et al 2020 the enhanced bacterial removal efficiencies by the biochar or arginine modified biochar amended columns might be also due to the stronger bacterial adsorption of biochar modified biochar relative to sand batch experiments were conducted to testify the adsorption capacities of both e coli and b subtilis by either quartz sand or biochar modified biochar in 5 mm nacl solutions at ph 6 after 4 h adsorption the adsorption factions of e coli and b subtilis by quartz sand were 1 4 and 3 1 respectively fig 4c and d the observation indicated that quartz sand could barely adsorb bacteria in contrast biochar modified biochar exhibited great bacterial adsorption capacities in batch experiments for example the adsorption percentages of e coli by 400bc 550bc 700bc were 36 3 44 6 and 63 3 respectively similar to e coli the adsorption capacity of b subtilis by biochar fabricated at different temperature was also in the order of 400bc 550bc 700bc it should be noted that the trends of bacterial adsorption capacities for biochar synthesized at different temperature agreed with the observation of bacterial removal obtained in columns with addition of biochar fabricated at different temperature figs 1 and 2 clearly the adsorption capacity of biochar had great influence on removal of bacteria in porous media moreover bacterial adsorption percentages by arginine modified biochar were greater than those by bulk biochar without modification which also explained the greater removal efficiencies acquired in columns with addition of modified biochar previous studies found that increasing porous media surface roughness would reduce the repulsive energy barrier between colloids and porous media resulting in the enhanced colloidal deposition jin et al 2017 rasmuson et al 2019 tong et al 2020 comparing with quartz sand fig s4a the surface of bulk biochar was relatively rougher and the roughness increased with the elevation of fabricated temperature fig s5d e and f afm measurement fig s6 further confirmed that biochar was rougher than quartz sand and increasing pyrolysis temperature would further increase the roughness of biochar specifically the root mean square values of surface roughness feature of quartz sand was 33 3 1 8 nm consistent with previous study 33 4 nm han et al 2016 while the corresponding values of 400bc 550bc and 700bc was 82 6 7 9 nm 127 0 11 1 nm and 187 7 4 2 nm respectively interaction energy between bacteria and sand biochar with the consideration of roughness was calculated details about calculation was provided in supplementary materials as expected the energy barrier between bacteria and sand biochar with the consideration of roughness was lower than that without consideration of roughness fig s3 moreover for both types of bacteria the energy barrier with different surfaces followed the order of 700bc 550bc 400bc sand with the consideration of roughness the observations could qualitatively explain the bacterial adsorption capacity trend of sand 400bc 550bc 700bc bet surface area of bulk biochar increased with increasing charring temperature table s7 which suggested that the available bacterial adsorption sites of biochar also followed the order of 400bc 550bc 700bc as a result greater bacterial removal efficiency in columns with amendment of biochar charring at higher temperature was achieved however comparing with that of 700bc 187 7 4 2 nm the root mean square value of surface roughness feature of 700mbc yet was slightly smaller 162 8 8 9 nm fig s6e moreover bet surface area of 700mbc was also slightly smaller than that of 700bc table s7 the observations indicated that the alteration in surface roughness and bet surface area due to the coating of arginine onto biochar surfaces could not theoretically explain the higher bacterial adsorption and removal capacity of 700mbc than 700bc clearly other mechanisms would contribute to the improved bacterial adsorption capacity of 700mbc under the experimental conditions the zeta potentials of both bulk and modified biochar were less negative relative to those of bare quartz sand table s1 which could result in lower repulsive force between bacteria both e coli and b subtilis that also showed surface electronegativity and bulk modified biochar than that between bacteria and quartz sand based on the dlvo theory without or with consideration of roughness fig s3 accordingly biochar either bulk or modified exhibited better adsorption capacity for bacteria than quartz sand fig 4c and d resulting in the high bacterial removal efficiency with the addition of biochar into sand columns moreover with the enhancement of pyrolysis temperature the zeta potential of biochar became less negative leading to lower repulsive force between bacteria and biochar the bacterial adsorption capacity of biochar thus increased with increasing biochar charring temperature leading to the larger bacterial removal efficiency in columns with addition of biochar fabricated at high temperature the zeta potential of arginine modified biochar 700mbc was less negative than that of 700bc table s1 the energy barrier between bacteria and 700mbc thus was lower than that between bacteria and 700bc fig s3 which theoretically supported the larger bacterial adsorption capacity of 700mbc and higher bacterial removal percentage in 700mbc amended column relative to 700bc without modification the increased deposition via the changing of porous media zeta potentials have also been observed for bacteria urfer 2017 plastic particles tong et al 2020 and engineering nanomaterials chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 sem images of 700bc fig s7a as well as 700mbc fig s7b collected from columns after bacterial transport experiments of e coli showed that bacteria deposited on the surfaces and cavities of biochar during their transport process to investigate whether bacteria were tightly bounded by biochar modified biochar backwashing experiments were conducted after the transport experiments of e coli and b subtilis in columns with 1 wt 700bc and 700mbc amended in 5 mm nacl solutions at ph 6 under fast filtration condition fig 4e and f backwashing experiments were also performed in column without biochar amendment as control since nearly 100 bacteria both e coli and b subtilis broke through sand columns without biochar amendment negligible bacteria were flushed out from the columns during backwashing process however 7 2 and 2 4 e coli were washed out from columns with amendment of 1 wt 700bc and 700mbc respectively based on the number of bacteria retained in the column after the original orientation elution similarly based on the amount of bacteria retained in columns 7 2 and 2 2 b subtilis were flushed out during the backwashing process in columns with addition of 1 wt 700bc and 700mbc respectively the observation indicated that in columns amended with 700bc and 700mbc small portions of e coli and b subtilis loosely deposited onto the surface of bulk and modified biochar which could be eluted out of columns by additional back flushing moreover for both e coli and b subtilis the percentages of bacteria washed out from 700bc amended columns were higher than those from columns with 700mbc amendment during the backwashing process obviously 700mbc could retain bacteria more tightly comparing with 700bc note that the portion of retained bacteria by straining would be not easily to elute from the columns by backwashing since the porosities of biochar and arg modified biochar amended columns were equivalent we presumed that the amount of bacteria deposited in the layer of biochar arg modified biochar by straining would be similar clearly the decreased energy barrier or less repulsive electrostatic force between bacteria and 700mbc relative to that between bacteria and 700bc fig s3 might lead to the tight attachment of bacteria in primary energy minima on 700mbc which could not be eluted out by backwashing and thus the percentage of bacteria washed out from 700mbc was lower 3 4 bacterial removal in simulated water with humic acid and actual river water nom is widely present in natural water as well in wastewater the bacterial removal performance with the copresence of nom in suspensions in columns both without and with biochar modified biochar amendment was examined since nearly 100 of both e coli and b subtilis passed through the column at the filtration velocity of 240 m day the presence of ha as representative nom regardless of its concentrations did not affect the removal of bacteria in sand columns fig s8 the presence of ha yet increased the transport and decreased the removal of e coli and b subtilis in columns with 1 wt 700bc at fast filter velocity fig 5 a and c table s8 moreover the percentages of bacterial removal in columns decreased with increasing ha concentrations from 0 2 to 5 mg l as indicated by the increasing breakthrough plateaus of both types of bacteria with increasing ha concentrations fig 5a and c table s8 by site competition and repelling deposition previous study also found that ha coexisting in suspensions could enhance the transport of bacteria in bare quartz sand yang et al 2012 nevertheless in the columns with amendment of 1 wt 700mbc negligible bacteria for both cell types with the copresence of ha in suspensions even at concentration of 5 mg l passed through the columns at filter velocity of 240 m day fig 5b and d the results clearly showed that regardless the presence of ha in suspensions the addition of 1 wt arginine modified 700bc into sand columns could 100 retain both types of cells even under fast filtration condition the bacterial removal performance in river water taken from xiaojiahe river beijing china was also examined the details and main physico chemical parameters of river water can be found in supplementary materials and table s9 100 of e coli and b subtilis could move through the sole sand columns in river water at filter velocity of 240 m day fig 5e and f circle which suggested that bacteria spiked in river water could not be removed by quartz sand 16 3 e coli and 4 6 b subtilis passed through the columns with the amendment of 1 wt 700bc under fast filtration condition fig 5e and f upward triangle table s10 the observation indicated that 700bc could remove large amount of bacteria from river water at fast velocity nearly complete removal of both types of cells from river water could be achieved in columns with addition of 1 wt 700mbc under fast filtration condition fig 5e and f downward triangle table s10 the above results clearly showed that arginine modified 700bc had great potential as filter media for bacterial removal in actual water treatment process 3 5 bacterial removal performance in multiple cycles and longtime injection process the bacterial removal efficiencies of 1 wt 700bc and 700mbc amended columns were investigated through three transport elution cycles under both slow and fast filtration conditions since e coli was more difficult to be removed than b subtilis figs 1 and 2 the former strain was chosen as representative cell for the cycle to cycle removal performance test in all three cycles under both slow and fast flow conditions 100 e coli could break through the sand columns without biochar amendment fig 6 a and b table s11 although negligible e coli passed through the columns with 1 wt 700bc amendment in all three cycles under slow flow rate condition yet portion of e coli passed through the columns with 1 wt 700bc amendment and the percentage of bacteria exiting these columns increasing from 34 7 in 1st cycle to 38 3 in 2nd cycle and 42 9 in 3rd cycle under fast filtration condition fig 6b increasing flow rate would increase hydrodynamic shear stress torkzaban et al 2015 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 bacteria breaking through columns with 1 wt 700bc at high flow rate thus was greater than those at low flow rate the increased percentages of bacteria passing through biochar amended columns with increasing filtration cycles suggested the sites onto biochar for subsequent bacterial deposition decreased with increasing bacterial deposition cycles and blocking occurred in these columns in contrast regardless under slow or fast flow rate conditions 100 removal percentages of e coli in all three filtration cycles were obtained in columns with 1 wt 700mbc amendment comparing with 700bc 700mbc with less negatively charged surfaces should have more positive sites for bacterial deposition the observations clearly showed that arginine modified biochar had great bacterial removal capacity in multiple cycles under both slow and fast filtration conditions to test the longtime bacterial removal performance in 1 wt 700bc and 700mbc amended columns the injection volume of e coli suspensions was increased to 100 pvs since negligible e coli broke through the columns with 1 wt 700bc 700mbc amendment even in the third transport elution cycle under slow flow rate condition the longtime injection process was then conducted under slow flow rate condition similar to the cycle experiment 100 e coli passed through the sand columns without biochar amendment under slow filtration condition during longtime filtration process fig 6c table s11 during the first 50 pvs bacterial suspension filtration processes e coli could be completely retained in 1 wt 700bc amended columns which was consistent with cycle experiments small portion of e coli started to break through the columns at 50 pvs and the amounts of bacteria in effluents gradually increased with increasing filtration volumes from 50 to 100 pvs in 1 wt 700bc amended columns due to blocking 50 e coli passed through the columns when the filtration volume reached 100 pvs in contrast 100 bacteria could be removed in columns with 1 wt 700mbc amendment during the whole process of 100 pvs bacterial suspension injection clearly modification of biochar by arginine could greatly improve the bacterial removal capacity note that the bacterial concentrations in actual water were typically about 102 106 cells ml jarde et al 2018 miralles cuevas et al 2021 which was lower than that considered in present study 107 cells ml biochar especially arg modified biochar thus exhibited great potential for the longtime bacteria removal in actual water treatment process 4 conclusion the results of present study showed that biochar arg modified biochar added into columns as permeable filter layer could improve the bacterial removal both e coli and b subtilis in sand filtration system under both slow and fast filtration conditions with increasing pyrolysis temperature and application rate of biochar the bacterial removal efficiencies could be enhanced comparing with biochar without modification arg modified biochar exhibited better bacterial removal performance 100 removal efficiency under both slow and fast filtration condition the addition of biochar modified biochar into sand columns would increase sites such as narrow flow channels and grain to grain contacts for the physical entrapment of bacteria partially contributing to the improved bacterial removal performance more importantly the larger bacterial adsorption capacity of biochar especially arg modified biochar had great contribution to the enhanced bacterial removal performance observed in columns with biochar modified biochar amendment bacteria were more tightly bounded with arginine modified biochar comparing with biochar columns with arginine modified biochar amendment exhibited excellent bacterial removal performance with the copresence of ha in bacterial suspensions nearly complete bacterial removal was also achieved in actual river water as well as in three filtration cycles under both slow and fast filtration conditions moreover negligible bacteria broke through the columns with arg modified biochar amendment during the whole process of 100 pvs injection duration under slow filtration condition clearly arginine modified biochar has great potential to efficiently remove bacteria from water note that in present study for both quartz sand columns and sand columns with biochar arg modified biochar amendment bacterial suspensions were injected into columns at either pore velocity of 4 m day to simulate slow filtration condition or 240 m day to simulate fast filtration condition by using a syringe pump the difference in hydraulic conductivities of quartz sand 1 77 10 2 cm sec and biochar 1 02 10 4 cm sec thus did not have great effect on the overall flow conditions e g flow durations however in filtration processes with flow solely driven by gravity such as stormwater filtration treatment process the lower hydraulic conductivity of biochar with sizes of 15 µm would enhance the process duration although the increase in sites such as narrow flow channels and grain to grain contacts resulted from the small sizes of biochar could partially enhance the bacterial retention via physical entrapment of bacteria its contribution to the overall bacterial retention yet was minor enhanced 15 retention in fine sand with same size of biochar added columns under fast flow condition comparing to that of bacterial adsorption capacity of biochar arg modified biochar thus in order to reduce eliminate the negative effects of lower hydraulic conductivity of biochar arg modified biochar layer on the flow rate or process duration biochar arg modified biochar with larger sizes might be better choices in practical filtration processes if whose flow was solely driven by gravity however the bacterial removal performance in sand columns with larger sized biochar arg modified biochar should be investigated prior to the real application as the bacterial adsorption capacity and physical entrapment of bacteria via straining at narrow flow channels grain to grain contacts regardless its minor contribution might be affected by the sizes of biochar arg modified biochar it is also worth pointing out that the recovery and the reuse of biochar arg modified biochar after their fully saturation by bacteria as well as the potential degradation of arginine by bacteria during the longtime operation process should be considered in the future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

16312,increasing biochar application worldwide may release more biochar derived dissolved organic matter bdom to the source water for drinking water supply however it is unclear how feedstock types and pyrolysis temperatures for biochar production would affect the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of bdom here we studied the spectroscopic characteristics of bdom pyrolyzed from pine needle wheat straw walnut shells alfalfa pig manure and sludge derived biochars at 300 500 and 700 c as well as the formation potential of disinfection byproducts dbps and their bulk toxicity after bdom chlorination the n c ratio of biochar was higher for n rich than c rich feedstocks optical analyses indicated that bdom aromaticity was highest at 700 c while the impact of pyrolysis temperature on the molecular weight of bdom varied greatly among feedstocks increasing pyrolysis temperature caused consistently decreased bdom reactivity toward haloketone formation but did not show consistent impacts on the other dbps among feedstocks the n rich sludge showed the highest specific haloacetonitrile formation potential of bdom at any given pyrolysis temperature the dbp formation potential from biochar was consistently highest at 300 c and was higher for n rich than c rich feedstocks the microtoxicity of dbp mixture was highest for the bdom derived from sludge produced at 300 c this study highlights the high variations in characteristics and chlorination reactivity of bdom with varying feedstocks and pyrolysis temperatures which implies that more attention should be paid to the environmental impacts of the intensive application of low temperature biochar from n rich feedstock such as sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biochar derived dissolved organic matter feedstock type pyrolysis temperature chemical characteristics disinfection byproducts toxicity 1 introduction biochar a carbon enriched solid material produced from the pyrolysis of biomass under oxygen limited conditions has gained significant interest due to its worldwide application in carbon sequestration and soil amendment cui et al 2016 smith et al 2016 the annual global production of biochar was estimated to be 50 270 tg with a steady increase of more than 12 per year jha et al 2010 it has been reported that 80 of the applied biochar tends to be retained in soils and the amount of carbon stored in biochar may reach 9 5 pg yr 1 by 2100 lehmann et al 2006 a certain amount of biochar derived dissolved organic matter bdom is readily released during the biochar application especially when heavy storms happen and usually displays markedly different environmental behaviors dependent on chemical features huang et al 2021 lian and xing 2017 zhang et al 2020 in fact the chemical characteristics of bdom are intimately associated with its feedstock materials jamieson et al 2014 lin et al 2012 liu et al 2015 for instance biochar produced from the n rich animal manure feedstock may have greater n content than biochar made from c rich wood ippolito et al 2020 additionally the chemical features of bdom are also determined by the pyrolysis conditions including pyrolysis temperature heating rate and residence time kloss et al 2012 lee et al 2018 notably pyrolysis temperature is the most prominent factor controlling the physicochemical properties of biochar and then influencing the bdom characteristics it has been reported that the increase in pyrolysis temperature from 450 to 550 c decreased dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in sawdust derived bdom by more than an order of magnitude uchimiya et al 2013 bdom produced from sawmill waste tended to have higher aromaticity and molecular weight at a higher pyrolysis temperature jamieson et al 2014 terrestrial dom is an important precursor of disinfection byproducts dbps in watersheds majidzadeh et al 2020 mikkelson et al 2013 and its quantity and quality play a vital role in generating dbps of various species and toxicity levels marhaba and van 2000 recently thermally impacted dom due to wildfires in watersheds was reported to increase the dom reactivity to yield toxic nitrogenous dbps cawley et al 2017 wang et al 2015b posing potential threats to drinking water safety although biochar and wildfire ash derived dom are both generated by thermal processes the former mainly experiences pyrolysis whereas the latter is affected by both pyrolysis and combustion therefore the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of bdom may not respond identically to the thermal process like wildfire ash derived dom moreover since bdom characteristics depend heavily on pyrolysis conditions it is necessary to investigate the impact of feedstock types and pyrolysis temperatures on the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of bdom to clarify the potentially close linkage between biochar application and drinking water safety to the best of our knowledge there were only a few studies available focusing on biochar derived organic matter and disinfection byproducts cai et al 2020 chen et al 2015 lee et al 2018 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 for instance liu et al 2019 reported that the quantity of doc leaching from biochar were dependent on feedstocks pyrolysis temperature and residence time chen et al 2015 found that oxygen containing groups on biochar varied greatly at different temperatures cai et al 2020 investigated the spectroscopic and molecular level characteristics of soil derived dom as well as the formation of dbp mixtures from two long term biochar addition experimental farmlands lee et al 2018 focused on the dynamic variations of the optical characteristics and the formation of dbps by simulating biochar leaching from biochar amended fields during intermittent rain events zhang et al 2019 examined the influence of aqueous solution chemistry on dbp formation in the presence of different biochar during chlorination however even though these studies have shown that the bdom was closely linked to the feedstocks and temperature and could be an important precursor of dbps the effects of different feedstock types i e c rich and n rich types and pyrolysis temperatures on the bdom characteristics as well as the formation and toxicity proxies of the induced dbps have not been comprehensively studied in the present work biochar samples produced from c rich and n rich feedstock types were notably selected to compare the effects of the feedstock type on the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of bdom the elemental analysis and fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems combined with parallel factor parafac analysis were utilized to evaluate the composition and optical characteristics of biochar and bdom as a function of feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature furthermore the dependencies of the formation potential and toxicity level of disinfection byproducts on feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature were evaluated by chromatographic analyses and in vitro bioassays thereafter the correlations among the characteristics of bdom formation potential and toxicity of dbps were also assessed using principal component analysis to understand whether the characteristics could be good proxies for predicting dbps formation and toxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar sources and production three biochar samples from c rich feedstocks pine needles wheat straw and walnut shells and three biochar samples from n rich feedstocks n fixing plants alfalfa sludge and pig manure under different temperature conditions 300 500 and 700 c were produced and studied biochar was prepared by pyrolyzing the powered biomass samples under oxygen limited conditions with a heating rate of 7 c min using a muffle furnace to assure a complete carbonization process a holding time of 2 h was applied for each peak temperature the produced biochar was sieved through a 2 mm sieve all biochar samples were air dried at room temperature ground and passed through 0 18 mm sieve prior to the extraction experiments the produced biochar derived from pine needles wheat straw walnut shells alfalfa pig manure and sludge and are named here as pine bc wheat bc walnut bc alfalfa bc manure bc and sludge bc respectively 2 2 elemental analysis of biochar analysis of the elemental composition including carbon c hydrogen h and nitrogen n was determined in triplicates by dry combustion to establish the weight fraction of these elements using an elemental analyzer elementar hanau germany the mass ratios of h c and n c were calculated to provide an indication of the biochar properties 2 3 extraction of bdom the bdom was extracted in the flasks containing the biochar and milli q water at a biochar to water ratio of 1 50 li et al 2020 mixing was performed on a reciprocating shaker at a rotary speed of 150 rpm for 2 h under ambient temperature the extraction experiments were conducted in triplicates for each sample the supernatant was filtered through a pre rinsed 0 45 µm polyethersulfone membrane millipore and stored at 4 c before further analysis 2 4 analyses of bdom quantity and characteristics the analyses of quantity and characteristics for all bdom followed the methods as previously described cai et al 2020 specifically the ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined using a benchtop meter hq440d with an intellical phc201 ph probe and a cdc401 conductivity probe hach loveland usa the doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentrations were measured with a total organic carbon total nitrogen analyzer toc l csh csn shimadzu tokyo japan the inorganic nh4 n and nox n were analyzed using an automated discrete analyzer dechem tech cleverchem 380 hamburg germany and the dissolved organic nitrogen don concentration was calculated as the difference between the total and inorganic nitrogen concentrations ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer aqualog kyoto horiba the eem data were all corrected for background and inner filter effects and then transformed into raman unit r u murphy et al 2013 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 in l mg c m an indicator for the dom aromaticity was calculated by dividing the ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm by the doc concentration karanfil et al 2002 the fluorescence index fi an indicator for dom source refers to the ratio of the emission wavelengths at 470 and 520 nm with a fixed excitation at 370 nm cory et al 2010 the humification index hix which is positively linked to the humification degree was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensity area of 435 480 nm to that of 300 345 nm with 254 nm excitation ohno 2002 the slope ratio sr which is commonly inversely correlated with the molecular size of dom was calculated as the ratio of the logarithmically transformed absorbance spectrum slope at 275 295 nm s275 295 to that estimated in the range of 350 400 nm s350 400 helms et al 2008 parallel factor analysis parafac was used to decompose the eems into different components murphy et al 2013 and the model was validated based on the split half analysis stedmon and bro 2008 all components were further compared to the previously reported models in the openfluor database murphy et al 2013 a four component model was finally established and the relative abundance of each component was determined as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at the maximum fmax for each component to the fmax sum for all components fmax fmax fmax murphy et al 2013 2 5 chlorination procedure and dbp analysis the chlorine reactivity of the bdom in forming dbps was evaluated using the specific dbp formation potential sdbp fp in μg dbp mg doc i e the dbp formation potential normalized by the doc concentration based on a chlorination test li et al 2020 the estimated dbp formation potential from biochar dbp fpbiochar in μg dbp g biochar was also calculated by multiplying the sdbp fp in μg dbp mg doc by the water extractable doc stock in mg doc g biochar to evaluate the yield of dbps derived from 1 gram of biochar briefly diluted water extract samples at 3 mg doc l were adjusted to a ph of 8 0 0 2 and chlorinated with naocl at a dose of cl2 3 doc 7 6 nh4 n cai et al 2020 the headspace free chlorinated samples in 60 ml brown amber bottles were incubated in dark at 25 0 5 c for 24 h then 10 ml aliquots were withdrawn for the measurements of the ph and residual chlorine concentration the residual chlorine in the remaining 50 ml samples was quenched with excess ascorbic acid 1 m immediately and the dbps in the samples were immediately extracted with 4 5 ml methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and three 1 ml mtbe aliquots were collected the first 1 ml aliquot was analyzed by gas chromatograph coupled with electron capture detector gc ecd following a modified us epa method 551 1 quantified dbps included four trihalomethanes thms trichloromethane bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and tribromomethane four haloacetonitriles hans trichloroacetonitrile dichloroacetonitrile bromochloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetonitrile chloral hydrate chd and three haloketones hkts 1 1 dichloro 2 propanone 1 2 dibromo 3 propanone and 1 1 1 trichloro 2 propanone the other 2 ml aliquots were dried with high purity n2 99 99 and re dissolved in 2 ml milli q water for the microtoxicity and genotoxicity tests respectively it should be noted that the pretreatments of toxicity analyses e g liquid liquid extraction and n2 gas drying can possibly cause the loss of some dbps and may not reflect the absolute toxicity of the whole dbp mixture however these tests still allowed us to roughly assess the relative difference in toxicity between the dbp mixtures for different feedstocks and pyrolysis temperatures 2 6 toxicity evaluation the microtoxicity and genotoxicity levels of the dbps were evaluated by microtox tests and sos umu bioassays respectively cai et al 2020 li et al 2020 oda et al 1985 zito et al 2019 for the microtox tests the luminescence inhibition of photobacterium phosphoreum was adopted to estimate the microbial toxicity of the dbps briefly the luminescence intensity of p phosphoreum after 15 min of exposure to the treated water containing dbps was measured by a microplate reader varioscan thermo then the percent light loss in the samples relative to the control sample was calculated as the inhibition rate which was further calibrated to the zn ii equivalent concentration to estimate the microtoxicity the bioassay procedure is described in detail in text s1 for the genotoxicity sos umu assays using salmonella nm2009 were conducted according to previous studies li et al 2020 oda et al 1985 the exposure of bacteria to genotoxic dbps causes dna damage that triggers the sos reaction and leads to the galactosidase production therefore the relative galactosidase activity rga was calculated to indicate the overall genotoxicity the rga was calculated at the concentration at which the strain viability was above 50 positive results were designated as rga levels at least 1 5 fold higher than that of the control in a dose dependent manner the procedural details are described in text s2 in the supporting information 2 7 statistics analysis statistical analysis was conducted using spss 20 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s post hoc test was performed to examine the differences of biochar produced from different pyrolysis conditions for various parameters when the data did not satisfy the basic assumptions for one way anova they were tested with the nonparametric kruskal wallis test instead the differences were considered significant at p 0 05 all data are presented as the mean standard error 3 results and discussion 3 1 elemental composition of biochar the carbon content was greater than 50 in all biochars except those derived from sludge table 1 the low carbon content in sludge could be attributed to its high ash content than those in other organic rich feedstocks fan et al 2020 comparing the biochars from different feedstocks sludge bc had the highest n c ratios 0 11 0 14 followed by the alfalfa bc 0 04 0 05 manure bc 0 03 0 04 and the bc from other c rich stocks 0 00 0 03 the variations in c and n contents with pyrolysis temperature differed between feedstock types table 1 the carbon contents in pine walnut and alfalfa bcs were elevated as a function of temperature table 1 higher carbon content at higher pyrolysis temperature suggests a higher degree of polymerization and more condensed carbon structure in biochar as previously reported chun et al 2004 however the decrease in carbon content with increasing pyrolysis temperature in sludge bc may result from the dominating role of carbon volatilization in the forms of co co2 and hydrocarbon over the polymerization during pyrolysis lu et al 2012 the increase of nitrogen content with temperature in c rich wheat and walnut bc can be explained by the incorporation of n into complex structures that were resistant to heating and not easily volatilized gaskin et al 2008 the reduction of n content against pyrolysis temperature in all n rich feedstock was ascribed to volatilization of nh4 n or no3 n at low temperature and pyridine at high temperature bagreev et al 2001 de souza souza et al 2021 the mass ratio of h c decreased when the pyrolysis temperature increased regardless of feedstock type table 1 indicating that biochar produced at 500 and 700 c were highly carbonized than those produced at 300 c the significant decline of n c ratio as the pyrolysis temperature increased in pine sludge and manure bc table 1 suggests less nitrogen containing groups ahmed et al 2016 as well as lower polarity of biochar suguihiro et al 2013 3 2 chemical properties of water extracts the average ph values of the water extracts rose towards more alkaline conditions as a function of pyrolysis temperature regardless of feedstock type table 2 which was likely attributed to the loss of acidic function groups carboxyl hydroxyl or formyl groups on biochar surface weber and quicker 2018 and the formation of basic surface oxides under high pyrolysis temperature rehrah et al 2014 ec values in different feedstock types showed two orders of magnitude difference table 2 and tended to increase with pyrolysis temperature except for the sludge bc as ec is an estimator of the total dissolved salts amount in the sample the increase of ec against pyrolysis temperature could be explained by the increase of solubility of salts and metals such as po4 3 k ca2 and mg2 de souza souza et al 2021 tian et al 2019 the water extractable organic carbon weoc and water extractable organic nitrogen weon concentrations were significantly lower under 500 and 700 c compared to 300 c for all feedstock types table 2 the dissimilar chemical composition i e acid functional group and micropore surface area of biochar prepared from different feedstock types and pyrolysis temperatures were considered responsible for different leaching amounts of weoc and weon mukherjee and zimmerman 2013 therefore the lowered weoc and weon levels at 500 and 700 c were supported by the decline of the acid functional group indicated by increasing ph table 1 besides weon from the n rich feedstocks sludge alfalfa and manure was remarkably higher compared to the c rich feedstocks pine needle walnut and wheat straw which agreed well with the higher nitrogen content in n rich feedstocks table 1 3 3 spectroscopic signature of bdom the suva values of bdom were consistently higher at 700 c than 300 and 500 c it indicates that the aromaticity of bdom was higher at high pyrolysis temperature regardless of feedstock type table 2 consistent with the higher aromaticity at a higher temperature indicated by the lower h c ratios table 1 cantrell et al 2012 this is because higher temperatures led to an increased amount of volatile matter which in turn boosted the content of aromatic structures doumer et al 2015 fang et al 2014 the trend of fi values as a function of pyrolysis temperature differed distinctly among different feedstock types for instance the fi values increased first and subsequently decreased for pine bc and sludge bc while the fi values of alfalfa bc kept increasing with pyrolysis temperature the hix values of sludge bc showed a continuous decrease with the increase of pyrolysis temperature and by contrast the elevation of hix values against pyrolysis temperature was observed for all the other biochar derived from other feedstocks table 2 these results gave a hint that the previously reported alternation in hix values of water extractable organic matter for biochar added soils cai et al 2020 could be probably disturbed by the added biochar rather than the genuine change in humification degree the sr values of pine bc demonstrated a first increase and a subsequent decrease as the function of the temperature while the opposite trend was exhibited for the manure and sludge bc these results disclosed that the dependencies of molecular size of bdom on pyrolysis temperature varied greatly among different feedstock types hansen et al 2016 helms et al 2008 overall the vast disparity of spectroscopic characteristics depended on both feedstock materials and pyrolysis temperatures four fluorescent components c1 c2 c3 and c4 were identified by the parafac model analyses fig 1 c1 displayed a prominent peak at ex em of 250 390 nm and was interpreted as polycyclic aromatic like fluorophores wang et al 2015b c2 with its maximum at ex em of 250 360 440 nm was assigned as terrestrial humic like fluorophores zhou et al 2019 the peak of c3 appeared at ex em of 250 340 387 nm which was identified as a microbial humic like fraction huang et al 2015 wang et al 2021 c4 showed primary peaks at 250 280 370 nm and was recognized as a protein like or tryptophan like substance bittar et al 2016 vines and terry 2020 the content of the four fluorescent components depended heavily on feedstock materials for instance when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c the relative abundance of polycyclic aromatic like c1 was 4 9 for sludge bc but 75 0 for walnut bc the protein like c4 fraction in bdom was significantly higher in sludge bc than other bcs at 500 and 700 c fig 1 suggesting that sludge bc derived dom may be more bio labile than the others at high pyrolysis temperatures lee et al 2018 the relative abundances of four fluorescence components varied greatly under different pyrolysis temperatures fig 1 generally more polycyclic aromatic like c1 but less protein like fraction c4 was contained in bdom with increasing pyrolysis temperature fig 1 in particular the relative abundances of c1 were 0 0 35 9 at 300 c 4 9 75 0 at 500 c and 16 4 95 5 at 700 c by contrast c4 accounted for 23 8 to 48 1 at 300 c while 0 0 to 8 6 at 700 c prior research has claimed that the thermal decomposition of protein during pyrolysis process contributed to the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via systematic and random depolymerization reactions knicker 2007 wang et al 2015b and this may explain the increase in c1 and decrease in c4 as a function of pyrolysis temperature in fig 1 lower average abundances of humic like fractions c2 and c3 were found at higher pyrolysis temperature fig 1 indicating less humic like materials from the dihydroxylation decarboxylation and aromatization reactions of biomass materials were generated when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 700 c demirbas 2004 gao et al 2020 wei et al 2020 3 4 formation and toxicity of dbp mixture the sdbp fp values i e dbp yield per doc of bdom were determined and found to depend on the feedstock type at a given pyrolysis temperature fig 2 a d for instance when the pyrolysis temperature was identically at 500 c the specific trihalomethane formation potential sthm fp values could have a 3 time difference ranging from 15 28 1 42 μg mg doc for walnut bc to 50 25 0 13 for sludge bc table s2 the specific haloacetonitrile formation potential shan fp values of bdom for n rich feedstocks were mostly higher than those from c rich feedstocks at any given pyrolysis temperatures fig 2b for instance the shan fp at 300 500 and 700 c were 0 02 0 14 0 23 0 64 and 0 03 0 18 μg mg doc for c rich feedstocks and 0 15 0 73 0 25 2 47 and 0 42 2 58 μg mg doc for n rich feedstocks table s2 the higher total nitrogen table 1 and weon contents table 2 in n rich feedstocks is likely the major factor for the higher shan fp for n rich feedstocks than c rich feedstocks wang et al 2015b pyrolysis temperature was identified as another key factor controlling the sdbp fp and its impact differed greatly among different feedstock types for instance the sthm fp inclined first and subsequently declined with increasing pyrolysis temperature for c rich pine and wheat bc as well as n rich alfalfa and sludge bc fig 2a while shan fp values of n rich sludge bc and manure bc were elevated as the pyrolysis temperature increased in terms of schd fp it declined gradually against pyrolysis temperature for c rich wheat and walnut bc and n rich alfalfa and sludge bc in contrast to sthm fp shan fp and schd fp the shkt fp consistently decreased with pyrolysis temperature regardless of feedstock type the amount of dbp precursors from 1 gram of biochar was estimated by dbp fpbiochar as shown in fig 2e h the dbp fpbiochar values for n rich feedstocks were markedly higher than those for c rich feedstocks at a given pyrolysis temperature for example han fpbiochar for three n rich feedstocks at 300 c ranged from 0 72 to 7 80 μg g biochar but from 0 04 to 0 39 μg g biochar for c rich feedstocks table s2 these findings suggest that disinfection byproduct formation potential would be higher from n rich feedstocks derived bdom than c rich feedstocks derived bdom furthermore dbp fpbiochar values were affected by the pyrolysis temperature as well basically the highest dbp fpbiochar values consistently occurred at pyrolysis temperature of 300 c regardless of feedstock type insignificant alternations in dbp fpbiochar were found between 500 and 700 c for most of the feedstocks the variations in dbp fpbiochar with pyrolysis temperature were similar to the variations in weoc and weon table 2 which suggests that the leachability of bdom from biochar is a critical factor on dbp fpbiochar as illustrated in fig 3 a the response of microtoxicity of dbp mixture in mg l equivalent zn ii to pyrolysis temperature differed among various feedstock types for instance the microtoxicity increased against pyrolysis temperature for alfalfa bc and manure bc but decreased with the pyrolysis temperature for sludge bc notably the microtoxicity of dbp mixture was significantly higher for chlorination of bdom from sludge bc than other feedstocks particularly the microtoxicity of dbp mixture for sludge bc produced at 300 c was equivalent to 1 71 mg l zn ii which was higher than the 72 h ec50 1 17 mg l and 96 h ec50 0 67 mg l of zinc chloride to daphnia magna reported in a previous study ergonul et al 2012 taking this into account the microtoxicity of the dbps produced from the chlorination of sludge derived bdom could not be neglected nevertheless in terms of genotoxicity indicated by the reactivity of β galactosidase none of the dbps formed from the chlorination of bdom were genotoxic regardless of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature as shown in fig 3b it is noteworthy that microtoxicity and genotoxicity in our study were both measured for the dbps induced from the chlorination of bdom at 3 mg l an environmentally relevant concentration since the biochars produced at 300 c are more potent to yield more bdom than those produced at higher temperatures they are expected to pose higher risks in order to address the concerns of the risks of bdom to drinking water sources the water extractable organic matter production and sdbp fp were compared with soil derived or other terrestrial dom in previous studies table 3 for instance the amount of weoc was ranging from 52 28 339 μg g soil in our study while 25 7600 μg g in previous studies the sthm fp shan fp schd fp and shkt fp were 5 3 50 3 0 02 2 6 0 2 9 2 and 0 05 0 5 μg mg doc in our study while 11 0 340 0 0 3 8 5 0 3 16 2 and 0 2 3 2 μg mg doc in previous studies respectively these results collectively demonstrated that weoc and specific formation potentials of dbps of the present study were quantitatively comparable with those in previous studies besides taking the potent toxicity of bdom e g sludge derived bdom into account its potential risks should not be diminished or negligible from the perspective of water safety and human health 3 5 linking dbp formation and toxicity with optical properties of bdom in order to obtain further insight into the relative contributions of bdom properties to the formation and toxicity of disinfection byproducts all the measured bdom characteristics were incorporated to create principal component analysis pca plots fig 4 the first two principal components explained 58 4 of the total variation in all parameters pc1 36 7 pc2 21 7 pc1 was associated with more protein like terrestrial humic like and less aromatic dom components because the fluorescent protein like c4 had relatively high positive loadings on pc1 while the polycyclic aromatics like c1 hix and suva254 were highly correlated and had negative loadings on pc1 fig 4a pc2 can be explained by less low molecular weight humic like dom as sr and c2 were placed on the negative side of pc2 fig 4a sthm fp had a high positive correlation with c3 and fi and negatively correlated with suva254 and sr fig 4a table s3 suggesting that humic like component with lower aromaticity and larger molecular weight from microbial sources in dom were likely the important sources of thms this result agrees well with the arguments that the dom reactivities toward the formation of thms were related to non fresh high molecular weight humic like components chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 pifer and fairey 2012 wang et al 2015a shan fp was positively correlated with fi and c3 and negatively correlated with sr fig 4a table s3 indicating that the high contribution of high molecular weight and microbial humic like dom components to form hans the negative correlation between schd fp and suva254 suggests that the less aromatic fractions such as oxygen containing functional groups including ketone carbonyl groups in dom have high reactivity in forming chd świetlik et al 2004 shkt fp was positively correlated with c2 and c4 but negatively correlated with suva254 and hix this infers that less humified terrestrial humic like and protein like components are highly reactive hkt precursors which was partially supported by the prior studies for instance our previous study found that humic like component and its correlated component is a source of hkts li et al 2020 and another study demonstrated that hkts had its highest values when the precursor was less aromatic and humified dom wang et al 2015a dbps microtoxicity was only weakly and positively linked to shkt fp r2 0 47 p 0 05 table s3 instead of other dbps and genotoxicity was not correlated to any dbps this finding was in line with the previous report that commonly detected dbps made a weak contribution to the overall dbps toxicity despite their relatively high abundances han and zhang 2018 li et al 2020 the first and second principal component scores results in fig 4b demonstrated that the pine bc 700 wheat bc 700 walnut bc 700 alfalfa bc 700 and manure bc 700 were more clustered which could be explained by similar hix and aromaticity as well as relative abundance of polycyclic aromatic like component it is noted that the pc1 scores decreased remarkably from positive to negative values when the pyrolysis temperature was increasing from 300 to 700 c for five feedstock types pine bc wheat bc walnut bc alfalfa bc and manure bc this result was in accordance with the decrease of tryptophan like c4 component as demonstrated in fig 1 moreover pc1 scores of sludge bc were in the following order sludge bc 500 sludge bc 300 sludge bc 700 which agreed well with the relative abundance of tryptophan like c4 shown in fig 1 in addition all the samples excluding the outlier sludge bc 500 were relatively more clustered in pc2 axis compared to pc1 axis this result indicated that the molecular weight of dom did not vary greatly under different feedstock types and pyrolysis temperatures 4 conclusion feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature were found as the key factors controlling the quantity and quality characteristics of bdom as well as the bdom reactivity with chlorine to form dbps of varying degrees of toxicity bdom characteristics differed significantly between c rich and n rich feedstock type to be specific biochar from c rich feedstocks had lower n c ratios than that from n rich feedstocks and the intimate association between carbon and nitrogen contents and pyrolysis temperature varied greatly among different feedstock types the vast disparity of aromaticity and molecular size dependent on the biochar pyrolysis temperature and feedstocks types were also observed more polycyclic aromatics like but less humic like and protein like fractions were contained in bdom as a function of temperature dom reactivity toward the formation of disinfection byproducts was higher in n rich feedstocks derived bdom and was the highest at low temperature 300 c the elevation in specific nitrogenous han formation potentials from n rich feedstocks resulted from the higher organic nitrogen content even though none of the dbps were genotoxic the microtoxicity of dbp mixture was more potent and differed significantly among various feedstock types these results implied that the pyrolysis conditions of biochar affected the spectral and molecular characteristics of bdom and altered its chlorine reactivity in forming disinfection byproducts however when the biochar produced under different feedstock types and pyrolysis conditions are intensively applied to the soils how the long term effect of biochar application particularly for the n rich biochars in watersheds on the dbps precursors and drinking water safety

16312,increasing biochar application worldwide may release more biochar derived dissolved organic matter bdom to the source water for drinking water supply however it is unclear how feedstock types and pyrolysis temperatures for biochar production would affect the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of bdom here we studied the spectroscopic characteristics of bdom pyrolyzed from pine needle wheat straw walnut shells alfalfa pig manure and sludge derived biochars at 300 500 and 700 c as well as the formation potential of disinfection byproducts dbps and their bulk toxicity after bdom chlorination the n c ratio of biochar was higher for n rich than c rich feedstocks optical analyses indicated that bdom aromaticity was highest at 700 c while the impact of pyrolysis temperature on the molecular weight of bdom varied greatly among feedstocks increasing pyrolysis temperature caused consistently decreased bdom reactivity toward haloketone formation but did not show consistent impacts on the other dbps among feedstocks the n rich sludge showed the highest specific haloacetonitrile formation potential of bdom at any given pyrolysis temperature the dbp formation potential from biochar was consistently highest at 300 c and was higher for n rich than c rich feedstocks the microtoxicity of dbp mixture was highest for the bdom derived from sludge produced at 300 c this study highlights the high variations in characteristics and chlorination reactivity of bdom with varying feedstocks and pyrolysis temperatures which implies that more attention should be paid to the environmental impacts of the intensive application of low temperature biochar from n rich feedstock such as sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biochar derived dissolved organic matter feedstock type pyrolysis temperature chemical characteristics disinfection byproducts toxicity 1 introduction biochar a carbon enriched solid material produced from the pyrolysis of biomass under oxygen limited conditions has gained significant interest due to its worldwide application in carbon sequestration and soil amendment cui et al 2016 smith et al 2016 the annual global production of biochar was estimated to be 50 270 tg with a steady increase of more than 12 per year jha et al 2010 it has been reported that 80 of the applied biochar tends to be retained in soils and the amount of carbon stored in biochar may reach 9 5 pg yr 1 by 2100 lehmann et al 2006 a certain amount of biochar derived dissolved organic matter bdom is readily released during the biochar application especially when heavy storms happen and usually displays markedly different environmental behaviors dependent on chemical features huang et al 2021 lian and xing 2017 zhang et al 2020 in fact the chemical characteristics of bdom are intimately associated with its feedstock materials jamieson et al 2014 lin et al 2012 liu et al 2015 for instance biochar produced from the n rich animal manure feedstock may have greater n content than biochar made from c rich wood ippolito et al 2020 additionally the chemical features of bdom are also determined by the pyrolysis conditions including pyrolysis temperature heating rate and residence time kloss et al 2012 lee et al 2018 notably pyrolysis temperature is the most prominent factor controlling the physicochemical properties of biochar and then influencing the bdom characteristics it has been reported that the increase in pyrolysis temperature from 450 to 550 c decreased dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in sawdust derived bdom by more than an order of magnitude uchimiya et al 2013 bdom produced from sawmill waste tended to have higher aromaticity and molecular weight at a higher pyrolysis temperature jamieson et al 2014 terrestrial dom is an important precursor of disinfection byproducts dbps in watersheds majidzadeh et al 2020 mikkelson et al 2013 and its quantity and quality play a vital role in generating dbps of various species and toxicity levels marhaba and van 2000 recently thermally impacted dom due to wildfires in watersheds was reported to increase the dom reactivity to yield toxic nitrogenous dbps cawley et al 2017 wang et al 2015b posing potential threats to drinking water safety although biochar and wildfire ash derived dom are both generated by thermal processes the former mainly experiences pyrolysis whereas the latter is affected by both pyrolysis and combustion therefore the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of bdom may not respond identically to the thermal process like wildfire ash derived dom moreover since bdom characteristics depend heavily on pyrolysis conditions it is necessary to investigate the impact of feedstock types and pyrolysis temperatures on the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of bdom to clarify the potentially close linkage between biochar application and drinking water safety to the best of our knowledge there were only a few studies available focusing on biochar derived organic matter and disinfection byproducts cai et al 2020 chen et al 2015 lee et al 2018 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 for instance liu et al 2019 reported that the quantity of doc leaching from biochar were dependent on feedstocks pyrolysis temperature and residence time chen et al 2015 found that oxygen containing groups on biochar varied greatly at different temperatures cai et al 2020 investigated the spectroscopic and molecular level characteristics of soil derived dom as well as the formation of dbp mixtures from two long term biochar addition experimental farmlands lee et al 2018 focused on the dynamic variations of the optical characteristics and the formation of dbps by simulating biochar leaching from biochar amended fields during intermittent rain events zhang et al 2019 examined the influence of aqueous solution chemistry on dbp formation in the presence of different biochar during chlorination however even though these studies have shown that the bdom was closely linked to the feedstocks and temperature and could be an important precursor of dbps the effects of different feedstock types i e c rich and n rich types and pyrolysis temperatures on the bdom characteristics as well as the formation and toxicity proxies of the induced dbps have not been comprehensively studied in the present work biochar samples produced from c rich and n rich feedstock types were notably selected to compare the effects of the feedstock type on the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of bdom the elemental analysis and fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems combined with parallel factor parafac analysis were utilized to evaluate the composition and optical characteristics of biochar and bdom as a function of feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature furthermore the dependencies of the formation potential and toxicity level of disinfection byproducts on feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature were evaluated by chromatographic analyses and in vitro bioassays thereafter the correlations among the characteristics of bdom formation potential and toxicity of dbps were also assessed using principal component analysis to understand whether the characteristics could be good proxies for predicting dbps formation and toxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar sources and production three biochar samples from c rich feedstocks pine needles wheat straw and walnut shells and three biochar samples from n rich feedstocks n fixing plants alfalfa sludge and pig manure under different temperature conditions 300 500 and 700 c were produced and studied biochar was prepared by pyrolyzing the powered biomass samples under oxygen limited conditions with a heating rate of 7 c min using a muffle furnace to assure a complete carbonization process a holding time of 2 h was applied for each peak temperature the produced biochar was sieved through a 2 mm sieve all biochar samples were air dried at room temperature ground and passed through 0 18 mm sieve prior to the extraction experiments the produced biochar derived from pine needles wheat straw walnut shells alfalfa pig manure and sludge and are named here as pine bc wheat bc walnut bc alfalfa bc manure bc and sludge bc respectively 2 2 elemental analysis of biochar analysis of the elemental composition including carbon c hydrogen h and nitrogen n was determined in triplicates by dry combustion to establish the weight fraction of these elements using an elemental analyzer elementar hanau germany the mass ratios of h c and n c were calculated to provide an indication of the biochar properties 2 3 extraction of bdom the bdom was extracted in the flasks containing the biochar and milli q water at a biochar to water ratio of 1 50 li et al 2020 mixing was performed on a reciprocating shaker at a rotary speed of 150 rpm for 2 h under ambient temperature the extraction experiments were conducted in triplicates for each sample the supernatant was filtered through a pre rinsed 0 45 µm polyethersulfone membrane millipore and stored at 4 c before further analysis 2 4 analyses of bdom quantity and characteristics the analyses of quantity and characteristics for all bdom followed the methods as previously described cai et al 2020 specifically the ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined using a benchtop meter hq440d with an intellical phc201 ph probe and a cdc401 conductivity probe hach loveland usa the doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentrations were measured with a total organic carbon total nitrogen analyzer toc l csh csn shimadzu tokyo japan the inorganic nh4 n and nox n were analyzed using an automated discrete analyzer dechem tech cleverchem 380 hamburg germany and the dissolved organic nitrogen don concentration was calculated as the difference between the total and inorganic nitrogen concentrations ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer aqualog kyoto horiba the eem data were all corrected for background and inner filter effects and then transformed into raman unit r u murphy et al 2013 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 in l mg c m an indicator for the dom aromaticity was calculated by dividing the ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm by the doc concentration karanfil et al 2002 the fluorescence index fi an indicator for dom source refers to the ratio of the emission wavelengths at 470 and 520 nm with a fixed excitation at 370 nm cory et al 2010 the humification index hix which is positively linked to the humification degree was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensity area of 435 480 nm to that of 300 345 nm with 254 nm excitation ohno 2002 the slope ratio sr which is commonly inversely correlated with the molecular size of dom was calculated as the ratio of the logarithmically transformed absorbance spectrum slope at 275 295 nm s275 295 to that estimated in the range of 350 400 nm s350 400 helms et al 2008 parallel factor analysis parafac was used to decompose the eems into different components murphy et al 2013 and the model was validated based on the split half analysis stedmon and bro 2008 all components were further compared to the previously reported models in the openfluor database murphy et al 2013 a four component model was finally established and the relative abundance of each component was determined as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at the maximum fmax for each component to the fmax sum for all components fmax fmax fmax murphy et al 2013 2 5 chlorination procedure and dbp analysis the chlorine reactivity of the bdom in forming dbps was evaluated using the specific dbp formation potential sdbp fp in μg dbp mg doc i e the dbp formation potential normalized by the doc concentration based on a chlorination test li et al 2020 the estimated dbp formation potential from biochar dbp fpbiochar in μg dbp g biochar was also calculated by multiplying the sdbp fp in μg dbp mg doc by the water extractable doc stock in mg doc g biochar to evaluate the yield of dbps derived from 1 gram of biochar briefly diluted water extract samples at 3 mg doc l were adjusted to a ph of 8 0 0 2 and chlorinated with naocl at a dose of cl2 3 doc 7 6 nh4 n cai et al 2020 the headspace free chlorinated samples in 60 ml brown amber bottles were incubated in dark at 25 0 5 c for 24 h then 10 ml aliquots were withdrawn for the measurements of the ph and residual chlorine concentration the residual chlorine in the remaining 50 ml samples was quenched with excess ascorbic acid 1 m immediately and the dbps in the samples were immediately extracted with 4 5 ml methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and three 1 ml mtbe aliquots were collected the first 1 ml aliquot was analyzed by gas chromatograph coupled with electron capture detector gc ecd following a modified us epa method 551 1 quantified dbps included four trihalomethanes thms trichloromethane bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and tribromomethane four haloacetonitriles hans trichloroacetonitrile dichloroacetonitrile bromochloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetonitrile chloral hydrate chd and three haloketones hkts 1 1 dichloro 2 propanone 1 2 dibromo 3 propanone and 1 1 1 trichloro 2 propanone the other 2 ml aliquots were dried with high purity n2 99 99 and re dissolved in 2 ml milli q water for the microtoxicity and genotoxicity tests respectively it should be noted that the pretreatments of toxicity analyses e g liquid liquid extraction and n2 gas drying can possibly cause the loss of some dbps and may not reflect the absolute toxicity of the whole dbp mixture however these tests still allowed us to roughly assess the relative difference in toxicity between the dbp mixtures for different feedstocks and pyrolysis temperatures 2 6 toxicity evaluation the microtoxicity and genotoxicity levels of the dbps were evaluated by microtox tests and sos umu bioassays respectively cai et al 2020 li et al 2020 oda et al 1985 zito et al 2019 for the microtox tests the luminescence inhibition of photobacterium phosphoreum was adopted to estimate the microbial toxicity of the dbps briefly the luminescence intensity of p phosphoreum after 15 min of exposure to the treated water containing dbps was measured by a microplate reader varioscan thermo then the percent light loss in the samples relative to the control sample was calculated as the inhibition rate which was further calibrated to the zn ii equivalent concentration to estimate the microtoxicity the bioassay procedure is described in detail in text s1 for the genotoxicity sos umu assays using salmonella nm2009 were conducted according to previous studies li et al 2020 oda et al 1985 the exposure of bacteria to genotoxic dbps causes dna damage that triggers the sos reaction and leads to the galactosidase production therefore the relative galactosidase activity rga was calculated to indicate the overall genotoxicity the rga was calculated at the concentration at which the strain viability was above 50 positive results were designated as rga levels at least 1 5 fold higher than that of the control in a dose dependent manner the procedural details are described in text s2 in the supporting information 2 7 statistics analysis statistical analysis was conducted using spss 20 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s post hoc test was performed to examine the differences of biochar produced from different pyrolysis conditions for various parameters when the data did not satisfy the basic assumptions for one way anova they were tested with the nonparametric kruskal wallis test instead the differences were considered significant at p 0 05 all data are presented as the mean standard error 3 results and discussion 3 1 elemental composition of biochar the carbon content was greater than 50 in all biochars except those derived from sludge table 1 the low carbon content in sludge could be attributed to its high ash content than those in other organic rich feedstocks fan et al 2020 comparing the biochars from different feedstocks sludge bc had the highest n c ratios 0 11 0 14 followed by the alfalfa bc 0 04 0 05 manure bc 0 03 0 04 and the bc from other c rich stocks 0 00 0 03 the variations in c and n contents with pyrolysis temperature differed between feedstock types table 1 the carbon contents in pine walnut and alfalfa bcs were elevated as a function of temperature table 1 higher carbon content at higher pyrolysis temperature suggests a higher degree of polymerization and more condensed carbon structure in biochar as previously reported chun et al 2004 however the decrease in carbon content with increasing pyrolysis temperature in sludge bc may result from the dominating role of carbon volatilization in the forms of co co2 and hydrocarbon over the polymerization during pyrolysis lu et al 2012 the increase of nitrogen content with temperature in c rich wheat and walnut bc can be explained by the incorporation of n into complex structures that were resistant to heating and not easily volatilized gaskin et al 2008 the reduction of n content against pyrolysis temperature in all n rich feedstock was ascribed to volatilization of nh4 n or no3 n at low temperature and pyridine at high temperature bagreev et al 2001 de souza souza et al 2021 the mass ratio of h c decreased when the pyrolysis temperature increased regardless of feedstock type table 1 indicating that biochar produced at 500 and 700 c were highly carbonized than those produced at 300 c the significant decline of n c ratio as the pyrolysis temperature increased in pine sludge and manure bc table 1 suggests less nitrogen containing groups ahmed et al 2016 as well as lower polarity of biochar suguihiro et al 2013 3 2 chemical properties of water extracts the average ph values of the water extracts rose towards more alkaline conditions as a function of pyrolysis temperature regardless of feedstock type table 2 which was likely attributed to the loss of acidic function groups carboxyl hydroxyl or formyl groups on biochar surface weber and quicker 2018 and the formation of basic surface oxides under high pyrolysis temperature rehrah et al 2014 ec values in different feedstock types showed two orders of magnitude difference table 2 and tended to increase with pyrolysis temperature except for the sludge bc as ec is an estimator of the total dissolved salts amount in the sample the increase of ec against pyrolysis temperature could be explained by the increase of solubility of salts and metals such as po4 3 k ca2 and mg2 de souza souza et al 2021 tian et al 2019 the water extractable organic carbon weoc and water extractable organic nitrogen weon concentrations were significantly lower under 500 and 700 c compared to 300 c for all feedstock types table 2 the dissimilar chemical composition i e acid functional group and micropore surface area of biochar prepared from different feedstock types and pyrolysis temperatures were considered responsible for different leaching amounts of weoc and weon mukherjee and zimmerman 2013 therefore the lowered weoc and weon levels at 500 and 700 c were supported by the decline of the acid functional group indicated by increasing ph table 1 besides weon from the n rich feedstocks sludge alfalfa and manure was remarkably higher compared to the c rich feedstocks pine needle walnut and wheat straw which agreed well with the higher nitrogen content in n rich feedstocks table 1 3 3 spectroscopic signature of bdom the suva values of bdom were consistently higher at 700 c than 300 and 500 c it indicates that the aromaticity of bdom was higher at high pyrolysis temperature regardless of feedstock type table 2 consistent with the higher aromaticity at a higher temperature indicated by the lower h c ratios table 1 cantrell et al 2012 this is because higher temperatures led to an increased amount of volatile matter which in turn boosted the content of aromatic structures doumer et al 2015 fang et al 2014 the trend of fi values as a function of pyrolysis temperature differed distinctly among different feedstock types for instance the fi values increased first and subsequently decreased for pine bc and sludge bc while the fi values of alfalfa bc kept increasing with pyrolysis temperature the hix values of sludge bc showed a continuous decrease with the increase of pyrolysis temperature and by contrast the elevation of hix values against pyrolysis temperature was observed for all the other biochar derived from other feedstocks table 2 these results gave a hint that the previously reported alternation in hix values of water extractable organic matter for biochar added soils cai et al 2020 could be probably disturbed by the added biochar rather than the genuine change in humification degree the sr values of pine bc demonstrated a first increase and a subsequent decrease as the function of the temperature while the opposite trend was exhibited for the manure and sludge bc these results disclosed that the dependencies of molecular size of bdom on pyrolysis temperature varied greatly among different feedstock types hansen et al 2016 helms et al 2008 overall the vast disparity of spectroscopic characteristics depended on both feedstock materials and pyrolysis temperatures four fluorescent components c1 c2 c3 and c4 were identified by the parafac model analyses fig 1 c1 displayed a prominent peak at ex em of 250 390 nm and was interpreted as polycyclic aromatic like fluorophores wang et al 2015b c2 with its maximum at ex em of 250 360 440 nm was assigned as terrestrial humic like fluorophores zhou et al 2019 the peak of c3 appeared at ex em of 250 340 387 nm which was identified as a microbial humic like fraction huang et al 2015 wang et al 2021 c4 showed primary peaks at 250 280 370 nm and was recognized as a protein like or tryptophan like substance bittar et al 2016 vines and terry 2020 the content of the four fluorescent components depended heavily on feedstock materials for instance when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c the relative abundance of polycyclic aromatic like c1 was 4 9 for sludge bc but 75 0 for walnut bc the protein like c4 fraction in bdom was significantly higher in sludge bc than other bcs at 500 and 700 c fig 1 suggesting that sludge bc derived dom may be more bio labile than the others at high pyrolysis temperatures lee et al 2018 the relative abundances of four fluorescence components varied greatly under different pyrolysis temperatures fig 1 generally more polycyclic aromatic like c1 but less protein like fraction c4 was contained in bdom with increasing pyrolysis temperature fig 1 in particular the relative abundances of c1 were 0 0 35 9 at 300 c 4 9 75 0 at 500 c and 16 4 95 5 at 700 c by contrast c4 accounted for 23 8 to 48 1 at 300 c while 0 0 to 8 6 at 700 c prior research has claimed that the thermal decomposition of protein during pyrolysis process contributed to the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via systematic and random depolymerization reactions knicker 2007 wang et al 2015b and this may explain the increase in c1 and decrease in c4 as a function of pyrolysis temperature in fig 1 lower average abundances of humic like fractions c2 and c3 were found at higher pyrolysis temperature fig 1 indicating less humic like materials from the dihydroxylation decarboxylation and aromatization reactions of biomass materials were generated when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 700 c demirbas 2004 gao et al 2020 wei et al 2020 3 4 formation and toxicity of dbp mixture the sdbp fp values i e dbp yield per doc of bdom were determined and found to depend on the feedstock type at a given pyrolysis temperature fig 2 a d for instance when the pyrolysis temperature was identically at 500 c the specific trihalomethane formation potential sthm fp values could have a 3 time difference ranging from 15 28 1 42 μg mg doc for walnut bc to 50 25 0 13 for sludge bc table s2 the specific haloacetonitrile formation potential shan fp values of bdom for n rich feedstocks were mostly higher than those from c rich feedstocks at any given pyrolysis temperatures fig 2b for instance the shan fp at 300 500 and 700 c were 0 02 0 14 0 23 0 64 and 0 03 0 18 μg mg doc for c rich feedstocks and 0 15 0 73 0 25 2 47 and 0 42 2 58 μg mg doc for n rich feedstocks table s2 the higher total nitrogen table 1 and weon contents table 2 in n rich feedstocks is likely the major factor for the higher shan fp for n rich feedstocks than c rich feedstocks wang et al 2015b pyrolysis temperature was identified as another key factor controlling the sdbp fp and its impact differed greatly among different feedstock types for instance the sthm fp inclined first and subsequently declined with increasing pyrolysis temperature for c rich pine and wheat bc as well as n rich alfalfa and sludge bc fig 2a while shan fp values of n rich sludge bc and manure bc were elevated as the pyrolysis temperature increased in terms of schd fp it declined gradually against pyrolysis temperature for c rich wheat and walnut bc and n rich alfalfa and sludge bc in contrast to sthm fp shan fp and schd fp the shkt fp consistently decreased with pyrolysis temperature regardless of feedstock type the amount of dbp precursors from 1 gram of biochar was estimated by dbp fpbiochar as shown in fig 2e h the dbp fpbiochar values for n rich feedstocks were markedly higher than those for c rich feedstocks at a given pyrolysis temperature for example han fpbiochar for three n rich feedstocks at 300 c ranged from 0 72 to 7 80 μg g biochar but from 0 04 to 0 39 μg g biochar for c rich feedstocks table s2 these findings suggest that disinfection byproduct formation potential would be higher from n rich feedstocks derived bdom than c rich feedstocks derived bdom furthermore dbp fpbiochar values were affected by the pyrolysis temperature as well basically the highest dbp fpbiochar values consistently occurred at pyrolysis temperature of 300 c regardless of feedstock type insignificant alternations in dbp fpbiochar were found between 500 and 700 c for most of the feedstocks the variations in dbp fpbiochar with pyrolysis temperature were similar to the variations in weoc and weon table 2 which suggests that the leachability of bdom from biochar is a critical factor on dbp fpbiochar as illustrated in fig 3 a the response of microtoxicity of dbp mixture in mg l equivalent zn ii to pyrolysis temperature differed among various feedstock types for instance the microtoxicity increased against pyrolysis temperature for alfalfa bc and manure bc but decreased with the pyrolysis temperature for sludge bc notably the microtoxicity of dbp mixture was significantly higher for chlorination of bdom from sludge bc than other feedstocks particularly the microtoxicity of dbp mixture for sludge bc produced at 300 c was equivalent to 1 71 mg l zn ii which was higher than the 72 h ec50 1 17 mg l and 96 h ec50 0 67 mg l of zinc chloride to daphnia magna reported in a previous study ergonul et al 2012 taking this into account the microtoxicity of the dbps produced from the chlorination of sludge derived bdom could not be neglected nevertheless in terms of genotoxicity indicated by the reactivity of β galactosidase none of the dbps formed from the chlorination of bdom were genotoxic regardless of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature as shown in fig 3b it is noteworthy that microtoxicity and genotoxicity in our study were both measured for the dbps induced from the chlorination of bdom at 3 mg l an environmentally relevant concentration since the biochars produced at 300 c are more potent to yield more bdom than those produced at higher temperatures they are expected to pose higher risks in order to address the concerns of the risks of bdom to drinking water sources the water extractable organic matter production and sdbp fp were compared with soil derived or other terrestrial dom in previous studies table 3 for instance the amount of weoc was ranging from 52 28 339 μg g soil in our study while 25 7600 μg g in previous studies the sthm fp shan fp schd fp and shkt fp were 5 3 50 3 0 02 2 6 0 2 9 2 and 0 05 0 5 μg mg doc in our study while 11 0 340 0 0 3 8 5 0 3 16 2 and 0 2 3 2 μg mg doc in previous studies respectively these results collectively demonstrated that weoc and specific formation potentials of dbps of the present study were quantitatively comparable with those in previous studies besides taking the potent toxicity of bdom e g sludge derived bdom into account its potential risks should not be diminished or negligible from the perspective of water safety and human health 3 5 linking dbp formation and toxicity with optical properties of bdom in order to obtain further insight into the relative contributions of bdom properties to the formation and toxicity of disinfection byproducts all the measured bdom characteristics were incorporated to create principal component analysis pca plots fig 4 the first two principal components explained 58 4 of the total variation in all parameters pc1 36 7 pc2 21 7 pc1 was associated with more protein like terrestrial humic like and less aromatic dom components because the fluorescent protein like c4 had relatively high positive loadings on pc1 while the polycyclic aromatics like c1 hix and suva254 were highly correlated and had negative loadings on pc1 fig 4a pc2 can be explained by less low molecular weight humic like dom as sr and c2 were placed on the negative side of pc2 fig 4a sthm fp had a high positive correlation with c3 and fi and negatively correlated with suva254 and sr fig 4a table s3 suggesting that humic like component with lower aromaticity and larger molecular weight from microbial sources in dom were likely the important sources of thms this result agrees well with the arguments that the dom reactivities toward the formation of thms were related to non fresh high molecular weight humic like components chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 pifer and fairey 2012 wang et al 2015a shan fp was positively correlated with fi and c3 and negatively correlated with sr fig 4a table s3 indicating that the high contribution of high molecular weight and microbial humic like dom components to form hans the negative correlation between schd fp and suva254 suggests that the less aromatic fractions such as oxygen containing functional groups including ketone carbonyl groups in dom have high reactivity in forming chd świetlik et al 2004 shkt fp was positively correlated with c2 and c4 but negatively correlated with suva254 and hix this infers that less humified terrestrial humic like and protein like components are highly reactive hkt precursors which was partially supported by the prior studies for instance our previous study found that humic like component and its correlated component is a source of hkts li et al 2020 and another study demonstrated that hkts had its highest values when the precursor was less aromatic and humified dom wang et al 2015a dbps microtoxicity was only weakly and positively linked to shkt fp r2 0 47 p 0 05 table s3 instead of other dbps and genotoxicity was not correlated to any dbps this finding was in line with the previous report that commonly detected dbps made a weak contribution to the overall dbps toxicity despite their relatively high abundances han and zhang 2018 li et al 2020 the first and second principal component scores results in fig 4b demonstrated that the pine bc 700 wheat bc 700 walnut bc 700 alfalfa bc 700 and manure bc 700 were more clustered which could be explained by similar hix and aromaticity as well as relative abundance of polycyclic aromatic like component it is noted that the pc1 scores decreased remarkably from positive to negative values when the pyrolysis temperature was increasing from 300 to 700 c for five feedstock types pine bc wheat bc walnut bc alfalfa bc and manure bc this result was in accordance with the decrease of tryptophan like c4 component as demonstrated in fig 1 moreover pc1 scores of sludge bc were in the following order sludge bc 500 sludge bc 300 sludge bc 700 which agreed well with the relative abundance of tryptophan like c4 shown in fig 1 in addition all the samples excluding the outlier sludge bc 500 were relatively more clustered in pc2 axis compared to pc1 axis this result indicated that the molecular weight of dom did not vary greatly under different feedstock types and pyrolysis temperatures 4 conclusion feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature were found as the key factors controlling the quantity and quality characteristics of bdom as well as the bdom reactivity with chlorine to form dbps of varying degrees of toxicity bdom characteristics differed significantly between c rich and n rich feedstock type to be specific biochar from c rich feedstocks had lower n c ratios than that from n rich feedstocks and the intimate association between carbon and nitrogen contents and pyrolysis temperature varied greatly among different feedstock types the vast disparity of aromaticity and molecular size dependent on the biochar pyrolysis temperature and feedstocks types were also observed more polycyclic aromatics like but less humic like and protein like fractions were contained in bdom as a function of temperature dom reactivity toward the formation of disinfection byproducts was higher in n rich feedstocks derived bdom and was the highest at low temperature 300 c the elevation in specific nitrogenous han formation potentials from n rich feedstocks resulted from the higher organic nitrogen content even though none of the dbps were genotoxic the microtoxicity of dbp mixture was more potent and differed significantly among various feedstock types these results implied that the pyrolysis conditions of biochar affected the spectral and molecular characteristics of bdom and altered its chlorine reactivity in forming disinfection byproducts however when the biochar produced under different feedstock types and pyrolysis conditions are intensively applied to the soils how the long term effect of biochar application particularly for the n rich biochars in watersheds on the dbps precursors and drinking water safety

16313,nature based solutions including rooftop water storage ponds are increasingly adopted in cities as new eco designs to address climate change issues such as water scarcity and storm water runoff macrophytes may be valuable additions for treating stored rooftop waters and provisioning other services including aquaponics esthetic and wildlife conservation values however the efficacy of macrophyte treatments has not been tested with influxes of different labile carbon loadings such as those occurring in storms moreover little is known about how macrophytes affect communities of metazoans and microbes including protozoans which are key players in the water treatment process here we experimentally investigated the effectiveness of two widely distributed macrophytes ceratophyllum demersum and egeria densa for treating drained rooftop water fed with two types of leaf litter namely quercus robur high c lability and quercus rubra low c lability c demersum was better than e densa at reducing water conductivity by 10 40 µs cm tds by 10 18 mg l doc by 4 5 mg l and at increasing water transparency by 4 9 water o2 levels by 19 27 and daylight ph by 0 9 1 3 compared to leaf litter only microcosms after 30 days each treatment developed a different community of algae protozoa and metazoa greater plant mass and epiphytic chlorophyll a suggested that c demersum was better at providing supporting habitat than e densa the two macrophytes did not differ in detritus accumulation but e densa was more prone to develop filamentous bacteria which cause sludge bulking in water treatment systems our study highlights the superior capacity of c demersum and the usefulness of whole ecosystem experiments in choosing the most adequate macrophyte species for nature based engineered solutions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water treatment storm water runoff rainwater harvesting water quality aquatic plants protozoa eutrophication 1 introduction rainwater harvesting from rooftops is becoming common in many parts of the world as aridity increases due to climate change campisano et al 2017 rodak et al 2020 stored rooftop water has many uses including for drinking water lim and jiang 2013 aquaponics million et al 2016 alsanius et al 2017 and the creation of ponds with esthetic and wildlife conservation values hassall and anderson 2015 toboso chavero et al 2019 collected rooftop water can be treated using technology for reducing nutrient content or microbial load e g ultrafiltration ozonation rodak et al 2020 however these treatments may not always be cost effective or do not have the additional values of green technology including providing raw materials for biofuel food for livestock or habitat for biodiversity moore and hunt 2012 kurniawan et al 2021 potential green methods for treating rooftop water may be the use of submerged macrophytes such as the hornworth ceratophyllum demersum l and the brazilian elodea egeria densa planch 1849 brix 1994 feijoó et al 2002 these fast growing perennial macrophytes are recommended for wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands khan et al 2009 pietro et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 however as far as we are aware there is no study comparing the performance of these macrophytes as water treatment systems in poorly mineralized waters such as storm water runoff waters with low mineral content may alter the growth of these macrophytes directly walstad 1999 or by increasing the toxic effects of compounds such as ammonia vines and wedding 1960 thurston et al 1981 this is one of the toxins generated in waters after atmospheric nitrogen deposition which increased globally from 86 6 to 96 6 tgn year 1 between 1984 and 2016 decina et al 2020 the potential of c demersum and e densa as water treatment systems can be from direct plant assimilation or to the microbes and metazoa that are associated with these macrophytes brix 1994 pietro et al 2006 these macrophytes may remove contaminants from water including nutrients feijoó et al 2002 pietro et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 and reduce harmful algal blooms by releasing algal growth inhibitors wium andersen et al 1983 pietro et al 2006 gross et al 2003 fewer algae may mean less food for their consumers including protozoans carlough and meyer 1990 finlay and esteban 1998 unless these taxa feed on bacteria and fungi both of which participate in processing detritus from dead plants and consumers srivastava and bell 2009 gessner et al 2010 the impacts of c demersum and e densa on microbial assemblages including protozoa have not been compared in detail because to our knowledge only c demersum has protozoan inventories babko et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 it is also largely unknown how the potential of c demersum and e densa as water treatment systems may be altered by changes in the biodegradability of organic matter in rooftop water including leaf litter which is a major source of organic carbon to freshwaters gessner et al 2010 stoler and relyea 2016 biodegradability is the rate of biological breakdown which is influenced by the lability of organic carbon e g c n ratio lignin content and environmental factors e g temperature water nutrient levels stoler and relyea 2016 stanek and stefanowicz 2019 influxes of organic matter with very labile carbon may boost nutrient and microbe numbers in waters to levels that might lead to eutrophication mason 1996 le moal et al 2019 however if there is concurrent release of low biodegradable substances such as tannins then nutrients may not boost ecosystem productivity tannins increase water turbidity julkunen tiitto and haggman 2009 which decreases photosynthesis efficiency e g machado et al 2020 therefore the potential of c demersum and e densa in green technology applications will be better understood if their performance is tested experimentally with different labile organic carbon loadings the goal of this study was to investigate experimentally the effectiveness of c demersum and e densa in water treatment systems and as supporting habitat for eukaryotic microbial and metazoan assemblages in drained rooftop water provisioned with two types of leaf litter namely quercus robur high biodegradability and quercus rubra low biodegradability stanek and stefanowicz 2019 understanding the biological effects of q rubra is important because this american tree species is listed as naturalized in many countries within the distributional range of the european native q robur stanek and stefanowicz 2019 including spain where our study was conducted if c demersum and e densa are effective in water treatment we expected an improvement in drained rooftop water with leaf litter shown by a reduction in nutrients conductivity and suspended solids moreover if macrophytes are useful for widespread use in water treatment we expected that the two macrophyte treatments would perform equally well and improve water quality and boost the density and biomass of high order consumers e g rotifers crustaceans in particular with the more labile organic carbon source q robur leaves last detritus production is a major concern in water treatment including those using nature based solutions such as ours maceda veiga et al 2015 therefore the better water treatment would be one that improves water quality while also reducing sludge production including aggregates of filamentous organisms martins et al 2004 perez uz et al 2010 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the experimental design the factorial experiment was conducted over 30 days in august 2017 in cylindrical microcosms 12 cm height x 11 cm diameter 1 l in the o incio pilot agro fluvial observatory 42 38 n 7 21 e lugo spain the treatments i e experimental factors were the macrophyte species c demersum and e densa and the type of abscised tree leaves quercus robur and q rubra which produced differences in labile organic carbon loadings see details in section 2 2 2 treatments were randomly allocated to 80 microcosms there were 10 microcosms replicates each for tree leaves only macrophytes only and for tree leaves with macrophytes fig 1 there were replicates for the two species of tree leaves and macrophytes e g 10 microcosms with q rubra and c demersum and 10 for q rubra and e densa we did not have rooftop water only microcosms because this was the least realistic setting all microcosms were placed on the ground under a balcony to protect microcosms from rain but to allow natural temperature and light fluctuations mean sd daily air temperature was 20 7 c mean light intensity at the top of microcosms was 6600 400 lux at 12 am microcosms were filled with 225 ml of water from a rainwater collector without macrophytes and with another 725 ml from a mixture of rooftop water from six houses in the municipality of o incio lugo northwestern spain after a storm two of the roofs were made of slate two of asbestos sheeting and two of tiles which were the three main roof types in the study area the area is relatively far from industries 30 km but atmospheric pollution can arrive from further afield decina et al 2020 we harvested the first 25 l of drained rooftop water from each roof and used the supernatant water of an homogenized sample to fill the microcosms within 24 h of harvesting water properties were ph 7 4 total nitrogen 0 5 mg l and dissolved organic carbon doc 5 mg l macrophytes and tree leaves were added after 24 h section 2 2 2 and we measured after 30 days water properties final plant size remnant tree leaf biomass microbes and metazoans section 2 2 3 thirty days is within the range of hydraulic retention times of constructed wetlands moore and hunt 2012 maceda veiga et al 2015 and this duration is sufficient for biological assemblages with fast generation times such as those of microbial eukaryotes to reach mature developmental stages e g salvadó 1994 2 2 plant and labile organic carbon sources plant fragments of c demersum n 30 and e densa n 30 used in this study were apical shoots haphazardly selected from mother plants kept at the pilot agrofluvial observatory o incio spain 42 39 n 7 21 w we introduced a fragment of 8 cm length from unbranched sections of a stem in microcosms with macrophytes plant fragments were gently brushed and rinsed in tap water to remove debris or epiphytes all fragments of each plant species had similar morphologies e g number and size internodes and size expressed as biomass mean sd 0 52 0 05 g c demersum and 0 45 0 03 g e densa or surface area 20 3 cm2 and 16 4 cm2 mother plants were brought in 2003 as four apical shoots of each species and have since grown in monocultures in two 200 l tanks fed with rainwater from rooftops ph 8 1 water conductivity 116 µs cm total nitrogen 4 5 mg l the four shoots of each species were from four different aquarium plant importers to potentially increase the genetic pool sources of labile organic carbon were freshly abscised leaves of two tree species namely european oak quercus robur l n 30 leaves and american oak quercus rubra l n 30 leaves growing together in a forest patch from o incio we collected 30 leaves from five tree individuals and selected similarly sized tree leaves of the pool to be cut and introduced part by part in microcosms until reaching 1 g we chose 1 g of these tree leaves per microcosm because this dry mass of leaf litter typifies amounts in rooftops scaled by the volume of our microcosms this was seen in our pilot study which also found that differences in growth of c demersum and e densa depending on these leaf litter types with the stronger negative effects for e densa growth n 3 microcosms each differences in tissue composition mean se among leaves mostly arise from elements related to biodegradability namely c n and lignin q robur c n 37 7 5 1 lignin 234 15 ca 12 0 5 mg 1 8 0 1 p 1 7 0 1 in mg g 1 litter and q rubra c n 68 7 5 5 lignin 198 1 ca 11 8 0 6 mg

than q rubra 2 3 microcosm surveys at the end of the experiment 30 days we recorded 1 ten water properties 2 three macrophyte properties 3 remnant tree leaf mass 4 taxonomic composition of primary producers algae and consumers protozoa and metazoa and 5 three measures of sludge production samples from 1 to 3 were taken before microcosms contents were homogenized by 10 manual inversion shakes before taking samples for 4 and 5 o2 saturation dissolved o2 concentration mg l ph conductivity µs cm water turbidity and total dissolved solids tds mg l were measured in situ using digital probes general water hardness dgh was measured using the colorimetric test visocolor macherey nagel germany we also calculated the day night water ph balance defined as the difference in ph between a period of high photosynthetic activity 14 00 h and after the night 7 00 h it is well known that photosynthesis of submerged macrophytes requires hco3 uptake that eventually increases water ph due to the release of oh from the plants pedersen et al 2013 another water property was the balance between o2 production and consumption for 30 min to assess the level of autotrophy which relates to eutrophication staehr et al 2012 microcosms were topped with rainwater and sealed with plastic to act as metabolic chambers see staehr et al 2012 by means of recording the difference in the initial and final o2 values at day 21 last microcosms were emptied through whatman gf f glass fiber filters u k the filterate was frozen at 20 c until analyses of chlorophyll a µg l were made hereafter water chlorophyll a water samples of 100 ml were frozen similarly to quantify total nitrogen mg l and doc at the university of barcelona following well established procedures outlined in elosegui and sabater 2009 plant fragments were extracted from microcosms and brushed to detach epiphytes onto a tray filled with tap water elosegui and sabater 2009 the surface area of each plant mm2 was calculated from scanned geometries and the final plant size was also expressed as mg ww epiphytic algal biomass was estimated by the concentration of chlorophyll a in the rinsed water which was measured as described in 1 and expressed as µg chlorophyll a per g of macrophyte remnant dead tree leaf mass after 30 days was calculated based on the difference in initial and final dry weight mass values of leaves at 70 c for 72 h elosegui and sabater 2009 the density of primary producers and consumers was determined in two steps a the content of microcosm was sieved through a 250 µm mesh to count large metazoa crustacea and b three 50 ml tubes of filtered water were collected per microcosm two of which were fixed in 4 formaldehyde for counting green algae diatoms amoeba flagellates ciliates and metazoans crustaceans rotifers gastrotrichs and helminths we examined 75 µl of a homogenized water sample from each microcosm drop by drop with a microscope at x100 and x400 maceda veiga et al 2015 the third tube was kept in the refrigerator at 4 c for fresh inspection at the field station to explore the taxa present prior to fixation and storage which may cause protozoan shrinkage from prior experience the preservation of hypotrichs e g aspidisca and euplotes is poor and so these are excluded from analyses taxonomic identifications were based on morphological traits following foissner et al 1991 1995 for ciliates krammer and lange bertalot 1986 1991 for algae and streble and krauter 1987 for metazoans and algae density data ind ml were to genus or the lowest practical taxonomical category density data were converted into biomass following standard methods for each taxon e g equations based on biovolume estimates dumont et al 1975 kremer et al 2014 in the absence of published equations we used carbon constants assumed for the group e g 0 22 pg c µm3 for nanoflagellates børsheim and bratbak 1987 protozoan assemblages were used to calculate the saprobity index by zelinka and marvan 1961 which ranks organic matter content in five ordinal categories i xenosaprobity ii oligosaprobity iii β mesosaprobity iv α mesosaprobity and v polisaprobity the amounts of detritus filamentous algae and filamentous bacteria including cyanobacteria were ranked from 0 to 5 using the samples processed for microscopy detailed above and their relative abundance in the 75 µl of water examined eikelboom 2000 we measured filamentous organisms because they prevent sedimentation and cause sludge bulking martins et al 2004 2 4 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted in r r core team 2014 the distributions of all variables were inspected prior to modeling and variables other than ph were log transformed to meet statistical requirements of models e g reducing severe kurtosis to examine effects of the 30 day water treatment on macrophytes and dead tree leaves themselves we compared the biomass and surface area of macrophytes and remnant dead tree litter mass among treatments using gaussian error distribution in the r function glm to test how c demersum and e densa performed relative to one another as water treatments we used the r function glm to compare the eleven water properties between leaf rooftop water filled microcosms with and without macrophytes we also used taxon rank abundance curves the r function rankabuncomp kindt and kindt 2008 to visually inspect the role of the two species of macrophytes as supporting habitat for autotrophs algae and heterotrophs flagellates amoeba ciliates and metazoa the rank abundance diagrams do not rely on a single statistic as diversity indices do and inform richness and evenness by reporting the whole distribution of abundances magurran 2004 the x axis is the observed richness and the overall slope is the evenness with a steeper curve indicative of low evenness magurran 2004 we used the r function glm to statistically compare the total taxon richness and densities of autotrophs heterotrophic microbial eukaryotes and metazoa among treatments differences in taxonomic composition were assessed using the r function adonis permanova nperm 999 oksanen et al 2007 and the function permutest betadisper was used to check whether differences in data dispersion affected permanova analyses oksanen et al 2007 last we used the r function indval to identify the most characteristic taxa for each treatment groups based on permutation tests de cáceres et al 2012 the indicator value of each taxon ranges from 0 to 1 and reaches its maximum value when all individuals of a taxon are in all microcosms of a group e g c demersum with q robur leaves to further study the performance of c demersum and e densa in microcosms we used the r function glm to compare biomasses of autotrophs and heterotrophs and indicators of sludge production among experimental factors statistical significance of experimental factors was tested with f tests and pair wise comparisons between levels of each treatment e g macrophyte type were examined using the r function lsmeans lenth and hervé 2015 statistical significance was at α 0 05 3 results 3 1 characteristics of macrophytes and dead tree leaves at 30 days the biomass and surface area of macrophyte fragments were greater in c demersum than in e densa table 1 fig 2 ab the concentration of epiphytic chlorophyll a per gram of macrophyte was greater with c demersum than with e densa table 1 fig 2c drained rooftop water with different organic carbon loadings i e types of dead tree leaves did not have significant effects on the final biomasses and surface areas of the two macrophyte species table 1 all types of tree leaves significantly reduced epiphytic chlorophyll a in c demersum and e densa but the effects were more marked for c demersum by 47 76 table 1 fig 2c the presence of dead tree leaves significantly affected the day night ph balance with greater values in microcosms with c demersum and dead tree leaves table 1 fig 2d q robur leaves had decomposed more 68 than those of q rubra 75 irrespective of the two macrophyte treatments fig 2f 3 2 effects of the macrophyte treatments on water quality drained rooftop waters

of water chlorophyll a water turbidity and doc table 2 appendix s1 o2 production was greater than o2 consumption when q robur microcosms were sealed for 30 min during daylight while the net o2 production was negative for q rubra microcosms 30 min o2 balance in table 2 appendix s1 leaf litter type did not significantly affect the other six water properties including total n table 2 appendix

by 19 27 and daylight ph by 0 9 1 3 all median values of the respective macrophyte treatments compared to microcosms with only leaf litter at 30 days table 2 appendix s1 however despite its lower biomass the e densa treatment was better at reducing water chlorophyll a by 14 34 µg l table 2 appendix s1 the day night ph balance was significantly more positive for e densa than for c demersum in the presence of leaf litter table 2 appendix s1 none of the two macrophytes had a significant effect on total n water concentrations table 2 appendix s1 3 3 effects of the macrophyte treatments on the biological assemblages and sludge the c demersum and e densa treatments did not significantly differ in the total density and taxon richness of autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms table 3 fig 3 the type of leaf litter significantly affected the density and taxon richness of autotrophs table 3 with the greatest values for e densa with q robur leaves fig 3 the same relationship held for the density of metazoa but not for heterotrophic microbes because their density did not significantly differ among treatments table 3 the taxonomic composition of autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms was heterogeneous among the leaf litter macrophyte treatments table 3 fig 3 there was greater taxon evenness for autotrophs than for heterotrophs rank abundance curves fig 3 the most characteristic

capacity of the european native macrophyte c demersum for treating drained rooftop water when compared to the south american macrophyte e densa we proved the efficacy of the macrophytes with two types of organic carbon loadings q robur high biodegradability and q rubra low biodegradability and found that c demersum was better than e densa at water oxygenation and at lessening water conductivity and turbidity arising respectively from the decomposition of leaves from the american oak q rubra and the native oak q robur leaves of q robur decomposed faster than those of q rubra which released more dissolved organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorous to water and hence stimulated production of water chlorophyll a egeria densa was better at reducing water chlorophyll a after 30 days despite having less biomass than c demersum however microcosms with e densa developed more non epiphytic organisms which cause sludge bulking which is a major issue in water treatment systems madoni 2003 martins et al 2004 the use of microcosms is common in aquatic ecology and to assess sewage treatments e g gause 1934 srivastava et al 2004 benton et al 2007 altermatt et al 2015 maceda veiga et al 2015 but microcosm based inferences are inevitably limited by the spatial scale and duration of the experiment carpenter 1996 englund and cooper 2003 we dealt with potential temporal changes by measuring 27 biological and environmental properties with different potential response durations ranging from hours e g o2 production and microbial densities to weeks e g plant growth elosegui and sabater 2009 microcosms also were pertinent because we were interested in studying small organisms metazoans e g rotifers gastrotrichs and microbial eukaryotes e g amoeba ciliates all of which have fast generation times e g 13 33 generations of microbes in 4 weeks and are the dominant biological communities in wastewater treatment plants alongside procariotes and viruses curds 1992 madoni 2003 perez uz et al 2010 although we did not measure non filamentous bacteria we examined ecological functions in which these bacteria participate e g 30 min o2 balance leaf litter decomposition and we studied microbial eukaryotes e g flagellates and ciliates whose densities typically depends on bacterial load curds 1992 salvadó and gracia 1993 appendix s2 the expected temporal succession of these microbial eukaryotic assemblages also can be inferred from sewage treatment plant monitoring flagellates dominate in density in the initial more disturbed assemblages scuticociliates at intermediate levels and sessile peritric ciliates and testate amoeba dominate in the final more stable eukaryotic microbial assemblages salvadó 1994 last rooftop water storage tanks are expected to differ from sewage treatment plants in type intensity and frequency of sewage effluent volumes madoni 2003 moore and hunt 2012 nevertheless among the 50 taxa listed appendix s3 we recorded taxa common and abundant in sewage treatment plants of different ages e g heterotrophic nanoflagellates the scuticociliate cyclidium glaucoma and the testate amoeba arcella sp salvadó 1994 madoni 2003 there were also epibionts characteristic of c demersum growing in natural conditions e g cocconeis nitzschia zhang et al 2020 therefore we are confident that the manageable size of microcosms allowing greater replication is a good first step to get a general view of how these plant treatments may work before increasing experimental scales 4 1 c demersum was superior to e densa in treating poorly mineralized rooftop waters despite the two macrophytes being regarded as fast growing plants with broad tolerances to a large range of conditions feijoó et al 2002 pietro et al 2006 c demersum had greater size than e densa after 30 days in all experimental conditions mother plants of the two species had grown for 12 years as floating mats in rainwater collectors see methods so the plants should be acclimatized to the properties of rainwater the lesser growth of e densa probably was due to overgrowth of the filamentous non epiphytic green algae cladophora which may have shaded the plant or have released plant growth inhibitors phillips et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 another factor probably of lesser importance might have been the shading from epiphytic algae e g tóth 2013 because e densa had less epiphytic algae scaled by the macrophyte biomass than did c demersum the overgrowth of suspended algae also did not seem to affect e densa performance because water chlorophyll a from leaf litter decomposition was reduced by the plant by up to 34 µl g which is a value typical of highly eutrophic lakes nürnberg 1996 besides direct plant effects a decrease in algal biomass may be due to differences in the action of algal grazers such as ostracods which were in all microcosms fed with dead tree leaves at a mean density of 28 36 ind l however ostracod grazing on filamentous algae is low compared to that of snails pinowska 2002 yan et al 2020 there were no snails in microcosms because snail survival might be low given the low mineral content in rooftop water walstad 1999 but if present snails might have consumed more e densa than c demersum sheldon 1987 pinowska 2002 another factor might have been that non epiphytic algae had fewer competitors with c demersum microcosms had c 12 h of direct sunlight on a sunny day whereas those of mother plants of each macrophyte species had c 6 h amv observ however the potential optimization of growth conditions for e densa must be done in the native distributional range because the sale of e densa is now prohibited in europe including spain because of its invasiveness curt et al 2010 4 2 tree leaf runoff from subsidies to contaminants although drained rooftop water may contain relatively high levels of nutrients lye 2009 meera and ahammed 2006 low total n values such as in our microcosms 0 5 mg l 1 are common in the highly variable contaminant loads in rooftop waters arising from time since rain or wind dispersion de buyck et al 2021 despite this microcosms with q robur and q rubra reached relatively high levels of eutrophication e g chlorophyll a 30 µl g nürnberg 1996 enabling us to test the capacity of e densa and c demersum to deal with eutrophic waters our experiment was realistic in that leaf litter decomposition produces little biodegradable compounds which stain water julkunen tiitto and haggman 2009 such as occurs in storm waters and sewage effluents madoni 2003 shen et al 2018 therefore c demersum may have more potential than e densa for treating other water types given that its growth was less affected by the runoff treatments the faster decomposition rate of q robur leaves than those of q rubra is consistent with work on the effects of q rubra on microbes in its invasive range in standardized common garden conditions hobbie et al 2006 stanek and stefanowicz 2019 the slower leaf litter breakdown of q rubra leaves may be due to lower biomass of microbes arising from higher values of c n ratio and phenols compared to q robur our results supported such effects by finding lesser biomass of heterotrophic eukaryotic microbes flagellates and ciliates in q rubra than in q robur microcosms although we did not study bacteria and fungi both of which are involved in the leaf litter decomposition szabó et al 2000 pascoal and cásio et al 2004 decreases in biomasses of these microbes probably would have decreased biomass of heterotrophic eukaryotic microbes the studied taxa e g cyclidium glaucoma nanoflagellates are bacterivores jezbera et al 2005 however the effects of changes in the quality of basal resources on upper trophic levels can be attenuated at least partially by food web complexity srivastava and bell 2009 the latter may explain why the biomass of metazoa did not show significant differences between q rubra and q robur leaves although heterotrophic eukaryotic microbial biomass did so 4 3 other advantages of macrophytes as water treatment systems alongside improving water quality an advantage of macrophyte water treatments is that they have other environmental benefits compared to hard engineered solutions moore and hunt 2012 kurniawan et al 2021 one of these values is providing food for livestock which may be useful for projects of circular economy such as aquaponics or other multi trophic systems million et al 2016 alsanius et al 2017 stevčić et al 2020 in which the water flows from fish tanks to plant tanks and return clean to the former the green tank may then provide both water and food for fish adults or larvae such as ciliates rotifers and daphnia diver and rinehart 2000 stevčić et al 2020 and raw material for biofuel kurniawan et al 2021 the lack of significant differences in total metazoan biomass between c demersum and e densa might suggest a similar potential of the two plants in this regard however total biomass does not deal with food quality which when allied to the differences in the taxonomic composition of organisms between the two macrophyte species suggests that c demersum and e densa are not equals in providing habitat for native biodiversity winter water temperatures may reduce the usefulness of macrophyte water treatments but countries with mediterranean climate probably have relatively long growing periods for the two plants the temperature tolerance range of c demersum is 5 35 c ma et al 2009 and that of e densa is 10 35 c haramoto and ikusima 1988 and mean monthly air temperature of barcelona city sd was 16 5 c mean monthly minimum 8 and maximum 24 between 1981 2010 www aemet es nevertheless mats of c demersum and e densa in the study area survive winters with air temperatures 1 c and this does not seem to affect much the summer performance of c demersum four rooftop water storage ponds 400 l were built after this study in the o incio observatory two with c demersum and two without plants and were visually inspected from 2018 to 2021 waters were clearer for c demersum than for ponds without the plant farmers personal observations given that runoff water quantity and quality probably varied substantially these years the benefits of c demersum seen in microcosms might well apply to broader spatial and temporal scales at least in man made ecosystems for water treatment purposes 5 conclusions our study suggests that c demersum is superior to e densa for treating rooftop water and for providing food for consumers water transparency conductivity water chlorophyll a and oxygenation were the water properties most affected by the type of macrophyte probably due to a combination of nutrient competition and the release of algal growth inhibitors pietro et al 2006 gross et al 2003 influxes of two types of carbon loading affected the taxonomic composition and biomass of various groups of algae and eukaryotic microbes in both c demersum and e densa microcosms as expected from the importance of leaf litter in fuelling food webs srivastava and bell 2009 gessner et al 2010 stoler and relyea 2016 given food web complexity our study suggests the

16313,nature based solutions including rooftop water storage ponds are increasingly adopted in cities as new eco designs to address climate change issues such as water scarcity and storm water runoff macrophytes may be valuable additions for treating stored rooftop waters and provisioning other services including aquaponics esthetic and wildlife conservation values however the efficacy of macrophyte treatments has not been tested with influxes of different labile carbon loadings such as those occurring in storms moreover little is known about how macrophytes affect communities of metazoans and microbes including protozoans which are key players in the water treatment process here we experimentally investigated the effectiveness of two widely distributed macrophytes ceratophyllum demersum and egeria densa for treating drained rooftop water fed with two types of leaf litter namely quercus robur high c lability and quercus rubra low c lability c demersum was better than e densa at reducing water conductivity by 10 40 µs cm tds by 10 18 mg l doc by 4 5 mg l and at increasing water transparency by 4 9 water o2 levels by 19 27 and daylight ph by 0 9 1 3 compared to leaf litter only microcosms after 30 days each treatment developed a different community of algae protozoa and metazoa greater plant mass and epiphytic chlorophyll a suggested that c demersum was better at providing supporting habitat than e densa the two macrophytes did not differ in detritus accumulation but e densa was more prone to develop filamentous bacteria which cause sludge bulking in water treatment systems our study highlights the superior capacity of c demersum and the usefulness of whole ecosystem experiments in choosing the most adequate macrophyte species for nature based

rainwater harvesting from rooftops is becoming common in many parts of the world as aridity increases due to climate change campisano et al 2017 rodak et al 2020 stored rooftop water has many uses

treatments may not always be cost effective or do not have the additional values of green technology including providing raw materials for biofuel food for livestock or habitat for biodiversity moore and hunt 2012 kurniawan et al 2021 potential green methods for treating rooftop water may be the use of submerged macrophytes such as the hornworth ceratophyllum demersum l and the brazilian elodea egeria densa planch 1849 brix 1994 feijoó et al 2002 these fast growing perennial macrophytes are recommended for wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands khan et al 2009 pietro et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 however as far as we are aware there is no study comparing the performance of these macrophytes as water treatment systems in poorly mineralized waters such as storm water runoff waters with low mineral content may alter the growth of these macrophytes directly walstad 1999 or by increasing the toxic effects of compounds such as ammonia vines and wedding 1960 thurston et al 1981 this is one of the toxins generated in waters after atmospheric nitrogen deposition which increased globally from 86 6 to 96 6 tgn year 1 between 1984 and 2016 decina et al 2020 the potential of c demersum and e densa as water treatment systems can be from direct plant assimilation or to the microbes and metazoa that are associated with these macrophytes brix 1994 pietro et al 2006 these macrophytes may remove contaminants from water including nutrients feijoó et al 2002 pietro et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 and reduce harmful algal blooms by releasing algal growth inhibitors wium andersen et al 1983 pietro et al 2006 gross et al 2003 fewer algae may mean less food for their consumers including protozoans carlough and meyer 1990 finlay and esteban 1998 unless these taxa feed on bacteria and fungi both of which participate in processing detritus from dead plants and consumers srivastava and bell 2009 gessner et al 2010 the impacts of c demersum and e densa on microbial assemblages including protozoa have not been compared in detail because to our knowledge only c demersum has protozoan inventories babko et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 it is also largely unknown how the potential of c demersum and e densa as water treatment systems may be altered by changes in the biodegradability of organic matter in rooftop water including leaf litter which is a major source of organic carbon to freshwaters gessner et al 2010 stoler and relyea 2016 biodegradability is the rate of biological breakdown which is influenced by the lability of organic carbon e g c n ratio lignin content and environmental factors e g temperature water nutrient levels stoler and relyea 2016 stanek and stefanowicz 2019 influxes of organic matter with very labile carbon may boost nutrient and microbe numbers in waters to levels that might lead to eutrophication mason 1996 le moal et al 2019 however if there is concurrent release of low biodegradable substances such as tannins then nutrients may not boost ecosystem productivity tannins increase water turbidity julkunen tiitto and haggman 2009 which decreases photosynthesis efficiency e g machado et al 2020 therefore the potential of c demersum and e densa in green technology applications will be better understood if their performance is tested experimentally with different labile organic carbon loadings the goal of this study was to investigate experimentally the effectiveness of c demersum and e densa in water treatment systems and as supporting habitat for eukaryotic microbial and metazoan assemblages in drained rooftop water provisioned with two types of leaf litter namely quercus robur high biodegradability and quercus rubra low biodegradability stanek and stefanowicz 2019 understanding the biological effects of q rubra is important because this american tree species is listed as naturalized in many countries within the distributional range of the european native q robur stanek and stefanowicz 2019 including spain where our study was conducted if c demersum and e densa are effective in water treatment we expected an improvement in drained rooftop water with leaf litter shown by a reduction in nutrients conductivity and suspended solids moreover if macrophytes are useful for widespread use in water treatment we expected that the two macrophyte treatments would perform equally well and improve water quality and boost the density and biomass of high order consumers e g rotifers crustaceans in particular with the more labile organic carbon source q robur leaves last detritus production is a major concern in water treatment including those using nature based solutions such as ours maceda veiga et al 2015 therefore the better water treatment would be one that improves water quality while also reducing sludge production including aggregates of filamentous organisms martins et al 2004 perez uz et al 2010 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the experimental design the factorial experiment was conducted over 30 days in august 2017 in cylindrical microcosms 12 cm height x 11 cm diameter 1 l in the o incio pilot agro fluvial observatory 42 38 n 7 21 e lugo spain the treatments i e experimental factors were the macrophyte species c demersum and e densa and the type of abscised tree leaves quercus robur and q rubra which produced differences in labile organic carbon loadings see details in section 2 2 2 treatments were randomly allocated to 80 microcosms there were 10 microcosms replicates each for tree leaves only macrophytes only and for tree leaves with macrophytes fig 1 there were replicates for the two species of tree leaves and macrophytes e g 10 microcosms with q rubra and c demersum and 10 for q rubra and e densa we did not have rooftop water only microcosms because this was the least realistic setting all microcosms were placed on the ground under a balcony to protect microcosms from rain but to allow natural temperature and light fluctuations mean sd daily air temperature was 20 7 c mean light intensity at the top of microcosms was 6600 400 lux at 12 am microcosms were filled with 225 ml of water from a rainwater collector without macrophytes and with another 725 ml from a mixture of rooftop water from six houses in the municipality of o incio lugo northwestern spain after a storm two of the roofs were made of slate two of asbestos sheeting and two of tiles which were the three main roof types in the study area the area is relatively far from industries 30 km but atmospheric pollution can arrive from further afield decina et al 2020 we harvested the first 25 l of drained rooftop water from each roof and used the supernatant water of an homogenized sample to fill the microcosms within 24 h of harvesting water properties were ph 7 4 total nitrogen 0 5 mg l and dissolved organic carbon doc 5 mg l macrophytes and tree leaves were added after 24 h section 2 2 2 and we measured after 30 days water properties final plant size remnant tree leaf biomass microbes and metazoans section 2 2 3 thirty days is within the range of hydraulic retention times of constructed wetlands moore and hunt 2012 maceda veiga et al 2015 and this duration is sufficient for biological assemblages with fast generation times such as those of microbial eukaryotes to reach mature developmental stages e g salvadó 1994 2 2 plant and labile organic carbon sources plant fragments of c demersum n 30 and e densa n 30 used in this study were apical shoots haphazardly selected from mother plants kept at the pilot agrofluvial observatory o incio spain 42 39 n 7 21 w we introduced a fragment of 8 cm length from unbranched sections of a stem in microcosms with macrophytes plant fragments were gently brushed and rinsed in tap water to remove debris or epiphytes all fragments of each plant species had similar morphologies e g number and size internodes and size expressed as biomass mean sd 0 52 0 05 g c demersum and 0 45 0 03 g e densa or surface area 20 3 cm2 and 16 4 cm2 mother plants were brought in 2003 as four apical shoots of each species and have since grown in monocultures in two 200 l tanks fed with rainwater from rooftops ph 8 1 water conductivity 116 µs cm total nitrogen 4 5 mg l the four shoots of each species were from four different aquarium plant importers to potentially increase the genetic pool sources of labile organic carbon were freshly abscised leaves of two tree species namely european oak quercus robur l n 30 leaves and american oak quercus rubra l n 30 leaves growing together in a forest patch from o incio we collected 30 leaves from five tree individuals and selected similarly sized tree leaves of the pool to be cut and introduced part by part in microcosms until reaching 1 g we chose 1 g of these tree leaves per microcosm because this dry mass of leaf litter typifies amounts in rooftops scaled by the volume of our microcosms this was seen in our pilot study which also found that differences in growth of c demersum and e densa depending on these leaf litter types with the stronger negative effects for e densa growth n 3 microcosms each differences in tissue composition mean se among leaves mostly arise from elements related to biodegradability namely c n and lignin q robur c n 37 7 5 1 lignin 234 15 ca 12 0 5 mg 1 8 0 1 p 1 7 0 1 in mg g 1 litter and q rubra c n 68 7 5 5 lignin 198 1 ca 11 8 0 6 mg

than q rubra 2 3 microcosm surveys at the end of the experiment 30 days we recorded 1 ten water properties 2 three macrophyte properties 3 remnant tree leaf mass 4 taxonomic composition of primary producers algae and consumers protozoa and metazoa and 5 three measures of sludge production samples from 1 to 3 were taken before microcosms contents were homogenized by 10 manual inversion shakes before taking samples for 4 and 5 o2 saturation dissolved o2 concentration mg l ph conductivity µs cm water turbidity and total dissolved solids tds mg l were measured in situ using digital probes general water hardness dgh was measured using the colorimetric test visocolor macherey nagel germany we also calculated the day night water ph balance defined as the difference in ph between a period of high photosynthetic activity 14 00 h and after the night 7 00 h it is well known that photosynthesis of submerged macrophytes requires hco3 uptake that eventually increases water ph due to the release of oh from the plants pedersen et al 2013 another water property was the balance between o2 production and consumption for 30 min to assess the level of autotrophy which relates to eutrophication staehr et al 2012 microcosms were topped with rainwater and sealed with plastic to act as metabolic chambers see staehr et al 2012 by means of recording the difference in the initial and final o2 values at day 21 last microcosms were emptied through whatman gf f glass fiber filters u k the filterate was frozen at 20 c until analyses of chlorophyll a µg l were made hereafter water chlorophyll a water samples of 100 ml were frozen similarly to quantify total nitrogen mg l and doc at the university of barcelona following well established procedures outlined in elosegui and sabater 2009 plant fragments were extracted from microcosms and brushed to detach epiphytes onto a tray filled with tap water elosegui and sabater 2009 the surface area of each plant mm2 was calculated from scanned geometries and the final plant size was also expressed as mg ww epiphytic algal biomass was estimated by the concentration of chlorophyll a in the rinsed water which was measured as described in 1 and expressed as µg chlorophyll a per g of macrophyte remnant dead tree leaf mass after 30 days was calculated based on the difference in initial and final dry weight mass values of leaves at 70 c for 72 h elosegui and sabater 2009 the density of primary producers and consumers was determined in two steps a the content of microcosm was sieved through a 250 µm mesh to count large metazoa crustacea and b three 50 ml tubes of filtered water were collected per microcosm two of which were fixed in 4 formaldehyde for counting green algae diatoms amoeba flagellates ciliates and metazoans crustaceans rotifers gastrotrichs and helminths we examined 75 µl of a homogenized water sample from each microcosm drop by drop with a microscope at x100 and x400 maceda veiga et al 2015 the third tube was kept in the refrigerator at 4 c for fresh inspection at the field station to explore the taxa present prior to fixation and storage which may cause protozoan shrinkage from prior experience the preservation of hypotrichs e g aspidisca and euplotes is poor and so these are excluded from analyses taxonomic identifications were based on morphological traits following foissner et al 1991 1995 for ciliates krammer and lange bertalot 1986 1991 for algae and streble and krauter 1987 for metazoans and algae density data ind ml were to genus or the lowest practical taxonomical category density data were converted into biomass following standard methods for each taxon e g equations based on biovolume estimates dumont et al 1975 kremer et al 2014 in the absence of published equations we used carbon constants assumed for the group e g 0 22 pg c µm3 for nanoflagellates børsheim and bratbak 1987 protozoan assemblages were used to calculate the saprobity index by zelinka and marvan 1961 which ranks organic matter content in five ordinal categories i xenosaprobity ii oligosaprobity iii β mesosaprobity iv α mesosaprobity and v polisaprobity the amounts of detritus filamentous algae and filamentous bacteria including cyanobacteria were ranked from 0 to 5 using the samples processed for microscopy detailed above and their relative abundance in the 75 µl of water examined eikelboom 2000 we measured filamentous organisms because they prevent sedimentation and cause sludge bulking martins et al 2004 2 4 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted in r r core team 2014 the distributions of all variables were inspected prior to modeling and variables other than ph were log transformed to meet statistical requirements of models e g reducing severe kurtosis to examine effects of the 30 day water treatment on macrophytes and dead tree leaves themselves we compared the biomass and surface area of macrophytes and remnant dead tree litter mass among treatments using gaussian error distribution in the r function glm to test how c demersum and e densa performed relative to one another as water treatments we used the r function glm to compare the eleven water properties between leaf rooftop water filled microcosms with and without macrophytes we also used taxon rank abundance curves the r function rankabuncomp kindt and kindt 2008 to visually inspect the role of the two species of macrophytes as supporting habitat for autotrophs algae and heterotrophs flagellates amoeba ciliates and metazoa the rank abundance diagrams do not rely on a single statistic as diversity indices do and inform richness and evenness by reporting the whole distribution of abundances magurran 2004 the x axis is the observed richness and the overall slope is the evenness with a steeper curve indicative of low evenness magurran 2004 we used the r function glm to statistically compare the total taxon richness and densities of autotrophs heterotrophic microbial eukaryotes and metazoa among treatments differences in taxonomic composition were assessed using the r function adonis permanova nperm 999 oksanen et al 2007 and the function permutest betadisper was used to check whether differences in data dispersion affected permanova analyses oksanen et al 2007 last we used the r function indval to identify the most characteristic taxa for each treatment groups based on permutation tests de cáceres et al 2012 the indicator value of each taxon ranges from 0 to 1 and reaches its maximum value when all individuals of a taxon are in all microcosms of a group e g c demersum with q robur leaves to further study the performance of c demersum and e densa in microcosms we used the r function glm to compare biomasses of autotrophs and heterotrophs and indicators of sludge production among experimental factors statistical significance of experimental factors was tested with f tests and pair wise comparisons between levels of each treatment e g macrophyte type were examined using the r function lsmeans lenth and hervé 2015 statistical significance was at α 0 05 3 results 3 1 characteristics of macrophytes and dead tree leaves at 30 days the biomass and surface area of macrophyte fragments were greater in c demersum than in e densa table 1 fig 2 ab the concentration of epiphytic chlorophyll a per gram of macrophyte was greater with c demersum than with e densa table 1 fig 2c drained rooftop water with different organic carbon loadings i e types of dead tree leaves did not have significant effects on the final biomasses and surface areas of the two macrophyte species table 1 all types of tree leaves significantly reduced epiphytic chlorophyll a in c demersum and e densa but the effects were more marked for c demersum by 47 76 table 1 fig 2c the presence of dead tree leaves significantly affected the day night ph balance with greater values in microcosms with c demersum and dead tree leaves table 1 fig 2d q robur leaves had decomposed more 68 than those of q rubra 75 irrespective of the two macrophyte treatments fig 2f 3 2 effects of the macrophyte treatments on water quality drained rooftop waters

of water chlorophyll a water turbidity and doc table 2 appendix s1 o2 production was greater than o2 consumption when q robur microcosms were sealed for 30 min during daylight while the net o2 production was negative for q rubra microcosms 30 min o2 balance in table 2 appendix s1 leaf litter type did not significantly affect the other six water properties including total n table 2 appendix

by 19 27 and daylight ph by 0 9 1 3 all median values of the respective macrophyte treatments compared to microcosms with only leaf litter at 30 days table 2 appendix s1 however despite its lower biomass the e densa treatment was better at reducing water chlorophyll a by 14 34 µg l table 2 appendix s1 the day night ph balance was significantly more positive for e densa than for c demersum in the presence of leaf litter table 2 appendix s1 none of the two macrophytes had a significant effect on total n water concentrations table 2 appendix s1 3 3 effects of the macrophyte treatments on the biological assemblages and sludge the c demersum and e densa treatments did not significantly differ in the total density and taxon richness of autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms table 3 fig 3 the type of leaf litter significantly affected the density and taxon richness of autotrophs table 3 with the greatest values for e densa with q robur leaves fig 3 the same relationship held for the density of metazoa but not for heterotrophic microbes because their density did not significantly differ among treatments table 3 the taxonomic composition of autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms was heterogeneous among the leaf litter macrophyte treatments table 3 fig 3 there was greater taxon evenness for autotrophs than for heterotrophs rank abundance curves fig 3 the most characteristic taxa for e densa treatments were diatoms and bacteria whereas c demersum treatments included taxa for most of the studied groups green algae diatoms amoeba flagellates and ciliates indicator values in

treatments f 2 51 25 41 p 0 001 the macrophyte treatments did not significantly differ in biomasses of autotrophs and heterotrophs either for microbes or for metazoans table 3 fig 3 however microcosms with q robur had greater overall biomasses of autotrophs than those with q rubra fig 4a biomasses of heterotrophic microbes were greater in microcosms with leaf litter compared to those with macrophytes alone with the highest values being for q robur fig 4b the same relationship held for metazoans but the two types of leaf litter did not differ in metazoan biomass fig 4c detritus

capacity of the european native macrophyte c demersum for treating drained rooftop water when compared to the south american macrophyte e densa we proved the efficacy of the macrophytes with two types of organic carbon loadings q robur high biodegradability and q rubra low biodegradability and found that c demersum was better than e densa at water oxygenation and at lessening water conductivity and turbidity arising respectively from the decomposition of leaves from the american oak q rubra and the native oak q robur leaves of q robur decomposed faster than those of q rubra which released more dissolved organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorous to water and hence stimulated production of water chlorophyll a egeria densa was better at reducing water chlorophyll a after 30 days despite having less biomass than c demersum however microcosms with e densa developed more non epiphytic organisms which cause sludge bulking which is a major issue in water treatment systems madoni 2003 martins et al 2004 the use of microcosms is common in aquatic ecology and to assess sewage treatments e g gause 1934 srivastava et al 2004 benton et al 2007 altermatt et al 2015 maceda veiga et al 2015 but microcosm based inferences are inevitably limited by the spatial scale and duration of the experiment carpenter 1996 englund and cooper 2003 we dealt with potential temporal changes by measuring 27 biological and environmental properties with different potential response durations ranging from hours e g o2 production and microbial densities to weeks e g plant growth elosegui and sabater 2009 microcosms also were pertinent because we were interested in studying small organisms metazoans e g rotifers gastrotrichs and microbial eukaryotes e g amoeba ciliates all of which have fast generation times e g 13 33 generations of microbes in 4 weeks and are the dominant biological communities in wastewater treatment plants alongside procariotes and viruses curds 1992 madoni 2003 perez uz et al 2010 although we did not measure non filamentous bacteria we examined ecological functions in which these bacteria participate e g 30 min o2 balance leaf litter decomposition and we studied microbial eukaryotes e g flagellates and ciliates whose densities typically depends on bacterial load curds 1992 salvadó and gracia 1993 appendix s2 the expected temporal succession of these microbial eukaryotic assemblages also can be inferred from sewage treatment plant monitoring flagellates dominate in density in the initial more disturbed assemblages scuticociliates at intermediate levels and sessile peritric ciliates and testate amoeba dominate in the final more stable eukaryotic microbial assemblages salvadó 1994 last rooftop water storage tanks are expected to differ from sewage treatment plants in type intensity and frequency of sewage effluent volumes madoni 2003 moore and hunt 2012 nevertheless among the 50 taxa listed appendix s3 we recorded taxa common and abundant in sewage treatment plants of different ages e g heterotrophic nanoflagellates the scuticociliate cyclidium glaucoma and the testate amoeba arcella sp salvadó 1994 madoni 2003 there were also epibionts characteristic of c demersum growing in natural conditions e g cocconeis nitzschia zhang et al 2020 therefore we are confident that the manageable size of microcosms allowing greater replication is a good first step to get a general view of how these plant treatments may work before increasing experimental scales 4 1 c demersum was superior to e densa in treating poorly mineralized rooftop waters despite the two macrophytes being regarded as fast growing plants with broad tolerances to a large range of conditions feijoó et al 2002 pietro et al 2006 c demersum had greater size than e densa after 30 days in all experimental conditions mother plants of the two species had grown for 12 years as floating mats in rainwater collectors see methods so the plants should be acclimatized to the properties of rainwater the lesser growth of e densa probably was due to overgrowth of the filamentous non epiphytic green algae cladophora which may have shaded the plant or have released plant growth inhibitors phillips et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 another factor probably of lesser importance might have been the shading from epiphytic algae e g tóth 2013 because e densa had less epiphytic algae scaled by the macrophyte biomass than did c demersum the overgrowth of suspended algae also did not seem to affect e densa performance because water chlorophyll a from leaf litter decomposition was reduced by the plant by up to 34 µl g which is a value typical of highly eutrophic lakes nürnberg 1996 besides direct plant effects a decrease in algal biomass may be due to differences in the action of algal grazers such as ostracods which were in all microcosms fed with dead tree leaves at a mean density of 28 36 ind l however ostracod grazing on filamentous algae is low compared to that of snails pinowska 2002 yan et al 2020 there were no snails in microcosms because snail survival might be low given the low mineral content in rooftop water walstad 1999 but if present snails might have consumed more e densa than c demersum sheldon 1987 pinowska 2002 another factor might have been that non epiphytic algae had fewer competitors with c demersum microcosms had c 12 h of direct sunlight on a sunny day whereas those of mother plants of each macrophyte species had c 6 h amv observ however the potential optimization of growth conditions for e densa must be done in the native distributional range because the sale of e densa is now prohibited in europe including spain because of its invasiveness curt et al 2010 4 2 tree leaf runoff from subsidies to contaminants although drained rooftop water may contain relatively high levels of nutrients lye 2009 meera and ahammed 2006 low total n values such as in our microcosms 0 5 mg l 1 are common in the highly variable contaminant loads in rooftop waters arising from time since rain or wind dispersion de buyck et al 2021 despite this microcosms with q robur and q rubra reached relatively high levels of eutrophication e g chlorophyll a 30 µl g nürnberg 1996 enabling us to test the capacity of e densa and c demersum to deal with eutrophic waters our experiment was realistic in that leaf litter decomposition produces little biodegradable compounds which stain water julkunen tiitto and haggman 2009 such as occurs in storm waters and sewage effluents madoni 2003 shen et al 2018 therefore c demersum may have more potential than e densa for treating other water types given that its growth was less affected by the runoff treatments the faster decomposition rate of q robur leaves than those of q rubra is consistent with work on the effects of q rubra on microbes in its invasive range in standardized common garden conditions hobbie et al 2006 stanek and stefanowicz 2019 the slower leaf litter breakdown of q rubra leaves may be due to lower biomass of microbes arising from higher values of c n ratio and phenols compared to q robur our results supported such effects by finding lesser biomass of heterotrophic eukaryotic microbes flagellates and ciliates in q rubra than in q robur microcosms although we did not study bacteria and fungi both of which are involved in the leaf litter decomposition szabó et al 2000 pascoal and cásio et al 2004 decreases in biomasses of these microbes probably would have decreased biomass of heterotrophic eukaryotic microbes the studied taxa e g cyclidium glaucoma nanoflagellates are bacterivores jezbera et al 2005 however the effects of changes in the quality of basal resources on upper trophic levels can be attenuated at least partially by food web complexity srivastava and bell 2009 the latter may explain why the biomass of metazoa did not show significant differences between q rubra and q robur leaves although heterotrophic eukaryotic microbial biomass did so 4 3 other advantages of macrophytes as water treatment systems alongside improving water quality an advantage of macrophyte water treatments is that they have other environmental benefits compared to hard engineered solutions moore and hunt 2012 kurniawan et al 2021 one of these values is providing food for livestock which may be useful for projects of circular economy such as aquaponics or other multi trophic systems million et al 2016 alsanius et al 2017 stevčić et al 2020 in which the water flows from fish tanks to plant tanks and return clean to the former the green tank may then provide both water and food for fish adults or larvae such as ciliates rotifers and daphnia diver and rinehart 2000 stevčić et al 2020 and raw material for biofuel kurniawan et al 2021 the lack of significant differences in total metazoan biomass between c demersum and e densa might suggest a similar potential of the two plants in this regard however total biomass does not deal with food quality which when allied to the differences in the taxonomic composition of organisms between the two macrophyte species suggests that c demersum and e densa are not equals in providing habitat for native biodiversity winter water temperatures may reduce the usefulness of macrophyte water treatments but countries with mediterranean climate probably have relatively long growing periods for the two plants the temperature tolerance range of c demersum is 5 35 c ma et al 2009 and that of e densa is 10 35 c haramoto and ikusima 1988 and mean monthly air temperature of barcelona city sd was 16 5 c mean monthly minimum 8 and maximum 24 between 1981 2010 www aemet es nevertheless mats of c demersum and e densa in the study area survive winters with air temperatures 1 c and this does not seem to affect much the summer performance of c demersum four rooftop water storage ponds 400 l were built after this study in the o incio observatory two with c demersum and two without plants and were visually inspected from 2018 to 2021 waters were clearer for c demersum than for ponds without the plant farmers personal observations given that runoff water quantity and quality probably varied substantially these years the benefits of c demersum seen in microcosms might well apply to broader spatial and temporal scales at least in man made ecosystems for water treatment purposes 5 conclusions our study suggests that c demersum is superior to e densa for treating rooftop water and for providing food for consumers water transparency conductivity water chlorophyll a and oxygenation were the water properties most affected by the type of macrophyte probably due to a combination of nutrient competition and the release of algal growth inhibitors pietro et al 2006 gross et al 2003 influxes of two types of carbon loading affected the taxonomic composition and biomass of various groups of algae and eukaryotic microbes in both c demersum and e densa microcosms as expected from the importance of leaf litter in fuelling food webs srivastava and bell 2009 gessner et al 2010 stoler and relyea 2016 given food web complexity our study suggests the

16314,rational coastal groundwater planning is of great significance to freshwater supply for sustainable social economic development and to environmental protection in case of seawater intrusion si quantifying the relation among groundwater quality quantity and the related social economic benefits in a coastal region with intense spatio temporal variation in groundwater abstraction is helpful to the restoration of the coastal aquifer and the practical policymaking however due to the comprehensive reality involving interdisciplinary principles it is usually difficult to integrate all the main attributes of groundwater resources into a mono policymaking process which might lead to biased decisions producing a series of adverse impacts on the environment and the social economy this study thereby develops a combined simulation optimization model s o model in the coastal part of longkou city china for striking the balance among the three main attributes of groundwater i e the groundwater quantity groundwater quality or its environmental function and its related economic yield involving the agricultural and industrial sectors it is seen that the industrial sector contributed over 80 of the economic yield by consuming over 10 of the total groundwater resource and the massive agricultural use of groundwater was mainly responsible for the si the results of the multi objective optimization provided practical alternative schemes for groundwater abstraction in terms of maximizing economic yield and minimizing si moreover the decision discrepancy caused by partial management only considering the groundwater quantity and quality would lower the water use efficiency and then cause unacceptable economic losses for the enterprises and the government our research highlights that the interdisciplinary management of groundwater resources based on the s o model could significantly improve practicability in groundwater policymaking and provides a typical

supply draper et al 2003 harou et al 2009 lefkoff and gorelick 1990 the rapid growth of water demand due to the population growth and urban expansion worldwide has led to overexploitation of coastal aquifers resulting in the conflict between the demand for groundwater resources and water environmental problems such as seawater intrusion si werner 2010 custodio 2010 de graaf et al 2019 momejian et al 2019 steyl and dennis 2010 many efforts have been made to seek the causes and treatments of si ebeling et al 2019 shi et al 2020 sowe et al 2019 stein et al 2019a zeng et al 2018 and the results have raised the concerns about the social economic impacts aroused by the costly treatment and water resource scarcity due to the pumping regulation werner et al 2013 highlighting the necessity of rational groundwater management in coastal regions coastal groundwater management is an interdisciplinary problem involving the regional conditions of hydrogeology climate ecology and the most important human activity which is the external disturbance to the groundwater system and is closely related to the social economic benefits erostate et al 2020 michael et al 2017 steyl and dennis 2010 vu et al 2018 the salination of the coastal aquifer caused by excessive groundwater pumping which in turn has profoundly affected human activities by aggravating freshwater scarcity and posing a great threat to crop yields which has forced some regions to use costly desalinated seawater to supplement freshwater supply askri et al 2010 deng et al 2010 ergil 2000 maas and poss 1989 to ensure the sustainability of coastal groundwater resources more and more studies have paid attention to improving the effectiveness of si mitigation in groundwater management however from the practical perspective of local governments and enterprises a relatively stable supply and demand relationship of the groundwater resources has already been formed during the long term social economic organization the policies obtained from the management that only considers the groundwater quantity and quality might be unacceptable to the water users due to the huge potential social economic costs besides in areas where groundwater overexploitation is caused by freshwater scarcity it is often difficult to find a large amount of freshwater for the usage of injection wells in si treatment there are many cases around the world demonstrating the conflicts among water resources environmental problems and economic benefits highlighting the urgency of rational planning of water resources in sustainable economic development and environmental protection de graaf et al 2019 lefkoff and gorelick 1990 perera et al 2018 post and werner 2017 therefore it is of practical significance to holistically consider the major attributes of groundwater in terms of resource environment and social economy during coastal groundwater management and to translate scientific recognitions to social benefits michael et al 2017 various methods have been applied to mitigate the conflicts among water resources environment and social economic benefits first optimization methods have significant advantages in solving practical questions involving single multi objective optimization problems for example ye et al 2018 developed a multi objective model to optimize the allocation of physical water and virtual water for different water users while considering the environmental impact in beijing of china zhang et al 2014 built a systematic framework to optimize wastewater reuse by considering multiple objectives including wastewater reuse supply and demands costs and profits and pollutants reduction for 31 provinces of china other researchers have paid more attention to the social economic benefits of the water resource for example grundmann et al 2012 proposed a united management model appm for optimal water allocation saline water management and beneficial irrigation strategies al juaidi et al 2014 developed a regional optimization model mainly to maximize the net benefit from agricultural water uses in gaza molinos senante et al 2014 developed an optimization model aiming to maximize the benefits of 5 kinds of water supply for 3 kinds of water demands including urban agriculture and industry habibi davijani et al 2016 applied the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to maximize the employment resulting from the optimum allocation of water to the agriculture and industry sectors those studies have proved the effectiveness of the optimization methods in solving the macroscopic allocation of water supply and demand while considering some of the social economic benefits whereas lacking the ability to incorporate the physical mechanism of the water cycle and water pollution on the regional scale second the physical based numerical model such as seawat femwater and feflow are common tools to quantify the flow pattern and transport behavior under different scenarios like groundwater pumping regulation and climate change chang et al 2018 oude essink et al 2010 stein et al 2019b vu et al 2018 in these studies scenario simulation is often applied as a conventional manner to study the responding mechanism under specific conditions by changing the input parameters of the model by combining the optimization methods such as the evolutionary algorithm ea and the physical mechanism based numerical model the combined simulation optimization model s o model breaks through the limitation of conventional simulation on preset scenarios so that it can be used as an effective approach to solving regional scale nonlinear optimization problems according to the objective functions although the s o model will lead to huge computational costs derived from the combination of the nonlinear numerical model and the optimization procedure the s o model has its significant advantages in seeking optimal solutions in a complex decision making problem with high accuracy besides high performance computer and surrogate models can still cope with the high computational cost kourakos and mantoglou 2009 2013 song et al 2018 yang et al 2021 s o model has been successfully applied in basin scale water resource management for certain objectives like maximizing water supply crop yields surface runoff and minimizing irrigation water water delivery cost groundwater level falling gong et al 2000 jiang et al 2021 song et al 2020 in terms of coastal groundwater management the s o model has been applied for topics like searching the optimal groundwater pumping without triggering si cheng et al 2000 design of engineering measures for mitigating si such as groundwater pumping regulation artificial recharge pumping injecting well placement and barrier wells adjustment dhar and datta 2009a 2009b huang and chiu 2018 javadi et al 2015 kourakos and mantoglou 2013 sreekanth and datta 2010 yang et al 2021 previous applications of the s o model mainly focused on the quantity and quality of groundwater only a few studies considered the social economic factors in terms of cost but the social economic benefits are one of the main attributes of the groundwater resource lower dimensional objective management by ignoring some of the main factors might arise decision bias song et al 2020 nowadays more and more researchers have realized the necessity of comprehending social economic benefits in water resource management post and werner 2017 shi and jiao 2014 werner et al 2013 however to our knowledge there have been no published attempts to evaluate the overall economic benefits of groundwater resources in conjunctive groundwater management and the negative impact from the decision bias derived from the partial management is still unknown this study focuses on the longkou city of china a modern coastal city integrating agriculture port harbor industry modern logistics and export oriented processing industry fast economic development and population increase in longkou led to the massive requirement of freshwater resources since the 1980s leading to over exploitation of the coastal aquifer the resulting si area where the chloride concentration is more than 250 mg l has been increased from 45 km2 in the 1980 s to over 140 km2 represented by 250 mg l after the 2000s threatening water safety in longkou fan et al 2020 li et al 2020 xue et al 1995 for the sustainability of the coastal aquifer groundwater pumping regulation has been carried out since the 2000s but little effect has been achieved in controlling si based on the current water policy the goal of this study is to alleviate the resource environment economy conflicts and to mitigate the current extent of si in longkou city under the condition of guaranteeing the groundwater supply and related economic benefits for the agricultural and industrial sectors which depend on the groundwater li et al 2019 shi and jiao 2014 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2008 a multi objective s o model was developed for the purpose of optimizing groundwater exploitation while considering the trade offs among groundwater resources seawater intrusion and economic benefits of the agricultural and industrial sectors to achieve the goal several items should be addressed 1 the condition and the main causes of si at present 2 the agricultural and industrial consumption of groundwater and their related economic benefits 3 the framework of the s o model 4 the preference of choosing optimal schemes based on different conditions and 5 decision discrepancy caused by differences in objective functions 2 study area and data collection 2 1 description of the study area longkou city is located at the north border of shandong province china on the south shore of the bohai sea with a total area of 880 km2 fig 1 most of the urban area which is less than 20 km from the coastline is low lying coastal quaternary sedimentary plain accounted for more than 60 560 km2 of the total area li et al 2020 the north facing terrain gradually raises from the north beach to the low mountains formulated by granite on the south with an averaged elevation of about 600 m longkou has a monsoon climate of medium latitudes with an annual average precipitation of about 630 mm ranging from 402 to 867 mm during the period from 2002 to 2018 the narrow valleys in the low mountain region converge the precipitation into 5 rivers running north into the bohai sea the largest river is the huangshui river on the east and the yongwen river in the middle of the city beima river balisha river and jiehe river on the west longkou is one of china s top 100 comprehensive strength cities in 2019 the gross domestic product gdp of longkou city was 68 01 billion chinese yuan renminbi cny in 2010 and 104 1 billion cny in 2015 and the annual gdp growth exceeded 10 based on the dataset from the national bureau of statistics nbs fig 2 the economic development mainly depends on the export oriented industry including machinery manufacturing chemical industry mining metallurgy paper industry and power groups the secondary industry output value accounted for about 58 2 of the gdp in longkou by 2015 and is still increasing on the other hand longkou is one of the most important agricultural bases in shandong province the main crops are corn and wheat with an annual yield of around 127 106 kg the economic output of agriculture including farming forestry animal husbandry and fishery accounted for about 3 5 of the gdp by 2015 and the total output has remained stable over the past 10 years with china s economic transformation the tertiary industry in longkou which is not strongly dependent on the water resource has grown rapidly in the past decade accounting for 47 5 of gdp by 2019 the excessive groundwater exploitation of over 120 million m3 yr mostly used for agricultural irrigation has led to serious seawater intrusion fig 1 wang et al 2021 in facing the crisis groundwater pumping restriction has been carried out since 2000 the groundwater usage has been drastically cut down from 119 96 106 m3 to 47 06 106 m3 by 2018 fig 4a wrb 2018 which mainly due to the cut from the agricultural usage and in contrast with the groundwater usage decrease surface water usage increased from 34 32 106 m3 yr to 57 56 106 m3 yr fig 4b the surface water has been supplied by the water conservancy facilities which have been built since the 1950s the reservoirs were built at the low mountain district in which wangwu reservoir is the largest with the maximum capacity of 149 106 m3 and a complete set of water canals have been built to transfer the freshwater from the reservoirs at the south to the farmland in the north besides 7 river sluices and 3000 seepage wells were set along the river channel of huangshui river and a groundwater cutoff wall was built in 1995 crossing the estuary district stretching for about 6 7 km the 7 sluices have an impoundment capacity of 4 28 106 m3 and the total annual water retention is about 12 84 106 m3 yr moreover the south to north water diversion project in china since 2000 has provided the maximum capability of 1 3 106 m3 of freshwater resource from the yellow river to longkou city to sum up the 5 river basins provide about 135 106 m3 of freshwater annually including 56 106 m3 of surface water and 79 106 m3 of groundwater for the population of about 718 000 people 7600 ha of basic farmland and more than 300 enterprises in general since 2000 the proportion of water resources used for agriculture has drastically declined due to the pumping restriction and the proportion of industry has increased 2 2 data collection monthly precipitation data from 2000 to 2018 long term daily groundwater level observations of the 34 boreholes from the 1980s to 2019 and the water resource bulletin wrb 2018 involving 4 kinds of uses including agriculture and industry from 2000 to 2018 was collected from the longkou water affairs bureau lkwab 2018 fig 4a and b the detailed inventory of 6776 groundwater pumping wells in longkou city 6491 for agricultural usage and 285 for industrial usage was carried out by the water resource department of shandong provence in 2011 fig 3 which includes the annual groundwater pumping time and pumping rates with detailed information of the wells the uses and users the groundwater quality monitoring was carried out twice a year based on the 52 monitoring wells from 2005 to 2019 li et al 2020 the hydro stratigraphic data were collected based on 86 boreholes collected from the local geological survey institute the hydrogeological parameters were estimated based on the in site aquifer tests of the groundwater level observation wells the terrain datasets used in the groundwater model were collected from the 30 m strm version1 http dds cr usgs gov srtm digital elevation model dem data 3 methodology 3 1 si numerical model in this study a three dimensional transient numerical model was built by using the variable density flow and coupled solute transport model of seawat 2000 guo and langevin 2002 the numerical model was established based on the current monitoring data before coupling with the optimization model 3 1 1 spatial and temporal discretization 1 spatial discretization and the boundary conditions the alluvial diluvial plain and the marine plain as shown in fig 1 were delineated as the modeling area in addition for the reasonable depict of the penetrate pathway of seawater into the coastal aquifer the northern boundary of the model extended 3 km from the coastline towards the shallow sea to include the continental shelf sediments into the simulation scope the top surface of the shallow sea was set as the specific head boundary conditions the southern boundary of the model was set as the no flow boundary condition because most of the potential lateral flow on the southern border is impounded by the reservoirs based on the watershed analysis by gis the discharged runoff from the reservoir can only serve in the river channel of huangshui river due to the impoundment of the 7 sluices fig 3b so the river reaches within the 7 sluices were set as the specific head boundary conditions based on the observed river stages in the vertical direction as shown in fig 5 the numerical model was discretized into 3 layers based on the statistics of the stratigraphic information from the boreholes representing the respective upper holocene unit layer 1 which is composed of alluvial diluvial and marine sediments including gravel sand clay and organic components with a mean thickness of about 15 m the middle holocene unit and the pleistocene unit layer 2 which is mainly composed of alluvial diluvial sediments including gravel sand and clay with the thickness ranging from 0 5 to 53 m and is significantly thicker in the west coast the granite and sandstone unite layer 3 which is considered as the relatively impermeable bottom of the regional aquifer as a result the model was discretized into 165 rows and 260 columns of rectangular mesh in horizontal with the resolution of 200 m 200 m and 3 layers in the vertical direction the total mesh number is 128 700 the model could have a more precisely refined discretization however due to the huge calculational tasks during the optimization process which would increase exponentially the discretization was appropriately simplified 1 temporal discretization the time vary datasets including groundwater level mass concentration precipitation from 1 1 2015 to 12 31 2018 were used for model calibration the 4 years transient simulation was set to have 48 stress periods based on the precipitation data which was monthly averaged in each stress period a total number of 40 timesteps 0 75 day timestep were set to increase the convergence of the nonlinear variable density solute transport model the phreatic aquifer in the study area is mainly replenished by seasonal rainfall and river water infiltration naturally 60 of the rainfall is concentrated in the summer season from june to september but due to the concentrated groundwater pumping for wheat growing from may to july the natural dynamic of the groundwater table fluctuation is altered to be driven by the irrigation cycle and the seasonal rainfall cycle 3 1 2 model calibration and sensitivity analysis the hydrogeological parameters of the model including hydraulic conductivity k specific yield sy rainfall infiltration coefficient ic porosity and longitudinal transverse dispersivity dl dt were adjusted during the calibration process based on the monitored datasets and results of the in suit aquifer tests table 1 the mass concentration of chloride ion cl was assigned to the model in layers based on the observations of the 52 wells we assume the homogeneous and isotropic material property in each sub domain as shown in fig 5 two fitting criteria including the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae were used to calibrate and validate the numerical model 1 rmse j 1 m i 1 n h c i h o i j 2 m n 2 mae j 1 m i 1 n h c i h o i j m n where hc and ho are the calculated head at the jth time step from the simulation model and observed head at ith observation location n is the number of observation locations m is the number of time steps after the calibration process an oat one factor at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the main factor that influences the si on one hand and on the other hand to test the robustness of the numerical model so that it could meet the requirement of the optimization process in all the parameters rainfall infiltration ic and groundwater pumping rates are the main factors that control the source sink of the si hydraulic conductivity k could strongly control the groundwater flow under the intensive groundwater pumping so those parameters were tested through increasing and decreasing the baseline value by 5 to 10 morris 1991 feng et al 2018 wang et al 2021 3 2 simulation optimization model in this study the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii was used for searching optimal solutions due to its efficiency in solving nonlinear multi objective problems including water resource allocation cost benefit evaluation and pollutants reduction and the seawat code was used for solving equations of the density dependent solute transport model guo and langevin 2002 the seawat model was modified into a subroutine that was repeatedly called by the main program in nsga ii for the calculation of salinity concentrations of the model grids under different groundwater pumping conditions and the concentration at the end of the management period was read by the evaluation process of the nsga ii through which an evolved generation of groundwater pumping conditions are generated for updating the simulation model the evolutionary process will stop after the ending criteria are met 3 2 1 decision variables and constraints the decision variables in this study were the groundwater pumping rate of the pumping zones which were delimited based on the administrative sub regions in longkou city the framework of the water usage in longkou is illustrated in fig 4 which shows the main water consumptions are agriculture and industry agricultural usage mainly includes 2 periods of irrigation for wheat and corn and industrial usage mainly includes 7 kinds of industries it is worth mentioning that the groundwater pumping for industrial uses is mainly discharged through wastewater pipes to sewage treatment plants and river reaches whereas the groundwater pumping for agricultural irrigation could partially re infiltrate into the aquifer as a replenishment making the groundwater net loss gnl in the numerical model less than the actual groundwater pumping volume thus the groundwater usage regime in each pumping zone could be expressed as follow 3 v r v r a v r i v r i α v r v s 1 r i v r a v r i where v r a and v r i are the agricultural usage and the industrial usage of the total groundwater usage α is the proportion of the industrial usage to the total groundwater usage and ri is the re infiltration rate of the agricultural irrigation vs and vr represent the compensated and the actual groundwater pumping volume respectively the formula can be transformed into the following form 4 v r 1 1 r i r i α v s v r i α 1 r i r i α v s v r a 1 a 1 r i r i α v s based on the regional policies groundwater extraction needs to be further reduced to prevent si so the gnl in each pumping zone which is essentially responsible for the si was set to vary between 50 to 120 of the current volume v s 0 which can be expressed as 5 0 5 v s 0 v s 1 2 v s 0 3 2 2 objective functions water resource scarcity and seawater intrusion are typical problems for coastal regions and the underlying cause of the two problems is social economic benefits such as water dependent products and urban water supply so the objective functions are used to deal with these three problems including maximization of the total groundwater pumping max gp minimization of the seawater intrusion min si and the maximization of the economic yield max ey the calculation of the total groundwater pumping volume from different pumping zones can be expressed as 6 v s t t n n q n t δ t where q n m3 d is the groundwater pumping rate of the n pumping zone in the t stress period n is the total number of the pumping zones and t is the number of the stress periods respectively while in the groundwater numerical model the groundwater pumping can be assigned as pumping wells or areal source sinks in the situation of this study for about 7000 wells in the modeling area which is more convenient to convert the wells to the areal source sinks in each pumping zones for optimization so the function of the first objective is expressed as 7 max f g n l t t n n q n t a n δ t where q n t m d is the net pumping rate npr set in the numerical model of the n pumping zone which has an area of an the second objective is to minimize the chloride mass in the modeled area at the end of the management period which can be expressed as 8 min f s i m a s s e n d m a s s i n i where the m a s s i n i and m a s s e n d is the total chloride mass kg calculated by the numerical model at the beginning and the end of the management period respectively in the numerical model the calculation of the total mass content can be expressed as m a s s m i j k m c i j k a i j k h i j k b o t i j k θ i j k m i j k u n c o n f i n e d 9 a m i j k m c i j k a i j k t o p i j k b o t i j k θ i j k m i j k c o n f i n e d 9 a where i j and k are the row column and layer numbers of the mth mesh in the numerical model m represents the total number of mesh in the numerical model a i j k b o t i j k c i j k and θ i j k are the area bottom elevation the concentration of the cl and the porosity of the mi j k mesh respectively t o p i j k and h i j k represent the top elevation and the hydrological head of the mesh mi j k for different meshes eq 9a is used when the mi j k is in the unconfined aquifer or eq 9b is used when the mi j k is in the confined aquifer the function of the third objective was the maximization of the economic yield ey due to the complexity in the dynamic input output relationship in economic activities we introduce an approximate calculation method to estimate the groundwater dependent economic yield based on the water consumption coefficient γ which represents the volume of water needed by the p product for unit income the evaluation of the economic yield can be expressed as 10 max f e y t i t c 11 t i n n p p v r n c p n γ p 12 t c f n n v r n where ti and tc is the total income and the total cost of the actual groundwater pumping volume in all the n pumping zones for p kinds of products v r n represents the actual groundwater pumping volume of the nth pumping zone as expressed in formulation 3 and 4 c represents the percentage of the groundwater used by the p product in the nth pumping zone γ m3 cny is the water consumption coefficient wcc representing the volume of water needed by the p product for unit income based on previous statistics of the national gdp and water consumption in china by guo 2010 f represents the groundwater resource fees 0 45cny m3 in shandong province overall both gp si and gp ey have a positive relationship however by adding the spatial differences of the pumping zones into the overall relations the situation could be significantly complicated due to the differences in the sensitivity of si to gp and the difference in the overall wcc of the sub regions for example increasing gp in certain locations within a certain range could mitigate si stein et al 2019a and the ey would be reduced by supplying a higher proportion of water resources to the sub regions or the industries with lower economic efficiency therefore to acquire a full understanding of the complicated regional situation two optimization problems were considered including 1 a two objective optimization for fully exploring the potential possibility of groundwater supply and si mitigation by considering the maximization of gp and the minimization of si and 2 a three objective optimization for balancing the water resource water environment and economy by considering the maximization of gp the minimization of si and the maximization of ey 4 results and analyses the performance of the numerical model was validated for representing the current situation of si then two sets of optimization results were obtained through a two objective optimization considering the trade offs between gp and si and a three objective optimization considering the trade offs among gp si ey the optimal schemes of the groundwater pumping were chosen based on different preferences and the two sets of optimal solutions were compared to evaluate the decision discrepancy 4 1 response of seawater intrusion to groundwater pumping 4 1 1 calibration results of the numerical model the numerical model was cautiously calibrated to simulate the distribution and dynamics of si as realistically as possible and the simulated distribution of cl in 2018 is illustrated in fig 7 the scatter diagrams of groundwater level and mass concentration and the representative hydrographs against the observed value in the 4 years calibration process are shown in fig 6 results show that the calculated groundwater level was consistent with the observations during the simulation period the rmse and mae of groundwater level were 0 87 m and 0 62 m respectively and the rmse and mae of cl concentration was 59 9 mg l and 39 2 mg l the regional groundwater table was consistent with the surface topography except for the two groundwater depression cones with the groundwater level lower than 0 m fig 1 negative water level region one on the west coast and the other one on the lower reaches of the huangshui river the sensitivity analysis shows that the cl concentration was mainly controlled by the intensive groundwater pumping which was the main cause of the groundwater depression cone so that the seawater could directly recharge the inland aquifer fig 7 intrusion zone precipitation had a positive influence on diluting the concentration of cl at the rim of the intrusion area whereas precipitation could not significantly reduce the overall mass of cl in the whole model because the coastline groundwater pumping could lead to the recharge from the sea also the dilution effect mainly took place at the top of the aquifer which is where excessive groundwater pumping took place leaving little fresh water for diluting the deeper aquifer where concentration is higher so groundwater pumping is the main factor that controls the si the fluctuation of the observed hydrograph had certain randomness due to the annual change of the detailed groundwater pumping condition and the precipitation variation also the anisotropy of the geological condition could contribute to the randomness so that made it very difficult for the numerical model to follow the observed hydrograph at every time step of 0 75 day under the condition of lacking more detailed information therefore as long as the simulation is of a similar fluctuation and the overall consistency with the observation in an acceptable accuracy the numerical model is calibrated and could be used for evaluating the essential response of si to gp and be adequate for optimization simulation 4 1 2 spatio temporal variation of gp and si based on the simulation results seawater intrusion response to groundwater pumping from two aspects 1 seasonal cycle of the groundwater pumping controlled by the seasonal agricultural irrigation 2 spatial distribution of the groundwater pumping influenced by the land usage and the water conservancy facilities two periods of seasonal irrigation cycle were the main driving force of groundwater table including the spring irrigation from march to june and winter irrigation from october to december aiming for wheat sown in autumn and corn sown in summer spring irrigation accounted for about 82 of the annual irrigation water due to the larger water demand for wheat growth and winter irrigation accounted for about 18 fig 4 in response to the groundwater pumping cycle the lowest groundwater level was in mid july every year after spring irrigation fig 6 during which the concentration of cl is also the highest in the year the groundwater pumping could bring the groundwater from the deep which has a higher concentration to the shallow aquifer but the following rainfall could again dilute the concentration in the shallow aquifer so the coastline area such as the estuarine district of yongwen river where there is no groundwater pumping fig 3 the concentration in the shallow aquifer is quite low fig 7 layer 1 so there was a vertical variation of the concentration that the concentration in the deeper aquifer was higher than in the shallow aquifer fig 7 layer 2 the pumping distribution also has a strong influence on si table 2 illustrates the groundwater usage wu for the 11 pumping zones pz based on the statistic of the 6776 pumping wells the 11 pumping zones are shown in fig 8 c the groundwater usage in 3 of the 11 pumping zones exceeded 10 000 103 m3 yr including pz 3 9 10 leading to the groundwater depression cones pz 2 3 5 at the west coast has the total groundwater abstraction of 16 966 103 m3 yr the groundwater table in this district was below 0 m ranging from 4 to 2 m fig 1 the negative water level region and was still declining during the year from 2015 to 2018 fig 6 a4 the rapid decline of the groundwater table led to the large quantity of seawater directly penetrating the coastline into the inland aquifer by using the streamline analysis based on the numerical model seawater along the coastline from yongwen river to jiehe river could penetrate the west coast aquifer for about 3 km affecting about 54 5 km2 of the west coast aquifer with the highest cl concentration up to 3000 mg l fig 7 intrusion zone in contrast the wu in pz 9 zhuyouguan town was about 18 129 103 m3 yr but could not trigger si due to the obstruction from the groundwater cut off wall at the estuary of huangshui river the concentration of cl ranged from 150 to 400 mg l on the east coast which derived from the si before the construction of the cut off wall in 1995 and was slowly decreasing during the simulation time the groundwater along the east coastline from yongwen river to the east discharges into the sea based on streamlined analysis fig 7 discharge zone the cut off wall enclosed a relatively independent groundwater system that was replenished by rainfall and river infiltration facilitated by the impounded runoff in the 7 sluices discharges mainly through groundwater pumping besides considering the current distribution of si was caused by persisting gp since the 1990s the uneven distribution of gp and the precipitation during the last 30 years has made the concentration of the shallow aquifer have a porphyritic distribution the gp restriction since 2000 could only slow the speed of si but not retract the intrusion area because of the negative groundwater level and the intrusion zone on the west coast 4 1 3 pareto optimal solutions balancing gp and si having ascertained the relationship between seawater intrusion and groundwater abstraction it is necessary to fully explore the possibilities of mitigating si while maximizing the groundwater pumping for the guarantee of groundwater supply thus minimizing ƒsi and maximizing ƒgnl was set as objective functions in the s o model the annually averaged net pumping rate npr of the 11 pumping zones in the seawat model were set as the decision variables which could vary between 50 to 120 of the current value based on the local policy demand for restricting groundwater abstraction the management period was set to 6 years and the population number npop in each generation was set to 100 the crossover probability and mutation probability was 0 9 and 0 05 respectively the pareto solutions of the two objective s o model were illustrated in the two dimensional scatter plot as shown in fig 8a the gray arrow indicates the optimal direction for each objective it can be observed that the ƒsi has an overall positive relationship with the ƒgnl to increase the ƒgnl to 27 0 106 m3 yr the ƒsi could increase to 1 012 indicating a 1 2 increase in the total mass of cl in the groundwater system to decrease the ƒgnl to 18 3 106 m3 yr fig 8a t0 ƒsi could decrease to 0 983 indicating a 1 7 decrease in the total mass of cl there is a significant inflection point of the slope in the scatter plot which indicates that the response relation of si and gp is not linear when the ƒgnl is reduced to less than 22 5 106 m3 yr fig 8a t2 the ability to mitigate si would be significantly weakened to compare the optimization solutions with the current situation as shown in fig 8a and b there could be a significant improvement in the groundwater pumping allocation to mitigate si scheme t0 could be representative that the npr in pz 1 2 3 5 6 should be reduced to the lower limit which is 50 of the current npr on the contrary pz 4 7 8 9 10 11 could support a nearly 20 increase in the npr fig 8d as an alternative scheme t2 represents the equal ƒgnl as the present while having the second minimum ƒsi as shown in figs 8b and 11 t2 only pz 2 and pz 6 need a 50 reduction in npr whereas the other pzs could increase their npr to the upper limit of 120 for maximizing ƒgnl without adverse effect to si as shown in t1 only pz 6 needs an 50 reduction in npr all the other pzs could increase their npr for searching the maximum ƒgnl all the optimized schemes simultaneously increased the npr in pz 4 7 8 9 10 11 to the upper limit of 120 indicating a relatively weaker influence on the si in those districts and the npr in pz 1 2 3 5 6 is sensitive to the groundwater quality implying that these areas are highly risky to seawater intrusion 4 2 three objective optimization balancing gp si ey the two objective optimization can identify the main factor of seawater intrusion and could also provide optimal strategies for si mitigation on this basis the detailed groundwater usage was further distinguished for evaluating the economic yield dependent on the groundwater the three objective optimization was then carried out by adding the third objective function of maximizing the ƒey for the refinement of the optimal schemes 4 2 1 economic output evaluation based on the datasets of the pumping wells as shown in fig 3 groundwater usage wu was divided into industrial usage wui and agricultural usage wua table 2 for industrial usage α represents the proportion of the industrial usage to the total groundwater usage in each pumping zone the 285 industrial pumping wells were used for 7 kinds of industries including power groups pg mining mi paper industry pp chemical industry ch machinery ma food fd and domestic life li the water consumption coefficients wcc of different industrial usages were also listed in table 2 digits in parentheses and fig 4 among the industrial usages the wcc of the paper industry food and chemical industry were higher ranging from 334 7 m3 104cny to 51 1 m3 104cny indicating that those industries need more water for production while the wcc of machinery manufacturing and mining industry were lower ranging from 19 6 m3 104cny to 9 0 m3 104cny those industries are less dependent on water resources and has a higher economic output in terms of the agricultural sector the groundwater was mainly used for two periods of irrigation of wheat and corn as explained in section 4 1 2 the irrigational water demand of wheat and corn in longkou was about 850 m3 103kg and 185 m3 103kg respectively that is about 2833 m3 104cny and 660 m3 104cny according to the unit price of wheat 3 0 cny kg and corn 2 8 cny kg it could be found that the agricultural wcc is significantly larger than the industrial wcc due to the much larger water demand of the irrigational water and the low price of the staple grain in addition due to the functional differences in administrative sub regions which are delimited by the government different pumping zones have different groundwater pumping regimes and different overall wcc as illustrated in table 2 power groups pg and the paper industry pp which have the largest groundwater consumption among all the industries were mostly located in pz9 and pz10 the mining industry and chemical industry were in pz2 pz9 and pz10 the food industry was mainly in pz3 and pz4 in summary pz2 longgang development zone pz9 zhuyouguan town and pz10 langao town were industrially centralized industrial usage of groundwater accounted for 36 6 26 46 and 23 79 respectively of the total groundwater usage in each district resulting in a relatively lower overall wcc higher economic efficiency in these 3 sub regions while in the other pzs the proportion of industrial usage were less than 7 resulting in a relatively higher overall wcc the overall wcc of the 11 pumping zones is sorted from large pz6 to small pz2 in fig 8c as a result by using the groundwater pumping calculated by the numerical model based on the water resource bulletin wrb and the detailed allocation in table 2 and the formulation in section 3 2 the calculated actual groundwater usage in longkou city was about 51 7 106 m3 yr including industrial usage and the agricultural usage of groundwater about 6 7 106 m3 yr and 45 106 m3 yr respectively causing the net loss in groundwater ƒgnl of 22 58 106 m3 yr the current total economic yield depended on the groundwater usage in longkou city was estimated to be about 2 296 billion cny yr 4 2 2 trade off surface of the optimal solutions in the three objective management the population number npop in each generation was increased to 200 which still might not be enough to depict a clear pareto optimal surface of this three objective optimization whereas further increasing the npop will make the total calculation time unacceptable therefore the s o model was set to proceed with the evolutionary process for another 10 generations after the ending criteria were met the last 10 generations were used for depicting the pareto optimal surface the s o model terminated at the 81st generation 1254 optimal solutions were archived from the 2000 solutions of the last 10 generations the optimal solutions balancing ƒgnl ƒsi and ƒey were plotted in the three dimensional coordinate plot as shown in fig 9 also for a better understanding of the spatial distribution of the optimal solutions the projections of the solutions are plotted as gray dots on the three coordinate planes the gray arrows on each primary axes indicate the optimal directions of the three objectives the optimal solutions formulated a pareto optimal surface covering a spatial extent ranging from 18 2 to 27 0 106 m3 yr for ƒgnl 0 983 1 012 for ƒsi and 1 74 2 75 109 cny for ƒey the current situation is marked as n0 in fig 9 fig 10 illustrates the projections of the three objective optimal solutions light blue dots and the two objective optimal solutions black dots on the three coordinate planes respectively after manually calculating the ƒey of the two objective optimal solutions results show that the distribution has significant differences 1 the projection of the optimal solutions shows a banded distribution on plane a the ƒgnl and ƒsi coordinate plane with a bandwidth of about 3 106 m3 yr along the ƒgnl axis direction the α boundary of the band is close to the pareto front of the two objective optimization and the β boundary is on the opposite side when ƒgnl is larger than 25 106 m3 yr the optimal solution shrinks to a linear distribution and extends along the α boundary 2 on plane b the ƒgnl and ƒey coordinate plane the optimal solutions also show a banded distribution but in an s shape the α boundary is on the right hand side of the band and the β boundary is on the left it can be seen from this coordinate plane that the β boundary represents the largest ƒey solution set under the same ƒgnl the α boundary and the β boundary overlap at the left and right end indicating that when the ƒgnl is close to the lower limit of the constraints 50 of the current ƒgnl and the upper limit 120 of the current ƒgnl the optimal solutions of the max ƒey are almost identical increasing groundwater abstraction could promote ƒey significantly to about 2 7 109 cny whereas in between the two boundaries have a distance up to 0 5 109 cny along the ƒey axis direction implying that different spatial allocation of groundwater pumping could have very different economic yield and in a certain range increasing ƒgnl could even reduce ƒey which is mainly due to the differences in wcc of the sub regions in addition when ƒgnl is over 25 106 m3 yr increasing the ƒgnl would have little benefit to the economy 3 on plane c the ƒsi ƒey coordinate plane the optimal solutions illustrate a curve like distribution with a positive correlation between ƒsi and ƒey the curve includes two straight line segments the lower segment of ƒey less than 2 7 109 cny has a larger slope than the upper segment the linear distribution of the optimal solution implies that increasing economic yield on the pareto surface will inevitably come at the cost of expansion of seawater intrusion and after economic yield reaches its up limit seawater intrusion could expand further by increasing the groundwater abstraction 4 2 3 optimal schemes analysis as shown in figs 9 and 10 there is a certain distance between the current situation n0 and the trade off surface formulated by the optimal solutions implying that the current groundwater pumping allocation neither fully explored the economic efficiency of groundwater resources nor effectively controls the seawater intrusion based on the optimal results some optimal solutions were chosen as the alternative groundwater abstraction schemes for specific prospects including 1 maximization of economic yield and 2 minimization of the seawater intrusion all the chosen optimal solutions should follow 2 basic rules the ƒsi should not be becoming worsen than the current situation the ƒey should be larger than the current situation as a result 3 typical solutions were chosen and marked in fig 10 the 3 optimal schemes are s1 with the maximum ƒey under the condition of the same ƒsi as the current situation s2 possessing the maximum ƒey with the same ƒsi and ƒgnl as the present and s3 with the minimum ƒsi under the condition of the same ƒey as the present s4 and s5 were chosen as a pair of references to compare with the optimal schemes s4 has the minimum ƒsi with the same ƒgnl as the present and s5 has the similar ƒsi and ƒey with s4 the percentage changes in npr corresponding to the selected optimal schemes are illustrated in fig 11 further the actual groundwater usage for industry wui and agriculture wua transformed from ƒgnl based on the formulations in section 3 2 are shown in table 3 1 maximization of economic yield in the selected optimal solutions s1 red rectangle in fig 10c is selected as a preferable scheme from the aspect of maximizing the ƒey because the ƒey of s1 could be potentially increased by 294 million cny from the current 2 296 billion cny to 2 590 billion cny and will not lead to further extension of seawater intrusion the ƒgnl of s1 increased from the current 22 58 106 m3 yr to 24 12 106 m3 yr fig 10 plane a and plane b which is achieved by increasing the pumping rates of almost all the pumping zones by 20 except for pz 1 pz 5 and pz 6 which need to reduce the current pumping rate to 65 50 and 51 respectively figs 11 s1 by comparing fig 10 plane a and plane c we found that the optimal solutions distributed on the line with ƒsi equal to 1 have similar value in ƒey with s1 therefore scheme s2 yellow rectangle in fig 10 was selected based on the similar ƒsi and ƒgnl conditions to the current situation for the maximum ƒey as shown in fig 10 plane c the ƒey value of s2 was about 2 553 billion a little smaller than s1 but the ƒgnl of s2 was less than the situation in s1 the transformed actual groundwater usage was about 54 45 106 m3 yr and 50 60 106 m3 yr for s1 and s2 respectively tables 3 s1 and s2 the total industrial usage was quite similar but the agricultural usage reduced by 3 6 106 m3 yr from 46 66 106 m3 yr in s1 to 43 06 106 m3 yr in s2 in terms of spatial allocation as shown in fig 11 the difference between s1 and s2 was in pz1 and in pz3 which indicates that similar economic output could be achieved if groundwater abstraction in pz1 was transferred to pz3 however the groundwater usage in pz1 was much smaller than the usage in pz3 table 2 making pz1 easier to make a change groundwater pumping restriction also the relatively larger amount of industrial usage of groundwater in pz3 table 3 0 69 106 m3 yr for wui in s1 compared to 0 39 106 m3 yr in s2 provides an opportunity for some of the enterprises to move the site from pz1 to pz3 therefore s1 is preferable to s2 in terms of maximizing the economic yield and groundwater resources 2 minimization of the seawater intrusion to minimize the seawater intrusion s3 could be representative green triangle in fig 10 because the ƒsi of s3 could decrease to 0 994 and would keep the same ƒey as the present as shown in table 3 the actual industrial usage of groundwater in s3 was about 6 91 106 m3 yr which is similar to the current volume but the agricultural usage had to be reduced by 5 26 106 m3 yr from the current of 45 106 m3 yr to 39 74 106 m3 yr the re distribution of the groundwater abstraction in s3 would reduce the total ƒgnl which is mainly caused by the reduction of the npr in pz 1 3 5 6 by 50 figs 11 s3 the rest of the pumping zones could increase their pumping rate to 120 except for pz 2 which could only increase to 110 the result implies that for mitigating si most of the groundwater abstraction on the west coast should be relocated to the east coast except for pz2 for reference scheme s4 yellow triangle in fig 9a was chosen from the aspect of minimizing the seawater intrusion based on the same ƒgnl as the present s4 has the ƒsi of about 0 990 which is the smallest in all the 4 schemes and the total groundwater usage of 52 83 106 m3 yr is larger than 46 65 106 m3 yr in s3 table 3 this suggests that the extent of seawater intrusion could be further reduced while increasing the available groundwater resources however the ƒey of s4 was only about 2 086 billion which is about 210 million cny less than the current situation and 504million cny less than s1 the economic efficiency of s4 is the lowest among the 4 selected schemes this is mainly due to the reduction in the industrial usage of groundwater by 0 65 106 m3 yr from 6 91 106 m3 yr in s3 to 6 26 106 m3 yr in s4 to compare s3 with s4 in fig 11 s4 restricted the groundwater abstraction in pz2 rather than pz1 and pz3 so the wui of pz2 in s4 1 74 106 m3 yr was about 1 2 106 m3 yr less than that in s3 2 94 106 m3 yr in terms of economic output pz2 is industrially centralized the enterprises located in this district have a significantly larger economic efficiency than the agricultural output in pz1 and pz3 the water resource deficit caused by the restriction of groundwater abstraction in pz2 might inhibit the productivity of the enterprises causing a potential economic loss of 210 million cny which is unacceptable for the enterprises and the local government also it is very difficult and costly for those mega sites like power groups and mining industries to move to other locations on the contrary it is much easier for relocating some of the irrigation dependent farmland in pz 1 3 5 6 to other places like pz 4 7 8 11 which could increase their npr by 20 therefore in terms of controlling seawater intrusion scheme s3 is preferable to scheme s4 for the feasibility of the economic transformation to summarize facing different prospects like maximization of economic yield and minimization of seawater intrusion there is still potential for optimization based on the current situation the differences in the relocation of the groundwater abstraction derive from the differences in wcc of the industries and sub regions which could translate water resource to economic yield and could determine the economic efficiency 4 3 decision discrepancy caused by additional major objectives by comparing the three objective and the two objective solutions we found that the lower dimensional objective optimization which ignores some of the major attributes in formulating objective functions might not be representative of the real situation in this case the groundwater stored in the coastal aquifer has three major attributes 1 the resource attribute groundwater is an important live element 2 the environmental attribute overexploitation of groundwater will cause serious seawater intrusion which is detrimental to the coastal ecosystem and 3 economic attribute groundwater supply is the main factors of production for agriculture and industry in longkou city the spatial distribution of groundwater abstraction was pre set by the distribution of the groundwater users including the farmland and the enterprises the re allocation of groundwater abstraction while ignoring the economic attribute of groundwater could have a serious negative impact on agricultural and industrial development that depend on groundwater resources to clarify the importance of considering the economic attribute for the multi objective optimization of the coastal groundwater the 3 objective optimal solutions along the β boundary in fig 10 were selected as the representative solution set to compare with the 2 objective optimal solutions and the variation in economic yield and groundwater usages against ƒsi were plotted in fig 12 the result shows that in the two objective optimization there is no recognition of the economic efficiency so scheme t1 and t2 cost more wu to reach a similar ey as scheme s2 and s3 water usage efficiency in the two objective optimization was lower than that in 3 objective optimization because the 3 objective optimization placed more emphasis on industry the wui industrial usage of groundwater along the β boundary created over 90 of the ey total economic yield by using only 14 of the groundwater resource indicating the economic efficiency of industry is much higher than that of basic agriculture so increasing wui from 11 4 t2 and 13 1 t1 to over 14 s3 and s2 could increase eyi economic yield of industry from around 87 89 2 t1 and t2 to over 90 s2 and s3 thus to maintain economic output industrial usage of groundwater should be guaranteed as a priority and agricultural usage of groundwater wua was forced to be reduced by applying water saving irrigation strategies and the planting of drought tolerant crops to control seawater intrusion the economic transformation could ensure sustainable growth by providing more water to the industry sector while improving the patterns of agricultural water usage without the structural reform of the water consumption regime it will be inevitable to cause potential economic losses for further si alleviation to further clarify the spatial relocation of npr the percentage variations in the npr of the 11 pumping zones for the two optimal solution sets fig 12 were plotted against ƒsi in fig 13 c f the result shows for controlling seawater intrusion two solution sets have different preferences in the sequence of the pumping zones for groundwater abstraction reduction for 2 objective optimization the sequence of groundwater abstraction reduction from first to last is pz6 pz2 pz5 pz1 pz3 pz4 fig 13c and the sequence in 3 objective optimization is pz6 pz5 pz3 pz1 pz2 pz4 fig 13e the two sequences have the same beginning and ending representing that for controlling seawater intrusion pz6 is the most necessary to reduce groundwater pumping while pz4 hardly affects seawater intrusion the order of pz2 changed the most in the two sequences because pz2 is an industrial centralized district with greater economic output capacity therefore to ensure economic output the groundwater abstraction in pz2 needs to be guaranteed which indirectly increases the necessity of reducing the groundwater abstraction in the surrounding pumping zones pz1 pz3 and pz5 to control seawater intrusion however due to the strong positive influence from the pumping rate of pz2 on the seawater intrusion the surrounding pumping zones need to further reduce their pumping rates in exchange for the seawater intrusion caused by the groundwater pumping in pz2 for example scheme s5 has a larger npr of pz2 than s4 but for getting a similar ƒsi fig 10 s5 must further reduce the npr of pz1 pz3 and pz5 to 50 fig 13c and e in one word decision discrepancy is caused by ignoring some of the major attributes of the decision variables failure to consider the major objectives might lead to biased decisions which are often inoperable in practical applications in this study biased decision making might have a negative impact on industrial enterprises which would reduce water usage efficiency and cause huge economic losses by considering the economic attribute of the groundwater also by dividing the industrial and agricultural usage of groundwater through the corresponding wcc the groundwater pumping allocation was complicated by another dimension of economic benefits which has a very different discipline with the relation between gp and si and due to the spatial differences in the water usage regime of the sub regions the total groundwater usage in longkou city has a non linear and non monotonic relation with the total economic yield of the city so the optimal allocation of the groundwater abstraction could only be solved by adding the objective function of economic yield during the optimization process along with the other major objectives 4 4 utilization of the water conservancy facilities based on the optimal results there is a significant difference in the preference of the pumping zones to either increase or decrease their pumping rates as shown in fig 13a and b the percentage variations of the averaged npr in each pumping zones in a generation 200 population during the whole evolutionary process of 81 generations were plotted the 11 pumping zones were divided into west coast and east coast for comparison on the east coast the water conservancy facilities are beneficial to the freshwater supply therefore all the pumping zones from pz7 to pz11 approached 120 of the current npr successively in the evolutionary process suggesting that the east coast increases its groundwater abstraction without significantly extending seawater intrusion among all the east coast pumping zones pz9 was the first to approach 120 which has the largest groundwater abstraction among all the 11 pumping zones and the shortest distance to the coastline those conditions made pz9 the most vulnerable to seawater intrusion however due to the groundwater cut off wall seawater is completely removed from the recharge source of the groundwater also due to the additional replenishment from the river infiltration supplied by the retained runoff in the 7 sluices who have total annual water retention of about 12 84 million m3 the riverside aquifer along huangshui river could afford the 20 additional npr so the groundwater pumping in the east coast was almost irrelevant to ƒsi as shown in fig 13d and f on the west coast there is no protection from water conservancy facilities so there were significant spatial differences in the optimized npr as shown in fig 13a the averaged npr of pz5 and pz6 have a downward trend to 60 of the current value during the evolutionary process indicating the npr of these two pumping zones should be reduced as much as possible for mitigating seawater intrusion on the contrary all the optimal solutions tend to increase the pumping rate of pz4 to the upper limit of the constraints 120 of the current value which indicates groundwater abstraction in pz4 barely influence the seawater intrusion therefore increasing the groundwater abstraction in pz4 is beneficial to the economy and the total water resource in terms of pz1 pz3 the percentage change was between 85 and 100 which indicates that different preferences of the optimal scheme will lead to different values of the npr in these three pumping zones to sum up the west coast is more vulnerable to seawater intrusion because there is no protection from water conservancy facilities at present however constructing new water conservancy facilities should be in line with the local hydrogeological conditions and the social economic development preference currently only the upper reaches of the yongwen river have been constructed a few sluices for the water supply of the aluminum plant and the sufficient water storage of beixingjia reservoir which is used for industrial production exclusively did not fully use therefore the construction of sluices in the middle and lower reaches of the yongwen river could be a plausible plan to increase the total water resource in districts like pz4 pz6 and pz7 under the condition of increasing the ecological discharge from the reservoir on the other hand it would be too costly for the west coast to build a groundwater cutoff wall due to the 41 km long coastline and the thicker quaternary sediments up to 75 m but only a partial segment of the cutoff wall will not be capable of resisting seawater intrusion from both sides of the peninsula thus relocation of the water dependent basic farmland and construction of more water conservancy facilities for water supply are the two sides of the coin for the optimal management of the water resources on the west coast during which the cost of changing site and the feasibility of water diversion should be considered 5 discussion the social economic benefit is one of the major attributes of the groundwater resource in the coastal region considering the major attributes is vital to rational groundwater management avoiding misunderstanding and biased decision making during environmental governance in longkou city the three objective functions were formulated based on the current eco society problems of water scarcity seawater intrusion and demand for economic development based on the analysis in section 3 2 2 and the optimal results each 2 among the 3 factors has an overall positive correlation and a partial negative correlation and the relationship among the three factors gp si ey is nonlinear and non monotonic which will lead to a 3 d multiplicity of solutions all the groundwater pumping schemes limited by the constraints could constitute a 3 d scattered point set waiting for arbitrary searching directions like maximization or minimization in the 3 d coordinate system formulated by the three factors in this case the constraints were set based on the local policy of groundwater pumping restriction and the hydrogeological limitations as shown in fig 14 due to the nonlinear and non monotonic relationship between ƒgnl and ƒey representing by the black arrows in fig 14 which derives from the difference in overall wcc of the sub regions the groundwater pumping constraints from 50 to 120 could delineate an olive shaped area in plane b based on the optimization results in fig 10 each pair of objectives could find a two dimensional pareto front such as max gp with min si and max ey with min si on the contrary there is no two dimensional pareto front on the coordinate plane of max gp with max ey characterized by this is caused by the overall positive correlation among the 3 main factors in addition the searching directions of the 3 factors were characterized by which might inevitably lead to a situation which has difficulty in acquiring a monotonic negative related 2 d pareto front around the max point in fig 14 however the nonlinear and non monotonic 3 factors could extend the multiplicity into a 3 d case so the process solutions in fig 14 and 3 objective solutions are overlapped and the differences between the 3 objective solutions and the 2 objective solutions also validate the effectiveness of this 3 objective optimization therefore the positive negative relationship between each of the main factors in multi objective optimization including 2 3 and even higher dimensional objectives is not necessarily determined by natural conditions and physical mechanisms but by human choices and constraints based on the local prospects to extend the constraints to extreme situations like excessive water supply the industry production would reach its highest capability thus the increased water supply would have no positive effect on economic yield besides too much irrigation water could even have a negative influence on agricultural production due to the waterlog disaster or soil salination so the olive shaped constraints could be changed to be able to find a pareto front however this is not the case here in longkou city due to the groundwater scarcity and groundwater pumping restriction policy which were set as constraints in the optimization process this study is based on a simplified evaluation of economic output whereas the results provide initial guidance for a more comprehensive understanding of coastal groundwater utilization the estimation of the groundwater dependent economic yield in this article was based on the previous statistics of wcc guo 2010 but the rapid economic development in china after 2010 along with the inflation rate and the slow increase in the market price of industrial agricultural products as well as the improvement of water utilization efficiency brought about by the development of science and technology has already had a great impact on wcc when government departments adopt wcc for local water resources planning the latest market prices and water consumption volume should be used for updating the wcc the economic transition from agricultural dependent to industrial dependent seems like a plausible plan for solving the water resource problems especially for some developing countries who are facing water resource scarcity environmental problems and comprehensive decision making in urban planning and economic transformation industrialization could change the structure of urban water consumption by transferring the water resource from agricultural uses to urban and industrial uses for higher economic benefit rogers et al 2002 but facing the comprehensive relations of local water supply and demand which is further complicated by the migration of the people from rural to urban areas the accelerated urban economic transition should guarantee food security and employment government plays an important role in coordinating the conflicts among water resources the environment and the economy because the strict groundwater pumping restriction often intervenes through government actions based on local feasibility especially in china where state ownership of land is constitutional the planning of agricultural and industrial land use can only be carried out by the local government reasonable land use planning will provide convenient conditions for subsequent economic development otherwise environmental pollution caused by improper planning would cause huge economic losses due to the costly environmental treatment second small and medium sized industrial enterprises are generally incapable of undertaking water resources surveys or building water conservancy facilities therefore the water conservancy department can only undertake the task of planning and construction also companies and farmers are often reluctant to bear the potential short term economic losses from relocation and water diversion requiring compensation from the government during coordination 6 conclusions a regional s o model was built to solve the groundwater management problems in a coastal city involving water resource scarcity seawater intrusion and demand for economic development the work highlights the importance of a holistic comprehend water policy by considering all the main attributes of groundwater which is complicated by the synthetic interest in social economic and eco hydrological aspects the simulation results of the 3 d numerical model uncovered the seawater intrusion in longkou city is well related to the amount and the spatial distribution of the groundwater pumping especially on the west coast the two objective s o modeling considering the maximization of groundwater abstraction and minimization of seawater intrusion found west coast should carry out groundwater pumping restriction to 50 of the current volume for mitigating seawater intrusion whereas the east coast is insensitive to the seawater intrusion due to the water conservancy facilities and could increase the groundwater pumping to 120 on the basis by dividing the groundwater usage and the corresponding wcc into 7 kinds of industrial usage and 2 kinds of agricultural usage with the spatial distribution difference the current groundwater dependent economic yield was evaluated to be about 2 296 billion cny yr the three objective s o model by adding the third objective function of maximizing economic yield could provide better schemes for different preferences like improving economic yield by 294 million cny or mitigating si on the west coast while maintaining the current economic yield the decision discrepancy caused by partial management would lead to misleading groundwater pumping schemes which could be harmful to the coastal industrial enterprises cause huge economic losses the results suggest the local structural reform of the water consumption regime with rational construction of water conservancy facilities could fundamentally solve the resource environment economy conflict the results emphasized that systematic analysis of transdisciplinary attributes of groundwater must be promoted while searching for a collaborative management strategy

16314,rational coastal groundwater planning is of great significance to freshwater supply for sustainable social economic development and to environmental protection in case of seawater intrusion si quantifying the relation among groundwater quality quantity and the related social economic benefits in a coastal region with intense spatio temporal variation in groundwater abstraction is helpful to the restoration of the coastal aquifer and the practical policymaking however due to the comprehensive reality involving interdisciplinary principles it is usually difficult to integrate all the main attributes of groundwater resources into a mono policymaking process which might lead to biased decisions producing a series of adverse impacts on the environment and the social economy this study thereby develops a combined simulation optimization model s o model in the coastal part of longkou city china for striking the balance among the three main attributes of groundwater i e the groundwater quantity groundwater quality or its environmental function and its related economic yield involving the agricultural and industrial sectors it is seen that the industrial sector contributed over 80 of the economic yield by consuming over 10 of the total groundwater resource and the massive agricultural use of groundwater was mainly responsible for the si the results of the multi objective optimization provided practical alternative schemes for groundwater abstraction in terms of maximizing economic yield and minimizing si moreover the decision discrepancy caused by partial management only considering the groundwater quantity and quality would lower the water use efficiency and then cause unacceptable economic losses for the enterprises and the government our research highlights that the interdisciplinary management of groundwater resources based on the s o model could significantly improve practicability in groundwater policymaking and provides a typical

have raised the concerns about the social economic impacts aroused by the costly treatment and water resource scarcity due to the pumping regulation werner et al 2013 highlighting the necessity of rational groundwater management in coastal regions coastal groundwater management is an interdisciplinary problem involving the regional conditions of hydrogeology climate ecology and the most important human activity which is the external disturbance to the groundwater system and is closely related to the social economic benefits erostate et al 2020 michael et al 2017 steyl and dennis 2010 vu et al 2018 the salination of the coastal aquifer caused by excessive groundwater pumping which in turn has profoundly affected human activities by aggravating freshwater scarcity and posing a great threat to crop yields which has forced some regions to use costly desalinated seawater to supplement freshwater supply askri et al 2010 deng et al 2010 ergil 2000 maas and poss 1989 to ensure the sustainability of coastal groundwater resources more and more studies have paid attention to improving the effectiveness of si mitigation in groundwater management however from the practical perspective of local governments and enterprises a relatively stable supply and demand relationship of the groundwater resources has already been formed during the long term social economic organization the policies obtained from the management that only considers the groundwater quantity and quality might be unacceptable to the water users due to the huge potential social economic costs besides in areas where groundwater overexploitation is caused by freshwater scarcity it is often difficult to find a large amount of freshwater for the usage of injection wells in si treatment there are many cases around the world demonstrating the conflicts among water resources environmental problems and economic benefits highlighting the urgency of rational planning of water resources in sustainable economic development and environmental protection de graaf et al 2019 lefkoff and gorelick 1990 perera et al 2018 post and werner 2017 therefore it is of practical significance to holistically consider the major attributes of groundwater in terms of resource environment and social economy during coastal groundwater management and to translate scientific recognitions to social benefits michael et al 2017 various methods have been applied to mitigate the conflicts among water resources environment and social economic benefits first optimization methods have significant advantages in solving practical questions involving single multi objective optimization problems for example ye et al 2018 developed a multi objective model to optimize the allocation of physical water and virtual water for different water users while considering the environmental impact in beijing of china zhang et al 2014 built a systematic framework to optimize wastewater reuse by considering multiple objectives including wastewater reuse supply and demands costs and profits and pollutants reduction for 31 provinces of china other researchers have paid more attention to the social economic benefits of the water resource for example grundmann et al 2012 proposed a united management model appm for optimal water allocation saline water management and beneficial irrigation strategies al juaidi et al 2014 developed a regional optimization model mainly to maximize the net benefit from agricultural water uses in gaza molinos senante et al 2014 developed an optimization

optimization pso algorithm to maximize the employment resulting from the optimum allocation of water to the agriculture and industry sectors those studies have proved the effectiveness of the optimization methods in solving the macroscopic allocation of water supply and demand while considering some of the social economic benefits whereas lacking the ability to incorporate the physical mechanism of the water cycle and water pollution on the regional scale second the physical based numerical model such as seawat femwater and feflow are common tools to quantify the flow pattern and transport behavior under different scenarios like groundwater pumping regulation and climate change chang et al 2018 oude essink et al 2010 stein et al 2019b vu et al 2018 in these studies scenario simulation is often applied as a conventional manner to study the responding mechanism under specific conditions by changing the input parameters of the model by combining the optimization methods such as the evolutionary algorithm ea and the physical mechanism based numerical model the combined simulation optimization model s o model breaks through the limitation of conventional simulation on preset scenarios so that it can be used as an effective approach to solving regional scale nonlinear optimization problems according to the objective functions although the s o model will lead to huge computational costs derived from the combination of the nonlinear numerical model and the optimization procedure the s o model has its significant advantages in seeking optimal solutions in a complex decision making problem with high accuracy besides high performance computer and surrogate models can still cope with the high computational cost kourakos and mantoglou 2009 2013 song et al 2018 yang

of the s o model mainly focused on the quantity and quality of groundwater only a few studies considered the social economic factors in terms of cost but the social economic benefits are one of the main attributes of the groundwater resource lower dimensional objective management by ignoring some of the main factors might arise decision bias song et al 2020 nowadays more and more researchers have realized the necessity of comprehending social economic benefits in water resource management post and werner 2017 shi and jiao 2014 werner et al 2013 however to our knowledge there have been no published attempts to evaluate the overall economic benefits of groundwater resources in conjunctive groundwater management and the negative impact from the decision bias derived from the partial management is still unknown this study focuses on the longkou city of china a modern coastal city integrating agriculture port harbor industry modern logistics and export oriented processing industry fast economic development and population increase in longkou led to the massive requirement of freshwater resources since the 1980s leading to over exploitation of the coastal aquifer the resulting si area where the chloride concentration is more than 250 mg l has been increased from 45 km2 in the 1980 s to over 140 km2 represented by 250 mg l after the 2000s threatening water safety in longkou fan et al 2020 li et al 2020 xue et al 1995 for the sustainability of the coastal aquifer groundwater pumping regulation has been carried out since the 2000s but little effect has been achieved in controlling si based on the current water policy the goal of this study is to alleviate the resource environment economy conflicts and to mitigate the current extent of si in longkou city under the condition of guaranteeing the groundwater supply and related economic benefits for the agricultural and industrial sectors which depend on the groundwater li et al 2019 shi and jiao 2014 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2008 a multi objective s o model was developed for the purpose of optimizing groundwater exploitation while considering the trade offs among groundwater resources seawater intrusion and economic benefits of the agricultural and industrial sectors to achieve the goal several items should be addressed 1 the condition and the main causes of si at present 2 the agricultural and industrial consumption of groundwater and their related economic benefits 3 the framework of the s o model 4 the preference of choosing optimal schemes based on different conditions and 5 decision discrepancy caused by differences in objective functions 2 study area and data collection 2 1 description of the study area longkou city is located at the north border of shandong province china on the south shore of the bohai sea with a total area of 880 km2 fig 1 most of the urban area which is less than 20 km from the coastline is low lying coastal quaternary sedimentary plain accounted for more than 60 560 km2 of the total area li et al 2020 the north facing terrain gradually raises from the north beach to the low mountains formulated by granite on the south with an averaged elevation of about 600 m longkou has a monsoon climate of medium latitudes with an annual average precipitation of about 630 mm ranging from 402 to 867 mm during the period from 2002 to 2018 the narrow valleys in the low mountain region converge the precipitation into 5 rivers running north into the bohai sea the largest river is the huangshui river on the east and the yongwen river in the middle of the city beima river balisha river and jiehe river on the west longkou is one of china s top 100 comprehensive strength cities in 2019 the gross domestic product gdp of longkou city was 68 01 billion chinese yuan renminbi cny in 2010 and 104 1 billion cny in 2015 and the annual gdp growth exceeded 10 based on the dataset from the national bureau of statistics nbs fig 2 the economic development mainly depends on the export oriented industry including machinery manufacturing chemical industry mining metallurgy paper industry and power groups the secondary industry output value accounted for about 58 2 of the gdp in longkou by 2015 and is still increasing on the other hand longkou is one of the most important agricultural bases in shandong province the main crops are corn and wheat with an annual yield of around 127 106 kg the economic output of agriculture including farming forestry animal husbandry and fishery accounted for about 3 5 of the gdp by 2015 and the total output has remained stable over the past 10 years with china s economic transformation the tertiary industry in longkou which is not strongly dependent on the water resource has grown rapidly in the past decade accounting for 47 5 of gdp by 2019 the excessive groundwater exploitation of over 120 million m3 yr mostly used for agricultural irrigation has led to serious seawater intrusion fig 1 wang et al 2021 in facing the crisis groundwater pumping restriction has been carried out since 2000 the groundwater usage has been drastically cut down from 119 96 106 m3 to 47 06 106 m3 by 2018 fig 4a wrb 2018 which mainly due to the cut from the agricultural usage and in contrast with the groundwater usage decrease surface water usage increased from 34 32 106 m3 yr to 57 56 106 m3 yr fig 4b the surface water has been supplied by the water conservancy facilities which have been built since the 1950s the reservoirs were built at the low mountain district in which wangwu reservoir is the largest with the maximum capacity of 149 106 m3 and a complete set of water canals have been built to transfer the freshwater from the reservoirs at the south to the farmland in the north besides 7 river sluices and 3000 seepage wells were set along the river channel of huangshui river and a groundwater cutoff wall was built in 1995 crossing the estuary district stretching for about 6 7 km the 7 sluices have an impoundment capacity of 4 28 106 m3 and the total annual water retention is about 12 84 106 m3 yr moreover the south to north water diversion project in china since 2000 has provided the maximum capability of 1 3 106 m3 of freshwater resource from the yellow river to longkou city to sum up the 5 river basins provide about 135 106 m3 of freshwater annually including 56 106 m3 of surface water and 79 106 m3 of groundwater for the population of about 718 000 people 7600 ha of basic farmland and more than 300 enterprises in general since 2000 the proportion of water resources used for agriculture has drastically declined due to the pumping restriction and the proportion of industry has increased 2 2 data collection monthly precipitation data from 2000 to 2018 long term daily groundwater level observations of the 34 boreholes from the 1980s to 2019 and the water resource bulletin wrb 2018 involving 4 kinds of uses including agriculture and industry from 2000 to 2018 was collected from the longkou water affairs bureau lkwab 2018 fig 4a and b the detailed inventory of 6776 groundwater pumping wells in longkou city 6491 for agricultural usage and 285 for industrial usage was carried out by the water resource department of shandong provence in 2011 fig 3 which includes the annual groundwater pumping time and pumping rates with detailed information of the wells the uses and users the groundwater quality monitoring was carried out twice a year based on the 52 monitoring wells from 2005 to 2019 li et al 2020 the hydro stratigraphic data were collected based on 86 boreholes collected from the local geological survey institute the hydrogeological parameters were estimated based on the in site aquifer tests of the groundwater level observation wells the terrain datasets used in the groundwater model were collected from the 30 m strm version1 http dds cr usgs gov srtm digital elevation model dem data 3 methodology 3 1 si numerical model in this study a three dimensional transient numerical model was built by using the variable density flow and coupled solute transport model of seawat 2000 guo and langevin 2002 the numerical model was established based on the current monitoring data before coupling with the optimization model 3 1 1 spatial and temporal discretization 1 spatial discretization and the boundary conditions the alluvial diluvial plain and the marine plain as shown in fig 1 were delineated as the modeling area in addition for the reasonable depict of the penetrate pathway of seawater into the coastal aquifer the northern boundary of the model extended 3 km from the coastline towards the shallow sea to include the continental shelf sediments into the simulation scope the top surface of the shallow sea was set as the specific head boundary conditions the southern boundary of the model was set as the no flow boundary condition because most of the potential lateral flow on the southern border is impounded by the reservoirs based on the watershed analysis by gis the discharged runoff from the reservoir can only serve in the river channel of huangshui river due to the impoundment of the 7 sluices fig 3b so the river reaches within the 7 sluices were set as the specific head boundary conditions based on the observed river stages in the vertical direction as shown in fig 5 the numerical model was discretized into 3 layers based on the statistics of the stratigraphic information from the boreholes representing the respective upper holocene unit layer 1 which is composed of alluvial diluvial and marine sediments including gravel sand clay and organic components with a mean thickness of about 15 m the middle holocene unit and the pleistocene unit layer 2 which is mainly composed of alluvial diluvial sediments including gravel sand and clay with the thickness ranging from 0 5 to 53 m and is significantly thicker in the west coast the granite and sandstone unite layer 3 which is considered as the relatively impermeable bottom of the regional aquifer as a result the model was discretized into 165 rows and 260 columns of rectangular mesh in horizontal with the resolution of 200 m 200 m and 3 layers in the vertical direction the total mesh number is 128 700 the model could have a more precisely refined discretization however due to the huge calculational tasks during the optimization process which would increase exponentially the discretization was appropriately simplified 1 temporal discretization the time vary datasets including groundwater level mass concentration precipitation from 1 1 2015 to 12 31 2018 were used for model calibration the 4 years transient simulation was set to have 48 stress periods based on the precipitation data which was monthly averaged in each stress period a total number of 40 timesteps 0 75 day timestep were set to increase the convergence of the nonlinear variable density solute transport model the phreatic aquifer in the study area is mainly replenished by seasonal rainfall and river water infiltration naturally 60 of the rainfall is concentrated in the summer season from june to september but due to the concentrated groundwater pumping for wheat growing from may to july the natural dynamic of the groundwater table fluctuation is altered to be driven by the irrigation cycle and the seasonal rainfall cycle 3 1 2 model calibration and sensitivity analysis the hydrogeological parameters of the model including hydraulic conductivity k specific yield sy rainfall infiltration coefficient ic porosity and longitudinal transverse dispersivity dl dt were adjusted during the calibration process based on the monitored datasets and results of the in suit aquifer tests table 1 the mass concentration of chloride ion cl was assigned to the model in layers based on the observations of the 52 wells we assume the homogeneous and isotropic material property in each sub domain as shown in fig 5 two fitting criteria including the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae were used to calibrate and validate the numerical model 1 rmse j 1 m i 1 n h c i h o i j 2 m n 2 mae j 1 m i 1 n h c i h o i j m n where hc and ho are the calculated head at the jth time step from the simulation model and observed head at ith observation location n is the number of observation locations m is the number of time steps after the calibration process an oat one factor at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the main factor that influences the si on one hand and on the other hand to test the robustness of the numerical model so that it could meet the requirement of the optimization process in all the parameters rainfall infiltration ic and groundwater pumping rates are the main factors that control the source sink of the si hydraulic conductivity k could strongly control the groundwater flow under the intensive groundwater pumping so those parameters were tested through increasing and decreasing the baseline value by 5 to 10 morris 1991 feng et al 2018 wang et al 2021 3 2 simulation optimization model in this study the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii was used for searching optimal solutions due to its efficiency in solving nonlinear multi objective problems including water resource allocation cost benefit evaluation and pollutants reduction and the seawat code was used for solving equations of the density dependent solute transport model guo and langevin 2002 the seawat model was modified into a subroutine that was repeatedly called by the main program in nsga ii for the calculation of salinity concentrations of the model grids under different groundwater pumping conditions and the concentration at the end of the management period was read by the evaluation process of the nsga ii through which an evolved generation of groundwater pumping conditions are generated for updating the simulation model the evolutionary process will stop after the ending criteria are met 3 2 1 decision variables and constraints the decision variables in this study were the groundwater pumping rate of the pumping zones which were delimited based on the administrative sub regions in longkou city the framework of the water usage in longkou is illustrated in fig 4 which shows the main water consumptions are agriculture and industry agricultural usage mainly includes 2 periods of irrigation for wheat and corn and industrial usage mainly includes 7 kinds of industries it is worth mentioning that the groundwater pumping for industrial uses is mainly discharged through wastewater pipes to sewage treatment plants and river reaches whereas the groundwater pumping for agricultural irrigation could partially re infiltrate into the aquifer as a replenishment making the groundwater net loss gnl in the numerical model less than the actual groundwater pumping volume thus the groundwater usage regime in each pumping zone could be expressed as follow 3 v r v r a v r i v r i α v r v s 1 r i v r a v r i where v r a and v r i are the agricultural usage and the industrial usage of the total groundwater usage α is the proportion of the industrial usage to the total groundwater usage and ri is the re infiltration rate of the agricultural irrigation vs and vr represent the compensated and the actual groundwater pumping volume respectively the formula can be transformed into the following form 4 v r 1 1 r i r i α v s v r i α 1 r i r i α v s v r a 1 a 1 r i r i α v s based on the regional policies groundwater extraction needs to be further reduced to prevent si so the gnl in each pumping zone which is essentially responsible for the si was set to vary between 50 to 120 of the current volume v s 0 which can be expressed as 5 0 5 v s 0 v s 1 2 v s 0 3 2 2 objective functions water resource scarcity and seawater intrusion are typical problems for coastal regions and the underlying cause of the two problems is social economic benefits such as water dependent products and urban water supply so the objective functions are used to deal with these three problems including maximization of the total groundwater pumping max gp minimization of the seawater intrusion min si and the maximization of the economic yield max ey the calculation of the total groundwater pumping volume from different pumping zones can be expressed as 6 v s t t n n q n t δ t where q n m3 d is the groundwater pumping rate of the n pumping zone in the t stress period n is the total number of the pumping zones and t is the number of the stress periods respectively while in the groundwater numerical model the groundwater pumping can be assigned as pumping wells or areal source sinks in the situation of this study for about 7000 wells in the modeling area which is more convenient to convert the wells to the areal source sinks in each pumping zones for optimization so the function of the first objective is expressed as 7 max f g n l t t n n q n t a n δ t where q n t m d is the net pumping rate npr set in the numerical model of the n pumping zone which has an area of an the second objective is to minimize the chloride mass in the modeled area at the end of the management period which can be expressed as 8 min f s i m a s s e n d m a s s i n i where the m a s s i n i and m a s s e n d is the total chloride mass kg calculated by the numerical model at the beginning and the end of the management period respectively in the numerical model the calculation of the total mass content can be expressed as m a s s m i j k m c i j k a i j k h i j k b o t i j k θ i j k m i j k u n c o n f i n e d 9 a m i j k m c i j k a i j k t o p i j k b o t i j k θ i j k m i j k c o n f i n e d 9 a where i j and k are the row column and layer numbers of the mth mesh in the numerical model m represents the total number of mesh in the numerical model a i j k b o t i j k c i j k and θ i j k are the area bottom elevation the concentration of the cl and the porosity of the mi j k mesh respectively t o p i j k and h i j k represent the top elevation and the hydrological head of the mesh mi j k for different meshes eq 9a is used when the mi j k is in the unconfined aquifer or eq 9b is used when the mi j k is in the confined aquifer the function of the third objective was the maximization of the economic yield ey due to the complexity in the dynamic input output relationship in economic activities we introduce an approximate calculation method to estimate the groundwater dependent economic yield based on the water consumption coefficient γ which represents the volume of water needed by the p product for unit income the evaluation of the economic yield can be expressed as 10 max f e y t i t c 11 t i n n p p v r n c p n γ p 12 t c f n n v r n where ti and tc is the total income and the total cost of the actual groundwater pumping volume in all the n pumping zones for p kinds of products v r n represents the actual groundwater pumping volume of the nth pumping zone as expressed in formulation 3 and 4 c represents the percentage of the groundwater used by the p product in the nth pumping zone γ m3 cny is the water consumption coefficient wcc representing the volume of water needed by the p product for unit income based on previous statistics of the national gdp and water consumption in china by guo 2010 f represents the groundwater resource fees 0 45cny m3 in shandong province overall both gp si and gp ey have a positive relationship however by adding the spatial differences of the pumping zones into the overall relations the situation could be significantly complicated due to the differences in the sensitivity of si to gp and the difference in the overall wcc of the sub regions for example increasing gp in certain locations within a certain range could mitigate si stein et al 2019a and the ey would be reduced by supplying a higher proportion of water resources to the sub regions or the industries with lower economic efficiency therefore to acquire a full understanding of the complicated regional situation two optimization problems were considered including 1 a two objective optimization for fully exploring the potential possibility of groundwater supply and si mitigation by considering the maximization of gp and the minimization of si and 2 a three objective optimization for balancing the water resource water environment and economy by considering the maximization of gp the minimization of si and the maximization of ey 4 results and analyses the performance of the numerical model was validated for representing the current situation of si then two sets of optimization results were obtained through a two objective optimization considering the trade offs between gp and si and a three objective optimization considering the trade offs among gp si ey the optimal schemes of the groundwater pumping were chosen based on different preferences and the two sets of optimal solutions were compared to evaluate the decision discrepancy 4 1 response of seawater intrusion to groundwater pumping 4 1 1 calibration results of the numerical model the numerical model was cautiously calibrated to simulate the distribution and dynamics of si as realistically as possible and the simulated distribution of cl in 2018 is illustrated in fig 7 the scatter diagrams of groundwater level and mass concentration and the representative hydrographs against the observed value in the 4 years calibration process are shown in fig 6 results show that the calculated groundwater level was consistent with the observations during the simulation period the rmse and mae of groundwater level were 0 87 m and 0 62 m respectively and the rmse and mae of cl concentration was 59 9 mg l and 39 2 mg l the regional groundwater table was consistent with the surface topography except for the two groundwater depression cones with the groundwater level lower than 0 m fig 1 negative water level region one on the west coast and the other one on the lower reaches of the huangshui river the sensitivity analysis shows that the cl concentration was mainly controlled by the intensive groundwater pumping which was the main cause of the groundwater depression cone so that the seawater could directly recharge the inland aquifer fig 7 intrusion zone precipitation had a positive influence on diluting the concentration of cl at the rim of the intrusion area whereas precipitation could not significantly reduce the overall mass of cl in the whole model because the coastline groundwater pumping could lead to the recharge from the sea also the dilution effect mainly took place at the top of the aquifer which is where excessive groundwater pumping took place leaving little fresh water for diluting the deeper aquifer where concentration is higher so groundwater pumping is the main factor that controls the si the fluctuation of the observed hydrograph had certain randomness due to the annual change of the detailed groundwater pumping condition and the precipitation variation also the anisotropy of the geological condition could contribute to the randomness so that made it very difficult for the numerical model to follow the observed hydrograph at every time step of 0 75 day under the condition of lacking more detailed information therefore as long as the simulation is of a similar fluctuation and the overall consistency with the observation in an acceptable accuracy the numerical model is calibrated and could be used for evaluating the essential response of si to gp and be adequate for optimization simulation 4 1 2 spatio temporal variation of gp and si based on the simulation results seawater intrusion response to groundwater pumping from two aspects 1 seasonal cycle of the groundwater pumping controlled by the seasonal agricultural irrigation 2 spatial distribution of the groundwater pumping influenced by the land usage and the water conservancy facilities two periods of seasonal irrigation cycle were the main driving force of groundwater table including the spring irrigation from march to june and winter irrigation from october to december aiming for wheat sown in autumn and corn sown in summer spring irrigation accounted for about 82 of the annual irrigation water due to the larger water demand for wheat growth and winter irrigation accounted for about 18 fig 4 in response to the groundwater pumping cycle the lowest groundwater level was in mid july every year after spring irrigation fig 6 during which the concentration of cl is also the highest in the year the groundwater pumping could bring the groundwater from the deep which has a higher concentration to the shallow aquifer but the following rainfall could again dilute the concentration in the shallow aquifer so the coastline area such as the estuarine district of yongwen river where there is no groundwater pumping fig 3 the concentration in the shallow aquifer is quite low fig 7 layer 1 so there was a vertical variation of the concentration that the concentration in the deeper aquifer was higher than in the shallow aquifer fig 7 layer 2 the pumping distribution also has a strong influence on si table 2 illustrates the groundwater usage wu for the 11 pumping zones pz based on the statistic of the 6776 pumping wells the 11 pumping zones are shown in fig 8 c the groundwater usage in 3 of the 11 pumping zones exceeded 10 000 103 m3 yr including pz 3 9 10 leading to the groundwater depression cones pz 2 3 5 at the west coast has the total groundwater abstraction of 16 966 103 m3 yr the groundwater table in this district was below 0 m ranging from 4 to 2 m fig 1 the negative water level region and was still declining during the year from 2015 to 2018 fig 6 a4 the rapid decline of the groundwater table led to the large quantity of seawater directly penetrating the coastline into the inland aquifer by using the streamline analysis based on the numerical model seawater along the coastline from yongwen river to jiehe river could penetrate the west coast aquifer for about 3 km affecting about 54 5 km2 of the west coast aquifer with the highest cl concentration up to 3000 mg l fig 7 intrusion zone in contrast the wu in pz 9 zhuyouguan town was about 18 129 103 m3 yr but could not trigger si due to the obstruction from the groundwater cut off wall at the estuary of huangshui river the concentration of cl ranged from 150 to 400 mg l on the east coast which derived from the si before the construction of the cut off wall in 1995 and was slowly decreasing during the simulation time the groundwater along the east coastline from yongwen river to the east discharges into the sea based on streamlined analysis fig 7 discharge zone the cut off wall enclosed a relatively independent groundwater system that was replenished by rainfall and river infiltration facilitated by the impounded runoff in the 7 sluices discharges mainly through groundwater pumping besides considering the current distribution of si was caused by persisting gp since the 1990s the uneven distribution of gp and the precipitation during the last 30 years has made the concentration of the shallow aquifer have a porphyritic distribution the gp restriction since 2000 could only slow the speed of si but not retract the intrusion area because of the negative groundwater level and the intrusion zone on the west coast 4 1 3 pareto optimal solutions balancing gp and si having ascertained the relationship between seawater intrusion and groundwater abstraction it is necessary to fully explore the possibilities of mitigating si while maximizing the groundwater pumping for the guarantee of groundwater supply thus minimizing ƒsi and maximizing ƒgnl was set as objective functions in the s o model the annually averaged net pumping rate npr of the 11 pumping zones in the seawat model were set as the decision variables which could vary between 50 to 120 of the current value based on the local policy demand for restricting groundwater abstraction the management period was set to 6 years and the population number npop in each generation was set to 100 the crossover probability and mutation probability was 0 9 and 0 05 respectively the pareto solutions of the two objective s o model were illustrated in the two dimensional scatter plot as shown in fig 8a the gray arrow indicates the optimal direction for each objective it can be observed that the ƒsi has an overall positive relationship with the ƒgnl to increase the ƒgnl to 27 0 106 m3 yr the ƒsi could increase to 1 012 indicating a 1 2 increase in the total mass of cl in the groundwater system to decrease the ƒgnl to 18 3 106 m3 yr fig 8a t0 ƒsi could decrease to 0 983 indicating a 1 7 decrease in the total mass of cl there is a significant inflection point of the slope in the scatter plot which indicates that the response relation of si and gp is not linear when the ƒgnl is reduced to less than 22 5 106 m3 yr fig 8a t2 the ability to mitigate si would be significantly weakened to compare the optimization solutions with the current situation as shown in fig 8a and b there could be a significant improvement in the groundwater pumping allocation to mitigate si scheme t0 could be representative that the npr in pz 1 2 3 5 6 should be reduced to the lower limit which is 50 of the current npr on the contrary pz 4 7 8 9 10 11 could support a nearly 20 increase in the npr fig 8d as an alternative scheme t2 represents the equal ƒgnl as the present while having the second minimum ƒsi as shown in figs 8b and 11 t2 only pz 2 and pz 6 need a 50 reduction in npr whereas the other pzs could increase their npr to the upper limit of 120 for maximizing ƒgnl without adverse effect to si as shown in t1 only pz 6 needs an 50 reduction in npr all the other pzs could increase their npr for searching the maximum ƒgnl all the optimized schemes simultaneously increased the npr in pz 4 7 8 9 10 11 to the upper limit of 120 indicating a relatively weaker influence on the si in those districts and the npr in pz 1 2 3 5 6 is sensitive to the groundwater quality implying that these areas are highly risky to seawater intrusion 4 2 three objective optimization balancing gp si ey the two objective optimization can identify the main factor of seawater intrusion and could also provide optimal strategies for si mitigation on this basis the detailed groundwater usage was further distinguished for evaluating the economic yield dependent on the groundwater the three objective optimization was then carried out by adding the third objective function of maximizing the ƒey for the refinement of the optimal schemes 4 2 1 economic output evaluation based on the datasets of the pumping wells as shown in fig 3 groundwater usage wu was divided into industrial usage wui and agricultural usage wua table 2 for industrial usage α represents the proportion of the industrial usage to the total groundwater usage in each pumping zone the 285 industrial pumping wells were used for 7 kinds of industries including power groups pg mining mi paper industry pp chemical industry ch machinery ma food fd and domestic life li the water consumption coefficients wcc of different industrial usages were also listed in table 2 digits in parentheses and fig 4 among the industrial usages the wcc of the paper industry food and chemical industry were higher ranging from 334 7 m3 104cny to 51 1 m3 104cny indicating that those industries need more water for production while the wcc of machinery manufacturing and mining industry were lower ranging from 19 6 m3 104cny to 9 0 m3 104cny those industries are less dependent on water resources and has a higher economic output in terms of the agricultural sector the groundwater was mainly used for two periods of irrigation of wheat and corn as explained in section 4 1 2 the irrigational water demand of wheat and corn in longkou was about 850 m3 103kg and 185 m3 103kg respectively that is about 2833 m3 104cny and 660 m3 104cny according to the unit price of wheat 3 0 cny kg and corn 2 8 cny kg it could be found that the agricultural wcc is significantly larger than the industrial wcc due to the much larger water demand of the irrigational water and the low price of the staple grain in addition due to the functional differences in administrative sub regions which are delimited by the government different pumping zones have different groundwater pumping regimes and different overall wcc as illustrated in table 2 power groups pg and the paper industry pp which have the largest groundwater consumption among all the industries were mostly located in pz9 and pz10 the mining industry and chemical industry were in pz2 pz9 and pz10 the food industry was mainly in pz3 and pz4 in summary pz2 longgang development zone pz9 zhuyouguan town and pz10 langao town were industrially centralized industrial usage of groundwater accounted for 36 6 26 46 and 23 79 respectively of the total groundwater usage in each district resulting in a relatively lower overall wcc higher economic efficiency in these 3 sub regions while in the other pzs the proportion of industrial usage were less than 7 resulting in a relatively higher overall wcc the overall wcc of the 11 pumping zones is sorted from large pz6 to small pz2 in fig 8c as a result by using the groundwater pumping calculated by the numerical model based on the water resource bulletin wrb and the detailed allocation in table 2 and the formulation in section 3 2 the calculated actual groundwater usage in longkou city was about 51 7 106 m3 yr including industrial usage and the agricultural usage of groundwater about 6 7 106 m3 yr and 45 106 m3 yr respectively causing the net loss in groundwater ƒgnl of 22 58 106 m3 yr the current total economic yield depended on the groundwater usage in longkou city was estimated to be about 2 296 billion cny yr 4 2 2 trade off surface of the optimal solutions in the three objective management the population number npop in each generation was increased to 200 which still might not be enough to depict a clear pareto optimal surface of this three objective optimization whereas further increasing the npop will make the total calculation time unacceptable therefore the s o model was set to proceed with the evolutionary process for another 10 generations after the ending criteria were met the last 10 generations were used for depicting the pareto optimal surface the s o model terminated at the 81st generation 1254 optimal solutions were archived from the 2000 solutions of the last 10 generations the optimal solutions balancing ƒgnl ƒsi and ƒey were plotted in the three dimensional coordinate plot as shown in fig 9 also for a better understanding of the spatial distribution of the optimal solutions the projections of the solutions are plotted as gray dots on the three coordinate planes the gray arrows on each primary axes indicate the optimal directions of the three objectives the optimal solutions formulated a pareto optimal surface covering a spatial extent ranging from 18 2 to 27 0 106 m3 yr for ƒgnl 0 983 1 012 for ƒsi and 1 74 2 75 109 cny for ƒey the current situation is marked as n0 in fig 9 fig 10 illustrates the projections of the three objective optimal solutions light blue dots and the two objective optimal solutions black dots on the three coordinate planes respectively after manually calculating the ƒey of the two objective optimal solutions results show that the distribution has significant differences 1 the projection of the optimal solutions shows a banded distribution on plane a the ƒgnl and ƒsi coordinate plane with a bandwidth of about 3 106 m3 yr along the ƒgnl axis direction the α boundary of the band is close to the pareto front of the two objective optimization and the β boundary is on the opposite side when ƒgnl is larger than 25 106 m3 yr the optimal solution shrinks to a linear distribution and extends along the α boundary 2 on plane b the ƒgnl and ƒey coordinate plane the optimal solutions also show a banded distribution but in an s shape the α boundary is on the right hand side of the band and the β boundary is on the left it can be seen from this coordinate plane that the β boundary represents the largest ƒey solution set under the same ƒgnl the α boundary and the β boundary overlap at the left and right end indicating that when the ƒgnl is close to the lower limit of the constraints 50 of the current ƒgnl and the upper limit 120 of the current ƒgnl the optimal solutions of the max ƒey are almost identical increasing groundwater abstraction could promote ƒey significantly to about 2 7 109 cny whereas in between the two boundaries have a distance up to 0 5 109 cny along the ƒey axis direction implying that different spatial allocation of groundwater pumping could have very different economic yield and in a certain range increasing ƒgnl could even reduce ƒey which is mainly due to the differences in wcc of the sub regions in addition when ƒgnl is over 25 106 m3 yr increasing the ƒgnl would have little benefit to the economy 3 on plane c the ƒsi ƒey coordinate plane the optimal solutions illustrate a curve like distribution with a positive correlation between ƒsi and ƒey the curve includes two straight line segments the lower segment of ƒey less than 2 7 109 cny has a larger slope than the upper segment the linear distribution of the optimal solution implies that increasing economic yield on the pareto surface will inevitably come at the cost of expansion of seawater intrusion and after economic yield reaches its up limit seawater intrusion could expand further by increasing the groundwater abstraction 4 2 3 optimal schemes analysis as shown in figs 9 and 10 there is a certain distance between the current situation n0 and the trade off surface formulated by the optimal solutions implying that the current groundwater pumping allocation neither fully explored the economic efficiency of groundwater resources nor effectively controls the seawater intrusion based on the optimal results some optimal solutions were chosen as the alternative groundwater abstraction schemes for specific prospects including 1 maximization of economic yield and 2 minimization of the seawater intrusion all the chosen optimal solutions should follow 2 basic rules the ƒsi should not be becoming worsen than the current situation the ƒey should be larger than the current situation as a result 3 typical solutions were chosen and marked in fig 10 the 3 optimal schemes are s1 with the maximum ƒey under the condition of the same ƒsi as the current situation s2 possessing the maximum ƒey with the same ƒsi and ƒgnl as the present and s3 with the minimum ƒsi under the condition of the same ƒey as the present s4 and s5 were chosen as a pair of references to compare with the optimal schemes s4 has the minimum ƒsi with the same ƒgnl as the present and s5 has the similar ƒsi and ƒey with s4 the percentage changes in npr corresponding to the selected optimal schemes are illustrated in fig 11 further the actual groundwater usage for industry wui and agriculture wua transformed from ƒgnl based on the formulations in section 3 2 are shown in table 3 1 maximization of economic yield in the selected optimal solutions s1 red rectangle in fig 10c is selected as a preferable scheme from the aspect of maximizing the ƒey because the ƒey of s1 could be potentially increased by 294 million cny from the current 2 296 billion cny to 2 590 billion cny and will not lead to further extension of seawater intrusion the ƒgnl of s1 increased from the current 22 58 106 m3 yr to 24 12 106 m3 yr fig 10 plane a and plane b which is achieved by increasing the pumping rates of almost all the pumping zones by 20 except for pz 1 pz 5 and pz 6 which need to reduce the current pumping rate to 65 50 and 51 respectively figs 11 s1 by comparing fig 10 plane a and plane c we found that the optimal solutions distributed on the line with ƒsi equal to 1 have similar value in ƒey with s1 therefore scheme s2 yellow rectangle in fig 10 was selected based on the similar ƒsi and ƒgnl conditions to the current situation for the maximum ƒey as shown in fig 10 plane c the ƒey value of s2 was about 2 553 billion a little smaller than s1 but the ƒgnl of s2 was less than the situation in s1 the transformed actual groundwater usage was about 54 45 106 m3 yr and 50 60 106 m3 yr for s1 and s2 respectively tables 3 s1 and s2 the total industrial usage was quite similar but the agricultural usage reduced by 3 6 106 m3 yr from 46 66 106 m3 yr in s1 to 43 06 106 m3 yr in s2 in terms of spatial allocation as shown in fig 11 the difference between s1 and s2 was in pz1 and in pz3 which indicates that similar economic output could be achieved if groundwater abstraction in pz1 was transferred to pz3 however the groundwater usage in pz1 was much smaller than the usage in pz3 table 2 making pz1 easier to make a change groundwater pumping restriction also the relatively larger amount of industrial usage of groundwater in pz3 table 3 0 69 106 m3 yr for wui in s1 compared to 0 39 106 m3 yr in s2 provides an opportunity for some of the enterprises to move the site from pz1 to pz3 therefore s1 is preferable to s2 in terms of maximizing the economic yield and groundwater resources 2 minimization of the seawater intrusion to minimize the seawater intrusion s3 could be representative green triangle in fig 10 because the ƒsi of s3 could decrease to 0 994 and would keep the same ƒey as the present as shown in table 3 the actual industrial usage of groundwater in s3 was about 6 91 106 m3 yr which is similar to the current volume but the agricultural usage had to be reduced by 5 26 106 m3 yr from the current of 45 106 m3 yr to 39 74 106 m3 yr the re distribution of the groundwater abstraction in s3 would reduce the total ƒgnl which is mainly caused by the reduction of the npr in pz 1 3 5 6 by 50 figs 11 s3 the rest of the pumping zones could increase their pumping rate to 120 except for pz 2 which could only increase to 110 the result implies that for mitigating si most of the groundwater abstraction on the west coast should be relocated to the east coast except for pz2 for reference scheme s4 yellow triangle in fig 9a was chosen from the aspect of minimizing the seawater intrusion based on the same ƒgnl as the present s4 has the ƒsi of about 0 990 which is the smallest in all the 4 schemes and the total groundwater usage of 52 83 106 m3 yr is larger than 46 65 106 m3 yr in s3 table 3 this suggests that the extent of seawater intrusion could be further reduced while increasing the available groundwater resources however the ƒey of s4 was only about 2 086 billion which is about 210 million cny less than the current situation and 504million cny less than s1 the economic efficiency of s4 is the lowest among the 4 selected schemes this is mainly due to the reduction in the industrial usage of groundwater by 0 65 106 m3 yr from 6 91 106 m3 yr in s3 to 6 26 106 m3 yr in s4 to compare s3 with s4 in fig 11 s4 restricted the groundwater abstraction in pz2 rather than pz1 and pz3 so the wui of pz2 in s4 1 74 106 m3 yr was about 1 2 106 m3 yr less than that in s3 2 94 106 m3 yr in terms of economic output pz2 is industrially centralized the enterprises located in this district have a significantly larger economic efficiency than the agricultural output in pz1 and pz3 the water resource deficit caused by the restriction of groundwater abstraction in pz2 might inhibit the productivity of the enterprises causing a potential economic loss of 210 million cny which is unacceptable for the enterprises and the local government also it is very difficult and costly for those mega sites like power groups and mining industries to move to other locations on the contrary it is much easier for relocating some of the irrigation dependent farmland in pz 1 3 5 6 to other places like pz 4 7 8 11 which could increase their npr by 20 therefore in terms of controlling seawater intrusion scheme s3 is preferable to scheme s4 for the feasibility of the economic transformation to summarize facing different prospects like maximization of economic yield and minimization of seawater intrusion there is still potential for optimization based on the current situation the differences in the relocation of the groundwater abstraction derive from the differences in wcc of the industries and sub regions which could translate water resource to economic yield and could determine the economic efficiency 4 3 decision discrepancy caused by additional major objectives by comparing the three objective and the two objective solutions we found that the lower dimensional objective optimization which ignores some of the major attributes in formulating objective functions might not be representative of the real situation in this case the groundwater stored in the coastal aquifer has three major attributes 1 the resource attribute groundwater is an important live element 2 the environmental attribute overexploitation of groundwater will cause serious seawater intrusion which is detrimental to the coastal ecosystem and 3 economic attribute groundwater supply is the main factors of production for agriculture and industry in longkou city the spatial distribution of groundwater abstraction was pre set by the distribution of the groundwater users including the farmland and the enterprises the re allocation of groundwater abstraction while ignoring the economic attribute of groundwater could have a serious negative impact on agricultural and industrial development that depend on groundwater resources to clarify the importance of considering the economic attribute for the multi objective optimization of the coastal groundwater the 3 objective optimal solutions along the β boundary in fig 10 were selected as the representative solution set to compare with the 2 objective optimal solutions and the variation in economic yield and groundwater usages against ƒsi were plotted in fig 12 the result shows that in the two objective optimization there is no recognition of the economic efficiency so scheme t1 and t2 cost more wu to reach a similar ey as scheme s2 and s3 water usage efficiency in the two objective optimization was lower than that in 3 objective optimization because the 3 objective optimization placed more emphasis on industry the wui industrial usage of groundwater along the β boundary created over 90 of the ey total economic yield by using only 14 of the groundwater resource indicating the economic efficiency of industry is much higher than that of basic agriculture so increasing wui from 11 4 t2 and 13 1 t1 to over 14 s3 and s2 could increase eyi economic yield of industry from around 87 89 2 t1 and t2 to over 90 s2 and s3 thus to maintain economic output industrial usage of groundwater should be guaranteed as a priority and agricultural usage of groundwater wua was forced to be reduced by applying water saving irrigation strategies and the planting of drought tolerant crops to control seawater intrusion the economic transformation could ensure sustainable growth by providing more water to the industry sector while improving the patterns of agricultural water usage without the structural reform of the water consumption regime it will be inevitable to cause potential economic losses for further si alleviation to further clarify the spatial relocation of npr the percentage variations in the npr of the 11 pumping zones for the two optimal solution sets fig 12 were plotted against ƒsi in fig 13 c f the result shows for controlling seawater intrusion two solution sets have different preferences in the sequence of the pumping zones for groundwater abstraction reduction for 2 objective optimization the sequence of groundwater abstraction reduction from first to last is pz6 pz2 pz5 pz1 pz3 pz4 fig 13c and the sequence in 3 objective optimization is pz6 pz5 pz3 pz1 pz2 pz4 fig 13e the two sequences have the same beginning and ending representing that for controlling seawater intrusion pz6 is the most necessary to reduce groundwater pumping while pz4 hardly affects seawater intrusion the order of pz2 changed the most in the two sequences because pz2 is an industrial centralized district with greater economic output capacity therefore to ensure economic output the groundwater abstraction in pz2 needs to be guaranteed which indirectly increases the necessity of reducing the groundwater abstraction in the surrounding pumping zones pz1 pz3 and pz5 to control seawater intrusion however due to the strong positive influence from the pumping rate of pz2 on the seawater intrusion the surrounding pumping zones need to further reduce their pumping rates in exchange for the seawater intrusion caused by the groundwater pumping in pz2 for example scheme s5 has a larger npr of pz2 than s4 but for getting a similar ƒsi fig 10 s5 must further reduce the npr of pz1 pz3 and pz5 to 50 fig 13c and e in one word decision discrepancy is caused by ignoring some of the major attributes of the decision variables failure to consider the major objectives might lead to biased decisions which are often inoperable in practical applications in this study biased decision making might have a negative impact on industrial enterprises which would reduce water usage efficiency and cause huge economic losses by considering the economic attribute of the groundwater also by dividing the industrial and agricultural usage of groundwater through the corresponding wcc the groundwater pumping allocation was complicated by another dimension of economic benefits which has a very different discipline with the relation between gp and si and due to the spatial differences in the water usage regime of the sub regions the total groundwater usage in longkou city has a non linear and non monotonic relation with the total economic yield of the city so the optimal allocation of the groundwater abstraction could only be solved by adding the objective function of economic yield during the optimization process along with the other major objectives 4 4 utilization of the water conservancy facilities based on the optimal results there is a significant difference in the preference of the pumping zones to either increase or decrease their pumping rates as shown in fig 13a and b the percentage variations of the averaged npr in each pumping zones in a generation 200 population during the whole evolutionary process of 81 generations were plotted the 11 pumping zones were divided into west coast and east coast for comparison on the east coast the water conservancy facilities are beneficial to the freshwater supply therefore all the pumping zones from pz7 to pz11 approached 120 of the current npr successively in the evolutionary process suggesting that the east coast increases its groundwater abstraction without significantly extending seawater intrusion among all the east coast pumping zones pz9 was the first to approach 120 which has the largest groundwater abstraction among all the 11 pumping zones and the shortest distance to the coastline those conditions made pz9 the most vulnerable to seawater intrusion however due to the groundwater cut off wall seawater is completely removed from the recharge source of the groundwater also due to the additional replenishment from the river infiltration supplied by the retained runoff in the 7 sluices who have total annual water retention of about 12 84 million m3 the riverside aquifer along huangshui river could afford the 20 additional npr so the groundwater pumping in the east coast was almost irrelevant to ƒsi as shown in fig 13d and f on the west coast there is no protection from water conservancy facilities so there were significant spatial differences in the optimized npr as shown in fig 13a the averaged npr of pz5 and pz6 have a downward trend to 60 of the current value during the evolutionary process indicating the npr of these two pumping zones should be reduced as much as possible for mitigating seawater intrusion on the contrary all the optimal solutions tend to increase the pumping rate of pz4 to the upper limit of the constraints 120 of the current value which indicates groundwater abstraction in pz4 barely influence the seawater intrusion therefore increasing the groundwater abstraction in pz4 is beneficial to the economy and the total water resource in terms of pz1 pz3 the percentage change was between 85 and 100 which indicates that different preferences of the optimal scheme will lead to different values of the npr in these three pumping zones to sum up the west coast is more vulnerable to seawater intrusion because there is no protection from water conservancy facilities at present however constructing new water conservancy facilities should be in line with the local hydrogeological conditions and the social economic development preference currently only the upper reaches of the yongwen river have been constructed a few sluices for the water supply of the aluminum plant and the sufficient water storage of beixingjia reservoir which is used for industrial production exclusively did not fully use therefore the construction of sluices in the middle and lower reaches of the yongwen river could be a plausible plan to increase the total water resource in districts like pz4 pz6 and pz7 under the condition of increasing the ecological discharge from the reservoir on the other hand it would be too costly for the west coast to build a groundwater cutoff wall due to the 41 km long coastline and the thicker quaternary sediments up to 75 m but only a partial segment of the cutoff wall will not be capable of resisting seawater intrusion from both sides of the peninsula thus relocation of the water dependent basic farmland and construction of more water conservancy facilities for water supply are the two sides of the coin for the optimal management of the water resources on the west coast during which the cost of changing site and the feasibility of water diversion should be considered 5 discussion the social economic benefit is one of the major attributes of the groundwater resource in the coastal region considering the major attributes is vital to rational groundwater management avoiding misunderstanding and biased decision making during environmental governance in longkou city the three objective functions were formulated based on the current eco society problems of water scarcity seawater intrusion and demand for economic development based on the analysis in section 3 2 2 and the optimal results each 2 among the 3 factors has an overall positive correlation and a partial negative correlation and the relationship among the three factors gp si ey is nonlinear and non monotonic which will lead to a 3 d multiplicity of solutions all the groundwater pumping schemes limited by the constraints could constitute a 3 d scattered point set waiting for arbitrary searching directions like maximization or minimization in the 3 d coordinate system formulated by the three factors in this case the constraints were set based on the local policy of groundwater pumping restriction and the hydrogeological limitations as shown in fig 14 due to the nonlinear and non monotonic relationship between ƒgnl and ƒey representing by the black arrows in fig 14 which derives from the difference in overall wcc of the sub regions the groundwater pumping constraints from 50 to 120 could delineate an olive shaped area in plane b based on the optimization results in fig 10 each pair of objectives could find a two dimensional pareto front such as max gp with min si and max ey with min si on the contrary there is no two dimensional pareto front on the coordinate plane of max gp with max ey characterized by this is caused by the overall positive correlation among the 3 main factors in addition the searching directions of the 3 factors were characterized by which might inevitably lead to a situation which has difficulty in acquiring a monotonic negative related 2 d pareto front around the max point in fig 14 however the nonlinear and non monotonic 3 factors could extend the multiplicity into a 3 d case so the process solutions in fig 14 and 3 objective solutions are overlapped and the differences between the 3 objective solutions and the 2 objective solutions also validate the effectiveness of this 3 objective optimization therefore the positive negative relationship between each of the main factors in multi objective optimization including 2 3 and even higher dimensional objectives is not necessarily determined by natural conditions and physical mechanisms but by human choices and constraints based on the local prospects to extend the constraints to extreme situations like excessive water supply the industry production would reach its highest capability thus the increased water supply would have no positive effect on economic yield besides too much irrigation water could even have a negative influence on agricultural production due to the waterlog disaster or soil salination so the olive shaped constraints could be changed to be able to find a pareto front however this is not the case here in longkou city due to the groundwater scarcity and groundwater pumping restriction policy which were set as constraints in the optimization process this study is based on a simplified evaluation of economic output whereas the results provide initial guidance for a more comprehensive understanding of coastal groundwater utilization the estimation of the groundwater dependent economic yield in this article was based on the previous statistics of wcc guo 2010 but the rapid economic development in china after 2010 along with the inflation rate and the slow increase in the market price of industrial agricultural products as well as the improvement of water utilization efficiency brought about by the development of science and technology has already had a great impact on wcc when government departments adopt wcc for local water resources planning the latest market prices and water consumption volume should be used for updating the wcc the economic transition from agricultural dependent to industrial dependent seems like a plausible plan for solving the water resource problems especially for some developing countries who are facing water resource scarcity environmental problems and comprehensive decision making in urban planning and economic transformation industrialization could change the structure of urban water consumption by transferring the water resource from agricultural uses to urban and industrial uses for higher economic benefit rogers et al 2002 but facing the comprehensive relations of local water supply and demand which is further complicated by the migration of the people from rural to urban areas the accelerated urban economic transition should guarantee food security and employment government plays an important role in coordinating the conflicts among water resources the environment and the economy because the strict groundwater pumping restriction often intervenes through government actions based on local feasibility especially in china where state ownership of land is constitutional the planning of agricultural and industrial land use can only be carried out by the local government reasonable land use planning will provide convenient conditions for subsequent economic development otherwise environmental pollution caused by improper planning would cause huge economic losses due to the costly environmental treatment second small and medium sized industrial enterprises are generally incapable of undertaking water resources surveys or building water conservancy facilities therefore the water conservancy department can only undertake the task of planning and construction also companies and farmers are often reluctant to bear the potential short term economic losses from relocation and water diversion requiring compensation from the government during coordination 6 conclusions a regional s o model was built to solve the groundwater management problems in a coastal city involving water resource scarcity seawater intrusion and demand for economic development the work highlights the importance of a holistic comprehend water policy by considering all the main attributes of groundwater which is complicated by the synthetic interest in social economic and eco hydrological aspects the simulation results of the 3 d numerical model uncovered the seawater intrusion in longkou city is well related to the amount and the spatial distribution of the groundwater pumping especially on the west coast the two objective s o modeling considering the maximization of groundwater abstraction and minimization of seawater intrusion found west coast should carry out groundwater pumping restriction to 50 of the current volume for mitigating seawater intrusion whereas the east coast is insensitive to the seawater intrusion due to the water conservancy facilities and could increase the groundwater pumping to 120 on the basis by dividing the groundwater usage and the corresponding wcc into 7 kinds of industrial usage and 2 kinds of agricultural usage with the spatial distribution difference the current groundwater dependent economic yield was evaluated to be about 2 296 billion cny yr the three objective s o model by adding the third objective function of maximizing economic yield could provide better schemes for different preferences like improving economic yield by 294 million cny or mitigating si on the west coast while maintaining the current economic yield the decision discrepancy caused by partial management would lead to misleading groundwater pumping schemes which could be harmful to the coastal industrial enterprises cause huge economic losses the results suggest the local structural reform of the water consumption regime with rational construction of water conservancy facilities could fundamentally solve the resource environment economy conflict the results emphasized that systematic analysis of transdisciplinary attributes of groundwater must be promoted while searching for a collaborative management strategy
