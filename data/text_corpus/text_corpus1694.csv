8470,study region latin america parana basin argentina brazil paraguay uruguay study focus this article traces the trajectory of transboundary cooperation over the past fifteen years for the guarani aquifer system a new insight for the region the guarani aquifer system is a transboundary aquifer shared by argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay it stands as one of the largest reservoirs of freshwater worldwide and is one of the few transboundary aquifers whose management is regulated by an international treaty the guarani aquifer agreement gaa the latter is also the first to refer in its preamble to the un international law commission draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers a first period 2002 2010 of positive collaboration in which the four countries actively moved forward towards a better understanding of the aquifer culminated with the adoption of the gaa in august 2010 a second period 2010 2017 has been marked by a slowdown in transboundary cooperation limited in this period to sporadic cross border projects and initiatives linked to past and existing international projects in this period argentina and uruguay and more recently brazil have ratified the gaa a third phase seems to be emerging in 2017 due to the possibility that finally paraguay ratifies the gaa allowing it to enter into force this article argues that in the future implementation of the agreement countries should build on the good practices both substantive and institutional stemming from the first period of transboundary cooperation keywords guarani aquifer system transboundary aquifer cooperation water resource governance guarani aquifer agreement water management 1 introduction the guarani aquifer system gas is a transboundary aquifer tba shared by four countries in latin america argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay it is considered as one of the largest reservoirs of freshwater in the world this article wishes to highlight how the four countries have moved forward and back in the management of the gas throughout the last fifteen years the paper identifies two main management periods in this pendulum the first one from 2002 to the adoption of the guarani aquifer agreement gaa in 2010 and the second one from that day in august 2010 to current days the first period can be framed as a period of increased management and transboundary cooperation the second one has been a period of stagnation and limited activity a third phase may have started in 2017 with a renewed interest for the transboundary cooperation dimension of the gas this paper argues that some good practices developed in the first period between 2002 and 2010 are still valid and merit particular attention in this possible new phase in particular the institutional structure that underpinned transboundary cooperation in the first phase could serve as a source of inspiration for the future transboundary management of the gas the paper is divided into four sections section 2 provides a brief account of the gas aimed at giving a general understanding of the main scientific and socio economic characteristics of the gas section 3 of this paper will discuss the developments from 2002 to 2010 in this section the article will present the path leading to the adoption of the gaa which includes the guarani project and a more in depth analysis of the gaa itself the paper will then move on to section 4 where the limited activities between 2010 and 2017 will be analysed in particular the article will discuss the countries different approach to the ratification of the gaa followed by an overview of domestic aquifer governance with direct or indirect transboundary implications the final section of the paper will discuss the potential opportunities for the transboundary management of the gas should the gaa enter into force 2 the guarani aquifer system the guarani aquifer system gas is one of the most important hydrostratigraphic units in the southern portion of south america the current resource exploitation exceeds 1 0 km3 a 93 6 in brazil of which about 80 is in são paulo state 2 8 in uruguay 2 3 in paraguay and 1 3 in argentina some 80 of the total is used for public water supply 15 for industrial processes and 5 by geothermal spas foster et al 2009 although this water extraction is essential it should be considered that it is still a small fraction of its full capacity the gas comprises a sequence of sandy layers of triassic jurassic age with average thicknesses of 250 m varying from 50 m to 600 m deposited in continental eolic fluvial and lagoon environments above a regional erosional surface dated to 250 m years and below an extensive layer of cretaceous basalts dated to 145 30 m years in the basins of paraná brazil and paraguay chaco paraná argentina and north uruguay the so called guarani aquifer is a set of different hydraulically connected geological units including the formations misiones argentina and paraguay botucatu pirambóia caturrita santa maria brazil and tacuarembó uruguay the current name was chosen to honour the guarani who are the original inhabitants of the region overlying the aquifer in regional terms from replenishment zones gas outcrop areas to the discharge zones gas groundwater flows tend to move from north to south accompanying the orientation of the paraná sedimentary basin in 80 of the area the gas is a confined aquifer with old to very old water from 4000 to 100 000 years groundwater in the city of são josé do rio preto the central region of the state of são paulo brazil and 150 km from the gas outcrop zone showed water of 120 000 years gastmans et al 2013 indicating a flow velocity of 0 5 0 7 m year this value is compatible with the aquifer circulation model where this flow is much more controlled by the low hydraulic gradients 0 1 0 3 m km than by the hydraulic conductivity which is quite high kh 5 10 m d foster et al 2009 according to rodríguez et al 2013 and wendland et al 2015 the active groundwater flow into the deep confined aquifer is very limited probably equivalent to 10 15 mm a of vertical infiltration in the recharge area 1 2 of the annual rainfall in contrast to 150 500 mm a 10 30 of the rainfall in the outcrop unconfined aquifer zone that is usually a common circumstance in groundwater systems of this kind although the gas is presented as a sole aquifer system apparently due to its size and long geological history of its formation it is possible to recognize even regionally several units with different aquifer capacities from the northern regions of the aquifer mainly in the states of são paulo and mato grosso do sul to the north of the state of paraná and even in areas of paraguay and uruguay gas has wells with high production above 300 m3 h in the southern states of brazil including paraná santa catarina and part of rio grande do sul and in argentina there is a substantial reduction of its potentiality in spite of the age of its waters the gas presents waters of excellent quality with low mineralization indicated by electric conductivity of 1000 μs cm except in regions such as argentina where salinity can be very high and in isolated areas in southern brazil the gas waters are potable and suitable for all uses sracek and hirata 2002 the salinity of this aquifer and its geochemical anomalies are associated with the formations below the gas mostly saline aquitards that contribute to the increase further to major ions of some trace elements particularly f and more strictly as psag 2009a the gas presents a high vulnerability to anthropogenic contamination only in its outcrop areas in areas where it is covered by fractured basalts up to 100 m thick or even in some basalt windows where the absence of the aquitard connects the gas directly with more superficial formations in the rest of the area the gas presents a very low or almost non existent vulnerability to contamination confirmed by the millenarian age of its waters in confined aquifer areas the only chance of contamination would be related to connections between the surface and the gas through abandoned or poorly designed wells which would serve as a bypass to persistent substances in high amounts water availability exploitable potential in a confined aquifer of such vast dimensions as the gas can be defined as the quantity of water available for use such availability can be calculated by active reserves as the quantity of water that can be abstracted from a static reserve or from a permanent storage during a given period without causing irreversible environmental damage except the exhaustion of the aquifer estimates of volumes of gas water range from 29 550 km3 4000 km3 to 32 830 km3 4400 km3 to calculate the volume of gas water that can effectively be exploited it is necessary to establish abstraction scenarios in line with the operating limits of pumping equipment and well construction techniques psag 2009b the revised conceptual hydrogeological model of the gas allowed defining five distinct resource management zones zone i to zone v foster et al 2009 based on the conceptual model which are described as follows fig 1 zone i unconfined recharge and discharge zone totally renewable resource associated to rainfalls that percolate into the aquifer in the outcrop areas in this zone the gas presents a high vulnerability to contamination and the operation of many anthropic activities may jeopardize the excellent natural quality with virtually no problem of geochemical anomaly of its waters the total water available for extraction can surpass 45 km3 year psag 2009a zone ii basalt covered recharge zone the gas is semi confined in this zone covered by fractured basalt 100 m of thickness the recharge is associated with some natural vertical flow through basalts or induced by pumping in addition to horizontal groundwater flow from the zone i in this zone the resource is partially renewable but due to the lack of knowledge of the vertical flows through these basalts the quantification of the total exploitable flow rate is still uncertain in addition it is known that in several parts of the state of são paulo the recharge of gas in this zone is very limited fernandes et al 2016 zone iii intermediate confined zone there is not significant recharge and the water residence time is typically higher than 10 000 years all the water extractions are considered non renewable mining condition and the total amount of available water from the storage is 2000 km3 that could be extracted just one time fig 2 zone iv deep confined zone in this zone the base of the aquitard that confined the gas is deeper than 400 m below surface and the exploitation is unlikely to be economic except for hydro geothermal application in a practical sense it is possible to pump water just from the storage and the total confined water available for extraction is limited to 50 100 km3 that could be extracted just one time zone v confined zone with saline groundwater restricted to argentina in this zone the gas is confined and groundwater has high salinity the water of this zone can be used only in spas and other hydro geothermal applications or for other purposes after treatment where this is economically feasible the gas is thus unquestionably a totally storage dominated groundwater system and this reality is reflected widely in its water exploitation management the expected problems in the border regions between countries are related to the aquifer contamination by anthropic activities especially those that have diffuse sources and covering wide areas such as extensive agriculture or areas of intense groundwater exploitation that can cause strong hydraulic interference between wells or restrict its long term use due to reduced recharge where the aquifer is confined 3 from a beacon of hope gas transboundary cooperation between 2002 and 2010 the second section of this article will discuss the developments from 2002 to 2010 in this section the paper will present the path leading to the adoption of the gaa which includes the guarani project and a more in depth analysis of the gaa itself 3 1 the process leading to the guarani aquifer agreement to argue that until the beginning of the guarani project there was no understanding of the gas would be inaccurate several studies had been undertaken from different universities which led for example to the knowledge that a huge aquifer was present under the four countries rebouças 1976 gilboa et al 1976 silva 1983 rocha 1997 montaño et al 1998 araujo et al 1999 rebouças 1999 tujchneider et al 2007 what is accurate is that a much more comprehensive understanding of the gas came thanks to the guarani project psag 2009a the latter was shaped by argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay between 2000 and 2003 and lasted six years from 2003 to 2009 it was implemented by the organisation of american states oas and supported by the global environmental facility gef the guarani project had three main components and concluded with the adoption of a strategic action programme sap it enhanced the hydrogeological understanding of the gas and it mapped the socio economic pressures on the gas together with an analysis of the relevance of the gas for dependent ecosystems the third component was legal and institutional and it assessed the readiness of the four countries in the field of groundwater management and transboundary aquifer cooperation psag 2009a an essential element of the guarani project was the decision to zoom in on four pilot areas which showcased particular pressures for the gas of relevance to this paper are two of these pilot studies in particular due to their transboundary nature the first one was developed around the cities of salto in uruguay and concordia in argentina an area where the gas is very deep and where groundwater stemming from the aquifer is used solely for thermal purposes the second one was the rivera uruguay santana do livramento brazil pilot study where the gas is much more vulnerable with recharge zones close to the urban area here groundwater from the aquifer is used for multiple purposes including human and agricultural needs the paper shows that the informal transboundary cooperation developed in the pilot studies also reverberated after the guarani project sindico 2016a the institutional structure that was developed and maintained throughout its duration was also another critical element for the guarani project santa cruz et al 2017 a secretariat was established in montevideo providing the necessary leadership national committees comprising technical expertise needed to advance the understanding of both the hydrogeological and the socio economics of the gas were established during the project a network of people in the region working on the gas grew and started working together building not only expertise but also very important relationships that slowly but steadily glued the four countries together the end result of the guarani project was as mentioned the adoption of a sap that included options for future transboundary cooperation aimed at the management of the gas the choices varied considerably with different financial implications some mentioned mercosur as the appropriate forum where to anchor the management of the gas others proposed a loose framework of not legally binding arrangements another one identified the la plata basin treaty framework as the appropriate institutional hub for the management of the gas but linked to an ad hoc treaty legally binding instrument on the gas this last option was precisely the outcome in 2010 of several years of inter governmental negotiations between the four gas countries sindico 2011 in 2004 talks took place within the mercosur framework and in 2005 a draft treaty was ready to be adopted but insurmountable differences on the dispute settlement provision did not allow the text to move forward from 2005 2010 the countries did not reinitiate talks although they were cooperating positively in the framework of the guarani project it was only in 2010 that negotiations were restarted this time after just a couple of meetings the four countries agreed on the text of a treaty that was finally adopted on 2 august 2010 in the argentinean city of san juan sindico 2011 3 2 the guarani aquifer agreement before sketching the content of the gaa it is important to highlight that one of the best practices stemming from the gaa is the legal instrument itself what this means is that the four countries sharing the gas decided to negotiate a treaty in the absence of serious conflict over the natural resource villar and ribeiro 2011 the gaa is preventative in nature and it has been hailed as a success story in that sense sindico 2011 the extent to which the content of the gaa should also be praised in the same favourable terms depends very much on what one expects from an international treaty if the expectation is one of explicit strong precise detailed enforceable provisions then the gaa will like many other international environmental treaties be a major disappointment if on the other hand what one was expecting was a framework promoting the management of the gas then the overall judgement over the gaa may well be more positive sindico 2017 the gaa sets out indeed a general management framework it contains the general rules of international law applicable to transboundary water resources surface and groundwater countries although sovereign have an obligation to cooperate and not to cause significant harm to neighbouring states gaa art 6 countries must use the aquifer in an equitably and reasonably gaa art 4 there is no single way to define what equitable and reasonable means it will always be a weighing and balancing exercise based on a number of factors while these are not listed in the gaa they can be found in the emerging international legal framework applicable to transboundary aquifers unwc 1997 art 6 and unilc 2008 art 5 other management practices are included in the treaty such as the obligation to exchange information and to monitor the aquifer gaa art 8 of particular importance is the obligation to notify other states if a planned activity may lead to cause significant harm gaa art 9 notification is then followed by an environmental impact assessment gaa art 10 1 a further provision that is worth highlighting is the reference to critical transboundary areas gaa art 14 which may warrant particular attention moving from the substantive and procedural part of the gaa to the institutional side article 15 clarifies that a commission will be established in the la plata basin treaty framework del castillo laborde 2011 to implement the objectives and goals of the gaa the 1969 la plata river treaty governs the water resources present in the la plata basin and includes argentina uruguay brazil paraguay and bolivia the four countries in the management of the gas will need to work primarily in the framework of an already existing regional legal structure the article will return to the importance of this commission when the possible third phase of the management of the gas the one following the entry into force of the gaa will be discussed the gaa not surprisingly does not have a provision about dispute settlement nor an annex on this however the treaty does indicate that the commission created under article 15 will be the first port of call when a conflict over the interpretation or application of the gaa takes place should peaceful negotiations not settle the dispute gaa art 16 however the commission will only be able to issue non legally binding recommendations leaving a more legalistic approach to an arbitration procedure that the countries will need to negotiate once the gaa enters into force gaa art 19 in conclusion whatever one thinks of the content of the gaa it was and still is one of the few international legal instruments to have been negotiated to manage specifically a tba this was a milestone in itself and was the culmination of a period of eight years from 2002 to 2010 in which the four countries cooperated amongst themselves when it came to the gas there were high hopes in 2010 for the transboundary management of the gas and commentators and observers hoped for a speedy entry into force of the gaa the second period of cross border cooperation of the gas 2010 2017 which the paper will now address showed that those hopes were maybe just a little bit too high 4 to a question mark gas transboundary cooperation between 2010 and 2017 the second period of gas transboundary management covered in this article was not as successful as the first one the years from 2010 to 2017 have been characterised by the lengthy and not completed process of ratification of the gaa and by sporadic and casuistic examples of transboundary cooperation this section of the paper comments on both these aspects 4 1 the ratification of the guarani aquifer agreement following the adoption i e signature of the gaa in 2010 there were hopes for a speedy entry into force of the agreement the latter required all four countries to ratify if one considers treaties like the paris agreement on climate change entering into force in less than one year and having more than one hundred parties the prospects of a deal with only four countries entering into force quickly should not have been considered a chimera the truth has been very different and seven years after its adoption the gaa is still not in effect argentina and uruguay have ratified the gaa in 2012 and brazil in 2017 paraguay after having decided against ratification in 2012 seems to be opening the debate once again over the possible ratification of the gaa argentina ratified the gaa on 31 october 2012 with law 26 780 the process leading to the ratification of the gaa reveals a constant challenge when talking about aquifers the difficulties in understanding the natural resource from the early days of the guarani project there had been the misconception that the gas was akin to an underground river where harmful practices in one part would be felt immediately or very quickly in other parts of the aquifer this is apparently not the case with groundwater within the gas flowing exceptionally slowly with insufficient connectivity between distant areas of the aquifer the real immediate challenges when it comes to pollution or overexploitation will usually be perceived within focused areas of the aquifer when it comes to the transboundary dimension of the aquifer these challenges will be felt mainly along the border this is not to say that the gas does not operate as a system and that management of the tba should not be considered holistically and cover all the aquifer but it is important to differentiate how a tba and a transboundary river operates this was an important issue in argentina and an element that helped in the ratification process was the delivery of technical evidence before the congress leading experts in the natural resource itself were invited to dispel any myths that could confuse members of parliament who were then asked to approve the law ratifying the gaa the extent to which such technical advice boosted the relatively quick ratification of the gaa in argentina may be a matter of speculation but it is fair to say that it helped assist the congress in taking an informed decision in uruguay the gaa was presented before the senate already in november 2011 the document submitted to uruguayan senators is interesting as it highlights a number of elements that explain some of the points present in the gaa itself several of which have been criticised quite heavily in the literature república oriental del uruguay law n 18913 the document takes the reader through the socio political and economic historical developments in the region highlighting that one of the ways that the debt of latin american countries could have been paid off was through the privatisation of its natural resources it stresses the vast amounts of freshwater in the gas and defines them as strategic for the first world sic countries it is within this context of the defense of its own natural resources vis à vis the interference of developed nations elsewhere in the world that the notion of sovereignty present in article 3 of the gaa should be framed the gaa passed without any problems the domestic legislative hurdles in uruguay and was approved with law no 18 913 on 12 june 2012 paving the way for the formal ratification of the latter brazil did not ratify the gaa until 2017 in fact it was only in late 2016 that the issue of the gaa resurfaced in brazilian politics some different international treaties that brazil had signed were bundled together including the gaa and discussed before in one of the two houses of the parliament on 14 february 2017 the national congress and on 2 may the senate finally approved the gaa with legislative decree 52 2017 one can point to many factors leading to the slow ratification in brazil the gaa important as it may be has not been a political priority for the country in the past years despite the very damaging droughts in the southern region including the city of são paulo whose maximum expression occurred in 2014 even from an environmental perspective it may well be that groundwater resources and the gas are not on the top list of priorities to these factors one can add the internal constitutional complexities very particular to brazil where the gas is shared between eight states groundwater is of exclusive competence of the states while surface water pertains to the federal and state governments making the management of aquifers not straightforward gesicki and sindico 2014 finally the fact that paraguay had not ratified could have been a further reason for the slow process in brazil paraguay deserves a special mention as it has the opportunity of triggering the entry into force of the gaa as it would be the last country to ratify the agreement when this happens paraguay will be hailed and remembered within transboundary water cooperation circles as has happened for other nations like vietnam whose ratification triggered the entry into force of the united nations watercourses convention or the russian federation that enabled the kyoto protocol to enter into force back in 2005 paraguay did have an opportunity to ratify the gaa back in 2012 but decided against it this decision may have been linked to internal political debates rather than genuine concern over the gaa itself the situation currently is hopefully different and a technical discussion on the gaa was scheduled in april 2017 along with the lines of what happened in argentina before the ratification of the agreement in that country the debate had to be rescheduled due to internal problems in the congress in asuncion the days before the scheduled date and was postponed for the second part of 2017 by today the gaa was approved by the paraguayan senate and waiting for the final agreement from the congress it is possible that a combination of technical clarification over the content of the gaa and a more favourable political climate could lead to the ratification of the gaa on behalf of the congress in paraguay in conclusion despite the promising signs from paraguay the gaa is not yet in force and the transboundary management of the gas resides outside the contours of the treaty 4 2 the guarani aquifer system without the agreement this sub section will discuss the few examples of gas transboundary management practices that can be found in the period between 2010 and 2017 these experiences can be traced back to informal cooperation between border cities and to domestic involvements mainly in uruguay that have indirect transboundary implications starting with the management of border cities these can be divided between those that form the legacy of the guarani project and border cities in the framework of projects linked to the la plata basin treaty as mentioned earlier in this paper one of the characteristics of the guarani project was the establishment of two pilot studies with a transboundary nature concordia salto between uruguay and argentina and rivera santana do livramento between uruguay and brazil the concordia salto example is particularly relevant and warrants special attention sindico 2016a during the guarani project a commission was established that comprised experts and political representatives from the two border cities the commission met regularly and exchanged information that was collected through joint monitoring activities when the guarani project came to an end in 2009 the commission of the pilot study continued despite lacking a formal legal backing in the form of an ad hoc agreement between the two countries except for what had been agreed in the framework of the now expired guarani project it is interesting to note that even without a formal written agreement in force between the two countries or even just the two municipalities the main activities for example joint monitoring continued throughout the years thanks to the leadership of the local members of the commission and to their creativity that enabled them to fund activities rivero godoy 2016 finally on 23 march 2017 an agreement between the cities of concordia and salto was signed and now gives legal backing to the commission república argentina 2017 this is an important and interesting transboundary legal arrangement rather than agreement as it is not negotiated between the two countries and hence it is difficult to see how it could be considered legally binding under international law however from a political perspective it is a very strong and persuasive document between the two municipalities sindico 2016a the concordia salto 2017 arrangement confirms many of the management practices and needs that have been developed in the guarani project enshrined in its sap and present also in the gaa article 1 encourages the two cities to boost further knowledge of the aquifer and exchange information article 4 deals with monitoring and provides legal backing to the already existing monitoring technical committee article 3 additional deals with the institutional structure creating the commission for the support of the management of groundwater resources this commission is based on the one that has worked uninterruptedly since the inception of the guarani project and will include local members derived from civil society both public and private the concordia salto experience is an example of how through local leadership transboundary cooperation can continue however the continuous efforts to negotiate an agreement between the two cities also shows the possible nervousness of local actors towards a voluntary arrangement that depended too heavily on the goodwill and the time of few people the concordia salto arrangement both in its informal and now more formal versions also raises internal constitutional issues and challenges both in argentina and in uruguay rivero godoy 2016 in fact it is not entirely clear whether cities have competences to strike deals with cities in other countries interestingly despite the doubts that may arise from the capital as to the legal effects of such agreements the reality is that the deal was still negotiated and now underpins the on going collaboration in the transboundary management of the portion of the gas present under concordia and salto on the argentinean and uruguayan border the guarani project has another transboundary pilot study within the cities of rivera in uruguay and santana do livramento in brazil contrary to the concordia salto experience the transboundary cooperation between these two cities did slow down after the expiry of the guarani project and in the aftermath of the adoption of the gaa however it did not grind to a complete halt the gas cross border cooperation can also be found around border cities linked to the framework project implemented under the framework of the la plata basin treaty cic cuenca del plata 2016 the towns of artigas in uruguay and quaraí in brazil fall within this category a pilot project was developed around water conflict in the cuareim quaraí river basin in the framework of the la plata basin treaty project cic cuenca del plata 2016 the latter focused mainly on surface water and highlighted the existence of the mixed brazilian uruguayan commission for the development of the cuareim quaraí river basin crc crq the project s report on the status of groundwater in the la plata basin mentions the work of the thematic group on groundwater in the cuareim quaraí river basin bervig and foleto 2014 cic cuenca del plata 2016 the joint work of brazilian and uruguayan experts has increased the knowledge on the transboundary groundwater resources through the development of joint hydrogeological maps and other activities a further aspect of the mixed brazilian uruguayan commission for the development of the crc crq is that it built on the previous experience of the guarani project this not only meant that the project could rely on already existing information but it also brought with it institutional expertise within the two countries this made it easier to implement the project from its inception in october 2012 the second set of experiences that have a gas transboundary management dimension have taken place at a domestic level this is the case for example of uruguay wherein 2013 the guarani aquifer commission was incorporated in the uruguay river water resources regional council with advisory body status through presidential decree n 183 2013 the goal of such incorporation was to implement a truly integrated and participative water resources management in the country that duly took into account social economic and environmental aspects the decree clarifies the role and the composition of the guarani aquifer commission but does not mention any input from neighbouring countries however in practice brazilian and argentinean representatives have been invited to sit as observers in meetings of the uruguayan guarani aquifer commission strengthening albeit informally transboundary aquifer cooperation 5 added value of the entry into force of the guarani aquifer agreement the future of gas transboundary cooperation the trajectory of the gas transboundary cooperation in the last fifteen years has been characterised by a swing of ups and downs however it could be at a turning point with recent developments pointing to the concrete possibility that the gaa could enter into force in the not so distant future with this in mind it is worth turning the attention to a discussion about how the transboundary cooperation of the gas would benefit from the gaa once it has entered into force hirata et al 2017 5 1 implementation of the gas transboundary management the two main reasons why the entry into force could prove beneficial for the transboundary management of the gas are the increased possibility of attracting finance and investment and the opportunity to develop an institutional structure capable of operationalising the gaa both are needed to propel the transboundary management of the gas into reality rather than it is only on paper if an international treaty is in force it will be easier to attract investment aimed at the management of in this case the gas this does not imply that the absence of a formal legal arrangement prevents funding as exemplified by the guarani project itself that took place precisely in the absence of any treaty on the aquifer however the entry into force of the gaa can focus funding towards the management of the gas in a way that was not possible before projects could be directed at the implementation of an ad hoc formal legal instrument and its objectives as happens for many of the activities related to the la plata basin treaty in southern america or the plan trifinio in central america 1997 not to mention the panoply of international projects linked to the sadc watercourses convention in southern africa world bank 2011 or to the mekong treaty in south east asia kinna and clarke 2017 however further funding alone will not be enough to deliver effective transboundary management in the gas the gaa needs to be accompanied by an institutional structure capable of planning promoting and implementing tba management in the region this process cannot be kick started until the gaa enters into force until then the commission mentioned in article 15 of the gaa remains a hypothetical entity it is only when the four countries will have ratified the gaa that the prospects of such a commission become real even then the latter does not just appear and it needs to be established from within the la plata basin treaty framework it is in fact one of the first but not the only items on the to do list once the gaa enters into force leaving aside for the moment the composition of the commission one of the possible activities that it could carry out could be an iterative process leading to a fruitful exchange of good practices a possible option is to devise a regular meeting once every two or three years in which the four countries share their experiences in the management of the gas to do so countries could be asked to compile their efforts in national submissions which would be submitted to the commission it is important to highlight that such submissions should be voluntary and their presentation at the regular meeting would not be subject to an assessment akin of a judgement the review of national submissions should be based on the following characteristics cooperative non intrusive and respectful of national sovereignty a regular exchange of national practices on the transboundary management of the gas of this nature i e cooperative rather than conflictive would align itself with general trends in international environmental governance sands and peel 2013 in fact international regimes governing global climate change biodiversity or sustainable development all point in that direction efforts to deal for example with the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change in the paris agreement van asselt et al 2016 or the implementation of the sustainable development goals sdgs persson et al 2016 all include a set of formal submissions to a central institution where the national efforts are reviewed but in a supportive and non intrusive manner transboundary water cooperation exception for the regime developed around the united nations economic commission for europe unece water convention tanzi et al 2015 is usually based on more general principled frameworks where only sporadically an institution serves as a clearinghouse for good practice but it is not unheard of the gaa and its future institutional structure could present itself as an innovative example of transboundary cooperation if it is able to develop an institutional structure capable of driving forward gas cooperation through also the exchange of good practices from which countries have the capacity and opportunity to learn from each other but will the commission established under article 15 of the gaa within the la plata river basin treaty framework be able to deliver such an ambitious goal this discussion is obviously speculative but considering the other functions it will have to perform according to articles 16 and following of the gaa it will not be an easy task in fact let s not forget that the commission is also due to deal with initial conflicts over the interpretation and application of the agreement complying hence with a quasi judicial function despite the fact that its recommendations over possible disagreements will not be legally binding this will be a complex and potentially hopefully not time consuming role considering the potential other functions that the commission will be asked to perform and the fact that the transboundary management of the gas is not solely about promoting the exchange of good practices the question that needs to be asked is what kind of structure would allow the commission to deliver all of its tasks here looking back at past transboundary management and institutional practices of the gas can prove helpful sometimes the wheel does not need to be reinvented it has already been argued that one of the good methods stemming from the guarani project was the institutional structure that had been developed and maintained throughout its duration santa cruz et al 2017 the extent to which a system based on a secretariat providing the necessary leadership and national technical committees can be replicated is unclear what is clear however is that if the commission will be the institutional hub for the transboundary management of the gas it will need to be supported in order to efficiently coordinate well monitoring development of planned activities with potential transboundary impacts and joint planning of critical transboundary areas amongst other elements present in the gaa one option that needs further research and consideration and that can just be presented in this paper is to develop a permanent program comprised by technical experts that would work under the commission developed ex article 15 of the gaa to aid in the operationalisation of the transboundary management of the gas the precise composition and structure of a possible programme would need to be developed by the four countries sharing the gas but it would be wise to look back at the first period of transboundary cooperation analysed in this paper the beacon of hope period and look for already existing good practices if potentially increased streams of funding and an operationalised institutional structure are two potentially concrete benefits stemming from the entry into force of the gaa there are other external benefits that also deserve proper consideration 5 2 global leadership the entry into force of the gaa will put the four countries in a position of global leadership when it comes to transboundary water cooperation hence enhancing their worldwide reputation however this is not only about reputation it is also about enabling such countries to meet better other international environmental obligations such as the ones the nations have under the paris agreement or within the sustainable development goals sdgs there are currently 592 tbas and groundwater bodies worldwide unesco igrac 2015 with only six of them featuring an ad hoc international agreement or arrangement aimed at its management movilla pateiro 2016 the gaa is a member of this exclusive club and the first to provide for in its preamble a reference to the un general assembly resolution 63 128 on the law of transboundary aquifers which includes in its annex the work stemming from the un international law commission unilc on the same topic the draft articles on the law of cross border aquifers developed by the unilc represent the emerging global legal norms obligations and rights in the field of transboundary aquifers eckstein and sindico 2014 eckstein and sindico 2014 when the gaa enters into force the four countries will be at the forefront of transboundary water cooperation considering the content of the gaa principles substantive and procedural provisions and the seeds of an institutional structure and its preventative nature let s not forget that the gaa was negotiated in the absence of conflict or of particular water stress in any of the four countries the entry into force of the gaa should be hailed as a historical moment for transboundary cooperation more generally not just in the context of water cooperation the four countries will be in a position to lead an example of collaboration in an ever growing field of international relations international waters also for its significance for sustainable development and climate change however in these two cases the entry into force of the gaa is not just a question of reputation but of aiding the four countries in meeting international obligations they have subscribed to starting with sustainable development and the sdgs there is an apparent link between tba cooperation and sdg 6 access to clean water and sanitation but also with many other sdgs for which groundwater and transboundary collaboration over groundwater resources is essential sindico 2016b the entry into force of the gaa has the potential to lead to better transboundary management of the gas through increased funding exchange of good management practises and more generally a drive towards better cross border cooperation thanks to an effective institutional structure if the promises stemming from the entry into force of the gaa are kept the four countries sharing the gas will find it easier to meet sdg 6 and other sdgs that relate directly or indirectly with good groundwater governance especially with its transboundary dimension there is a further more direct and specific reason why the entry into force of the gaa will benefit the gas countries in their sdg policies sdg 6 5 requires states by 2030 to implement integrated water resources management at all levels including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate the agreed indicator for sdg 6 5 2 reads as follows proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation the gaa falls clearly under the category of arrangement which includes both legally binding and non legally binding instruments it also seems from the latest developments on indicator 6 5 2 that the gaa would most likely fall under the category of operational arrangement sindico 2016b mainly if it were to include regular meetings of the four countries within the operation of its intuitional structure as suggested earlier in this paper when it comes to climate change groundwater becomes particularly important in fact the more climate change threatens surface water through droughts and salinization the more it becomes necessary to better understand and better manage groundwater resources margat and van der gun 2013 the latter in fact can become an adequate buffer against the climate change impacts on surface water the good governance of groundwater resources becomes hence a strategy to adapt to climate change and promote resilience in many countries against this background groundwater has a role to play also in the measures that all states need to adopt to implement and comply with the paris agreement in fact the nationally determined contribution ndc that all states are obliged to prepare and submit according to the paris agreement needs to include also a section on adaptation with the entry into force of the gaa and the potential leverage of tba cooperation between the four countries climate change adaptation will be strengthened groundwater related efforts linked to climate change adaptation could be included by the four nations in their ndcs establishing the formal link between the entry into force of the gaa and the paris agreement in conclusion the entry into force of the gaa has the potential of reaping multiple benefits some are linked directly to the future management of the gas others are reputational putting the four countries at the forefront of international environmental governance in the field of international waters and finally other benefits relate to the positive interplay between the entry into force of the gaa and the implementation of the sdgs and the paris agreement 6 conclusions this article has tracked the last fifteen years of transboundary cooperation over the gas it has highlighted a turbulent story with two clear periods and a third one potentially emerging in this previous year in the first period 2002 2010 the four countries moved forward the cooperation agenda and thanks in particular but not only to the guarani project and its sap a real momentum was also built this first period culminated with the signature of the gaa in august 2010 the second period goes from 2010 to 2017 and it has been characterized by a regression of the gas transboundary cooperation three of the four countries have ratified the gaa and despite some informal efforts to continue cross border cooperation usually in border areas the momentum that had been developed in the first period has not been sustained 2017 may well be the year in which a third and crucial period begins for the gas transboundary cooperation with the recent ratification of the agreement by brazil all attention is focused on paraguay and the date in which the gaa enters into force may be closer the article does not only take the reader through a historical journey of the last fifteen years of the gas transboundary cooperation it also highlights the advantages in boosting the latter through the gaa the merits of pushing for a speedy entry into force of the agreement can be summarised as follows firstly the scientific understanding of the gas as a whole has been stalled and would benefit from a continuous monitoring and data sharing system which could be enhanced through increased funding that could stem from an enforce gaa secondly the entry into force of the gaa could promote regular exchange of practices in the management of the aquifer via the la plata basin commission acting as a clearinghouse the past experience guarani project and others is in a position to provide useful good practices that can feed into the implementation of the gaa especially from an institutional perspective thirdly potentially the agreement could put the gas again on the agenda and promote cooperation in cities that were not reached by the guarani project such as pedro juan caballero and ponta porã for example overall considering the past and current practices in the transboundary management of the gas the entry into force and the implementation of the gaa promises to lead to more efficient cross border cooperation conflict of interest none 
8470,study region latin america parana basin argentina brazil paraguay uruguay study focus this article traces the trajectory of transboundary cooperation over the past fifteen years for the guarani aquifer system a new insight for the region the guarani aquifer system is a transboundary aquifer shared by argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay it stands as one of the largest reservoirs of freshwater worldwide and is one of the few transboundary aquifers whose management is regulated by an international treaty the guarani aquifer agreement gaa the latter is also the first to refer in its preamble to the un international law commission draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers a first period 2002 2010 of positive collaboration in which the four countries actively moved forward towards a better understanding of the aquifer culminated with the adoption of the gaa in august 2010 a second period 2010 2017 has been marked by a slowdown in transboundary cooperation limited in this period to sporadic cross border projects and initiatives linked to past and existing international projects in this period argentina and uruguay and more recently brazil have ratified the gaa a third phase seems to be emerging in 2017 due to the possibility that finally paraguay ratifies the gaa allowing it to enter into force this article argues that in the future implementation of the agreement countries should build on the good practices both substantive and institutional stemming from the first period of transboundary cooperation keywords guarani aquifer system transboundary aquifer cooperation water resource governance guarani aquifer agreement water management 1 introduction the guarani aquifer system gas is a transboundary aquifer tba shared by four countries in latin america argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay it is considered as one of the largest reservoirs of freshwater in the world this article wishes to highlight how the four countries have moved forward and back in the management of the gas throughout the last fifteen years the paper identifies two main management periods in this pendulum the first one from 2002 to the adoption of the guarani aquifer agreement gaa in 2010 and the second one from that day in august 2010 to current days the first period can be framed as a period of increased management and transboundary cooperation the second one has been a period of stagnation and limited activity a third phase may have started in 2017 with a renewed interest for the transboundary cooperation dimension of the gas this paper argues that some good practices developed in the first period between 2002 and 2010 are still valid and merit particular attention in this possible new phase in particular the institutional structure that underpinned transboundary cooperation in the first phase could serve as a source of inspiration for the future transboundary management of the gas the paper is divided into four sections section 2 provides a brief account of the gas aimed at giving a general understanding of the main scientific and socio economic characteristics of the gas section 3 of this paper will discuss the developments from 2002 to 2010 in this section the article will present the path leading to the adoption of the gaa which includes the guarani project and a more in depth analysis of the gaa itself the paper will then move on to section 4 where the limited activities between 2010 and 2017 will be analysed in particular the article will discuss the countries different approach to the ratification of the gaa followed by an overview of domestic aquifer governance with direct or indirect transboundary implications the final section of the paper will discuss the potential opportunities for the transboundary management of the gas should the gaa enter into force 2 the guarani aquifer system the guarani aquifer system gas is one of the most important hydrostratigraphic units in the southern portion of south america the current resource exploitation exceeds 1 0 km3 a 93 6 in brazil of which about 80 is in são paulo state 2 8 in uruguay 2 3 in paraguay and 1 3 in argentina some 80 of the total is used for public water supply 15 for industrial processes and 5 by geothermal spas foster et al 2009 although this water extraction is essential it should be considered that it is still a small fraction of its full capacity the gas comprises a sequence of sandy layers of triassic jurassic age with average thicknesses of 250 m varying from 50 m to 600 m deposited in continental eolic fluvial and lagoon environments above a regional erosional surface dated to 250 m years and below an extensive layer of cretaceous basalts dated to 145 30 m years in the basins of paraná brazil and paraguay chaco paraná argentina and north uruguay the so called guarani aquifer is a set of different hydraulically connected geological units including the formations misiones argentina and paraguay botucatu pirambóia caturrita santa maria brazil and tacuarembó uruguay the current name was chosen to honour the guarani who are the original inhabitants of the region overlying the aquifer in regional terms from replenishment zones gas outcrop areas to the discharge zones gas groundwater flows tend to move from north to south accompanying the orientation of the paraná sedimentary basin in 80 of the area the gas is a confined aquifer with old to very old water from 4000 to 100 000 years groundwater in the city of são josé do rio preto the central region of the state of são paulo brazil and 150 km from the gas outcrop zone showed water of 120 000 years gastmans et al 2013 indicating a flow velocity of 0 5 0 7 m year this value is compatible with the aquifer circulation model where this flow is much more controlled by the low hydraulic gradients 0 1 0 3 m km than by the hydraulic conductivity which is quite high kh 5 10 m d foster et al 2009 according to rodríguez et al 2013 and wendland et al 2015 the active groundwater flow into the deep confined aquifer is very limited probably equivalent to 10 15 mm a of vertical infiltration in the recharge area 1 2 of the annual rainfall in contrast to 150 500 mm a 10 30 of the rainfall in the outcrop unconfined aquifer zone that is usually a common circumstance in groundwater systems of this kind although the gas is presented as a sole aquifer system apparently due to its size and long geological history of its formation it is possible to recognize even regionally several units with different aquifer capacities from the northern regions of the aquifer mainly in the states of são paulo and mato grosso do sul to the north of the state of paraná and even in areas of paraguay and uruguay gas has wells with high production above 300 m3 h in the southern states of brazil including paraná santa catarina and part of rio grande do sul and in argentina there is a substantial reduction of its potentiality in spite of the age of its waters the gas presents waters of excellent quality with low mineralization indicated by electric conductivity of 1000 μs cm except in regions such as argentina where salinity can be very high and in isolated areas in southern brazil the gas waters are potable and suitable for all uses sracek and hirata 2002 the salinity of this aquifer and its geochemical anomalies are associated with the formations below the gas mostly saline aquitards that contribute to the increase further to major ions of some trace elements particularly f and more strictly as psag 2009a the gas presents a high vulnerability to anthropogenic contamination only in its outcrop areas in areas where it is covered by fractured basalts up to 100 m thick or even in some basalt windows where the absence of the aquitard connects the gas directly with more superficial formations in the rest of the area the gas presents a very low or almost non existent vulnerability to contamination confirmed by the millenarian age of its waters in confined aquifer areas the only chance of contamination would be related to connections between the surface and the gas through abandoned or poorly designed wells which would serve as a bypass to persistent substances in high amounts water availability exploitable potential in a confined aquifer of such vast dimensions as the gas can be defined as the quantity of water available for use such availability can be calculated by active reserves as the quantity of water that can be abstracted from a static reserve or from a permanent storage during a given period without causing irreversible environmental damage except the exhaustion of the aquifer estimates of volumes of gas water range from 29 550 km3 4000 km3 to 32 830 km3 4400 km3 to calculate the volume of gas water that can effectively be exploited it is necessary to establish abstraction scenarios in line with the operating limits of pumping equipment and well construction techniques psag 2009b the revised conceptual hydrogeological model of the gas allowed defining five distinct resource management zones zone i to zone v foster et al 2009 based on the conceptual model which are described as follows fig 1 zone i unconfined recharge and discharge zone totally renewable resource associated to rainfalls that percolate into the aquifer in the outcrop areas in this zone the gas presents a high vulnerability to contamination and the operation of many anthropic activities may jeopardize the excellent natural quality with virtually no problem of geochemical anomaly of its waters the total water available for extraction can surpass 45 km3 year psag 2009a zone ii basalt covered recharge zone the gas is semi confined in this zone covered by fractured basalt 100 m of thickness the recharge is associated with some natural vertical flow through basalts or induced by pumping in addition to horizontal groundwater flow from the zone i in this zone the resource is partially renewable but due to the lack of knowledge of the vertical flows through these basalts the quantification of the total exploitable flow rate is still uncertain in addition it is known that in several parts of the state of são paulo the recharge of gas in this zone is very limited fernandes et al 2016 zone iii intermediate confined zone there is not significant recharge and the water residence time is typically higher than 10 000 years all the water extractions are considered non renewable mining condition and the total amount of available water from the storage is 2000 km3 that could be extracted just one time fig 2 zone iv deep confined zone in this zone the base of the aquitard that confined the gas is deeper than 400 m below surface and the exploitation is unlikely to be economic except for hydro geothermal application in a practical sense it is possible to pump water just from the storage and the total confined water available for extraction is limited to 50 100 km3 that could be extracted just one time zone v confined zone with saline groundwater restricted to argentina in this zone the gas is confined and groundwater has high salinity the water of this zone can be used only in spas and other hydro geothermal applications or for other purposes after treatment where this is economically feasible the gas is thus unquestionably a totally storage dominated groundwater system and this reality is reflected widely in its water exploitation management the expected problems in the border regions between countries are related to the aquifer contamination by anthropic activities especially those that have diffuse sources and covering wide areas such as extensive agriculture or areas of intense groundwater exploitation that can cause strong hydraulic interference between wells or restrict its long term use due to reduced recharge where the aquifer is confined 3 from a beacon of hope gas transboundary cooperation between 2002 and 2010 the second section of this article will discuss the developments from 2002 to 2010 in this section the paper will present the path leading to the adoption of the gaa which includes the guarani project and a more in depth analysis of the gaa itself 3 1 the process leading to the guarani aquifer agreement to argue that until the beginning of the guarani project there was no understanding of the gas would be inaccurate several studies had been undertaken from different universities which led for example to the knowledge that a huge aquifer was present under the four countries rebouças 1976 gilboa et al 1976 silva 1983 rocha 1997 montaño et al 1998 araujo et al 1999 rebouças 1999 tujchneider et al 2007 what is accurate is that a much more comprehensive understanding of the gas came thanks to the guarani project psag 2009a the latter was shaped by argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay between 2000 and 2003 and lasted six years from 2003 to 2009 it was implemented by the organisation of american states oas and supported by the global environmental facility gef the guarani project had three main components and concluded with the adoption of a strategic action programme sap it enhanced the hydrogeological understanding of the gas and it mapped the socio economic pressures on the gas together with an analysis of the relevance of the gas for dependent ecosystems the third component was legal and institutional and it assessed the readiness of the four countries in the field of groundwater management and transboundary aquifer cooperation psag 2009a an essential element of the guarani project was the decision to zoom in on four pilot areas which showcased particular pressures for the gas of relevance to this paper are two of these pilot studies in particular due to their transboundary nature the first one was developed around the cities of salto in uruguay and concordia in argentina an area where the gas is very deep and where groundwater stemming from the aquifer is used solely for thermal purposes the second one was the rivera uruguay santana do livramento brazil pilot study where the gas is much more vulnerable with recharge zones close to the urban area here groundwater from the aquifer is used for multiple purposes including human and agricultural needs the paper shows that the informal transboundary cooperation developed in the pilot studies also reverberated after the guarani project sindico 2016a the institutional structure that was developed and maintained throughout its duration was also another critical element for the guarani project santa cruz et al 2017 a secretariat was established in montevideo providing the necessary leadership national committees comprising technical expertise needed to advance the understanding of both the hydrogeological and the socio economics of the gas were established during the project a network of people in the region working on the gas grew and started working together building not only expertise but also very important relationships that slowly but steadily glued the four countries together the end result of the guarani project was as mentioned the adoption of a sap that included options for future transboundary cooperation aimed at the management of the gas the choices varied considerably with different financial implications some mentioned mercosur as the appropriate forum where to anchor the management of the gas others proposed a loose framework of not legally binding arrangements another one identified the la plata basin treaty framework as the appropriate institutional hub for the management of the gas but linked to an ad hoc treaty legally binding instrument on the gas this last option was precisely the outcome in 2010 of several years of inter governmental negotiations between the four gas countries sindico 2011 in 2004 talks took place within the mercosur framework and in 2005 a draft treaty was ready to be adopted but insurmountable differences on the dispute settlement provision did not allow the text to move forward from 2005 2010 the countries did not reinitiate talks although they were cooperating positively in the framework of the guarani project it was only in 2010 that negotiations were restarted this time after just a couple of meetings the four countries agreed on the text of a treaty that was finally adopted on 2 august 2010 in the argentinean city of san juan sindico 2011 3 2 the guarani aquifer agreement before sketching the content of the gaa it is important to highlight that one of the best practices stemming from the gaa is the legal instrument itself what this means is that the four countries sharing the gas decided to negotiate a treaty in the absence of serious conflict over the natural resource villar and ribeiro 2011 the gaa is preventative in nature and it has been hailed as a success story in that sense sindico 2011 the extent to which the content of the gaa should also be praised in the same favourable terms depends very much on what one expects from an international treaty if the expectation is one of explicit strong precise detailed enforceable provisions then the gaa will like many other international environmental treaties be a major disappointment if on the other hand what one was expecting was a framework promoting the management of the gas then the overall judgement over the gaa may well be more positive sindico 2017 the gaa sets out indeed a general management framework it contains the general rules of international law applicable to transboundary water resources surface and groundwater countries although sovereign have an obligation to cooperate and not to cause significant harm to neighbouring states gaa art 6 countries must use the aquifer in an equitably and reasonably gaa art 4 there is no single way to define what equitable and reasonable means it will always be a weighing and balancing exercise based on a number of factors while these are not listed in the gaa they can be found in the emerging international legal framework applicable to transboundary aquifers unwc 1997 art 6 and unilc 2008 art 5 other management practices are included in the treaty such as the obligation to exchange information and to monitor the aquifer gaa art 8 of particular importance is the obligation to notify other states if a planned activity may lead to cause significant harm gaa art 9 notification is then followed by an environmental impact assessment gaa art 10 1 a further provision that is worth highlighting is the reference to critical transboundary areas gaa art 14 which may warrant particular attention moving from the substantive and procedural part of the gaa to the institutional side article 15 clarifies that a commission will be established in the la plata basin treaty framework del castillo laborde 2011 to implement the objectives and goals of the gaa the 1969 la plata river treaty governs the water resources present in the la plata basin and includes argentina uruguay brazil paraguay and bolivia the four countries in the management of the gas will need to work primarily in the framework of an already existing regional legal structure the article will return to the importance of this commission when the possible third phase of the management of the gas the one following the entry into force of the gaa will be discussed the gaa not surprisingly does not have a provision about dispute settlement nor an annex on this however the treaty does indicate that the commission created under article 15 will be the first port of call when a conflict over the interpretation or application of the gaa takes place should peaceful negotiations not settle the dispute gaa art 16 however the commission will only be able to issue non legally binding recommendations leaving a more legalistic approach to an arbitration procedure that the countries will need to negotiate once the gaa enters into force gaa art 19 in conclusion whatever one thinks of the content of the gaa it was and still is one of the few international legal instruments to have been negotiated to manage specifically a tba this was a milestone in itself and was the culmination of a period of eight years from 2002 to 2010 in which the four countries cooperated amongst themselves when it came to the gas there were high hopes in 2010 for the transboundary management of the gas and commentators and observers hoped for a speedy entry into force of the gaa the second period of cross border cooperation of the gas 2010 2017 which the paper will now address showed that those hopes were maybe just a little bit too high 4 to a question mark gas transboundary cooperation between 2010 and 2017 the second period of gas transboundary management covered in this article was not as successful as the first one the years from 2010 to 2017 have been characterised by the lengthy and not completed process of ratification of the gaa and by sporadic and casuistic examples of transboundary cooperation this section of the paper comments on both these aspects 4 1 the ratification of the guarani aquifer agreement following the adoption i e signature of the gaa in 2010 there were hopes for a speedy entry into force of the agreement the latter required all four countries to ratify if one considers treaties like the paris agreement on climate change entering into force in less than one year and having more than one hundred parties the prospects of a deal with only four countries entering into force quickly should not have been considered a chimera the truth has been very different and seven years after its adoption the gaa is still not in effect argentina and uruguay have ratified the gaa in 2012 and brazil in 2017 paraguay after having decided against ratification in 2012 seems to be opening the debate once again over the possible ratification of the gaa argentina ratified the gaa on 31 october 2012 with law 26 780 the process leading to the ratification of the gaa reveals a constant challenge when talking about aquifers the difficulties in understanding the natural resource from the early days of the guarani project there had been the misconception that the gas was akin to an underground river where harmful practices in one part would be felt immediately or very quickly in other parts of the aquifer this is apparently not the case with groundwater within the gas flowing exceptionally slowly with insufficient connectivity between distant areas of the aquifer the real immediate challenges when it comes to pollution or overexploitation will usually be perceived within focused areas of the aquifer when it comes to the transboundary dimension of the aquifer these challenges will be felt mainly along the border this is not to say that the gas does not operate as a system and that management of the tba should not be considered holistically and cover all the aquifer but it is important to differentiate how a tba and a transboundary river operates this was an important issue in argentina and an element that helped in the ratification process was the delivery of technical evidence before the congress leading experts in the natural resource itself were invited to dispel any myths that could confuse members of parliament who were then asked to approve the law ratifying the gaa the extent to which such technical advice boosted the relatively quick ratification of the gaa in argentina may be a matter of speculation but it is fair to say that it helped assist the congress in taking an informed decision in uruguay the gaa was presented before the senate already in november 2011 the document submitted to uruguayan senators is interesting as it highlights a number of elements that explain some of the points present in the gaa itself several of which have been criticised quite heavily in the literature república oriental del uruguay law n 18913 the document takes the reader through the socio political and economic historical developments in the region highlighting that one of the ways that the debt of latin american countries could have been paid off was through the privatisation of its natural resources it stresses the vast amounts of freshwater in the gas and defines them as strategic for the first world sic countries it is within this context of the defense of its own natural resources vis à vis the interference of developed nations elsewhere in the world that the notion of sovereignty present in article 3 of the gaa should be framed the gaa passed without any problems the domestic legislative hurdles in uruguay and was approved with law no 18 913 on 12 june 2012 paving the way for the formal ratification of the latter brazil did not ratify the gaa until 2017 in fact it was only in late 2016 that the issue of the gaa resurfaced in brazilian politics some different international treaties that brazil had signed were bundled together including the gaa and discussed before in one of the two houses of the parliament on 14 february 2017 the national congress and on 2 may the senate finally approved the gaa with legislative decree 52 2017 one can point to many factors leading to the slow ratification in brazil the gaa important as it may be has not been a political priority for the country in the past years despite the very damaging droughts in the southern region including the city of são paulo whose maximum expression occurred in 2014 even from an environmental perspective it may well be that groundwater resources and the gas are not on the top list of priorities to these factors one can add the internal constitutional complexities very particular to brazil where the gas is shared between eight states groundwater is of exclusive competence of the states while surface water pertains to the federal and state governments making the management of aquifers not straightforward gesicki and sindico 2014 finally the fact that paraguay had not ratified could have been a further reason for the slow process in brazil paraguay deserves a special mention as it has the opportunity of triggering the entry into force of the gaa as it would be the last country to ratify the agreement when this happens paraguay will be hailed and remembered within transboundary water cooperation circles as has happened for other nations like vietnam whose ratification triggered the entry into force of the united nations watercourses convention or the russian federation that enabled the kyoto protocol to enter into force back in 2005 paraguay did have an opportunity to ratify the gaa back in 2012 but decided against it this decision may have been linked to internal political debates rather than genuine concern over the gaa itself the situation currently is hopefully different and a technical discussion on the gaa was scheduled in april 2017 along with the lines of what happened in argentina before the ratification of the agreement in that country the debate had to be rescheduled due to internal problems in the congress in asuncion the days before the scheduled date and was postponed for the second part of 2017 by today the gaa was approved by the paraguayan senate and waiting for the final agreement from the congress it is possible that a combination of technical clarification over the content of the gaa and a more favourable political climate could lead to the ratification of the gaa on behalf of the congress in paraguay in conclusion despite the promising signs from paraguay the gaa is not yet in force and the transboundary management of the gas resides outside the contours of the treaty 4 2 the guarani aquifer system without the agreement this sub section will discuss the few examples of gas transboundary management practices that can be found in the period between 2010 and 2017 these experiences can be traced back to informal cooperation between border cities and to domestic involvements mainly in uruguay that have indirect transboundary implications starting with the management of border cities these can be divided between those that form the legacy of the guarani project and border cities in the framework of projects linked to the la plata basin treaty as mentioned earlier in this paper one of the characteristics of the guarani project was the establishment of two pilot studies with a transboundary nature concordia salto between uruguay and argentina and rivera santana do livramento between uruguay and brazil the concordia salto example is particularly relevant and warrants special attention sindico 2016a during the guarani project a commission was established that comprised experts and political representatives from the two border cities the commission met regularly and exchanged information that was collected through joint monitoring activities when the guarani project came to an end in 2009 the commission of the pilot study continued despite lacking a formal legal backing in the form of an ad hoc agreement between the two countries except for what had been agreed in the framework of the now expired guarani project it is interesting to note that even without a formal written agreement in force between the two countries or even just the two municipalities the main activities for example joint monitoring continued throughout the years thanks to the leadership of the local members of the commission and to their creativity that enabled them to fund activities rivero godoy 2016 finally on 23 march 2017 an agreement between the cities of concordia and salto was signed and now gives legal backing to the commission república argentina 2017 this is an important and interesting transboundary legal arrangement rather than agreement as it is not negotiated between the two countries and hence it is difficult to see how it could be considered legally binding under international law however from a political perspective it is a very strong and persuasive document between the two municipalities sindico 2016a the concordia salto 2017 arrangement confirms many of the management practices and needs that have been developed in the guarani project enshrined in its sap and present also in the gaa article 1 encourages the two cities to boost further knowledge of the aquifer and exchange information article 4 deals with monitoring and provides legal backing to the already existing monitoring technical committee article 3 additional deals with the institutional structure creating the commission for the support of the management of groundwater resources this commission is based on the one that has worked uninterruptedly since the inception of the guarani project and will include local members derived from civil society both public and private the concordia salto experience is an example of how through local leadership transboundary cooperation can continue however the continuous efforts to negotiate an agreement between the two cities also shows the possible nervousness of local actors towards a voluntary arrangement that depended too heavily on the goodwill and the time of few people the concordia salto arrangement both in its informal and now more formal versions also raises internal constitutional issues and challenges both in argentina and in uruguay rivero godoy 2016 in fact it is not entirely clear whether cities have competences to strike deals with cities in other countries interestingly despite the doubts that may arise from the capital as to the legal effects of such agreements the reality is that the deal was still negotiated and now underpins the on going collaboration in the transboundary management of the portion of the gas present under concordia and salto on the argentinean and uruguayan border the guarani project has another transboundary pilot study within the cities of rivera in uruguay and santana do livramento in brazil contrary to the concordia salto experience the transboundary cooperation between these two cities did slow down after the expiry of the guarani project and in the aftermath of the adoption of the gaa however it did not grind to a complete halt the gas cross border cooperation can also be found around border cities linked to the framework project implemented under the framework of the la plata basin treaty cic cuenca del plata 2016 the towns of artigas in uruguay and quaraí in brazil fall within this category a pilot project was developed around water conflict in the cuareim quaraí river basin in the framework of the la plata basin treaty project cic cuenca del plata 2016 the latter focused mainly on surface water and highlighted the existence of the mixed brazilian uruguayan commission for the development of the cuareim quaraí river basin crc crq the project s report on the status of groundwater in the la plata basin mentions the work of the thematic group on groundwater in the cuareim quaraí river basin bervig and foleto 2014 cic cuenca del plata 2016 the joint work of brazilian and uruguayan experts has increased the knowledge on the transboundary groundwater resources through the development of joint hydrogeological maps and other activities a further aspect of the mixed brazilian uruguayan commission for the development of the crc crq is that it built on the previous experience of the guarani project this not only meant that the project could rely on already existing information but it also brought with it institutional expertise within the two countries this made it easier to implement the project from its inception in october 2012 the second set of experiences that have a gas transboundary management dimension have taken place at a domestic level this is the case for example of uruguay wherein 2013 the guarani aquifer commission was incorporated in the uruguay river water resources regional council with advisory body status through presidential decree n 183 2013 the goal of such incorporation was to implement a truly integrated and participative water resources management in the country that duly took into account social economic and environmental aspects the decree clarifies the role and the composition of the guarani aquifer commission but does not mention any input from neighbouring countries however in practice brazilian and argentinean representatives have been invited to sit as observers in meetings of the uruguayan guarani aquifer commission strengthening albeit informally transboundary aquifer cooperation 5 added value of the entry into force of the guarani aquifer agreement the future of gas transboundary cooperation the trajectory of the gas transboundary cooperation in the last fifteen years has been characterised by a swing of ups and downs however it could be at a turning point with recent developments pointing to the concrete possibility that the gaa could enter into force in the not so distant future with this in mind it is worth turning the attention to a discussion about how the transboundary cooperation of the gas would benefit from the gaa once it has entered into force hirata et al 2017 5 1 implementation of the gas transboundary management the two main reasons why the entry into force could prove beneficial for the transboundary management of the gas are the increased possibility of attracting finance and investment and the opportunity to develop an institutional structure capable of operationalising the gaa both are needed to propel the transboundary management of the gas into reality rather than it is only on paper if an international treaty is in force it will be easier to attract investment aimed at the management of in this case the gas this does not imply that the absence of a formal legal arrangement prevents funding as exemplified by the guarani project itself that took place precisely in the absence of any treaty on the aquifer however the entry into force of the gaa can focus funding towards the management of the gas in a way that was not possible before projects could be directed at the implementation of an ad hoc formal legal instrument and its objectives as happens for many of the activities related to the la plata basin treaty in southern america or the plan trifinio in central america 1997 not to mention the panoply of international projects linked to the sadc watercourses convention in southern africa world bank 2011 or to the mekong treaty in south east asia kinna and clarke 2017 however further funding alone will not be enough to deliver effective transboundary management in the gas the gaa needs to be accompanied by an institutional structure capable of planning promoting and implementing tba management in the region this process cannot be kick started until the gaa enters into force until then the commission mentioned in article 15 of the gaa remains a hypothetical entity it is only when the four countries will have ratified the gaa that the prospects of such a commission become real even then the latter does not just appear and it needs to be established from within the la plata basin treaty framework it is in fact one of the first but not the only items on the to do list once the gaa enters into force leaving aside for the moment the composition of the commission one of the possible activities that it could carry out could be an iterative process leading to a fruitful exchange of good practices a possible option is to devise a regular meeting once every two or three years in which the four countries share their experiences in the management of the gas to do so countries could be asked to compile their efforts in national submissions which would be submitted to the commission it is important to highlight that such submissions should be voluntary and their presentation at the regular meeting would not be subject to an assessment akin of a judgement the review of national submissions should be based on the following characteristics cooperative non intrusive and respectful of national sovereignty a regular exchange of national practices on the transboundary management of the gas of this nature i e cooperative rather than conflictive would align itself with general trends in international environmental governance sands and peel 2013 in fact international regimes governing global climate change biodiversity or sustainable development all point in that direction efforts to deal for example with the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change in the paris agreement van asselt et al 2016 or the implementation of the sustainable development goals sdgs persson et al 2016 all include a set of formal submissions to a central institution where the national efforts are reviewed but in a supportive and non intrusive manner transboundary water cooperation exception for the regime developed around the united nations economic commission for europe unece water convention tanzi et al 2015 is usually based on more general principled frameworks where only sporadically an institution serves as a clearinghouse for good practice but it is not unheard of the gaa and its future institutional structure could present itself as an innovative example of transboundary cooperation if it is able to develop an institutional structure capable of driving forward gas cooperation through also the exchange of good practices from which countries have the capacity and opportunity to learn from each other but will the commission established under article 15 of the gaa within the la plata river basin treaty framework be able to deliver such an ambitious goal this discussion is obviously speculative but considering the other functions it will have to perform according to articles 16 and following of the gaa it will not be an easy task in fact let s not forget that the commission is also due to deal with initial conflicts over the interpretation and application of the agreement complying hence with a quasi judicial function despite the fact that its recommendations over possible disagreements will not be legally binding this will be a complex and potentially hopefully not time consuming role considering the potential other functions that the commission will be asked to perform and the fact that the transboundary management of the gas is not solely about promoting the exchange of good practices the question that needs to be asked is what kind of structure would allow the commission to deliver all of its tasks here looking back at past transboundary management and institutional practices of the gas can prove helpful sometimes the wheel does not need to be reinvented it has already been argued that one of the good methods stemming from the guarani project was the institutional structure that had been developed and maintained throughout its duration santa cruz et al 2017 the extent to which a system based on a secretariat providing the necessary leadership and national technical committees can be replicated is unclear what is clear however is that if the commission will be the institutional hub for the transboundary management of the gas it will need to be supported in order to efficiently coordinate well monitoring development of planned activities with potential transboundary impacts and joint planning of critical transboundary areas amongst other elements present in the gaa one option that needs further research and consideration and that can just be presented in this paper is to develop a permanent program comprised by technical experts that would work under the commission developed ex article 15 of the gaa to aid in the operationalisation of the transboundary management of the gas the precise composition and structure of a possible programme would need to be developed by the four countries sharing the gas but it would be wise to look back at the first period of transboundary cooperation analysed in this paper the beacon of hope period and look for already existing good practices if potentially increased streams of funding and an operationalised institutional structure are two potentially concrete benefits stemming from the entry into force of the gaa there are other external benefits that also deserve proper consideration 5 2 global leadership the entry into force of the gaa will put the four countries in a position of global leadership when it comes to transboundary water cooperation hence enhancing their worldwide reputation however this is not only about reputation it is also about enabling such countries to meet better other international environmental obligations such as the ones the nations have under the paris agreement or within the sustainable development goals sdgs there are currently 592 tbas and groundwater bodies worldwide unesco igrac 2015 with only six of them featuring an ad hoc international agreement or arrangement aimed at its management movilla pateiro 2016 the gaa is a member of this exclusive club and the first to provide for in its preamble a reference to the un general assembly resolution 63 128 on the law of transboundary aquifers which includes in its annex the work stemming from the un international law commission unilc on the same topic the draft articles on the law of cross border aquifers developed by the unilc represent the emerging global legal norms obligations and rights in the field of transboundary aquifers eckstein and sindico 2014 eckstein and sindico 2014 when the gaa enters into force the four countries will be at the forefront of transboundary water cooperation considering the content of the gaa principles substantive and procedural provisions and the seeds of an institutional structure and its preventative nature let s not forget that the gaa was negotiated in the absence of conflict or of particular water stress in any of the four countries the entry into force of the gaa should be hailed as a historical moment for transboundary cooperation more generally not just in the context of water cooperation the four countries will be in a position to lead an example of collaboration in an ever growing field of international relations international waters also for its significance for sustainable development and climate change however in these two cases the entry into force of the gaa is not just a question of reputation but of aiding the four countries in meeting international obligations they have subscribed to starting with sustainable development and the sdgs there is an apparent link between tba cooperation and sdg 6 access to clean water and sanitation but also with many other sdgs for which groundwater and transboundary collaboration over groundwater resources is essential sindico 2016b the entry into force of the gaa has the potential to lead to better transboundary management of the gas through increased funding exchange of good management practises and more generally a drive towards better cross border cooperation thanks to an effective institutional structure if the promises stemming from the entry into force of the gaa are kept the four countries sharing the gas will find it easier to meet sdg 6 and other sdgs that relate directly or indirectly with good groundwater governance especially with its transboundary dimension there is a further more direct and specific reason why the entry into force of the gaa will benefit the gas countries in their sdg policies sdg 6 5 requires states by 2030 to implement integrated water resources management at all levels including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate the agreed indicator for sdg 6 5 2 reads as follows proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation the gaa falls clearly under the category of arrangement which includes both legally binding and non legally binding instruments it also seems from the latest developments on indicator 6 5 2 that the gaa would most likely fall under the category of operational arrangement sindico 2016b mainly if it were to include regular meetings of the four countries within the operation of its intuitional structure as suggested earlier in this paper when it comes to climate change groundwater becomes particularly important in fact the more climate change threatens surface water through droughts and salinization the more it becomes necessary to better understand and better manage groundwater resources margat and van der gun 2013 the latter in fact can become an adequate buffer against the climate change impacts on surface water the good governance of groundwater resources becomes hence a strategy to adapt to climate change and promote resilience in many countries against this background groundwater has a role to play also in the measures that all states need to adopt to implement and comply with the paris agreement in fact the nationally determined contribution ndc that all states are obliged to prepare and submit according to the paris agreement needs to include also a section on adaptation with the entry into force of the gaa and the potential leverage of tba cooperation between the four countries climate change adaptation will be strengthened groundwater related efforts linked to climate change adaptation could be included by the four nations in their ndcs establishing the formal link between the entry into force of the gaa and the paris agreement in conclusion the entry into force of the gaa has the potential of reaping multiple benefits some are linked directly to the future management of the gas others are reputational putting the four countries at the forefront of international environmental governance in the field of international waters and finally other benefits relate to the positive interplay between the entry into force of the gaa and the implementation of the sdgs and the paris agreement 6 conclusions this article has tracked the last fifteen years of transboundary cooperation over the gas it has highlighted a turbulent story with two clear periods and a third one potentially emerging in this previous year in the first period 2002 2010 the four countries moved forward the cooperation agenda and thanks in particular but not only to the guarani project and its sap a real momentum was also built this first period culminated with the signature of the gaa in august 2010 the second period goes from 2010 to 2017 and it has been characterized by a regression of the gas transboundary cooperation three of the four countries have ratified the gaa and despite some informal efforts to continue cross border cooperation usually in border areas the momentum that had been developed in the first period has not been sustained 2017 may well be the year in which a third and crucial period begins for the gas transboundary cooperation with the recent ratification of the agreement by brazil all attention is focused on paraguay and the date in which the gaa enters into force may be closer the article does not only take the reader through a historical journey of the last fifteen years of the gas transboundary cooperation it also highlights the advantages in boosting the latter through the gaa the merits of pushing for a speedy entry into force of the agreement can be summarised as follows firstly the scientific understanding of the gas as a whole has been stalled and would benefit from a continuous monitoring and data sharing system which could be enhanced through increased funding that could stem from an enforce gaa secondly the entry into force of the gaa could promote regular exchange of practices in the management of the aquifer via the la plata basin commission acting as a clearinghouse the past experience guarani project and others is in a position to provide useful good practices that can feed into the implementation of the gaa especially from an institutional perspective thirdly potentially the agreement could put the gas again on the agenda and promote cooperation in cities that were not reached by the guarani project such as pedro juan caballero and ponta porã for example overall considering the past and current practices in the transboundary management of the gas the entry into force and the implementation of the gaa promises to lead to more efficient cross border cooperation conflict of interest none 
8471,study region this study region encompasses the transboundary san pedro and santa cruz aquifers which are shared between the states of sonora mexico and arizona us special regional considerations include a semi arid climate basin fill aquifers with predominantly montane recharge areas economic drivers in the mining trade and military sectors groundwater dependent cities with expanding cones of depression interbasin groundwater transfers ground and surface water contamination and protected aquatic and riparian habitats that act as significant migration corridors for hundreds of species including some that are threatened and endangered study focus we focus on lessons learned from the hydrologic assessment of the transboundary san pedro and santa cruz aquifers we conducted the work in two phases 1 laying the groundwork and 2 implementation the laying the groundwork phase consisted of binational meetings with stakeholders and key actors agencies and individuals and the development of an understanding of the physical institutional historical and socio political context this led to signing of the binational transboundary aquifer assessment program taap agreement in 2009 and detailed the process for cooperation and coordination in the assessment of shared aquifers the implementation phase began with an agreement to proceed with the study of four focus aquifers santa cruz san pedro mesilla conejos médanos in mexico and hueco bolson bolsón del hueco in mexico and development of associated technical teams though we do include a brief discussion of the lessons learned from the physical science portion of the study the results have been described and published elsewhere the bulk of the paper instead focuses on the findings and lessons learned from the integration of social science perspectives into a largely physical science based program since there is a growing recognition of the need for this type of approach especially in the management and assessment of transboundary aquifers new hydrological insights for the region the sonora arizona effort succeeded because both countries were adequately represented and because of flexibility of skills and ability of teams comprising both university and government scientists teams included social and earth scientists including the social sciences was critical to research design and implementation and to addressing the cultural institutional and socio political contexts of transboundary aquifer assessment significant components of the continuing implementation phase include strategic planning data compilation and analysis cross border integration of datasets geophysical and geochemical surveys and internal peer and stakeholder engagement keywords transboundary aquifers us mexico groundwater socio hydrology hydrogeology 1 introduction transboundary aquifers represent a source of water of growing importance globally for reasons of increasing water use scarcity and contamination scarcity caused by growth in population agriculture industry climate change and drought the resulting need requires the development of agreements to share and manage transboundary waters water governance of which sharing and management are components can present a number of challenges foster et al 2010 varady et al 2016 there is also recognition that without basic hydrologic information aquifer management and water resource planning would be difficult water quality can be impaired as a result of scarcity resulting in impacts to human health and economic activities through declines in agricultural production loss of ecosystem services and the costs of water treatment and remediation those factors may be exacerbated by climate change and drought cycles both of which are likely to affect the southwest united states garfin et al 2013 as concentrations of salts and contaminants rise in water supplies assessing a transboundary aquifer involves more than simply the study of the physical aspects of the aquifer and its environment where waters straddle a political boundary the complexity of assessment and management increases by assessment we mean the development of information through both data collection and analysis which is conducted in an impartial and reproducible way factors such as politics policy differing legal frameworks resources political economic and or military institutional capacity interstate relations and history and cultural and linguistic differences all come into play blomquist and ingram 2003 norman and bakker 2005 therefore the usual approaches employed by hydrologists to understand cooperator client needs develop workplans and carry out studies are insufficient and the required skill sets exceed the abilities and training of most hydrologists currently a range of multidisciplinary approaches encompassing the fields of law and the physical and social sciences are being applied to the study of transboundary aquifers successful approaches to initiate cooperation over transboundary waters include respecting the autonomies of participating countries creating networks of scientists from participating countries consulting diverse groups of stakeholders and allowing for each participating country to have ownership of specific cooperative activities petersen perlman and wolf 2015 thereby mitigating the perceived risk countries face by entering into cooperative frameworks subramanian et al 2012 such approaches include aquifer assessments and classification schemes designed to support developing systems of international law governance and management alley 2013 callegary et al 2016 eckstein and eckstein 2005 eden et al 2016 petrossian et al 2017 sanchez et al 2016 shamir et al 2015 they also include studies of cooperation conflict scenarios embodying a nuanced recognition that cooperation and cooperation commonly exist side by side conti 2014 delli priscoli 1994 wolf 2008 zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 groundwater shared between the us and mexico is no exception to these complexities and challenges and the two countries share a number of hydrological basins crossed by the international boundary in the early 2000s us agencies and institutions including the water resources research institutes wrris of texas new mexico and arizona cooperated in a series of binational discussions and meetings in response to the urgent need to study shared groundwater along the mexico us border as a result the us congress authorized public law 109 448 the united states mexico transboundary aquifer assessment act taa act in december 22 2006 alley 2013 authorizing funding of 50 million usd over a ten year period the taa act created the ground rules for the us team with regard to which institutions would be involved and consulted and with regard to us overall goals 1 develop and implement an integrated scientific approach to identify and assess priority transboundary aquifers 2 consider the expansion or modification of existing agreements as appropriate between the united states geological survey the participating states the water resources research institutes and appropriate authorities in the united states and mexico the act signaled the us s interest in binational studies and authorized us involvement consultation with and a request for involvement from mexico were the next steps thus began the process described in this paper of negotiation engagement and mutual learning that resulted in a formal agreement between the two countries in 2009 to allow the study of transboundary aquifers ibwc 2009 four transboundary aquifers were chosen for initial study the san pedro and santa cruz shared between sonora mexico and arizona us mesilla shared among chihuahua mexico new mexico us and texas us and the hueco bolson chihuahua and texas we focus on the transboundary san pedro aquifer and the transboundary santa cruz aquifer system tspa and tscas respectively where continual binational work has taken place from 2007 to the present the studies described here are limited to subwatersheds of larger geologic basins straddling the mexico us border the objectives of this paper are to describe the multidisciplinary approach involving a combination of social and physical sciences and university and government institutions and scientists that was used for the study of the tspa and tscas we describe the process of laying the groundwork specifically negotiation engagement and mutual learning leading to agreement between the two countries we document the results of combined application of physical and social sciences to assess priority transboundary aquifers finally we summarize our successes and failures and propose opportunities for improvement 1 1 background 1 1 1 what do international law and policy have to do with hydrology the hydrologic assessment of transboundary aquifers is just one piece within the larger arena of international law policy and management development of international legal and policy frameworks for the study of transboundary aquifers began long before the current study providing a rich history that informed our approach international discussions between the us and mexico began in the 1990s and continuing to the present these discussions formalized or published in policy briefs reports and journal articles attempted to recognize describe and formulate policy and legal frameworks in terms of the economic value of groundwater agarwal et al 2000 and more recently to situate groundwater within the water food energy climate ecosystem nexus bazilian et al 2011 berardy and chester 2017 de strasser et al 2016 dodds and bartram 2016 ringler et al 2013 as an example the 9th international symposium on managed aquifer recharge ismar9 held in june 2016 in mexico city focused on increasing groundwater s visibility and promoting sustainable groundwater management the symposium resulted in six policy directives ismar9 2016 the first directive called for recognizing aquifers and groundwater as critically important finite valuable and vulnerable resources next the symposium called for halting the chronic depletion of aquifers across the globe the third directive called for information on groundwater to be shared widely citing the uniqueness of all aquifer systems and the need for these systems to be well understood further directives called for sustainable management and protection of groundwater using integrated water resources management principles agarwal et al 2000 and advocated increased managed aquifer recharge finally the sixth directive addressed the need for collaboration strong stakeholder participation and community engagement in effective groundwater management the principles outlined in the ismar9 directives reflect the 2008 united nations draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers draft articles the draft articles are arguably the most significant effort to date for developing any international regulatory system for transboundary aquifer systems eckstein 2011 the 19 draft articles are modeled on the 1997 united nations convention on the law of the non navigational uses of transboundary watercourses un convention and include rules for equitable utilization obligation to cause no significant harm and promotion of international and technical cooperation eckstein 2011 the ratification of the draft articles will be included once again in the provisional agenda of the seventy fourth session of the un general assembly in 2019 unga 2016 the draft articles encourage nations to enter into bilateral or regional agreements but to date only a handful of such formal agreements over transboundary aquifers have been formalized the transboundary waters task force of un water crafted seven pillars that are considered necessary for reliable long lasting and sustainable transboundary water cooperation unga 2010 the text of the first pillar recommends a sound legal framework un water called for agreements to be concrete and to aim for cooperative institutional agreements with enforcement mechanisms on the protection of water resources and related ecosystems the second pillar proposes appropriate institutional structures with strong capacities at national international and regional scales third transboundary water development and management should feature long term and contingency planning to make vulnerable systems more resilient the fourth pillar calls for data exchange joint monitoring and assessment of shared waters the fifth pillar recommends public participation with the aims of enhancing transparency creating ownership and working toward agreement on policies and management decisions sixth the panel calls for countries sharing river basins to share benefits from the rivers fairly and justly compensate those who suffer losses the seventh and final pillar states that in order to accomplish everything listed above appropriate financing is necessary unga 2010 taken together the directives draft articles and pillars mentioned in the preceding paragraphs apply directly to projects such as ours by affirming the importance of groundwater the need for better information and the need for collaboration to obtain it they also raise the visibility of groundwater internationally and provide a set of guidelines for countries seeking to develop and prioritize objectives and behaviors related to transboundary groundwater issues 1 2 site descriptions although the san pedro river riparian corridor has received considerable international attention the tspa along with the tscas only began to receive attention late in the last decade the 2009 update to the international groundwater resources assessment center s transboundary aquifers or the world map featured both aquifers igrac 2009 unesco s internationally shared aquifer resource management isarm program listed the aquifers as part of the inventory listed in the isarm of the americas inventory 1 2 1 transboundary san pedro aquifer the tspa is of critical interest because of the high ecological value of the riparian ecosystem sustained by the san pedro river cec 1999 gungle et al 2016 and the need for groundwater to sustain the river existing communities and continuing development the tspa and its watershed make up one of the most studied hydrologic systems in the region because of their economic historical and environmental characteristics richter et al 2014 previous studies include topics ranging from geophysics and hydrology to biology and ecosystem services anning and leenhouts 2010 bagstad et al 2013 2005 callegary et al 2007 gungle et al 2016 lite and stromberg 2005 moran et al 2008 pool and dickinson 2007 stewart et al 2012 the economic drivers differ on each side of the border with military and tourism in arizona and mining in sonora as the lead industries the copper deposit at cananea is responsible for about 40 of copper production in mexico jiménez 2014 with over 350 species of birds and over 80 species of mammals the riparian forest and flanking areas along the san pedro river have been recognized as a critical north american biodiversity hotspot and critical migratory corridor cec 1999 and several projects have been initiated to maintain baseflow in the river using managed aquifer recharge richter et al 2014 fig 1 1 2 2 transboundary santa cruz aaquifer system in the tscas the major economic drivers include commerce at the international border and a significant manufacturing sector on the mexican side of the border about 100 manufacturing plants employing over 34 000 people were registered in nogales sonora in 2014 pavlakovich kochi 2014 and the plants can have negative environmental impacts if their discharges do not meet water quality standards the tscas is the main source of water for the twin cities of nogales sonora and nogales arizona which have a combined population of about 250 000 conagua 2015c erwin 2007 inegi 2017 scott et al 2012 uscb 2017 in addition to obtaining groundwater from the santa cruz aquifer nogales sonora also uses groundwater from the nogales and los alisos aquifers and nogales arizona maintains a wellfield to the west of the city conagua 2015b nelson 2007 scott et al 2012 municipal water providers struggle to meet the demands due strongly seasonally variable groundwater levels in wells near the santa cruz river prichard and scott 2014 the nogales international wastewater treatment plant situated in arizona treats effluent from both cities with about 80 originating in nogales sonora ibwc 2017 the effluent is discharged into the santa cruz river where it helps to sustain riparian habitat and stabilize groundwater levels for up to 15 km downstream of the facility acknowledging the unique set of conditions present in the portion of the tscas near the us mexico border the arizona department of water resources adwr created the santa cruz active management area ama in 1994 adwr 2010 amas are areas in which adwr regulates the use of groundwater in accordance with the 1980 arizona groundwater code adwr 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 laying the groundwork by laying the groundwork we mean those factors or actions required at the outset of the project in order to move forward with the physically based study of the aquifers some of these factors were anticipated and others were added along the way as the need became evident some were learned in hindsight in typical groundwater assessments it is unusual to consider some factors investigated for this study these include institutional economic historical and socio political factors but these affect who is involved what language s and methods of communications are used ease of travel and availability of funding they can also inform somewhat unexpectedly preliminary conceptual models and task development with respect to subjects such as land use land cover water budgets water quality and units of measurement methods and results used to assess governance and legal and institutional frameworks are documented in megdal and scott 2011 megdal et al 2010 and scott et al 2010 milman and scott 2010 determined the key aspects that influence water management in transboundary settings understanding these factors is critical to understanding the mechanisms for supporting the work on a prospective as well as retrospective basis as changing policy and management environments and funding cycles have direct bearing on the workflow development of a binational agreement though not initially foreseen as a requirement for the binational work was one of the principle activities of the first several years of the project the taa legislation in the us did not involve an agreement with mexico but institutional frameworks required binational consultation on water issues to occur through the international boundary and water commission ibwc the ibwc la comisión internacional de límites y aguas or cila in mexico is one organization with two sections a mexican and a u s section it is a branch of the state department in the u s and of the secretaría de relaciones exteriores in mexico following ibwc protocols in order for progress to be made on studies a binational agreement was needed the ibwc and the mexican national water commission comisión nacional del agua or conagua were key players in the development of the agreement that established the binational taap in the us representatives of the university based water resources research institutes wrris were key negotiators the wrris are federally authorized with a long standing working relationship with and funding from the us geological survey usgs identification of team members was constrained by law custom and regulation in each country in part it involved the selection and inclusion of agencies and individuals deemed necessary given the resources and personnel available to carry out the functions of the project the team member selection process evolved between 2007 and about 2009 to conform more closely with legal and regulatory requirements in both countries the approach of the us part of the team was constrained by the language of the taa act and its requirement of the maximum extent practicable for cooperation and the development of relationships with organizations in mexico the taa act required the participation of the usgs and the wrris in mexico selection of member agencies was made with regard to federal requirements for consultation and work with particular agencies namely conagua and ibwc these agencies then contracted as needed with other institutions such as the university of sonora and the mexican geological service communication and stakeholder engagement were key to the success of the project a flexible approach amenable to the changing demands of the project prevented detailed long term planning at the outset however approaches to different levels of communication internal communication peer to peer and with stakeholders were worked out over time various tools and techniques were used including development of bilingual web products fact sheets binational workshops and field trips like technical studies engagement efforts require resources which were intermittent a broad set of stakeholders was involved in early assessment scoping efforts a successful workshop organized by the university of arizona s water resources research center wrrc the primary institution on the team with social science expertise the workshop involved a long list of stakeholders from both countries and both aquifers and was held in late 2009 after a long period approximately 2011 2016 of focusing on the physical science portion of the transboundary studies new efforts by the wrrc to disseminate and explore the findings and engage a broader set of stakeholders are underway the development of an approach to planning and decision making was not a linear process it began simply eventually evolving into agreements and workplans contractual agreements were used to formalize expectations whether tasks arose from a funding agreement or from an accord formalizing a working relationship between two entities with representation on the binational team formal agreements were used to clarify the roles of institutions committees working groups and personnel and to guide future work 2 2 developing physical context climate hydrology land cover vegetation soils and geology the development of an understanding of the physical context required information on climate land cover hydrology vegetation soils and geology a literature review was conducted for each aquifer vandervoet et al 2013 one of the main goals was to develop a binational database with the goal as specified by the joint report of the principal engineers regarding the joint cooperative process united state mexico for the transboundary aquifer assessment program hereafter referred to as the joint report that metadata be developed and that the database be housed and served by the ibwc for the tspa data and existing literature on the aforementioned topics were summarized in callegary et al 2016 for the tscas a binational report using the same approach has been drafted and is in review field work included geophysical geochemical and hydrological studies callegary et al 2016 2013 minjárez sosa et al 2011a stewart et al 2012 modeling included chemical transport modeling mcandrew 2011 and assessment of aquifer vulnerability to contamination lincicome 2011 when priorities and funding allowed field work and modeling were conducted in both the us and mexico using standard approaches the results and analysis were published as abstracts graduate theses journal articles and reports alley 2013 stewart 2014 callegary et al 2017 megdal 2017 minjárez et al 2017 callegary et al 2018 geologic field work is ongoing and includes geologic mapping and geophysical and hydrochemical surveys hydrochemical surveys were carried out by the universidad de sonora minjárez sosa et al 2011a b hydrochemical data for the us were taken from the adwr and usgs databases and water quality reports and the obtained information allowed us to identify groundwater families in the binational context 3 results and discussion 3 1 laying the groundwork understanding the context when approaching the study of transboundary aquifers is critical to project success context includes the economic historical and socio political setting in which the study is to occur it also includes legal and institutional frameworks lack of knowledge can hinder progress or even shut down a project 3 1 1 economic historical and socio political setting in mexico primary authority for management of water resources emanates from the federal government to the states and municipalities in the united states primary authority rests with the states except in cases of interstate surface waters binational waters are not currently jointly managed by the two countries except in cases where treaties have been negotiated such as for the rio grande and colorado rivers the 1944 water treaty serves as the main reference for binational water management in the us and mexico michel 2003 it establishes the distribution of water on the colorado and tijuana rivers and the rio grande however it does not address groundwater management milanes murcia 2017 the only attempt to include groundwater management in the border region is minute 242 which limits the groundwater extractions from the yuma aquifer located within the states of arizona and sonora sanchez and eckstein 2017 mumme 2000 minutes are not amendments to the treaty but are decisions made by the ibwc and are used to carry out the provisions of the 1944 treaty guidelines and agreements providing jurisdiction or establishing a process for binational consultation include the la paz agreement of 1983 and the integral environmental plan for the us mexico border of 1992 an awareness of this shared history as well as current events and political realities was critical when approaching the binational work 3 1 2 legal framework institutional setting political resource management and decision making authority tend to be more centralized in mexico than in the us megdal et al 2010 megdal and scott 2011 in mexico much of the authority to regulate water lies with conagua and in the case of binational water some of that authority lies with the ibwc in the us depending on the issue water management jurisdiction varies it may require the participation of multiple institutions such as state water and environment departments and in the case of interstate waters and contamination other agencies may need to be involved such as the epa with respect to water research any of the aforementioned institutions may be involved but also universities and the usgs the resulting institutional asymmetries required each group to learn and adjust to the functions and procedures of the partner institutions such as communication protocols rules and customs questions that needed to be answered included how is communication initiated what is the chain of communication what permission is needed and in what situations is informal communication acceptable decisions were also required on procedures for approval of proposals and decisions review of draft manuscripts and data exchange ibwc protocols provided a starting point for communication and distinguishing between formal and informal exchanges fig 2 3 1 3 development of a binational agreement owing to its expertise in managing treaty obligations and mexican policies regarding transboundary waters negotiations through the ibwc were central to formalizing cooperation and establishing the nature of the cooperation the discussions meetings joint presentations at a conferences and legislation ultimately led to the 2009 signing of the joint report the joint report established the framework for us mexico coordination and dialogue to implement transboundary aquifer studies megdal 2017 the document clarifies program details such as background roles responsibilities funding relevance of the international water treaties and the use of information collected or compiled as part of the program four priority aquifers santa cruz san pedro mesilla and hueco bolson were agreed upon by the parties involved which included the ibwc the conagua the usgs unison and the wrris at new mexico state university texas a m and the university of arizona approval was later given to add the nogales aquifer classified as a separate aquifer in mexico in recognition of the fact that it is hydraulically connected via both surface and groundwater to the santa cruz aquifer in the us by agreement the transboundary aquifer assessment program taap has focused on assessment and not management indeed a clause of the joint report reads the information generated from these projects is solely for the purpose of expanding knowledge of the aquifers and should not be used by one country to require that the other country modify its water management and use nevertheless the taap furthers two important components of the un 2008 draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers the first is article 7 2 the general obligation to cooperate which calls for establishment of joint mechanisms of cooperation the second is article 8 2 on the regular exchange of data and information where knowledge about the nature and extent of a transboundary aquifer or aquifer system is inadequate aquifer states shall take such action individually or jointly and where appropriate together with or through international organizations table 1 3 1 4 available resources technical and financial financial resources were provided by each country us funding was divided equally as required by the taa act among the wrris and the usgs water science centers in texas new mexico and arizona with respect to the san pedro santa cruz and nogales aquifers the wrrc the wrri based at the university of arizona and ibwc contributed additional funding in mexico funds were provided by conagua to the mexican section of the ibwc and thence to the unison at times funding in availability in one country would lag behind funding in the other resulting in differences in the amount and type of work occurring in each country no restrictions were imposed on funding coming from additional sources this and the fact that the taap is a partnership of universities and government in two countries all with different sources and timing of funding added flexibility that allowed at least a minimal level of work even in years with low or no funding technical resources were available through a variety of institutions in mexico conagua often obtains technical expertise under contract with universities 3 1 5 identification of team members one of the initial challenges was determining which parties should come to the table and which were required by government laws and regulations team composition evolved substantially over a period of several years in part because the us team worked initially under the assumption that there would be no constraints as to which agencies and institutions they could work with in mexico a variety of institutions in the us had considerable experience working with mexican partner institutions in the us the usgs and the wrris located in the three states designated in the taa act are core team members and have determined which other partners were invited to consult or participate in arizona the arizona department of water resources the upper san pedro partnership and the city of nogales were consulted the binational ibwc has played a key role in the binational team because of its centrality in the study and management of binational water as well as the fact that it is part of the state department of both countries in addition mexico s policy requires that all border water issues be handled through ibwc also in mexico conagua has played the role of chief policy and funding coordinator for water studies while unison was contracted because of its technical expertise scientific assessment of the aquifers was carried out by a team under the guidance of a binational technical group and a working group as stipulated by the joint report the binational technical group s role was to oversee the development of work plans and goals the working group was responsible for carrying out individual tasks and documenting progress via reports journal articles and factsheets given that some critical taap personnel are political appointees and therefore subject to election cycles there has been remarkable stability of team membership this has allowed for the building of mutual trust and the flexibility required for working within each country s institutional environment wilder et al 2010 geophysical surveys aquifer tests and water quality sampling were carried out by faculty and students from unison through contract with ibwc in the us field activities were carried out by the scientists from the usgs and faculty and students from the university of arizona 3 1 6 planning and decision making generally binational priorities were developed jointly however each country in accordance with the joint report can carry out work within its own borders without needing to consult the other thus some taap related studies were not binational though they were designed to contribute to the overall objectives of the taap binational forums addressing the arizona sonora aquifers in 2009 and the four focus aquifers in 2016 resulted in the development of strategic plans outlining priorities and tasks over multi year periods annual tactical plans instituted in 2016 outline the implementation of the strategic plans year by year taking account of current realities relating to funding resources personnel any new challenges and progress to date tactical workplans were used to outline and agree upon short term goals tasks budgets and timelines usually expected to last one to three years strategic workplans were used to outline long term vision and estimated budgets for the project as well as sequences of tasks on different fronts such as the development of fully coupled binational groundwater surface water models 3 1 7 communication and stakeholder engagement until a formal agreement between the two countries was signed no binational work could proceed the long development phase for this project 3 years prior to the signing of the joint report runs counter to typical project timelines for hydrologic studies this period however was needed for essential activities such as team and trust building bagshaw et al 2007 as well as the time required drafting and negotiating the joint report and for the approval process in each country meetings and field trips were essential to the creation of the joint report and to building the binational arizona sonora team much learning negotiation and within country consultation had to occur in order to develop the team s ability to negotiate the complexity of institutional and cultural asymmetries for hydrologic studies there is no substitute for being physically present in the field area but it became clear that field trips were opportunities not only for knowledge exchange but also for building trust and a shared history knowledge gained through the binational taap effort will be useful only if stakeholders are aware of the results of our research and given opportunities for interaction and communication with project scientists the objectives stated in public law 109 448 require that us taa funding be used to produce scientific products for each priority transboundary aquifer that a are capable of being broadly distributed and b provide the scientific information needed by water managers and natural resource agencies on both sides of the united states mexico border to effectively accomplish the missions of the managers and agencies our definition of stakeholders includes the public decision makers and natural resource agencies who can use the research and information developed by the arizona sonora section of the taap to improve understanding and inform decisions related to san pedro and santa cruz aquifers the wrrc and usgs have conducted forums to share information and to discuss future directions for studying the tspa efforts were made to determine the most effective means of communication with stakeholders in the us and mexico web products factsheets and briefings are an important mode of communication with stakeholders the wrrc hosts a bilingual webpage https wrrc arizona edu taap that is regularly updated and includes background information on the program links to publications materials and activities databases and workshops a bulletin summarizing results of the binational study of the transboundary san pedro aquifer was released in spring 2017 in both english and spanish with the objective of showing the main results of the san pedro study to interested stakeholders beginning june 20 2017 briefings with decision makers were also an important means of communicating results and listening for feedback on priorities 3 1 8 communication internal to the project protocols established by the ibwc were followed in order to achieve effective internal communication within and between the us and mexican teams binational technical group meetings were scheduled by the ibwc at these meetings new tasks were developed and current challenges and progress were reviewed official minutes were produced for each session traveling to meetings continues to offer challenges depending on the institution binational travel can require a complicated process to obtain permission for international travel and up to nine weeks advance notice conference calls are the default therefore for convenience and when time is insufficient to process travel arrangements informal peer to peer communication took place in the form of email and telephone exchanges but only after permission was given by the ibwc 3 1 9 communication with the scientific community attendance and participation at conferences were important for communication and exchange among peers in the scientific community for example callegary et al 2009 mcandrew et al 2009 megdal et al 2010 scott et al 2010 minjárez et al 2017 vandervoet et al 2013 in 2017 the binational team presented the joint cooperative framework for the transboundary aquifer assessment program during a special session about the shared waters of north america at the world water congress in cancún méxico presentations included a poster on the taap and a discussion of the joint report and the binational study of the transboundary san pedro aquifer callegary et al 2017 megdal 2017 at the 2017 universities council on water resources annual conference scientific and modeling efforts were presented including discussions of the institutional and legal aspects of the taap journal articles theses and reports have also been critical to dissemination of scientific results mcandrew 2011 megdal and scott 2011 milman and scott 2010 prichard and scott 2014 scott et al 2012 stewart 2014 stewart et al 2012 the binational study of the transboundary san pedro aquifer was published in december 2016 and is the first binational aquifer study prepared and released simultaneously in english and spanish by the ibwc callegary et al 2016 the santa cruz study is currently under review by different governmental agencies in the us and mexico and is expected to be completed in 2018 3 2 developing physical context in this section we briefly describe the assessment results of each of the main topics studied in developing the physical context more specific results the physical technical assessment either have been or will be published elsewhere callegary et al 2016 3 2 1 delineation of the study area literature review and binational database development one of our first tasks was to define the area of study it was assumed initially that watershed boundaries primarily following the crests of mountain ranges would suffice in arizona a decision was made to limit the size of the study areas of the two aquifers to downstream boundaries established by adwr adwr 1991 in mexico aquifers are defined legally and generally approximate watershed boundaries but tend to include portions of adjacent aquifers this could have been a point of difficulty since portions of the actual aquifers might be excluded from study it was agreed however that the actual watershed boundaries could be used for the purposes of research assessment in the binational study for instance with groundwater modeling in sonora the tspa and tscas follow the official aquifer boundaries designated by the mexican national water commission conagua conagua 2015a b c for the tscas the arizona boundary combines three areas the adwr santa cruz ama boundary adwr 2017 the san rafael valley watershed adwr 2014 and the sonoita creek watershed which were added on the basis of watershed boundaries the next steps included reviewing existing literature and databases issues such as data integration and compatibility that were expected to be straightforward sometimes required time and face to face meetings to resolve questions arose regarding differences in measurement methods and dates data review requirements and quality assurance quality control procedures decisions had to be made about which data fields to combine and which to leave out as well as negotiations regarding format type cations trace metals etc amount e g all data or every other data point and range of dates of data to be included to fill data gaps in sonora a campaign of data collection was carried out by unison during that year minjárez sosa et al 2011a b a critical step was metadata development for each dataset required are the originator and publisher of the data if modifications were made or if data are derived from calculations or modeling for spatial data required information included horizontal and vertical datums and preferably instrument type or an estimate of precision finally questions regarding data storage location and level of accessibility e g available to public needed to be answered 3 2 2 climate land cover vegetation soils and geology binational versions of some data types such as land use land cover and vegetation were available in the published literature however challenges to data integration were the rule rather than the exception it was a high priority to keep data and grid resolutions comparable on both sides of the border for example coverage provided by meteorological stations was insufficient to allow reasonable interpolation thus it was decided that global meteorological datasets though low in resolution provided the best available data collected according to documented and reviewed methods soil data could not be integrated because classification methods in each country differ significantly for geology rather than attempt to re map each unit and bring descriptions into accord it was decided to combine geologic units by age and rock type using geologic maps from each country 3 2 3 hydrology and hydrochemical data differences in amount type timing and method of data collection presented a number of challenges to data integration in maps and databases for example methods for evaluation of water use differ in each country in mexico reports on water availability including water budget are published for each legally defined aquifer conagua 2015a 2015c these are required to be updated every five years using standardized methods published in the norma oficial mexicana nom 011 conagua 2000 diario oficial de la federación 2002 the reports include information on geology hydrology and well censuses they also calculate a groundwater budget for each aquifer and estimate the volume of water in deficit or the volume available annually for consumption in the us there are no uniform requirements for development of water budgets or the methods used to evaluate them in the san pedro and santa cruz aquifers published water budgets exist though different methods were used to compute them erwin 2007 gungle et al 2016 nelson 2007 thus direct comparisons of water budgets were not possible as in other areas of the project compromise and accommodation were the norm selection of parameters depended on agency preferences and recommendations as well as on the previous data available and the length of record for instance mexican authorities expressed their interest in the distribution of major cations and anions na ca2 mg2 k cl so4 2 hco3 and us counterparts were interested in the distribution of isotopes in the study area in addition for both hydrologic and hydrogeochemical data conagua typically uses contour lines for presenting this type of information whereas the usgs representatives prefer point information a compromise was reached in which water level maps used contours and water quality maps did not 3 3 lessons learned challenges and solutions challenges arose from a variety of situations including 1 misunderstanding regarding the correct channels through which to carry out the binational work 2 misunderstanding the correct protocols to use and 3 inadvertently differing interpretations of terms the situation in 1 occurred early in the program when the us part of the team assumed that it could work directly with the states in mexico and that no official binational agreement was needed an example of 2 occurred when the us team did not send proposals for new binational tasks well ahead of binational technical advisory committee meetings but instead introduced them during the meeting itself resulting in rejection of the majority of the proposed tasks an example of 3 occurred with the use of the acronym taap for a time after the signing of the joint report the us team continued to use it to refer solely to projects receiving funding under the 2006 us taa act while the mexican portion of the team used it to refer to the overall binational program resulting in confusion and ultimately the cessation of binational work in the mesilla aquifer for several years ending in 2016 when binational engagement was reinitiated each of these misunderstandings resulted in substantial delays of work or progress project wide or with groups associated with particular aquifers the majority of the solutions to the challenges above were rooted in the domain of social rather than physical science and often appeared with the benefit of hindsight in an attempt to systematize them we have laid them out in a diagram indicating the category or element being considered and the questions or factors that may be considered during project planning and implementation fig 3 it is intended to be used flexibly not prescriptively being modified to fit the needs of each project or study 3 3 1 laying the groundwork a long lead time between the passage of the taa act in 2006 and the signing by ibwc of the joint report in 2009 belies the intense activity of the intervening years we label this phase laying the groundwork and in hindsight it was critical in that it made possible the ensuing binational studies critical activities during this period consisted in learning engagement team building and development of binational understandings and protocols regarding communication and data exchange learning consisted of studying institutional and legal frameworks and socio political differences as well as literature reviews and building bibliographic and hydrologic databases engagement included convening stakeholders the public decision makers and natural resource agencies to explain project goals and context and to solicit feedback on priorities future directions and tasks team building consisted of meetings and field trips with current and potential team members to build shared history and exchange understanding of and ideas about us and mexican national and transboundary social economic legal and institutional frameworks as well as approaches to scientific assessment of the aquifers the eventual development of a common understanding of protocols and expectations with respect to communication and data exchange was critical for smooth functioning of the project all of these steps helped to alleviate the perceived risk of engaging in this activity for both parties subramanian et al 2012 petersen perlman and wolf 2015 3 3 2 leadership and facilitation leadership and facilitation were key factors in the success of the taap leaders appeared at various junctures and ranged from decision and policy maker involvement in the creation of the taa legislation to university and agency based managers and other personnel upper level managers at universities and agencies provided vision and guidance and support in terms of keeping the program a priority at the institutional level leaders on the technical teams were responsible for maintaining high standards for the collection and analysis of scientific data and organizing tasks and workflow with respect to facilitation various actors both individuals and institutions facilitated many processes and components of the program from stakeholder engagement and bridging cultures to scientific assessment the organization that provided primary binational facilitation was the ibwc which has facilitation as one of its primary functions in some respects it combines some of the qualities of both bridging and boundary organizations as defined by crona and parker 2012 as such it provides a space for trust building learning and conflict resolution by linking binational institutions bridging and it focuses on the science policy interface in terms of water and promotes accountability through the construction of agreements such as minutes and the joint report boundary 3 3 3 available resources technical and financial the taap is a partnership of multiple institutions in two countries with differing technical and financial capacities the diversity of institutions involved added flexibility and stability to the project with respect to technical functions a variety of modes for example stakeholder engagement and subcontracting were used to extend the range of technical input and expertise with respect to financial capacities the diversity of institutions and timing and sources of funding supported stability and consistency of effort through time 3 3 4 adaptation accommodation perseverance dealing with complexity and the unexpected we have already noted the complexities and the learning process involved in blending physical and social science with institutional asymmetries differing funding cycles shifting institutional priorities and personnel changes all of this occurs in the context of a shared binational history and different cultures and languages given that relationship building process development and formalization and scientific research are all occurring simultaneously within this temporally evolving environment there should be no expectation that the perfect formula or institutional arrangement will be created varady et al 2013 in such circumstances adaptation accommodation and perseverance become not just significant factors but factors that are critical to success 3 3 5 cultural and socio political sensitivity cultural and linguistic considerations may seem irrelevant to most physical scientists but disregarding them in a binational context can strain incipient relationships among participants having some members from each country with a working knowledge of the other country s culture and language made the work flow more easily despite the best efforts however breaches of institutional hierarchical and cultural norms continue to arise and in fact should be expected a history of good will and trust can help to overcome such challenges important considerations when preparing for meetings include such basics as expectations for greetings phrases and physical contact and behavior and protocols e g hierarchical formal discussions or unstructured discussions with at will participation we assert that it is critical that cultural and socio political issues be anticipated and respected from the beginning of a project blomquist and ingram 2003 norman and bakker 2005 far from reaching what is typically considered to be the main goal of aquifer assessments a project that does not incorporate and act on this knowledge runs the risk of failure almost before it has begun factors that need to be considered initially that may not occur to most physical scientists are legal and institutional frameworks especially those governing water management a number of questions related to these factors arise that need to be answered for example who must be consulted what are the protocols for consultation are there existing treaties precedents working groups what work has already been done and who are the experts these questions are logical when thinking about legal and institutional frameworks however it is also useful to think intuitively about what might have been missed for instance what questions are not being asked participants must be on the lookout for cultural biases and how they might be affecting interactions during meetings have all participants been asked individually to voice an opinion might there be cultural factors that affect reactions to such a question and might there be a better time place and setting for eliciting this information 3 3 6 time estimates of time are typically incorporated into plans for scientific studies but initial estimates in this case neglected to add time for negotiation learning and the unexpected a general inability to predict time requirements for different tasks has been a recurring phenomenon in this study such is probably true of any bi or multi national project and it is certainly true of the study of transboundary aquifers 3 3 7 research methods data and publication here the devil is in the details data collection methods frequency metadata storage and accessibility differed among agencies institutions and countries many tasks that are typically straightforward required significantly more time than expected due to problems of integration and compatibility how to integrate had to be agreed upon largely after data collection occurred nationally adopted standards and methods for report formats and level of detail peer review data sharing and translation all had to be had to be discussed reports format and level of detail eventually developed into a hybrid of the usgs and conagua styles review of reports followed the usual protocols of each institution in each country for data sharing it was written into the agreement that the ibwc would be the official repository of records generated by all binational interactions including joint projects 4 conclusions the transboundary aquifer assessment program taap as applied to the san pedro santa cruz and nogales aquifers has been a successful collaboration by government and university partners in mexico and the us taap was motivated by the taa act by the us congress in 2006 with a ten year authorization and developed within the context of worldwide advances toward transboundary aquifer assessment and governance promulgated by academics unesco and other international bodies beginning in the 1990s one of the most significant achievements was the signing in 2009 by both countries of the joint report which created the us mexico transboundary aquifer program this authorized the formation of binational teams and the beginning of the truly binational phase of the technical studies us taap funding was not appropriated during the period fy11 to fy15 despite this two projects that were initiated binationally were the development of reports for the transboundary san pedro and the combined santa cruz and nogales aquifers the 2016 report on the tspa compiles and analyzes scientific information from both countries as will the tscas report summarizing the current state of knowledge with the respect to hydrology and hydrologically related information results of the taap build a foundation for understanding and can be used by agencies land managers universities and decision makers to make informed choices about current and future water resources moreover bilingual binational reports focused on individual aquifers represent a store of hydrologic information from both countries that was previously unavailable in both languages in one publication maps included in the reports can be used by agencies land managers universities and decision makers to understand the way in which information on water geology climate and vegetation is integrated across the border the mapping effort is noteworthy in that data from each country were integrated across the border thereby avoiding the customary white map syndrome on the other side of the border the process of carrying out the taap project has produced an experienced binational team a tested process and a precedent for a binational partnership of government institutions and universities which can be used to facilitate and carry out new binational projects focused on transboundary aquifers data gaps were identified including information and analysis necessary to update the numerical model of the groundwater flow system the 2016 report the binational study of the transboundary san pedro aquifer callegary et al 2016 is the first groundwater focused report in which the data and results are officially accepted by the us and mexican governments through the ibwc official ibwc approval and participation was critical to project success and working within the protocols outlined in the ibwc joint report led to an unprecedented level of data sharing and scientific cooperation between the two countries on the subject of groundwater we feel that the methods developed in this paper if used appropriately and flexibly will help to fill data gaps add skill sets and build relationships in those areas in which typical aquifer assessments are weakest and where transboundary aquifer assessments are most in need

8471,study region this study region encompasses the transboundary san pedro and santa cruz aquifers which are shared between the states of sonora mexico and arizona us special regional considerations include a semi arid climate basin fill aquifers with predominantly montane recharge areas economic drivers in the mining trade and military sectors groundwater dependent cities with expanding cones of depression interbasin groundwater transfers ground and surface water contamination and protected aquatic and riparian habitats that act as significant migration corridors for hundreds of species including some that are threatened and endangered study focus we focus on lessons learned from the hydrologic assessment of the transboundary san pedro and santa cruz aquifers we conducted the work in two phases 1 laying the groundwork and 2 implementation the laying the groundwork phase consisted of binational meetings with stakeholders and key actors agencies and individuals and the development of an understanding of the physical institutional historical and socio political context this led to signing of the binational transboundary aquifer assessment program taap agreement in 2009 and detailed the process for cooperation and coordination in the assessment of shared aquifers the implementation phase began with an agreement to proceed with the study of four focus aquifers santa cruz san pedro mesilla conejos médanos in mexico and hueco bolson bolsón del hueco in mexico and development of associated technical teams though we do include a brief discussion of the lessons learned from the physical science portion of the study the results have been described and published elsewhere the bulk of the paper instead focuses on the findings and lessons learned from the integration of social science perspectives into a largely physical science based program since there is a growing recognition of the need for this type of approach especially in the management and assessment of transboundary aquifers new hydrological insights for the region the sonora arizona effort succeeded because both countries were adequately represented and because of flexibility of skills and ability of teams comprising both university and government scientists teams included social and earth scientists including the social sciences was critical to research design and implementation and to addressing the cultural institutional and socio political contexts of transboundary aquifer assessment significant components of the continuing implementation phase include strategic planning data compilation and analysis cross border integration of datasets geophysical and geochemical surveys and internal peer and stakeholder engagement keywords transboundary aquifers us mexico groundwater socio hydrology hydrogeology 1 introduction transboundary aquifers represent a source of water of growing importance globally for reasons of increasing water use scarcity and contamination scarcity caused by growth in population agriculture industry climate change and drought the resulting need requires the development of agreements to share and manage transboundary waters water governance of which sharing and management are components can present a number of challenges foster et al 2010 varady et al 2016 there is also recognition that without basic hydrologic information aquifer management and water resource planning would be difficult water quality can be impaired as a result of scarcity resulting in impacts to human health and economic activities through declines in agricultural production loss of ecosystem services and the costs of water treatment and remediation those factors may be exacerbated by climate change and drought cycles both of which are likely to affect the southwest united states garfin et al 2013 as concentrations of salts and contaminants rise in water supplies assessing a transboundary aquifer involves more than simply the study of the physical aspects of the aquifer and its environment where waters straddle a political boundary the complexity of assessment and management increases by assessment we mean the development of information through both data collection and analysis which is conducted in an impartial and reproducible way factors such as politics policy differing legal frameworks resources political economic and or military institutional capacity interstate relations and history and cultural and linguistic differences all come into play blomquist and ingram 2003 norman and bakker 2005 therefore the usual approaches employed by hydrologists to understand cooperator client needs develop workplans and carry out studies are insufficient and the required skill sets exceed the abilities and training of most hydrologists currently a range of multidisciplinary approaches encompassing the fields of law and the physical and social sciences are being applied to the study of transboundary aquifers successful approaches to initiate cooperation over transboundary waters include respecting the autonomies of participating countries creating networks of scientists from participating countries consulting diverse groups of stakeholders and allowing for each participating country to have ownership of specific cooperative activities petersen perlman and wolf 2015 thereby mitigating the perceived risk countries face by entering into cooperative frameworks subramanian et al 2012 such approaches include aquifer assessments and classification schemes designed to support developing systems of international law governance and management alley 2013 callegary et al 2016 eckstein and eckstein 2005 eden et al 2016 petrossian et al 2017 sanchez et al 2016 shamir et al 2015 they also include studies of cooperation conflict scenarios embodying a nuanced recognition that cooperation and cooperation commonly exist side by side conti 2014 delli priscoli 1994 wolf 2008 zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 groundwater shared between the us and mexico is no exception to these complexities and challenges and the two countries share a number of hydrological basins crossed by the international boundary in the early 2000s us agencies and institutions including the water resources research institutes wrris of texas new mexico and arizona cooperated in a series of binational discussions and meetings in response to the urgent need to study shared groundwater along the mexico us border as a result the us congress authorized public law 109 448 the united states mexico transboundary aquifer assessment act taa act in december 22 2006 alley 2013 authorizing funding of 50 million usd over a ten year period the taa act created the ground rules for the us team with regard to which institutions would be involved and consulted and with regard to us overall goals 1 develop and implement an integrated scientific approach to identify and assess priority transboundary aquifers 2 consider the expansion or modification of existing agreements as appropriate between the united states geological survey the participating states the water resources research institutes and appropriate authorities in the united states and mexico the act signaled the us s interest in binational studies and authorized us involvement consultation with and a request for involvement from mexico were the next steps thus began the process described in this paper of negotiation engagement and mutual learning that resulted in a formal agreement between the two countries in 2009 to allow the study of transboundary aquifers ibwc 2009 four transboundary aquifers were chosen for initial study the san pedro and santa cruz shared between sonora mexico and arizona us mesilla shared among chihuahua mexico new mexico us and texas us and the hueco bolson chihuahua and texas we focus on the transboundary san pedro aquifer and the transboundary santa cruz aquifer system tspa and tscas respectively where continual binational work has taken place from 2007 to the present the studies described here are limited to subwatersheds of larger geologic basins straddling the mexico us border the objectives of this paper are to describe the multidisciplinary approach involving a combination of social and physical sciences and university and government institutions and scientists that was used for the study of the tspa and tscas we describe the process of laying the groundwork specifically negotiation engagement and mutual learning leading to agreement between the two countries we document the results of combined application of physical and social sciences to assess priority transboundary aquifers finally we summarize our successes and failures and propose opportunities for improvement 1 1 background 1 1 1 what do international law and policy have to do with hydrology the hydrologic assessment of transboundary aquifers is just one piece within the larger arena of international law policy and management development of international legal and policy frameworks for the study of transboundary aquifers began long before the current study providing a rich history that informed our approach international discussions between the us and mexico began in the 1990s and continuing to the present these discussions formalized or published in policy briefs reports and journal articles attempted to recognize describe and formulate policy and legal frameworks in terms of the economic value of groundwater agarwal et al 2000 and more recently to situate groundwater within the water food energy climate ecosystem nexus bazilian et al 2011 berardy and chester 2017 de strasser et al 2016 dodds and bartram 2016 ringler et al 2013 as an example the 9th international symposium on managed aquifer recharge ismar9 held in june 2016 in mexico city focused on increasing groundwater s visibility and promoting sustainable groundwater management the symposium resulted in six policy directives ismar9 2016 the first directive called for recognizing aquifers and groundwater as critically important finite valuable and vulnerable resources next the symposium called for halting the chronic depletion of aquifers across the globe the third directive called for information on groundwater to be shared widely citing the uniqueness of all aquifer systems and the need for these systems to be well understood further directives called for sustainable management and protection of groundwater using integrated water resources management principles agarwal et al 2000 and advocated increased managed aquifer recharge finally the sixth directive addressed the need for collaboration strong stakeholder participation and community engagement in effective groundwater management the principles outlined in the ismar9 directives reflect the 2008 united nations draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers draft articles the draft articles are arguably the most significant effort to date for developing any international regulatory system for transboundary aquifer systems eckstein 2011 the 19 draft articles are modeled on the 1997 united nations convention on the law of the non navigational uses of transboundary watercourses un convention and include rules for equitable utilization obligation to cause no significant harm and promotion of international and technical cooperation eckstein 2011 the ratification of the draft articles will be included once again in the provisional agenda of the seventy fourth session of the un general assembly in 2019 unga 2016 the draft articles encourage nations to enter into bilateral or regional agreements but to date only a handful of such formal agreements over transboundary aquifers have been formalized the transboundary waters task force of un water crafted seven pillars that are considered necessary for reliable long lasting and sustainable transboundary water cooperation unga 2010 the text of the first pillar recommends a sound legal framework un water called for agreements to be concrete and to aim for cooperative institutional agreements with enforcement mechanisms on the protection of water resources and related ecosystems the second pillar proposes appropriate institutional structures with strong capacities at national international and regional scales third transboundary water development and management should feature long term and contingency planning to make vulnerable systems more resilient the fourth pillar calls for data exchange joint monitoring and assessment of shared waters the fifth pillar recommends public participation with the aims of enhancing transparency creating ownership and working toward agreement on policies and management decisions sixth the panel calls for countries sharing river basins to share benefits from the rivers fairly and justly compensate those who suffer losses the seventh and final pillar states that in order to accomplish everything listed above appropriate financing is necessary unga 2010 taken together the directives draft articles and pillars mentioned in the preceding paragraphs apply directly to projects such as ours by affirming the importance of groundwater the need for better information and the need for collaboration to obtain it they also raise the visibility of groundwater internationally and provide a set of guidelines for countries seeking to develop and prioritize objectives and behaviors related to transboundary groundwater issues 1 2 site descriptions although the san pedro river riparian corridor has received considerable international attention the tspa along with the tscas only began to receive attention late in the last decade the 2009 update to the international groundwater resources assessment center s transboundary aquifers or the world map featured both aquifers igrac 2009 unesco s internationally shared aquifer resource management isarm program listed the aquifers as part of the inventory listed in the isarm of the americas inventory 1 2 1 transboundary san pedro aquifer the tspa is of critical interest because of the high ecological value of the riparian ecosystem sustained by the san pedro river cec 1999 gungle et al 2016 and the need for groundwater to sustain the river existing communities and continuing development the tspa and its watershed make up one of the most studied hydrologic systems in the region because of their economic historical and environmental characteristics richter et al 2014 previous studies include topics ranging from geophysics and hydrology to biology and ecosystem services anning and leenhouts 2010 bagstad et al 2013 2005 callegary et al 2007 gungle et al 2016 lite and stromberg 2005 moran et al 2008 pool and dickinson 2007 stewart et al 2012 the economic drivers differ on each side of the border with military and tourism in arizona and mining in sonora as the lead industries the copper deposit at cananea is responsible for about 40 of copper production in mexico jiménez 2014 with over 350 species of birds and over 80 species of mammals the riparian forest and flanking areas along the san pedro river have been recognized as a critical north american biodiversity hotspot and critical migratory corridor cec 1999 and several projects have been initiated to maintain baseflow in the river using managed aquifer recharge richter et al 2014 fig 1 1 2 2 transboundary santa cruz aaquifer system in the tscas the major economic drivers include commerce at the international border and a significant manufacturing sector on the mexican side of the border about 100 manufacturing plants employing over 34 000 people were registered in nogales sonora in 2014 pavlakovich kochi 2014 and the plants can have negative environmental impacts if their discharges do not meet water quality standards the tscas is the main source of water for the twin cities of nogales sonora and nogales arizona which have a combined population of about 250 000 conagua 2015c erwin 2007 inegi 2017 scott et al 2012 uscb 2017 in addition to obtaining groundwater from the santa cruz aquifer nogales sonora also uses groundwater from the nogales and los alisos aquifers and nogales arizona maintains a wellfield to the west of the city conagua 2015b nelson 2007 scott et al 2012 municipal water providers struggle to meet the demands due strongly seasonally variable groundwater levels in wells near the santa cruz river prichard and scott 2014 the nogales international wastewater treatment plant situated in arizona treats effluent from both cities with about 80 originating in nogales sonora ibwc 2017 the effluent is discharged into the santa cruz river where it helps to sustain riparian habitat and stabilize groundwater levels for up to 15 km downstream of the facility acknowledging the unique set of conditions present in the portion of the tscas near the us mexico border the arizona department of water resources adwr created the santa cruz active management area ama in 1994 adwr 2010 amas are areas in which adwr regulates the use of groundwater in accordance with the 1980 arizona groundwater code adwr 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 laying the groundwork by laying the groundwork we mean those factors or actions required at the outset of the project in order to move forward with the physically based study of the aquifers some of these factors were anticipated and others were added along the way as the need became evident some were learned in hindsight in typical groundwater assessments it is unusual to consider some factors investigated for this study these include institutional economic historical and socio political factors but these affect who is involved what language s and methods of communications are used ease of travel and availability of funding they can also inform somewhat unexpectedly preliminary conceptual models and task development with respect to subjects such as land use land cover water budgets water quality and units of measurement methods and results used to assess governance and legal and institutional frameworks are documented in megdal and scott 2011 megdal et al 2010 and scott et al 2010 milman and scott 2010 determined the key aspects that influence water management in transboundary settings understanding these factors is critical to understanding the mechanisms for supporting the work on a prospective as well as retrospective basis as changing policy and management environments and funding cycles have direct bearing on the workflow development of a binational agreement though not initially foreseen as a requirement for the binational work was one of the principle activities of the first several years of the project the taa legislation in the us did not involve an agreement with mexico but institutional frameworks required binational consultation on water issues to occur through the international boundary and water commission ibwc the ibwc la comisión internacional de límites y aguas or cila in mexico is one organization with two sections a mexican and a u s section it is a branch of the state department in the u s and of the secretaría de relaciones exteriores in mexico following ibwc protocols in order for progress to be made on studies a binational agreement was needed the ibwc and the mexican national water commission comisión nacional del agua or conagua were key players in the development of the agreement that established the binational taap in the us representatives of the university based water resources research institutes wrris were key negotiators the wrris are federally authorized with a long standing working relationship with and funding from the us geological survey usgs identification of team members was constrained by law custom and regulation in each country in part it involved the selection and inclusion of agencies and individuals deemed necessary given the resources and personnel available to carry out the functions of the project the team member selection process evolved between 2007 and about 2009 to conform more closely with legal and regulatory requirements in both countries the approach of the us part of the team was constrained by the language of the taa act and its requirement of the maximum extent practicable for cooperation and the development of relationships with organizations in mexico the taa act required the participation of the usgs and the wrris in mexico selection of member agencies was made with regard to federal requirements for consultation and work with particular agencies namely conagua and ibwc these agencies then contracted as needed with other institutions such as the university of sonora and the mexican geological service communication and stakeholder engagement were key to the success of the project a flexible approach amenable to the changing demands of the project prevented detailed long term planning at the outset however approaches to different levels of communication internal communication peer to peer and with stakeholders were worked out over time various tools and techniques were used including development of bilingual web products fact sheets binational workshops and field trips like technical studies engagement efforts require resources which were intermittent a broad set of stakeholders was involved in early assessment scoping efforts a successful workshop organized by the university of arizona s water resources research center wrrc the primary institution on the team with social science expertise the workshop involved a long list of stakeholders from both countries and both aquifers and was held in late 2009 after a long period approximately 2011 2016 of focusing on the physical science portion of the transboundary studies new efforts by the wrrc to disseminate and explore the findings and engage a broader set of stakeholders are underway the development of an approach to planning and decision making was not a linear process it began simply eventually evolving into agreements and workplans contractual agreements were used to formalize expectations whether tasks arose from a funding agreement or from an accord formalizing a working relationship between two entities with representation on the binational team formal agreements were used to clarify the roles of institutions committees working groups and personnel and to guide future work 2 2 developing physical context climate hydrology land cover vegetation soils and geology the development of an understanding of the physical context required information on climate land cover hydrology vegetation soils and geology a literature review was conducted for each aquifer vandervoet et al 2013 one of the main goals was to develop a binational database with the goal as specified by the joint report of the principal engineers regarding the joint cooperative process united state mexico for the transboundary aquifer assessment program hereafter referred to as the joint report that metadata be developed and that the database be housed and served by the ibwc for the tspa data and existing literature on the aforementioned topics were summarized in callegary et al 2016 for the tscas a binational report using the same approach has been drafted and is in review field work included geophysical geochemical and hydrological studies callegary et al 2016 2013 minjárez sosa et al 2011a stewart et al 2012 modeling included chemical transport modeling mcandrew 2011 and assessment of aquifer vulnerability to contamination lincicome 2011 when priorities and funding allowed field work and modeling were conducted in both the us and mexico using standard approaches the results and analysis were published as abstracts graduate theses journal articles and reports alley 2013 stewart 2014 callegary et al 2017 megdal 2017 minjárez et al 2017 callegary et al 2018 geologic field work is ongoing and includes geologic mapping and geophysical and hydrochemical surveys hydrochemical surveys were carried out by the universidad de sonora minjárez sosa et al 2011a b hydrochemical data for the us were taken from the adwr and usgs databases and water quality reports and the obtained information allowed us to identify groundwater families in the binational context 3 results and discussion 3 1 laying the groundwork understanding the context when approaching the study of transboundary aquifers is critical to project success context includes the economic historical and socio political setting in which the study is to occur it also includes legal and institutional frameworks lack of knowledge can hinder progress or even shut down a project 3 1 1 economic historical and socio political setting in mexico primary authority for management of water resources emanates from the federal government to the states and municipalities in the united states primary authority rests with the states except in cases of interstate surface waters binational waters are not currently jointly managed by the two countries except in cases where treaties have been negotiated such as for the rio grande and colorado rivers the 1944 water treaty serves as the main reference for binational water management in the us and mexico michel 2003 it establishes the distribution of water on the colorado and tijuana rivers and the rio grande however it does not address groundwater management milanes murcia 2017 the only attempt to include groundwater management in the border region is minute 242 which limits the groundwater extractions from the yuma aquifer located within the states of arizona and sonora sanchez and eckstein 2017 mumme 2000 minutes are not amendments to the treaty but are decisions made by the ibwc and are used to carry out the provisions of the 1944 treaty guidelines and agreements providing jurisdiction or establishing a process for binational consultation include the la paz agreement of 1983 and the integral environmental plan for the us mexico border of 1992 an awareness of this shared history as well as current events and political realities was critical when approaching the binational work 3 1 2 legal framework institutional setting political resource management and decision making authority tend to be more centralized in mexico than in the us megdal et al 2010 megdal and scott 2011 in mexico much of the authority to regulate water lies with conagua and in the case of binational water some of that authority lies with the ibwc in the us depending on the issue water management jurisdiction varies it may require the participation of multiple institutions such as state water and environment departments and in the case of interstate waters and contamination other agencies may need to be involved such as the epa with respect to water research any of the aforementioned institutions may be involved but also universities and the usgs the resulting institutional asymmetries required each group to learn and adjust to the functions and procedures of the partner institutions such as communication protocols rules and customs questions that needed to be answered included how is communication initiated what is the chain of communication what permission is needed and in what situations is informal communication acceptable decisions were also required on procedures for approval of proposals and decisions review of draft manuscripts and data exchange ibwc protocols provided a starting point for communication and distinguishing between formal and informal exchanges fig 2 3 1 3 development of a binational agreement owing to its expertise in managing treaty obligations and mexican policies regarding transboundary waters negotiations through the ibwc were central to formalizing cooperation and establishing the nature of the cooperation the discussions meetings joint presentations at a conferences and legislation ultimately led to the 2009 signing of the joint report the joint report established the framework for us mexico coordination and dialogue to implement transboundary aquifer studies megdal 2017 the document clarifies program details such as background roles responsibilities funding relevance of the international water treaties and the use of information collected or compiled as part of the program four priority aquifers santa cruz san pedro mesilla and hueco bolson were agreed upon by the parties involved which included the ibwc the conagua the usgs unison and the wrris at new mexico state university texas a m and the university of arizona approval was later given to add the nogales aquifer classified as a separate aquifer in mexico in recognition of the fact that it is hydraulically connected via both surface and groundwater to the santa cruz aquifer in the us by agreement the transboundary aquifer assessment program taap has focused on assessment and not management indeed a clause of the joint report reads the information generated from these projects is solely for the purpose of expanding knowledge of the aquifers and should not be used by one country to require that the other country modify its water management and use nevertheless the taap furthers two important components of the un 2008 draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers the first is article 7 2 the general obligation to cooperate which calls for establishment of joint mechanisms of cooperation the second is article 8 2 on the regular exchange of data and information where knowledge about the nature and extent of a transboundary aquifer or aquifer system is inadequate aquifer states shall take such action individually or jointly and where appropriate together with or through international organizations table 1 3 1 4 available resources technical and financial financial resources were provided by each country us funding was divided equally as required by the taa act among the wrris and the usgs water science centers in texas new mexico and arizona with respect to the san pedro santa cruz and nogales aquifers the wrrc the wrri based at the university of arizona and ibwc contributed additional funding in mexico funds were provided by conagua to the mexican section of the ibwc and thence to the unison at times funding in availability in one country would lag behind funding in the other resulting in differences in the amount and type of work occurring in each country no restrictions were imposed on funding coming from additional sources this and the fact that the taap is a partnership of universities and government in two countries all with different sources and timing of funding added flexibility that allowed at least a minimal level of work even in years with low or no funding technical resources were available through a variety of institutions in mexico conagua often obtains technical expertise under contract with universities 3 1 5 identification of team members one of the initial challenges was determining which parties should come to the table and which were required by government laws and regulations team composition evolved substantially over a period of several years in part because the us team worked initially under the assumption that there would be no constraints as to which agencies and institutions they could work with in mexico a variety of institutions in the us had considerable experience working with mexican partner institutions in the us the usgs and the wrris located in the three states designated in the taa act are core team members and have determined which other partners were invited to consult or participate in arizona the arizona department of water resources the upper san pedro partnership and the city of nogales were consulted the binational ibwc has played a key role in the binational team because of its centrality in the study and management of binational water as well as the fact that it is part of the state department of both countries in addition mexico s policy requires that all border water issues be handled through ibwc also in mexico conagua has played the role of chief policy and funding coordinator for water studies while unison was contracted because of its technical expertise scientific assessment of the aquifers was carried out by a team under the guidance of a binational technical group and a working group as stipulated by the joint report the binational technical group s role was to oversee the development of work plans and goals the working group was responsible for carrying out individual tasks and documenting progress via reports journal articles and factsheets given that some critical taap personnel are political appointees and therefore subject to election cycles there has been remarkable stability of team membership this has allowed for the building of mutual trust and the flexibility required for working within each country s institutional environment wilder et al 2010 geophysical surveys aquifer tests and water quality sampling were carried out by faculty and students from unison through contract with ibwc in the us field activities were carried out by the scientists from the usgs and faculty and students from the university of arizona 3 1 6 planning and decision making generally binational priorities were developed jointly however each country in accordance with the joint report can carry out work within its own borders without needing to consult the other thus some taap related studies were not binational though they were designed to contribute to the overall objectives of the taap binational forums addressing the arizona sonora aquifers in 2009 and the four focus aquifers in 2016 resulted in the development of strategic plans outlining priorities and tasks over multi year periods annual tactical plans instituted in 2016 outline the implementation of the strategic plans year by year taking account of current realities relating to funding resources personnel any new challenges and progress to date tactical workplans were used to outline and agree upon short term goals tasks budgets and timelines usually expected to last one to three years strategic workplans were used to outline long term vision and estimated budgets for the project as well as sequences of tasks on different fronts such as the development of fully coupled binational groundwater surface water models 3 1 7 communication and stakeholder engagement until a formal agreement between the two countries was signed no binational work could proceed the long development phase for this project 3 years prior to the signing of the joint report runs counter to typical project timelines for hydrologic studies this period however was needed for essential activities such as team and trust building bagshaw et al 2007 as well as the time required drafting and negotiating the joint report and for the approval process in each country meetings and field trips were essential to the creation of the joint report and to building the binational arizona sonora team much learning negotiation and within country consultation had to occur in order to develop the team s ability to negotiate the complexity of institutional and cultural asymmetries for hydrologic studies there is no substitute for being physically present in the field area but it became clear that field trips were opportunities not only for knowledge exchange but also for building trust and a shared history knowledge gained through the binational taap effort will be useful only if stakeholders are aware of the results of our research and given opportunities for interaction and communication with project scientists the objectives stated in public law 109 448 require that us taa funding be used to produce scientific products for each priority transboundary aquifer that a are capable of being broadly distributed and b provide the scientific information needed by water managers and natural resource agencies on both sides of the united states mexico border to effectively accomplish the missions of the managers and agencies our definition of stakeholders includes the public decision makers and natural resource agencies who can use the research and information developed by the arizona sonora section of the taap to improve understanding and inform decisions related to san pedro and santa cruz aquifers the wrrc and usgs have conducted forums to share information and to discuss future directions for studying the tspa efforts were made to determine the most effective means of communication with stakeholders in the us and mexico web products factsheets and briefings are an important mode of communication with stakeholders the wrrc hosts a bilingual webpage https wrrc arizona edu taap that is regularly updated and includes background information on the program links to publications materials and activities databases and workshops a bulletin summarizing results of the binational study of the transboundary san pedro aquifer was released in spring 2017 in both english and spanish with the objective of showing the main results of the san pedro study to interested stakeholders beginning june 20 2017 briefings with decision makers were also an important means of communicating results and listening for feedback on priorities 3 1 8 communication internal to the project protocols established by the ibwc were followed in order to achieve effective internal communication within and between the us and mexican teams binational technical group meetings were scheduled by the ibwc at these meetings new tasks were developed and current challenges and progress were reviewed official minutes were produced for each session traveling to meetings continues to offer challenges depending on the institution binational travel can require a complicated process to obtain permission for international travel and up to nine weeks advance notice conference calls are the default therefore for convenience and when time is insufficient to process travel arrangements informal peer to peer communication took place in the form of email and telephone exchanges but only after permission was given by the ibwc 3 1 9 communication with the scientific community attendance and participation at conferences were important for communication and exchange among peers in the scientific community for example callegary et al 2009 mcandrew et al 2009 megdal et al 2010 scott et al 2010 minjárez et al 2017 vandervoet et al 2013 in 2017 the binational team presented the joint cooperative framework for the transboundary aquifer assessment program during a special session about the shared waters of north america at the world water congress in cancún méxico presentations included a poster on the taap and a discussion of the joint report and the binational study of the transboundary san pedro aquifer callegary et al 2017 megdal 2017 at the 2017 universities council on water resources annual conference scientific and modeling efforts were presented including discussions of the institutional and legal aspects of the taap journal articles theses and reports have also been critical to dissemination of scientific results mcandrew 2011 megdal and scott 2011 milman and scott 2010 prichard and scott 2014 scott et al 2012 stewart 2014 stewart et al 2012 the binational study of the transboundary san pedro aquifer was published in december 2016 and is the first binational aquifer study prepared and released simultaneously in english and spanish by the ibwc callegary et al 2016 the santa cruz study is currently under review by different governmental agencies in the us and mexico and is expected to be completed in 2018 3 2 developing physical context in this section we briefly describe the assessment results of each of the main topics studied in developing the physical context more specific results the physical technical assessment either have been or will be published elsewhere callegary et al 2016 3 2 1 delineation of the study area literature review and binational database development one of our first tasks was to define the area of study it was assumed initially that watershed boundaries primarily following the crests of mountain ranges would suffice in arizona a decision was made to limit the size of the study areas of the two aquifers to downstream boundaries established by adwr adwr 1991 in mexico aquifers are defined legally and generally approximate watershed boundaries but tend to include portions of adjacent aquifers this could have been a point of difficulty since portions of the actual aquifers might be excluded from study it was agreed however that the actual watershed boundaries could be used for the purposes of research assessment in the binational study for instance with groundwater modeling in sonora the tspa and tscas follow the official aquifer boundaries designated by the mexican national water commission conagua conagua 2015a b c for the tscas the arizona boundary combines three areas the adwr santa cruz ama boundary adwr 2017 the san rafael valley watershed adwr 2014 and the sonoita creek watershed which were added on the basis of watershed boundaries the next steps included reviewing existing literature and databases issues such as data integration and compatibility that were expected to be straightforward sometimes required time and face to face meetings to resolve questions arose regarding differences in measurement methods and dates data review requirements and quality assurance quality control procedures decisions had to be made about which data fields to combine and which to leave out as well as negotiations regarding format type cations trace metals etc amount e g all data or every other data point and range of dates of data to be included to fill data gaps in sonora a campaign of data collection was carried out by unison during that year minjárez sosa et al 2011a b a critical step was metadata development for each dataset required are the originator and publisher of the data if modifications were made or if data are derived from calculations or modeling for spatial data required information included horizontal and vertical datums and preferably instrument type or an estimate of precision finally questions regarding data storage location and level of accessibility e g available to public needed to be answered 3 2 2 climate land cover vegetation soils and geology binational versions of some data types such as land use land cover and vegetation were available in the published literature however challenges to data integration were the rule rather than the exception it was a high priority to keep data and grid resolutions comparable on both sides of the border for example coverage provided by meteorological stations was insufficient to allow reasonable interpolation thus it was decided that global meteorological datasets though low in resolution provided the best available data collected according to documented and reviewed methods soil data could not be integrated because classification methods in each country differ significantly for geology rather than attempt to re map each unit and bring descriptions into accord it was decided to combine geologic units by age and rock type using geologic maps from each country 3 2 3 hydrology and hydrochemical data differences in amount type timing and method of data collection presented a number of challenges to data integration in maps and databases for example methods for evaluation of water use differ in each country in mexico reports on water availability including water budget are published for each legally defined aquifer conagua 2015a 2015c these are required to be updated every five years using standardized methods published in the norma oficial mexicana nom 011 conagua 2000 diario oficial de la federación 2002 the reports include information on geology hydrology and well censuses they also calculate a groundwater budget for each aquifer and estimate the volume of water in deficit or the volume available annually for consumption in the us there are no uniform requirements for development of water budgets or the methods used to evaluate them in the san pedro and santa cruz aquifers published water budgets exist though different methods were used to compute them erwin 2007 gungle et al 2016 nelson 2007 thus direct comparisons of water budgets were not possible as in other areas of the project compromise and accommodation were the norm selection of parameters depended on agency preferences and recommendations as well as on the previous data available and the length of record for instance mexican authorities expressed their interest in the distribution of major cations and anions na ca2 mg2 k cl so4 2 hco3 and us counterparts were interested in the distribution of isotopes in the study area in addition for both hydrologic and hydrogeochemical data conagua typically uses contour lines for presenting this type of information whereas the usgs representatives prefer point information a compromise was reached in which water level maps used contours and water quality maps did not 3 3 lessons learned challenges and solutions challenges arose from a variety of situations including 1 misunderstanding regarding the correct channels through which to carry out the binational work 2 misunderstanding the correct protocols to use and 3 inadvertently differing interpretations of terms the situation in 1 occurred early in the program when the us part of the team assumed that it could work directly with the states in mexico and that no official binational agreement was needed an example of 2 occurred when the us team did not send proposals for new binational tasks well ahead of binational technical advisory committee meetings but instead introduced them during the meeting itself resulting in rejection of the majority of the proposed tasks an example of 3 occurred with the use of the acronym taap for a time after the signing of the joint report the us team continued to use it to refer solely to projects receiving funding under the 2006 us taa act while the mexican portion of the team used it to refer to the overall binational program resulting in confusion and ultimately the cessation of binational work in the mesilla aquifer for several years ending in 2016 when binational engagement was reinitiated each of these misunderstandings resulted in substantial delays of work or progress project wide or with groups associated with particular aquifers the majority of the solutions to the challenges above were rooted in the domain of social rather than physical science and often appeared with the benefit of hindsight in an attempt to systematize them we have laid them out in a diagram indicating the category or element being considered and the questions or factors that may be considered during project planning and implementation fig 3 it is intended to be used flexibly not prescriptively being modified to fit the needs of each project or study 3 3 1 laying the groundwork a long lead time between the passage of the taa act in 2006 and the signing by ibwc of the joint report in 2009 belies the intense activity of the intervening years we label this phase laying the groundwork and in hindsight it was critical in that it made possible the ensuing binational studies critical activities during this period consisted in learning engagement team building and development of binational understandings and protocols regarding communication and data exchange learning consisted of studying institutional and legal frameworks and socio political differences as well as literature reviews and building bibliographic and hydrologic databases engagement included convening stakeholders the public decision makers and natural resource agencies to explain project goals and context and to solicit feedback on priorities future directions and tasks team building consisted of meetings and field trips with current and potential team members to build shared history and exchange understanding of and ideas about us and mexican national and transboundary social economic legal and institutional frameworks as well as approaches to scientific assessment of the aquifers the eventual development of a common understanding of protocols and expectations with respect to communication and data exchange was critical for smooth functioning of the project all of these steps helped to alleviate the perceived risk of engaging in this activity for both parties subramanian et al 2012 petersen perlman and wolf 2015 3 3 2 leadership and facilitation leadership and facilitation were key factors in the success of the taap leaders appeared at various junctures and ranged from decision and policy maker involvement in the creation of the taa legislation to university and agency based managers and other personnel upper level managers at universities and agencies provided vision and guidance and support in terms of keeping the program a priority at the institutional level leaders on the technical teams were responsible for maintaining high standards for the collection and analysis of scientific data and organizing tasks and workflow with respect to facilitation various actors both individuals and institutions facilitated many processes and components of the program from stakeholder engagement and bridging cultures to scientific assessment the organization that provided primary binational facilitation was the ibwc which has facilitation as one of its primary functions in some respects it combines some of the qualities of both bridging and boundary organizations as defined by crona and parker 2012 as such it provides a space for trust building learning and conflict resolution by linking binational institutions bridging and it focuses on the science policy interface in terms of water and promotes accountability through the construction of agreements such as minutes and the joint report boundary 3 3 3 available resources technical and financial the taap is a partnership of multiple institutions in two countries with differing technical and financial capacities the diversity of institutions involved added flexibility and stability to the project with respect to technical functions a variety of modes for example stakeholder engagement and subcontracting were used to extend the range of technical input and expertise with respect to financial capacities the diversity of institutions and timing and sources of funding supported stability and consistency of effort through time 3 3 4 adaptation accommodation perseverance dealing with complexity and the unexpected we have already noted the complexities and the learning process involved in blending physical and social science with institutional asymmetries differing funding cycles shifting institutional priorities and personnel changes all of this occurs in the context of a shared binational history and different cultures and languages given that relationship building process development and formalization and scientific research are all occurring simultaneously within this temporally evolving environment there should be no expectation that the perfect formula or institutional arrangement will be created varady et al 2013 in such circumstances adaptation accommodation and perseverance become not just significant factors but factors that are critical to success 3 3 5 cultural and socio political sensitivity cultural and linguistic considerations may seem irrelevant to most physical scientists but disregarding them in a binational context can strain incipient relationships among participants having some members from each country with a working knowledge of the other country s culture and language made the work flow more easily despite the best efforts however breaches of institutional hierarchical and cultural norms continue to arise and in fact should be expected a history of good will and trust can help to overcome such challenges important considerations when preparing for meetings include such basics as expectations for greetings phrases and physical contact and behavior and protocols e g hierarchical formal discussions or unstructured discussions with at will participation we assert that it is critical that cultural and socio political issues be anticipated and respected from the beginning of a project blomquist and ingram 2003 norman and bakker 2005 far from reaching what is typically considered to be the main goal of aquifer assessments a project that does not incorporate and act on this knowledge runs the risk of failure almost before it has begun factors that need to be considered initially that may not occur to most physical scientists are legal and institutional frameworks especially those governing water management a number of questions related to these factors arise that need to be answered for example who must be consulted what are the protocols for consultation are there existing treaties precedents working groups what work has already been done and who are the experts these questions are logical when thinking about legal and institutional frameworks however it is also useful to think intuitively about what might have been missed for instance what questions are not being asked participants must be on the lookout for cultural biases and how they might be affecting interactions during meetings have all participants been asked individually to voice an opinion might there be cultural factors that affect reactions to such a question and might there be a better time place and setting for eliciting this information 3 3 6 time estimates of time are typically incorporated into plans for scientific studies but initial estimates in this case neglected to add time for negotiation learning and the unexpected a general inability to predict time requirements for different tasks has been a recurring phenomenon in this study such is probably true of any bi or multi national project and it is certainly true of the study of transboundary aquifers 3 3 7 research methods data and publication here the devil is in the details data collection methods frequency metadata storage and accessibility differed among agencies institutions and countries many tasks that are typically straightforward required significantly more time than expected due to problems of integration and compatibility how to integrate had to be agreed upon largely after data collection occurred nationally adopted standards and methods for report formats and level of detail peer review data sharing and translation all had to be had to be discussed reports format and level of detail eventually developed into a hybrid of the usgs and conagua styles review of reports followed the usual protocols of each institution in each country for data sharing it was written into the agreement that the ibwc would be the official repository of records generated by all binational interactions including joint projects 4 conclusions the transboundary aquifer assessment program taap as applied to the san pedro santa cruz and nogales aquifers has been a successful collaboration by government and university partners in mexico and the us taap was motivated by the taa act by the us congress in 2006 with a ten year authorization and developed within the context of worldwide advances toward transboundary aquifer assessment and governance promulgated by academics unesco and other international bodies beginning in the 1990s one of the most significant achievements was the signing in 2009 by both countries of the joint report which created the us mexico transboundary aquifer program this authorized the formation of binational teams and the beginning of the truly binational phase of the technical studies us taap funding was not appropriated during the period fy11 to fy15 despite this two projects that were initiated binationally were the development of reports for the transboundary san pedro and the combined santa cruz and nogales aquifers the 2016 report on the tspa compiles and analyzes scientific information from both countries as will the tscas report summarizing the current state of knowledge with the respect to hydrology and hydrologically related information results of the taap build a foundation for understanding and can be used by agencies land managers universities and decision makers to make informed choices about current and future water resources moreover bilingual binational reports focused on individual aquifers represent a store of hydrologic information from both countries that was previously unavailable in both languages in one publication maps included in the reports can be used by agencies land managers universities and decision makers to understand the way in which information on water geology climate and vegetation is integrated across the border the mapping effort is noteworthy in that data from each country were integrated across the border thereby avoiding the customary white map syndrome on the other side of the border the process of carrying out the taap project has produced an experienced binational team a tested process and a precedent for a binational partnership of government institutions and universities which can be used to facilitate and carry out new binational projects focused on transboundary aquifers data gaps were identified including information and analysis necessary to update the numerical model of the groundwater flow system the 2016 report the binational study of the transboundary san pedro aquifer callegary et al 2016 is the first groundwater focused report in which the data and results are officially accepted by the us and mexican governments through the ibwc official ibwc approval and participation was critical to project success and working within the protocols outlined in the ibwc joint report led to an unprecedented level of data sharing and scientific cooperation between the two countries on the subject of groundwater we feel that the methods developed in this paper if used appropriately and flexibly will help to fill data gaps add skill sets and build relationships in those areas in which typical aquifer assessments are weakest and where transboundary aquifer assessments are most in need

8472,study region chihuahua coahuila nuevo leon and tamaulipas mexico texas usa study focus the objective of this study is to identify and classify the transboundary hydrogeological units shared between chihuahua coahuila nuevo leon and tamaulipas mexico and texas and assess their potential transboundary linkages new hydrological insights the transboundary groundwater resources between mexico and united states are largely uncharacterized due to lack of data differences in aquifer boundary delimitations and methodologies and limited cooperation and coordination among federal and local agencies within and between countries to address groundwater challenges from a binational perspective our results indicate that the transboundary hydrogeological units identified cover around 180 000 km2 110 000 km2 in texas and 72 000 km2 in mexico between 50 and 60 of this sharable area reports good aquifer potential and good water quality conditions some 20 25 is considered to have poor aquifer potential and water quality the areas of the bolsons southeast of the hueco tularosa bolson aquifer in northern chihuahua and southwestern texas and between the serrania del burro and allende piedras negras aquifers in southern texas and northern coahuila appear to be the most important for transboundary aquifer potential this study the first assessment of its kind in this region will support the development of transboundary management regimes aimed at preventing the degradation of future water supplies in the borderland between mexico and united states keywords transboundary aquifer hydrogeology northeastern mexico texas 1 introduction the most recent study on transboundary aquifers between mexico and the united states finds that there might be up to 36 of them sanchez et al 2016 fifteen potential transboundary aquifers have been reported between mexico and texas though recognized transboundary linkages are known only for five sanchez et al 2016 due to lack of data differences in aquifer boundary delimitations and methodologies and the limited cooperation and coordination among federal and local agencies within and between countries to address groundwater challenges from a binational perspective the transboundary groundwater resources shared by the two countries are largely uncharacterized the recent research on transboundary aquifers supported by the transboundary aquifer assessment program includes the san pedro and santa cruz aquifers between arizona and sonora the hueco bolson and mesilla bolson between texas new mexico and chihuahua and the yuma aquifer which is governed by minute 242 of the international boundary and water commission comisión nacional de límites y aguas ibwc cila apart from these the rest of the potential transboundary aquifers in this region remain unexplored the challenge of managing the transboundary aquifers between mexico and texas in terms of vulnerabilities and planning scenarios is greatly magnified by the number of unknowns including aquifer conditions and transboundary linkages rapid urbanization population growth and climate change predictions that envision a more drought prone border region require attention to groundwater resources as surface water has already reached its supply limit according to the world resources institute the rio grande basin is one of the most water stressed basins in the world maddocks and reig 2014 and it supplies close to 90 of all agriculture production in texas it is also the source of domestic supply for highly populated cities such as el paso laredo mcallen and san antonio in texas and ciudad juarez piedras negras nuevo laredo acuna and reynosa in mexico there are also small communities along the border between chihuahua and texas that rely completely on groundwater for domestic use the purpose of this study is to develop a methodology to identify and classify the transboundary aquifers between mexico and texas this new approach is designed to provide the first ever assessment of all the transboundary hydrogeological units shared between mexico and texas identified in this study as hgus it is divided into two phases first to assess the surficial correlation of geological units to identify hydrogeological connectivity and preliminary aquifer identification and to develop a classification of geological units based on hydrogeological parameters and water quality to identify those transboundary units with aquifer potential results will identify and visualize the highest priority regions based on the previous classification this study releases important results overall the hgus identified cover around 180 000 km2 approximately 110 000 km2 on the texas side and 72 000 km2 on the mexico side the total area considered to have good aquifer potential as well as good water quality ranges between 50 and 60 of which 60 is in texas and the rest in mexico some 20 25 of the shared land is considered to have poor aquifer conditions and low water quality with similar area on the two sides of the border this study should be read in light of its intrinsic limitations and research boundaries first the geological correlation is based primarily on surficial geology using structural geology and well depths to define vertical extent and thus limiting the correlation to the outcrop portions of the formations this approach was used to efficiently visualize the geological correlation in two dimensions a second limitation has to do with the certainty of the reported data in some areas some of the reports from conagua on the geological formations at the border with chihuahua close to big bend national park are limited in terms of data reliability suggesting the need for more research to confirm their assumptions the classification of these units should be taken as a preliminary estimate the same caution applies to formations that have been reported on only one side of the border assuming limited connectivity to the other side in terms of water quality data some reports are rather general and do not specify the location of the water being tested if such formations cover a significant area their water quality values might be over or underestimated in addition some reports contradict each other in those cases the hgu has been identified with two categories at the same time again adding uncertainty in terms of water quality to the whole unit this paper has two main parts the first part addresses geological correlations between texas and mexico and describes the lithological and hydrological features of each identified formation followed by the delineation of boundary and transboundary units and their corresponding boundaries the second part addresses the classification of transboundary hydrogeological units formations based on hydrogeological characteristics and water quality and a preliminary identification of priority areas based on their aquifer potential 2 methodology 2 1 geological correlation commonly in hydrogeology the boundaries of an aquifer are defined by lithology changes mexico and texas use different methods to define aquifer boundaries texas uses geologic formations and mexico uses a combination of hydrogeologic and administrative boundaries sanchez et al 2016 a unified geologic correlation process was developed to identify those units that actually cross the boundary as a sign of potential transboundary aquifers this geological correlation is limited to surficial and structural geology as geological maps are representative of surficial geological formations vertical analysis based on profiles and well lithological descriptions is used to identify the outcropping limits of the geological boundaries of the formations to perform the geological correlation a review of all available hydrogeological data on geological units between texas and mexico was performed along with an extensive visualization and analysis of geographical information using arcgis 10 3 software geological data for mexico were downloaded from the federal agency servicio geologico mexicano sgm servicio geológico mexicano 2016 as geologic maps in shapefile format at 1 250000 scale this scale was selected due to its availability in data on both sides of the border for the texas side geological data were obtained from the usgs united states geological service using the texas geologic map data website which covers the entire state u s geological survey 2016a to address the problems related to differences of geological equivalence across the border correlation maps with common geological units were available and complemented those regions for which information was limited preliminary geologic map of laredo crystal city eagle pass san antonio and del rio 1 x 2 quadrangles texas and nuevo laredo ciudad acuna piedras negras and nueva rosita 1 x 2 quadrangles mexico page et al 2009 where no geologic maps spanned the two countries it was necessary to use maps available from either mexico and texas at 1 250000 scale the texas portions were supplied by the usgs map preliminary geologic map of southernmost texas united states and parts of

mexicano 2002 servicio geológico mexicano 2003a b servicio geológico mexicano 2008a b c d f in case of uncertainty or lack of information of the geological name assigned in either country the stratigraphic lexicons from both countries were reviewed geologic description age thickness stratigraphic position and correlations were used to determine the corresponding geological formation the formation identification process also provided the preliminary data to identify the type and quality of the aquifers that could be considered transboundary and those with limited or poor aquifer potential after the geological correlation process a geological structural analysis vertical geology was developed from the geologic map profiles and well lithology descriptions to delineate the formations boundaries this process was necessary because even if there is physical continuity of a geological unit it can be truncated by folds or faults faulting can improve the permeability of the rock or it can generate secondary porosity in rocks initially considered aquitards rocks blocking groundwater flow 2 2 classification of hydrogeological units hgus the second objective was the classification of geological units based on the hydrogeological correlation hydrological features and water quality this classification is based on previous categorization by conagua 2006 edited to fit the objectives of this research conagua 2006 proposes an aquifer classification based on geological characteristics such as porosity and permeability of the lithological features of outcropping units aquifer potential and the water quality in those geological units the categories are unit i poor to very poor aquifer potential and very poor groundwater quality unit ii moderate aquifer potential and good to moderate water quality unit iii geologic units that work as aquitards with poor aquifer potential and very poor water quality unit iv moderate to poor aquifer potential and very poor water quality unit v moderate aquifer potential and good water quality unit vi poor to very poor aquifer potential and moderate to poor water quality and unit vii aquitards with poor to very poor water quality it is important to clarify that conagua 2006 report in which this classification was used applied only to the geologic units in north tamaulipas mexico this research uses similar criteria to identify the lithological and hydrogeological potential of those units aquifers that cross the border between texas and mexico with minor adjustments for the objectives of this research for this research aquifer potential is defined as the potential that a formation a group of formations or a part of a formation contains sufficient saturated permeable material to yield significant quantities of water for wells and springs u s geological survey 2016b the criteria used to define aquifer potential include lithological features permeability porosity hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity and water yield when available considering the complexity and heterogeneity of the units as well as the differences in methods used to characterize units on the two sides of the border a combination of criteria were used to classify aquifer potential as good moderate or poor geological and lithological descriptions of the units porosity and hydraulic conductivity when available or standardized values according to the predominant lithology hiscock 2005 permeability reports and assessments and water yield data from conagua 2006 and technical reports from the texas water development board twdb data were collected from federal state and local agencies as well as from technical and scientific reports private industry reports non public reports and field assessments the common criterion for water quality was tds total dissolved solids which was available for most of the border region this research uses the tds ranges of the texas water development board twdb 2017 to classify groundwater quality freshwater less than 1000 mg l slightly saline called brackish water in many studies 1000 3000 mg l moderately saline 3000 10 000 mg l very saline 10 000 35 000 mg l and brine over 35 000 mg l some reports refer to parts per million ppm where 1 ppm is equivalent to 1 mg l ppm is the term used in this report as well table 1 shows our classification of formations according to aquifer potential and corresponding water quality this classification is then visualized and analyzed using gis tools to identify delineate and propose aquifer boundaries from a hydrogeological perspective names of the aquifers were assigned according to the literature from either the u s or the mexico side for those formations identified as good potential aquifers according to the classification but whose aquifer has not been named we maintain the same formation name on both sides and refer to them as hydrogeological units or hgus given the lithological differences among them 3 results and discussions 3 1 geological correlation between mexico and texas this section includes the geological features of the formations identified and correlated between mexico and texas they are included and described in detail in table 2 geological formations in table 2 are listed according to the age of the geological unit oldest first and in case they have different names on both sides this study reports first the name according to mexico then for texas table 2 also includes hydrological features available as well as the name of those units that have been recognized as aquifers according to the literature there are formations that have been reported on only one side of the border not crossing the boundary those formations are identified with a parenthetical usa or mex the border and transboundary formations are highlighted in bold in the figures figs 1 5 list all the geological formations with their corresponding names reported on both sides mex texas even if they are the same but this section considers only the correlation of formations located on the border listed in bold in the figures other units in the same country or not near the border are not considered 3 2 geological formation limits the formations in the borderland defining their geologic limits on both sides are presented in figs 6 8 these figures represent the next level of refinement of identification of borderland formations with their corresponding physical delimitations there are formations that have only been identified on one side of the border examples in figs 6 7 and 8 are qt to tertiary clay and mud usa cox sandstone usa javelina fm usa neogene conglomerate mex rhyolitic tuff mex andesitic porphyry mex devils river limestone usa uvalde gravel usa lissie fm usa and catahoula vicksburg fm undivided usa though these formations seem to appear only on one side of the borderland they could be continuous into mexico indeed the uvalde gravel has been proven to be continuous with the quaternary alluvial on the mexico side forming the allende piedras negras transboundary aquifer according to some technical studies boghici 2002 lack of data on these formations prevents further conclusions and therefore this study will consider them as boundary formations with reservations on their transboundary linkages pending further research the extension limits of the formations were defined according to structural geological limits faults folds and lineaments in fig 6 the formations show great variation in types and sizes and complex distribution along the border area the geological extensions in this area were defined mainly by geological limits and small faults u s geological survey 2007 servicio geológico mexicano 2016 the geological limits of the western side of the state of texas are based on a combination of geological and political boundaries with the state of new mexico the entire mesilla bolson is mapped and considered in the analysis of this research even though only a small portion of the aquifer lies in texas geologically speaking the northern limits of the hueco bolson in the state of new mexico also include the tularosa basin but the northern part is not fully mapped so it is not considered in this study according to the literature the hueco bolson and the tularosa basin are hydrogeologically connected in the subsurface but there is a topographical feature that divides the two basins sanchez et al 2016 sheng et al 2001 therefore considering the reasonable previous research on this aquifer this study considers the official extension of the hueco bolson to not include the tularosa basin following reports by twdb george et al 2011 and isarm international groundwater resources assessment centre igrac 2015 however for mapping purposes hueco bolson and tularosa basin will be presented as hueco tularosa basin the geological limits of the red light draw bolson fig 9 are defined by the quitman mountains in texas and the sierra el trozado in mexico in the case of green river valley bolson it is possible to extend the hgu across the border into mexico by following the tertiary and quaternary deposits groat 1972 and gabaldón 1991 also report the extension of the presidio and redford bolsons across the rio grande up to sierra de ventana chihuahua in mexico where the limits are defined by cretaceous and igneous rocks fig 7 represents mostly the geological limits of the edwards aquifer and adjacent formations the north and the west sides are limited by the extent of the geological formation the east side is limited by the balcones fault and the south on the mexico side by the boquillas sabinas lineament padilla 2007 fig 8 shows the boundaries of the eastern part of the region the east side of the formations is limited by the coast the south side limits in mexico are defined mainly by the sierra mojada china lineament padilla 2007 and small faults and folds servicio geológico mexicano 2016 and the northern limits are defined primarily by the chittim anticline on the east side of edwards aquifer alexander 2015 and san marcos arch baker 1995 at the northern limit of the gulf coast aquifer there are formations that act as extent limits of the boundary formations those units that do not seem to cross the borderland or that occur as igneous inclusions within surrounding or adjacent to the boundary formations analysis of these formations was not included in the current study but are included in the figures for mapping and visualization purposes they are also listed in the corresponding legends of the figures not highlighted in bold 3 3 classification of geological formations aquifers given the geological description and hydrogeological features described in section 3 1 and table 2 boundary and transboundary formations were classified according to their aquifer potential and water quality parameters as described in section 2 2 the classification shown in table 3 is based on the predominant conditions of the formations according to available data aquifer names are given based on the literature either from the texas or the mexico side except in the case of the cretaceous terlingua aquifer which is formed by a section of the santa elena fm santa elena limestone a section of pen fm aguja fm and javelina usa identified only as cretaceous strata by fallin 1990 in contrast with other similar formations this aquifer shows aquifer potential therefore for the purpose of this study and considering its location it has been identified as the cretaceous terlingua aquifer those formations that have been identified as having good aquifer potential according to the classification but have not been given an aquifer identification name maintain the same formation name on both sides and are referred to as hydrogeological units or hgus given the lithological differences among them considering the uncertainty of the continuity of the boundary formations those formations that have been reported only one side of the border and the randomness of their appearance in the border region with apparent discontinuity in the other side for example the tertiary basalts fig 6 this classification includes both boundary and transboundary formations pending further research to identify and characterize geographically the areas of transboundary groundwater between texas and mexico the ids from table 3 are classified into groups with similar characteristics table 4 shows the grouping five groups were created to identify those geographic areas containing transboundary groundwater with good and moderate potential and differentiate them from those areas with poor potential and water quality group 1 dark green the most important units formations in terms of groundwater potential and water quality corresponds to the a1 a2 b1 and b2 classifications group 2 light green includes those units formations that have good to moderate aquifer potential but poor water quality or with limited water quality information on that area a3 a4 b3 and b4 group 2 constitutes a second level of priority representing possible future resource development as desalination projects given the good aquifer potential of those units group 3 orange includes those units with poor aquifer potential or aquitards with good to moderate water quality this group may be considered a third level of priority given the limited potential of the aquifer but still exploitable at the local level for domestic supply in small communities because of good to moderate water quality c1 c3 d1 and d2 group 4 light maroon is the lowest priority group units formations with poor aquifer potential and with poor water quality or limited information on water quality in that area c3 c4 d3 and d4 group 5 gray includes those units formations with limited information on both aquifer potential and water quality their priority is undefined given the lack of data e1 e2 e3 and e4 figs 12 13 and 14 show the hgus colored by group further details are given in section 3 4 2 interesting findings are shown in table 3 from the total of 53 boundary and transboundary formations accounting for differences of geological sections or sub units within the formation which add a total of 64 15 formations sub units are considered to have good to middle aquifer potential with good to moderate water quality and 4 formations have good aquifer potential but limited information on water quality upper west nueces fm santa elena fm santa elena limestone austin fm austin chalk and ojinaga fm it is fair to say that approximately 35 of the identified geological units have good aquifer potential with at least 28 of good to moderate water quality conditions the predominant formations under this classification are the edwards fm upper salmon peak and aurora fm glen rose fm all parts of the edwards aquifer likewise good aquifer conditions are also prominent in the quaternary alluvium deposits of santa fe del pino the serrania de burro and presa la amistad aquifers and the quaternary and conglomerate deposits of the bolsons of valle de juarez mesilla red light draw green river valley presidio and redford the carrizo fm carrizo sand part of the carrizo wilcox aquifer is also in this category moderate aquifer conditions but with less than 1000 ppm tds were found in oakville lagarto fm flemming fm reynosa fm goliad fm and wilcox fm indio fm on the other hand an estimated 17 formations 32 have been identified as poor aquifers or aquitards with poor to moderate water quality the predominant formations in this category are the yegua fm part of the yegua jackson aquifer santa elena fm santa elena limestone part of the cretaceous terlingua aquifer upson fm upson clay aguja fm escondido fm midway fm kincaid fm bigford fm palma real guayabal fm laredo fm frio fm and the lower catahoula formation both parts of the catahoula confining system and the beaumont fm part of the gulf coast aquifer the rest of the formations and sub units 5 are considered aquitards with no data on water quality or aquitards with good to moderate water quality 3 and there are 6 boundary and transboundary formations that have no reported data on either aquifer conditions or water quality san carlos fm san carlos sandstone chisos fm usa cox sandstone usa la pena fm yucca fm picacho fm and benevides fm caution should be taken in estimates of percentages considering that these are based on type of formation and not on geographical extent from a general perspective the area of the bolsons southeast of the valle de juarez hueco tularosa bolson aquifer in the north of chihuahua and southwestern texas and between the serrania del burro and allende piedras negras aquifers in south texas and north of coahuila where the quaternary and alluvium deposits are concentrated appear to be the most important areas for transboundary aquifer potential section 3 4 1 describes those transboundary formations in more detail 3 4 classification of transboundary hydrogeological units hgus 3 4 1 transboundary hydrogeological units hgus in order to assess the classification of transboundary hydrogeological units it was necessary to group the transboundary geological formations into hydrogeological units aquifers figs 9 11 show the transboundary geological formations grouped into hydrogeological units the clustering of formations is based on the geological and lithological description of the units in section 3 and in the literature cited mainly in table 2 these maps represent a more refined identification of transboundary geological formations considering hydrogeological linkages and boundary limitations they are referred to as hydrogeological units or hgus instead of aquifers because of the different hydrogeological conditions among formations that may or may not be categorized as an aquifer fig 9 shows the region including the population centers of el paso ciudad juarez and presidio ojinaga twelve hgus are identified and delineated starting from the west the conejos medanos mesilla bolson and valle de juarez hueco tularosa bolson aquifers are the most studied aquifers in the region and officially recognized as transboundary aquifers by both countries sheng et al 2001 and therefore hydrogeological conditions and boundaries have been addressed according to the literature these aquifers are formed by quaternary alluvium and quaternary conglomerates on both sides of the border quaternary clay and mud on the texas side and neogene conglomerate in the hueco tularosa bolson on the mexico side it is important to clarify that the areal extension of these aquifers crosses into new mexico where the geological formation is recognized as the santa fe group which is equivalent to quaternary clay and mud in the hueco tularosa bolson and quaternary eolic in the mesilla bolson moving east there are multiple formations with different hydrogeological properties these formations are continuous across the border therefore have been grouped instead of divided into the quitman mountains hgu this hgu groups a series of small formations with limited aquifer potential except for aurora fm glen rose fm and ojinaga fm that act primarily as a boundary between the neighboring bolsons beach 2008 groat 1972 the next hgu identified is the red light draw bolson which is composed of the same geological features as the valle de juarez hueco tularosa bolson likewise the next group of formations the eagle mountains hgu has very limited aquifer potential and acts as a boundary of the adjacent bolson similar to the quitman mountains hgu the eagle mountains hgu has limited aquifer potential and acts as a hydrogeological boundary between adjacent hgus is formed by portions of the same formations identified in the quitman mountains except for the buda del rio fm buda limestone del rio clay and the ojinaga fm beach 2008 from west to east the next three hgus the green river valley bolson the presidio bolson and the redford bolson are formed by the same formations as the previous bolsons and are considered to have good aquifer potential but more research is needed to confirm both aquifer capabilities and transboundary linkages gabaldón 1991 east of the redford bolson the hgu designated as tertiary igneous rocks is an aquifer of limited potential because of the igneous material prominent in this area the next formation to the east has been referred in this study as the cretaceous terlingua aquifer the literature refers to this area mainly as cretaceous strata fallin 1990 but because of the broad presence of formations of cretaceous age in the region and to geographically identify this particular formation which shows aquifer potential this study refers to this hgu as the cretaceous terlingua aquifer this aquifer includes four formations but only one pen fm is considered to have some aquifer potential the next group of transboundary formations located mostly in the big bend region maderas del carmen coahuila is referred to as the mariscal hgu after the mariscal mine in big bend national park it includes a variety of laterally discontinuous layers that cross the boundary at varying locations making their separation problematic this hgu act as a barrier to neighboring water bearing formations apart from a small section of the austin chalk fm and the quaternary conglomerate lenses present in this region the mariscal hgu does not have good aquifer potential east of the mariscal hgu is the boquillas fm which has no important aquifer potential finally in fig 10 there are two quaternary alluvium aquifers the santa fe del pino and the serrania de burro these names are from official reports on the mexican portion of the aquifer conagua 2015d 2015e in addition to quaternary alluvium the santa fe del pino is formed by quaternary conglomerates on both sides of the border and the serrania del burro is formed by quaternary clay and mud on the texas side though small both transboundary aquifers are characterized as having good aquifer potential conagua 2015d 2015e but more research is required fig 10 shows the transboundary hgu from fort stockton to piedras negras the largest hgu in this figure is the edwards aquifer one of the largest aquifers in the state of texas it supplies groundwater to the southcentral part of the state and extends into the northern and western parts of the state of coahuila this aquifer is composed of a variety of formations with mostly good aquifer potential except for the lower portions of the west nueces fm and the salmon peak fm which are considered to have poor aquifer potential and a portion of santa elena fm santa elena limestone which is considered to have moderate aquifer potential the rest of the formations in the edwards aquifer have good aquifer potential as well as good water quality boghici 2004 all of the identified formations have been reported on both sides of the border except for the devils river limestone usa considering the extension of the edwards aquifer which covers the largest area in the borderland there are geological features worth mentioning first the kiamichi fm outcrops as a linear feature at the southern limit of the edwards aquifer in coahuila creating an open circle around this region dark purple stratigraphically underlying the edwards aquifer likewise the austin fm austin chalk has also been identified as overlying a portion of the edwards aquifer adjacent to the border between texas and northeast coahuila acting as an upper confining unit of the system boghici 2004 as mentioned in section 3 some reports describe this formation having a good aquifer potential boghici 2002 but others classify it as an aquitard clark and small 1997 reeves and small 1973 the austin fm austin chalk is also present to the east of the buda del rio fm buda limestone del rio clay which is the next hgu to the east the buda del rio fm buda limestone del rio clay is continuous across the border into texas underlying the uvalde gravel and outcropping as small islands inside and to the north of the presa la amistad aquifer this formation and the eagle ford fm eagle ford group have poor aquifer potential boghici 2002 the next identified hgu is the presa la amistad aquifer named from mexico s official reports conagua 2015a b c d e f g h this hgu is formed by quaternary alluvium on both sides of the border and the uvalde gravel usa on the texas side it is reported to have good aquifer potential as well as good water quality conagua 2015a b c d e f g h it is worth mentioning the presa la amistad aquifer underlines the region where the international amistad dam is located and according to official reports from conagua 2015c there is groundwater flow from the aquifer to amistad reservoir dam hydrogeological information for this region is limited on both sides of the border therefore more research is required to confirm surface and groundwater interactions from this aquifer east of the presa la amistad aquifer is the allende piedras negras aquifer though it has not been recognized officially as a transboundary aquifer technical studies are available that report transboundary linkages in this aquifer boghici 2002 this aquifer is formed by quaternary alluvium and quaternary conglomerates on both sides of the border and the uvalde gravel usa on the texas side fig 11 shows the hgus moving east towards the coast starting from a small outcrop section of the upson fm upson clay which appears as blue points in the middle of the san miguel fm on the mexico side of the border with several points east of the allende piedras negras aquifer on texas side next are the escondido fm olmos fm and midway fm kincaid fm which act as aquitards or have poor aquifer potential and poor water quality saline brackish the next hgu to the east is the carrizo wilcox aquifer which is formed by the carrizo fm carrizo sand and the wilcox fm indio fm there is a reasonable amount of data on this aquifer from both sides of the border that agree that aquifer potential is good to moderate and water quality is fresh to slightly saline depending on location klemt et al 1976 ashworth and hopkins 1995 boghici 2002 east of the carrizo wilcox aquifer the three hgus bigford fm el pico clay fm and palma real guayabal fm laredo fm and the yegua fm which is part of the yegua jackson aquifer are reported to have aquifer characteristics similar to the escondido and olmos formations boghici 2002 conagua 2006 the remaining portion of the yegua jackson aquifer jackson fm jackson group is reported to have moderate aquifer potential but poor water quality boghici 2002 conagua 2006 between the yegua jackson aquifer and the gulf coast aquifer referred to in mexico as the bajo rio bravo aquifer lies the catahoula confining system none of the formations that are part of this confining system are reported to have good aquifer potential or water quality ashworth and hopkins 1995 twdb 2017 the upper catahoula portion of the catahoula fm is part of the gulf coast aquifer and is reported to have moderate aquifer potential and brackish water ashworth and hopkins 1995 twdb 2017 all formations the gulf coast aquifer have good aquifer potential and good water quality except for the beaumont fm twdb 2017 which is adjacent to the quaternary lacustrine in the vicinity of the state of tamaulipas the transboundary portion of this aquifer seems to rely on the quaternary alluvium located along the rio grande conagua 2015h details of the potential transboundary portions of the hgu are addressed in the next section 3 4 2 classification of transboundary hgus by group figs 12 14 map the hgus colored by category group id table 4 fig 12 shows the western region of texas bordering the state of chihuahua the most important aquifers in the region are the hgus designated as bolsons which are classified as good production potential aquifers however except for the urban centers in the region including the cities of presidio and ojinaga and small towns that use groundwater for irrigation and livestock on both sides of the border guadalupe in chihuahua and sierra blanca valentina and van horn in texas not much research or groundwater development is reported in this region given the limited surface water availability in this border area there is a high dependency on groundwater which has had impacts on the sensitive ecosystem in some areas of the chihuahua desert sanchez et al 2016 moreover there seems to be interest in developing groundwater storage in the igneous portion of the western bolsons for the future water needs of the city of el paso sanchez et al 2016 more research and data collection on aquifer properties and water quality on both sides of the border in this region is of high priority for both countries the big bend region does not represent an important source of groundwater development given the complexity and limited continuity of the formations that surround the transboundary area some classified as good aquifers and others as aquitards the fact that this region is a national park and a protected area on the mexican side maderas del carmen makes significant groundwater development in the region unlikely however two small quaternary alluvium transboundary aquifers santa fe del pino and serrania del burro have been identified on the eastern side of the big bend area which should be noted for future research and water needs in the area generally 60 65 of the land in this area is estimated to have good aquifer potential and good water quality fig 13 predominantly shows the edwards aquifer and adjacent hgus according to the classification system table 4 80 85 of the edwards aquifer hgu is classified as having good to moderate aquifer potential with both good and poor water quality areas exceptions are a portion of the border region between texas and coahuila north of the austin chalk and a small portion in the western extent of the aquifer given the generally good aquifer potential of the edwards aquifer which extends almost to the center of the state of coahuila the edwards aquifer in coahuila is considered of high priority for future research the mexican side of the aquifer is considered an ecological priority for the state of coahuila because it includes the serrania del burro mountains which serves as the headwaters of all perennial rivers in the state these rivers provide water for the cities of ocampo muzquiz and cuatrocienegas in the five springs region region de los cinco manantiales cuatrocienegas is outside the limits of the edwards aquifer there is high dependency on the presa la amistad aquifer in the cities of del rio acuna bordering the edwards and on the allende piedras negras aquifer in the bordering cities of piedras negras eagle pass sanchez et al 2016 there are reports of high transmissivity along the border area as well as groundwater confinement that increases water yield in the area of the amistad aquifer close to acuna george et al 2011 other small communities in uvalde kinney edwards and val verde counties in texas also rely on groundwater from the edwards aquifer and a reverse hydraulic gradient has been reported north of uvalde city due to surface drainage variations and overpumping boghici 2002 continuing eastward from the area covered in figs 13 14 shows the classification of hgus from the allende piedras negras aquifer to the brb gulf coast aquifer within this area it can be seen that apart from the carrizo wilcox aquifer and sections of the gulf coast aquifer along the border which are considered to have good aquifer potential and good water quality on both sides of the border the rest of the region falls into the poor quality category for aquifer and water this region is known to have high salinity tds 1000 3000 mg l and is referred to as the bad water zone sanchez et al 2016 reliance on groundwater in this region is limited good aquifer potential associated with the gulf coast aquifer extends from texas across the border to the state of tamaulipas groundwater supply is reported to be significant in the border cities of mcallen reynosa and brownsville matamoros and the surrounding area extensive irrigation districts on both sides depend on groundwater for economic development in the texas counties of harris galveston fort bend jasper and wharton land subsidence has been reported in the gulf coast aquifer george et al 2011 and reverse groundwater flow because of over pumping has been reported around the cities of crystal city and cotulla further because of the location of the amistad and falcon international dams in this region as well as the groundwater surface interactions that contribute to the rio grande rio bravo river flow and its tributaries a portion of the groundwater on the mexico side is considered to be committed to fulfill mexico s water obligations with the united states under the 1944 water treaty for the utilization of waters of the colorado and tijuana rivers and of the rio grande adding pressure on groundwater resources in this region conagua 2015c based on the classification system table 4 it is estimated that around 30 35 of the borderland in this region has good aquifer potential overall the identified hgus in the borderland between texas and mexico cover around 180 000 km2 approximately 110 000 km2 on the texas side and 72 000 km2 on the mexico side it is worth mentioning that excluding the area of the edwards aquifer which has a large areal extent primarily on the texas side approximately 35 000 km2 the proportion of land on both sides of the border is similar between 50 and 60 of this area is considered to have good aquifer potential as well as good water quality of which approximately 60 is in texas and 40 in mexico approximately 20 25 of the borderland is considered to have poor aquifer conditions and poor water quality with approximately equal areas on both sides of the border 4 conclusions from the total of 53 boundary and transboundary formations identified between mexico and texas there are 15 formations sub units considered to have good to moderate aquifer potential and good to moderate water quality approximately 35 of the identified geological units have good aquifer potential and at least 28 good to moderate water quality the predominant formations classified as good to moderate are the edwards fm upper salmon peak and aurora fm glen rose fm part of the edwards aquifer the quaternary alluvium deposits of santa fe del pino the serrania de burro and presa la amistad aquifers and the quaternary and conglomerate deposits of the bolsons of valle de juarez mesilla red light draw green river valley presidio and redford the carrizo fm carrizo sand part of the carrizo wilcox aquifer is also in this category on the other hand an estimated 17 formations 32 have been identified as having poor aquifer potential or as aquitards with moderate to poor water quality the predominant formations in this category are the yegua fm part of the yegua jackson aquifer santa elena fm santa elena limestone upson fm upson clay aguja fm escondido fm midway fm kincaid fm bigford fm palma real guayabal fm laredo fm frio fm and the lower catahoula formation both parts of the catahoula confining system and the beaumont fm part of the gulf coast aquifer overall the area covered by the identified hgus in the borderland between texas and mexico is around 180 000 km2 approximately 110 000 km2 on the texas side and 72 000 km2 on the mexico side the total area considered to have good aquifer potential as well as good water quality ranges between 50 and 60 of which approximately 60 is in texas and 40 in mexico approximately 20 25 of the borderland is considered to have poor aquifer potential and poor water quality from a general perspective the areas of the bolsons southeast of the hueco tularosa bolson aquifer in northern chihuahua and southwestern texas and between the serrania del burro and allende piedras negras aquifers in southern texas and northern coahuila where the quaternary and alluvium deposits are concentrated appear to be the most important for transboundary aquifer potential this is the first assessment of its kind in this region further research must incorporate new data to better define the physical characteristics of the hgu such as three dimensional distribution of hgu the extension of the main hydrogeological basics evidence of groundwater flow systems across the borderland distribution of hydraulic heads and chemical and isotopic composition of the residence times of groundwater this efforts will support the development of transboundary management regimes aimed at preventing the degradation of future water supplies in

8472,study region chihuahua coahuila nuevo leon and tamaulipas mexico texas usa study focus the objective of this study is to identify and classify the transboundary hydrogeological units shared between chihuahua coahuila nuevo leon and tamaulipas mexico and texas and assess their potential transboundary linkages new hydrological insights the transboundary groundwater resources between mexico and united states are largely uncharacterized due to lack of data differences in aquifer boundary delimitations and methodologies and limited cooperation and coordination among federal and local agencies within and between countries to address groundwater challenges from a binational perspective our results indicate that the transboundary hydrogeological units identified cover around 180 000 km2 110 000 km2 in texas and 72 000 km2 in mexico between 50 and 60 of this sharable area reports good aquifer potential and good water quality conditions some 20 25 is considered to have poor aquifer potential and water quality the areas of the bolsons southeast of the hueco tularosa bolson aquifer in northern chihuahua and southwestern texas and between the serrania del burro and allende piedras negras aquifers in southern texas and northern coahuila appear to be the most important for transboundary aquifer potential this study the first assessment of its kind in this region will support the development of transboundary management regimes aimed at preventing the degradation of future water supplies in the borderland between mexico and united states keywords transboundary aquifer hydrogeology northeastern mexico texas 1 introduction the most recent study on transboundary aquifers between mexico and the united states finds that there might be up to 36 of them sanchez et al 2016 fifteen potential transboundary aquifers have been reported between mexico and texas though recognized transboundary linkages are known only for five sanchez et al 2016 due to lack of data differences in aquifer boundary delimitations and methodologies and the limited cooperation and coordination among federal and local agencies within and between countries to address groundwater challenges from a binational perspective the transboundary groundwater resources shared by the two countries are largely uncharacterized the recent research on transboundary aquifers supported by the transboundary aquifer assessment program includes the san pedro and santa cruz aquifers between arizona and sonora the hueco bolson and mesilla bolson between texas new mexico and chihuahua and the yuma aquifer which is governed by minute 242 of the international boundary and water commission comisión nacional de límites y aguas ibwc cila apart from these the rest of the potential transboundary aquifers in this region remain unexplored the challenge of managing the transboundary aquifers between mexico and texas in terms of vulnerabilities and planning scenarios is greatly magnified by the number of unknowns including aquifer conditions and transboundary linkages rapid urbanization population growth and climate change predictions that envision a more drought prone border region require attention to groundwater resources as surface water has already reached its supply limit according to the world resources institute the rio grande basin is one of the most water stressed basins in the world maddocks and reig 2014 and it supplies close to 90 of all agriculture production in texas it is also the source of domestic supply for highly populated cities such as el paso laredo mcallen and san antonio in texas and ciudad juarez piedras negras nuevo laredo acuna and reynosa in mexico there are also small communities along the border between chihuahua and texas that rely completely on groundwater for domestic use the purpose of this study is to develop a methodology to identify and classify the transboundary aquifers between mexico and texas this new approach is designed to provide the first ever assessment of all the transboundary hydrogeological units shared between mexico and texas identified in this study as hgus it is divided into two phases first to assess the surficial correlation of geological units to identify hydrogeological connectivity and preliminary aquifer identification and to develop a classification of geological units based on hydrogeological parameters and water quality to identify those transboundary units with aquifer potential results will identify and visualize the highest priority regions based on the previous classification this study releases important results overall the hgus identified cover around 180 000 km2 approximately 110 000 km2 on the texas side and 72 000 km2 on the mexico side the total area considered to have good aquifer potential as well as good water quality ranges between 50 and 60 of which 60 is in texas and the rest in mexico some 20 25 of the shared land is considered to have poor aquifer conditions and low water quality with similar area on the two sides of the border this study should be read in light of its intrinsic limitations and research boundaries first the geological correlation is based primarily on surficial geology using structural geology and well depths to define vertical extent and thus limiting the correlation to the outcrop portions of the formations this approach was used to efficiently visualize the geological correlation in two dimensions a second limitation has to do with the certainty of the reported data in some areas some of the reports from conagua on the geological formations at the border with chihuahua close to big bend national park are limited in terms of data reliability suggesting the need for more research to confirm their assumptions the classification of these units should be taken as a preliminary estimate the same caution applies to formations that have been reported on only one side of the border assuming limited connectivity to the other side in terms of water quality data some reports are rather general and do not specify the location of the water being tested if such formations cover a significant area their water quality values might be over or underestimated in addition some reports contradict each other in those cases the hgu has been identified with two categories at the same time again adding uncertainty in terms of water quality to the whole unit this paper has two main parts the first part addresses geological correlations between texas and mexico and describes the lithological and hydrological features of each identified formation followed by the delineation of boundary and transboundary units and their corresponding boundaries the second part addresses the classification of transboundary hydrogeological units formations based on hydrogeological characteristics and water quality and a preliminary identification of priority areas based on their aquifer potential 2 methodology 2 1 geological correlation commonly in hydrogeology the boundaries of an aquifer are defined by lithology changes mexico and texas use different methods to define aquifer boundaries texas uses geologic formations and mexico uses a combination of hydrogeologic and administrative boundaries sanchez et al 2016 a unified geologic correlation process was developed to identify those units that actually cross the boundary as a sign of potential transboundary aquifers this geological correlation is limited to surficial and structural geology as geological maps are representative of surficial geological formations vertical analysis based on profiles and well lithological descriptions is used to identify the outcropping limits of the geological boundaries of the formations to perform the geological correlation a review of all available hydrogeological data on geological units between texas and mexico was performed along with an extensive visualization and analysis of geographical information using arcgis 10 3 software geological data for mexico were downloaded from the federal agency servicio geologico mexicano sgm servicio geológico mexicano 2016 as geologic maps in shapefile format at 1 250000 scale this scale was selected due to its availability in data on both sides of the border for the texas side geological data were obtained from the usgs united states geological service using the texas geologic map data website which covers the entire state u s geological survey 2016a to address the problems related to differences of geological equivalence across the border correlation maps with common geological units were available and complemented those regions for which information was limited preliminary geologic map of laredo crystal city eagle pass san antonio and del rio 1 x 2 quadrangles texas and nuevo laredo ciudad acuna piedras negras and nueva rosita 1 x 2 quadrangles mexico page et al 2009 where no geologic maps spanned the two countries it was necessary

mexicano 2002 servicio geológico mexicano 2003a b servicio geológico mexicano 2008a b c d f in case of uncertainty or lack of information of the geological name assigned in either country the stratigraphic lexicons from both countries were reviewed geologic description age thickness stratigraphic position and correlations were used to determine the corresponding geological formation the formation identification process also provided the preliminary data to identify the type and quality of the aquifers that could be considered transboundary and those with limited or poor aquifer potential after the geological correlation process a geological structural analysis vertical geology was developed from the geologic map profiles and well lithology descriptions to delineate the formations boundaries this process was necessary because even if there is physical continuity of a geological unit it can be truncated by folds or faults faulting can improve the permeability of the rock or it can generate secondary porosity in rocks initially considered aquitards rocks blocking groundwater flow 2 2 classification of hydrogeological units hgus the second objective was the classification of geological units based on the hydrogeological correlation hydrological features and water quality this classification is based on previous categorization by conagua 2006 edited to fit the objectives of this research conagua 2006 proposes an aquifer classification based on geological characteristics such as porosity and permeability of the lithological features of outcropping units aquifer potential and the water quality in those geological units the categories are unit i poor to very poor aquifer potential and very poor groundwater quality unit ii moderate aquifer potential and good to moderate water quality unit iii geologic units that work as aquitards with poor aquifer potential and very poor water quality unit iv moderate to poor aquifer potential and very poor water quality unit v moderate aquifer potential and good water quality unit vi poor to very poor aquifer potential and moderate to poor water quality and unit vii aquitards with poor to very poor water quality it is important to clarify that conagua 2006 report in which this classification was used applied only to the geologic units in north tamaulipas mexico this research uses similar criteria to identify the lithological and hydrogeological potential of those units aquifers that cross the border between texas and mexico with minor adjustments for the objectives of this research for this research aquifer potential is defined as the potential that a formation a group of formations or a part of a formation contains sufficient saturated permeable material to yield significant quantities of water for wells and springs u s geological survey 2016b the criteria used to define aquifer potential include lithological features permeability porosity hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity and water yield when available considering the complexity and heterogeneity of the units as well as the differences in methods used to characterize units on the two sides of the border a combination of criteria were used to classify aquifer potential as good moderate or poor geological and lithological descriptions of the units porosity and hydraulic conductivity when available or standardized values according to the predominant lithology hiscock 2005 permeability reports and assessments and water yield data from conagua 2006 and technical reports from the texas water development board twdb data were collected from federal state and local agencies as well as from technical and scientific reports private industry reports non public reports and field assessments the common criterion for water quality was tds total dissolved solids which was available for most of the border region this research uses the tds ranges of the texas water development board twdb 2017 to classify groundwater quality freshwater less than 1000 mg l slightly saline called brackish water in many studies 1000 3000 mg l moderately saline 3000 10 000 mg l very saline 10 000 35 000 mg l and brine over 35 000 mg l some reports refer to parts per million ppm where 1 ppm is equivalent to 1 mg l ppm is the term used in this report as well table 1 shows our classification of formations according to aquifer potential and corresponding water quality this classification is then visualized and analyzed using gis tools to identify delineate and propose aquifer boundaries from a hydrogeological perspective names of the aquifers were assigned according to the literature from either the u s or the mexico side for those formations identified as good potential aquifers according to the classification but whose aquifer has not been named we maintain the same formation name on both sides and refer to them as hydrogeological units or hgus given the lithological differences among them 3 results and discussions 3 1 geological correlation between mexico and texas this section includes the geological features of the formations identified and correlated between mexico and texas they are included and described in detail in table 2 geological formations in table 2 are listed according to the age of the geological unit oldest first and in case they have different names on both sides this study reports first the name according to mexico then for texas table 2 also includes hydrological features available as well as the name of those units that have been recognized as aquifers according to the literature there are formations that have been reported on only one side of the border not crossing the boundary those formations are identified with a parenthetical usa or mex the border and transboundary formations are highlighted in bold in the figures figs 1 5 list all the geological formations with their corresponding names reported on both sides mex texas even if they are the same but this section considers only the correlation of formations located on the border listed in bold in the figures other units in the same country or not near the border are not considered 3 2 geological formation limits the formations in the borderland defining their geologic limits on both sides are presented in figs 6 8 these figures represent the next level of refinement of identification of borderland formations with their corresponding physical delimitations there are formations that have only been identified on one side of the border examples in figs 6 7 and 8 are qt to tertiary clay and mud usa cox sandstone usa javelina fm usa neogene conglomerate mex rhyolitic tuff mex andesitic porphyry mex devils river limestone usa uvalde gravel usa lissie fm usa and catahoula vicksburg fm undivided usa though these formations seem to appear only on one side of the borderland they could be continuous into mexico indeed the uvalde gravel has been proven to be continuous with the quaternary alluvial on the mexico side forming the allende piedras negras transboundary aquifer according to some technical studies boghici 2002 lack of data on these formations prevents further conclusions and therefore this study will consider them as boundary formations with reservations on their transboundary linkages pending further research the extension limits of the formations were defined according to structural geological limits faults folds and lineaments in fig 6 the formations show great variation in types and sizes and complex distribution along the border area the geological extensions in this area were defined mainly by geological limits and small faults u s geological survey 2007 servicio geológico mexicano 2016 the geological limits of the western side of the state of texas are based on a combination of geological and political boundaries with the state of new mexico the entire mesilla bolson is mapped and considered in the analysis of this research even though only a small portion of the aquifer lies in texas geologically speaking the northern limits of the hueco bolson in the state of new mexico also include the tularosa basin but the northern part is not fully mapped so it is not considered in this study according to the literature the hueco bolson and the tularosa basin are hydrogeologically connected in the subsurface but there is a topographical feature that divides the two basins sanchez et al 2016 sheng et al 2001 therefore considering the reasonable previous research on this aquifer this study considers the official extension of the hueco bolson to not include the tularosa basin following reports by twdb george et al 2011 and isarm international groundwater resources assessment centre igrac 2015 however for mapping purposes hueco bolson and tularosa basin will be presented as hueco tularosa basin the geological limits of the red light draw bolson fig 9 are defined by the quitman mountains in texas and the sierra el trozado in mexico in the case of green river valley bolson it is possible to extend the hgu across the border into mexico by following the tertiary and quaternary deposits groat 1972 and gabaldón 1991 also report the extension of the presidio and redford bolsons across the rio grande up to sierra de ventana chihuahua in mexico where the limits are defined by cretaceous and igneous rocks fig 7 represents mostly the geological limits of the edwards aquifer and adjacent formations the north and the west sides are limited by the extent of the geological formation the east side is limited by the balcones fault and the south on the mexico side by the boquillas sabinas lineament padilla 2007 fig 8 shows the boundaries of the eastern part of the region the east side of the formations is limited by the coast the south side limits in mexico are defined mainly by the sierra mojada china lineament padilla 2007 and small faults and folds servicio geológico mexicano 2016 and the northern limits are defined primarily by the chittim anticline on the east side of edwards aquifer alexander 2015 and san marcos arch baker 1995 at the northern limit of the gulf coast aquifer there are formations that act as extent limits of the boundary formations those units that do not seem to cross the borderland or that occur as igneous inclusions within surrounding or adjacent to the boundary formations analysis of these formations was not included in the current study but are included in the figures for mapping and visualization purposes they are also listed in the corresponding legends of the figures not highlighted in bold 3 3 classification of geological formations aquifers given the geological description and hydrogeological features described in section 3 1 and table 2 boundary and transboundary formations were classified according to their aquifer potential and water quality parameters as described in section 2 2 the classification shown in table 3 is based on the predominant conditions of the formations according to available data aquifer names are given based on the literature either from the texas or the mexico side except in the case of the cretaceous terlingua aquifer which is formed by a section of the santa elena fm santa elena limestone a section of pen fm aguja fm and javelina usa identified only as cretaceous strata by fallin 1990 in contrast with other similar formations this aquifer shows aquifer potential therefore for the purpose of this study and considering its location it has been identified as the cretaceous terlingua aquifer those formations that have been identified as having good aquifer potential according to the classification but have not been given an aquifer identification name maintain the same formation name on both sides and are referred to as hydrogeological units or hgus given the lithological differences among them considering the uncertainty of the continuity of the boundary formations those formations that have been reported only one side of the border and the randomness of their appearance in the border region with apparent discontinuity in the other side for example the tertiary basalts fig 6 this classification includes both boundary and transboundary formations pending further research to identify and characterize geographically the areas of transboundary groundwater between texas and mexico the ids from table 3 are classified into groups with similar characteristics table 4 shows the grouping five groups were created to identify those geographic areas containing transboundary groundwater with good and moderate potential and differentiate them from those areas with poor potential and water quality group 1 dark green the most important units formations in terms of groundwater potential and water quality corresponds to the a1 a2 b1 and b2 classifications group 2 light green includes those units formations that have good to moderate aquifer potential but poor water quality or with limited water quality information on that area a3 a4 b3 and b4 group 2 constitutes a second level of priority representing possible future resource development as desalination projects given the good aquifer potential of those units group 3 orange includes those units with poor aquifer potential or aquitards with good to moderate water quality this group may be considered a third level of priority given the limited potential of the aquifer but still exploitable at the local level for domestic supply in small communities because of good to moderate water quality c1 c3 d1 and d2 group 4 light maroon is the lowest priority group units formations with poor aquifer potential and with poor water quality or limited information on water quality in that area c3 c4 d3 and d4 group 5 gray includes those units formations with limited information on both aquifer potential and water quality their priority is undefined given the lack of data e1 e2 e3 and e4 figs 12 13 and 14 show the hgus colored by group further details are given in section 3 4 2 interesting findings are shown in table 3 from the total of 53 boundary and transboundary formations accounting for differences of geological sections or sub units within the formation which add a total of 64 15 formations sub units are considered to have good to middle aquifer potential with good to moderate water quality and 4 formations have good aquifer potential but limited information on water quality upper west nueces fm santa elena fm santa elena limestone austin fm austin chalk and ojinaga fm it is fair to say that approximately 35 of the identified geological units have good aquifer potential with at least 28 of good to moderate water quality conditions the predominant formations under this classification are the edwards fm upper salmon peak and aurora fm glen rose fm all parts of the edwards aquifer likewise good aquifer conditions are also prominent in the quaternary alluvium deposits of santa fe del pino the serrania de burro and presa la amistad aquifers and the quaternary and conglomerate deposits of the bolsons of valle de juarez mesilla red light draw green river valley presidio and redford the carrizo fm carrizo sand part of the carrizo wilcox aquifer is also in this category moderate aquifer conditions but with less than 1000 ppm tds were found in oakville lagarto fm flemming fm reynosa fm goliad fm and wilcox fm indio fm on the other hand an estimated 17 formations 32 have been identified as poor aquifers or aquitards with poor to moderate water quality the predominant formations in this category are the yegua fm part of the yegua jackson aquifer santa elena fm santa elena limestone part of the cretaceous terlingua aquifer upson fm upson clay aguja fm escondido fm midway fm kincaid fm bigford fm palma real guayabal fm laredo fm frio fm and the lower catahoula formation both parts of the catahoula confining system and the beaumont fm part of the gulf coast aquifer the rest of the formations and sub units 5 are considered aquitards with no data on water quality or aquitards with good to moderate water quality 3 and there are 6 boundary and transboundary formations that have no reported data on either aquifer conditions or water quality san carlos fm san carlos sandstone chisos fm usa cox sandstone usa la pena fm yucca fm picacho fm and benevides fm caution should be taken in estimates of percentages considering that these are based on type of formation and not on geographical extent from a general perspective the area of the bolsons southeast of the valle de juarez hueco tularosa bolson aquifer in the north of chihuahua and southwestern texas and between the serrania del burro and allende piedras negras aquifers in south texas and north of coahuila where the quaternary and alluvium deposits are concentrated appear to be the most important areas for transboundary aquifer potential section 3 4 1 describes those transboundary formations in more detail 3 4 classification of transboundary hydrogeological units hgus 3 4 1 transboundary hydrogeological units hgus in order to assess the classification of transboundary hydrogeological units it was necessary to group the transboundary geological formations into hydrogeological units aquifers figs 9 11 show the transboundary geological formations grouped into hydrogeological units the clustering of formations is based on the geological and lithological description of the units in section 3 and in the literature cited mainly in table 2 these maps represent a more refined identification of transboundary geological formations considering hydrogeological linkages and boundary limitations they are referred to as hydrogeological units or hgus instead of aquifers because of the different hydrogeological conditions among formations that may or may not be categorized as an aquifer fig 9 shows the region including the population centers of el paso ciudad juarez and presidio ojinaga twelve hgus are identified and delineated starting from the west the conejos medanos mesilla bolson and valle de juarez hueco tularosa bolson aquifers are the most studied aquifers in the region and officially recognized as transboundary aquifers by both countries sheng et al 2001 and therefore hydrogeological conditions and boundaries have been addressed according to the literature these aquifers are formed by quaternary alluvium and quaternary conglomerates on both sides of the border quaternary clay and mud on the texas side and neogene conglomerate in the hueco tularosa bolson on the mexico side it is important to clarify that the areal extension of these aquifers crosses into new mexico where the geological formation is recognized as the santa fe group which is equivalent to quaternary clay and mud in the hueco tularosa bolson and quaternary eolic in the mesilla bolson moving east there are multiple formations with different hydrogeological properties these formations are continuous across the border therefore have been grouped instead of divided into the quitman mountains hgu this hgu groups a series of small formations with limited aquifer potential except for aurora fm glen rose fm and ojinaga fm that act primarily as a boundary between the neighboring bolsons beach 2008 groat 1972 the next hgu identified is the red light draw bolson which is composed of the same geological features as the valle de juarez hueco tularosa bolson likewise the next group of formations the eagle mountains hgu has very limited aquifer potential and acts as a boundary of the adjacent bolson similar to the quitman mountains hgu the eagle mountains hgu has limited aquifer potential and acts as a hydrogeological boundary between adjacent hgus is formed by portions of the same formations identified in the quitman mountains except for the buda del rio fm buda limestone del rio clay and the ojinaga fm beach 2008 from west to east the next three hgus the green river valley bolson the presidio bolson and the redford bolson are formed by the same formations as the previous bolsons and are considered to have good aquifer potential but more research is needed to confirm both aquifer capabilities and transboundary linkages gabaldón 1991 east of the redford bolson the hgu designated as tertiary igneous rocks is an aquifer of limited potential because of the igneous material prominent in this area the next formation to the east has been referred in this study as the cretaceous terlingua aquifer the literature refers to this area mainly as cretaceous strata fallin 1990 but because of the broad presence of formations of cretaceous age in the region and to geographically identify this particular formation which shows aquifer potential this study refers to this hgu as the cretaceous terlingua aquifer this aquifer includes four formations but only one pen fm is considered to have some aquifer potential the next group of transboundary formations located mostly in the big bend region maderas del carmen coahuila is referred to as the mariscal hgu after the mariscal mine in big bend national park it includes a variety of laterally discontinuous layers that cross the boundary at varying locations making their separation problematic this hgu act as a barrier to neighboring water bearing formations apart from a small section of the austin chalk fm and the quaternary conglomerate lenses present in this region the mariscal hgu does not have good aquifer potential east of the mariscal hgu is the boquillas fm which has no important aquifer potential finally in fig 10 there are two quaternary alluvium aquifers the santa fe del pino and the serrania de burro these names are from official reports on the mexican portion of the aquifer conagua 2015d 2015e in addition to quaternary alluvium the santa fe del pino is formed by quaternary conglomerates on both sides of the border and the serrania del burro is formed by quaternary clay and mud on the texas side though small both transboundary aquifers are characterized as having good aquifer potential conagua 2015d 2015e but more research is required fig 10 shows the transboundary hgu from fort stockton to piedras negras the largest hgu in this figure is the edwards aquifer one of the largest aquifers in the state of texas it supplies groundwater to the southcentral part of the state and extends into the northern and western parts of the state of coahuila this aquifer is composed of a variety of formations with mostly good aquifer potential except for the lower portions of the west nueces fm and the salmon peak fm which are considered to have poor aquifer potential and a portion of santa elena fm santa elena limestone which is considered to have moderate aquifer potential the rest of the formations in the edwards aquifer have good aquifer potential as well as good water quality boghici 2004 all of the identified formations have been reported on both sides of the border except for the devils river limestone usa considering the extension of the edwards aquifer which covers the largest area in the borderland there are geological features worth mentioning first the kiamichi fm outcrops as a linear feature at the southern limit of the edwards aquifer in coahuila creating an open circle around this region dark purple stratigraphically underlying the edwards aquifer likewise the austin fm austin chalk has also been identified as overlying a portion of the edwards aquifer adjacent to the border between texas and northeast coahuila acting as an upper confining unit of the system boghici 2004 as mentioned in section 3 some reports describe this formation having a good aquifer potential boghici 2002 but others classify it as an aquitard clark and small 1997 reeves and small 1973 the austin fm austin chalk is also present to the east of the buda del rio fm buda limestone del rio clay which is the next hgu to the east the buda del rio fm buda limestone del rio clay is continuous across the border into texas underlying the uvalde gravel and outcropping as small islands inside and to the north of the presa la amistad aquifer this formation and the eagle ford fm eagle ford group have poor aquifer potential boghici 2002 the next identified hgu is the presa la amistad aquifer named from mexico s official reports conagua 2015a b c d e f g h this hgu is formed by quaternary alluvium on both sides of the border and the uvalde gravel usa on the texas side it is reported to have good aquifer potential as well as good water quality conagua 2015a b c d e f g h it is worth mentioning the presa la amistad aquifer underlines the region where the international amistad dam is located and according to official reports from conagua 2015c there is groundwater flow from the aquifer to amistad reservoir dam hydrogeological information for this region is limited on both sides of the border therefore more research is required to confirm surface and groundwater interactions from this aquifer east of the presa la amistad aquifer is the allende piedras negras aquifer though it has not been recognized officially as a transboundary aquifer technical studies are available that report transboundary linkages in this aquifer boghici 2002 this aquifer is formed by quaternary alluvium and quaternary conglomerates on both sides of the border and the uvalde gravel usa on the texas side fig 11 shows the hgus moving east towards the coast starting from a small outcrop section of the upson fm upson clay which appears as blue points in the middle of the san miguel fm on the mexico side of the border with several points east of the allende piedras negras aquifer on texas side next are the escondido fm olmos fm and midway fm kincaid fm which act as aquitards or have poor aquifer potential and poor water quality saline brackish the next hgu to the east is the carrizo wilcox aquifer which is formed by the carrizo fm carrizo sand and the wilcox fm indio fm there is a reasonable amount of data on this aquifer from both sides of the border that agree that aquifer potential is good to moderate and water quality is fresh to slightly saline depending on location klemt et al 1976 ashworth and hopkins 1995 boghici 2002 east of the carrizo wilcox aquifer the three hgus bigford fm el pico clay fm and palma real guayabal fm laredo fm and the yegua fm which is part of the yegua jackson aquifer are reported to have aquifer characteristics similar to the escondido and olmos formations boghici 2002 conagua 2006 the remaining portion of the yegua jackson aquifer jackson fm jackson group is reported to have moderate aquifer potential but poor water quality boghici 2002 conagua 2006 between the yegua jackson aquifer and the gulf coast aquifer referred to in mexico as the bajo rio bravo aquifer lies the catahoula confining system none of the formations that are part of this confining system are reported to have good aquifer potential or water quality ashworth and hopkins 1995 twdb 2017 the upper catahoula portion of the catahoula fm is part of the gulf coast aquifer and is reported to have moderate aquifer potential and brackish water ashworth and hopkins 1995 twdb 2017 all formations the gulf coast aquifer have good aquifer potential and good water quality except for the beaumont fm twdb 2017 which is adjacent to the quaternary lacustrine in the vicinity of the state of tamaulipas the transboundary portion of this aquifer seems to rely on the quaternary alluvium located along the rio grande conagua 2015h details of the potential transboundary portions of the hgu are addressed in the next section 3 4 2 classification of transboundary hgus by group figs 12 14 map the hgus colored by category group id table 4 fig 12 shows the western region of texas bordering the state of chihuahua the most important aquifers in the region are the hgus designated as bolsons which are classified as good production potential aquifers however except for the urban centers in the region including the cities of presidio and ojinaga and small towns that use groundwater for irrigation and livestock on both sides of the border guadalupe in chihuahua and sierra blanca valentina and van horn in texas not much research or groundwater development is reported in this region given the limited surface water availability in this border area there is a high dependency on groundwater which has had impacts on the sensitive ecosystem in some areas of the chihuahua desert sanchez et al 2016 moreover there seems to be interest in developing groundwater storage in the igneous portion of the western bolsons for the future water needs of the city of el paso sanchez et al 2016 more research and data collection on aquifer properties and water quality on both sides of the border in this region is of high priority for both countries the big bend region does not represent an important source of groundwater development given the complexity and limited continuity of the formations that surround the transboundary area some classified as good aquifers and others as aquitards the fact that this region is a national park and a protected area on the mexican side maderas del carmen makes significant groundwater development in the region unlikely however two small quaternary alluvium transboundary aquifers santa fe del pino and serrania del burro have been identified on the eastern side of the big bend area which should be noted for future research and water needs in the area generally 60 65 of the land in this area is estimated to have good aquifer potential and good water quality fig 13 predominantly shows the edwards aquifer and adjacent hgus according to the classification system table 4 80 85 of the edwards aquifer hgu is classified as having good to moderate aquifer potential with both good and poor water quality areas exceptions are a portion of the border region between texas and coahuila north of the austin chalk and a small portion in the western extent of the aquifer given the generally good aquifer potential of the edwards aquifer which extends almost to the center of the state of coahuila the edwards aquifer in coahuila is considered of high priority for future research the mexican side of the aquifer is considered an ecological priority for the state of coahuila because it includes the serrania del burro mountains which serves as the headwaters of all perennial rivers in the state these rivers provide water for the cities of ocampo muzquiz and cuatrocienegas in the five springs region region de los cinco manantiales cuatrocienegas is outside the limits of the edwards aquifer there is high dependency on the presa la amistad aquifer in the cities of del rio acuna bordering the edwards and on the allende piedras negras aquifer in the bordering cities of piedras negras eagle pass sanchez et al 2016 there are reports of high transmissivity along the border area as well as groundwater confinement that increases water yield in the area of the amistad aquifer close to acuna george et al 2011 other small communities in uvalde kinney edwards and val verde counties in texas also rely on groundwater from the edwards aquifer and a reverse hydraulic gradient has been reported north of uvalde city due to surface drainage variations and overpumping boghici 2002 continuing eastward from the area covered in figs 13 14 shows the classification of hgus from the allende piedras negras aquifer to the brb gulf coast aquifer within this area it can be seen that apart from the carrizo wilcox aquifer and sections of the gulf coast aquifer along the border which are considered to have good aquifer potential and good water quality on both sides of the border the rest of the region falls into the poor quality category for aquifer and water this region is known to have high salinity tds 1000 3000 mg l and is referred to as the bad water zone sanchez et al 2016 reliance on groundwater in this region is limited good aquifer potential associated with the gulf coast aquifer extends from texas across the border to the state of tamaulipas groundwater supply is reported to be significant in the border cities of mcallen reynosa and brownsville matamoros and the surrounding area extensive irrigation districts on both sides depend on groundwater for economic development in the texas counties of harris galveston fort bend jasper and wharton land subsidence has been reported in the gulf coast aquifer george et al 2011 and reverse groundwater flow because of over pumping has been reported around the cities of crystal city and cotulla further because of the location of the amistad and falcon international dams in this region as well as the groundwater surface interactions that contribute to the rio grande rio bravo river flow and its tributaries a portion of the groundwater on the mexico side is considered to be committed to fulfill mexico s water obligations with the united states under the 1944 water treaty for the utilization of waters of the colorado and tijuana rivers and of the rio grande adding pressure on groundwater resources in this region conagua 2015c based on the classification system table 4 it is estimated that around 30 35 of the borderland in this region has good aquifer potential overall the identified hgus in the borderland between texas and mexico cover around 180 000 km2 approximately 110 000 km2 on the texas side and 72 000 km2 on the mexico side it is worth mentioning that excluding the area of the edwards aquifer which has a large areal extent primarily on the texas side approximately 35 000 km2 the proportion of land on both sides of the border is similar between 50 and 60 of this area is considered to have good aquifer potential as well as good water quality of which approximately 60 is in texas and 40 in mexico approximately 20 25 of the borderland is considered to have poor aquifer conditions and poor water quality with approximately equal areas on both sides of the border 4 conclusions from the total of 53 boundary and transboundary formations identified between mexico and texas there are 15 formations sub units considered to have good to moderate aquifer potential and good to moderate water quality approximately 35 of the identified geological units have good aquifer potential and at least 28 good to moderate water quality the predominant formations classified as good to moderate are the edwards fm upper salmon peak and aurora fm glen rose fm part of the edwards aquifer the quaternary alluvium deposits of santa fe del pino the serrania de burro and presa la amistad aquifers and the quaternary and conglomerate deposits of the bolsons of valle de juarez mesilla red light draw green river valley presidio and redford the carrizo fm carrizo sand part of the carrizo wilcox aquifer is also in this category on the other hand an estimated 17 formations 32 have been identified as having poor aquifer potential or as aquitards with moderate to poor water quality the predominant formations in this category are the yegua fm part of the yegua jackson aquifer santa elena fm santa elena limestone upson fm upson clay aguja fm escondido fm midway fm kincaid fm bigford fm palma real guayabal fm laredo fm frio fm and the lower catahoula formation both parts of the catahoula confining system and the beaumont fm part of the gulf coast aquifer overall the area covered by the identified hgus in the borderland between texas and mexico is around 180 000 km2 approximately 110 000 km2 on the texas side and 72 000 km2 on the mexico side the total area considered to have good aquifer potential as well as good water quality ranges between 50 and 60 of which approximately 60 is in texas and 40 in mexico approximately 20 25 of the borderland is considered to have poor aquifer potential and poor water quality from a general perspective the areas of the bolsons southeast of the hueco tularosa bolson aquifer in northern chihuahua and southwestern texas and between the serrania del burro and allende piedras negras aquifers in southern texas and northern coahuila where the quaternary and alluvium deposits are concentrated appear to be the most important for transboundary aquifer potential this is the first assessment of its kind in this region further research must incorporate new data to better define the physical characteristics of the hgu such as three dimensional distribution of hgu the extension of the main hydrogeological basics evidence of groundwater flow systems across the borderland distribution of hydraulic heads and chemical and isotopic composition of the residence times of groundwater this efforts will support the development of transboundary management regimes aimed at preventing the degradation of future water supplies in

8473,study region asia study focus internationally shared aquifers transboundary aquifers tbas are recognised as an important water resource in asia despite their importance studies on the assessment of tba resources have received less attention in comparison to transboundary rivers a lack of expertise experience and institutional support has restricted the cooperative and sustainable management of the shared aquifer resources this study attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the status of transboundary groundwater resources in asia including the tba inventories socio economic implications and future perspectives specifically the study focuses on the progress of the assessment of tbas in asia as a result of the internationally shared aquifer resources management initiative isram new hydrological insights for the region in asia tbas have played a major role in providing freshwater resources and sustaining socio economic development since 2000 many regional cooperative initiatives have achieved considerable progress in developing tba inventories of asia but the level of understanding of the shared aquifer systems remains limited particularly for the developing countries legal and institutional frameworks for regional tba cooperation are vital and many countries in asia have come to recognise the need to cooperate with their neighbours in dealing with tba governance sustainable and equitable management of tba in asia requires an increasing effort from different sectors and countries in order to reach mutual acceptance of effective cooperation keywords transboundary aquifers tbas groundwater asia region isarm 1 introduction groundwater resources play an important role in sustaining water needs of asia groundwater is widely adopted for crop irrigation food production industry and domestic use in urban and rural communities accounting for about 25 of total water usage in asia fao 2016 the groundwater withdrawal amount in asia accounts for the majority 72 of global usage value caused by intensive agricultural activities and explosive population growth over the region including bangladesh china india iran and pakistan fao 2016 gleeson et al 2012 shah 2005 groundwater also provides a valuable base flow supplying water to rivers lakes and wetlands thus serving as an essential resource for maintaining various ecosystems that depend on it bernadez et al 1993 danielopol et al 2003 kløve et al 2014 wösten et al 2008 apart from its environmental function groundwater has significant socio economic implications for instance it was estimated that groundwater irrigation in asia contributes us 10 to us 30 billion per year to its economy shah et al 2003 wwap 2015 transboundary aquifers tbas like transboundary rivers serve as vital sources of water upon which large numbers of people rely throughout asia complex relationships occur between upstream recharge areas and downstream regions across international borders and the effective management of tbas is of particular importance for the region despite their significance tbas have received less attention from policy makers scientists and local communities due to their hidden diverse nature and the difficulty in conducting hydrological investigations across international borders consequently there are substantial gaps in the water policies or agreements to manage these tbas at international level given the significant contribution of tbas to global water resources their sustainable and equitable management should be undertaken based on international acceptance for effective cooperation among all relevant stakeholders in 2000 the unesco international hydrological programme ihp and the international association of hydrogeologists iah in collaboration with the food and agriculture organization fao and the united nations economic commission for europe unece implemented an interagency collaboration programme isarm internationally shared aquifer resource management aimed at improving the understanding of scientific socio economic legal institutional and environmental issues related to the management of tbas puri and aureli 2005 since then substantial multiagency efforts together with several regional initiatives have been made to develop tba inventories assess global tba systems and suggest legal and institutional frameworks in order to manage internationally shared groundwater resources in a sustainable manner puri et al 2001 puri and aureli 2005 unece 2000 2001 unesco 2004 2010a in asia regional collaboration initiatives have been implemented and considerable progress has been achieved in terms of the regional tba inventories understanding the status of groundwater resources and engagement of the relevant inter national communities for tba management unesco 2006 2010b twap 2014 zaisheng et al 2008 2013 the objectives of this paper are 1 to provide a comprehensive overview of the status and inventories of tba resources in asia and 2 to summarise the progress of tba management in asia focusing on hydrogeological and institutional achievements and future perspectives 2 status of tbas in asia 2 1 groundwater in asia asia is the largest continent in the world in terms of both area 43 5 million km2 and population 3 5 billion it borders the pacific ocean in the east arctic ocean in the north the indian ocean in the south and the mediterranean sea in the west respectively asia is notable for dense and large settlements including some of the most populous countries in the world such as china india indonesia pakistan bangladesh and japan un desa 2015 asia is also characterised by extremely diverse climate zones and geographic features climates range from arctic in siberia to tropical in southeast asia and southern india the monsoon circulation dominates across southeast asia south asia and the southeastern part of east asia while central asia western asia and the inland regions of east asia are in the arid zone precipitation also varies depending on the location and climate zone annual rainfall near the equator zones is more than 2000 mm year whereas many parts of southwest and central asia have precipitation rates of less than 150 mm year zaisheng et al 2013 there are several vast deserts in the inland regions of asia such as the gobi desert in mongolia and the arabian desert in the middle east with respect to geographical features the himalayas located between nepal and china is the tallest mountain range in the world some of the world s largest rivers are located in asia including the ganges and the brahmaputra india yangtze china yenisey lena ob amur russian federation and mekong south east asia fig 1 illustrates the hydrogeological mapping results from the china geological survey cgs on a 1 8 million scale cgs 2012 the occurrence of groundwater resources varies across asia sedimentary aquifers mainly composed of floodplain alluvial deposits are developed along large rivers such as the ganges yangtze and mekong these aquifers are generally thick with good storage space providing favourable conditions for groundwater development groundwater productivity yield from the sedimentary aquifers in west asia on the other hand is generally low and these aquifers have very limited groundwater recharge sources in the mountainous regions of central and northern asia groundwater generally occurs in complexes of joint hard rocks although there is little rainfall and strong evaporation in the inland arid areas of central asia the thawing of glaciers and snow in the high mountains is favourable to groundwater recharge unesco 2010b the carbonate rocks are widely distributed in southeast asia in southern china and in some parts of the indochina peninsula there is stratified limestone from the late paleozoic and mesozoic eras in which karst systems are considerably developed a lot of quaternary volcanic rock is extensively distributed on the circum pacific islands groundwater serves as an important source of freshwater supply in asia according to a statistical analysis on global water usage by fao fao 2016 total groundwater abstraction in asia accounts for approximately 72 6 1 1011 m3 year of global usage 8 5 1011 m3 year the results also show that eight out of ten countries with the largest groundwater extraction are located in asia india china nepal bangladesh and pakistan alone account for nearly half of world s total groundwater use mostly associated with a huge population and intensive agricultural activities many countries in western and central asia mainly rely on groundwater for water supply in bangladesh and mongolia about 80 of total water withdrawal comes from groundwater several countries in western asia with no permanent rivers saudi arabia united arab emirates oman kuwait bahrain and qatar rely on groundwater for almost 100 of their renewable water source groundwater extraction has increased greatly in asia particularly since the 1970s global estimates on the sustainability of groundwater usage strongly indicate that current groundwater consumption for some regions in asia such as the upper ganges river basin or north china plain is likely to face serious aquifer depletion and water shortage problems gleeson et al 2012 for instance the groundwater extraction rate in china has increased from 57 109 m3 year in the 1970s to 111 109 m3 year in the 2000s causing many serious environmental issues such as groundwater depletion or land subsidence unesco 2006 in northern india satellite based estimates of groundwater storage change suggest that groundwater is being depleted over the area at a rate of approximately 17 7 4 5 km3 yr which is double the capacity of india s largest surface water reservoir rodell et al 2009 consequently without proper measures being taken to ensure sustainable groundwater usage over 100 million residents of the region may suffer a serious reduction in agricultural output and a shortage of potable water leading to extensive socio economic stress in thailand the increasingly heavy pumping of groundwater in bangkok between 1955 and 1982 caused a decline of 45 50 m in groundwater levels the lowering of water levels by these depths resulted in abandonment of old wells increased pumping costs and land subsidence problems gupta and babel 2005 phien wej et al 2006 vietnam has also suffered from serious groundwater depletion caused by the unsustainable consumption of groundwater for irrigation and other anthropogenic use erban et al 2014 in terms of groundwater quality a high arsenic content is easily observed in many regions of asia in bangladesh and the neighbouring indian states of western bengal a high level of arsenic in the groundwater used for drinking has become a massive public health issue brikowski et al 2014 nickson et al 1998 previous research suggests that about 35 million people in these areas are at risk of being exposed to arsenic poisoning through drinking groundwater chowdhury et al 1999 hasan et al 2009 harvey 2008 radloff et al 2011 shukla et al 2010 in china groundwater with a high arsenic level was found in inner mongolia and other areas rodríguez lado et al 2013 in southeast asia groundwater contamination by arsenic was observed mostly in the alluvial aquifers along major rivers such as the mekong delta in the southern part of vietnam and cambodia erban et al 2013 fendorf et al 2010 with an increase in economic activity groundwater quality deterioration frequently occurs in asia as a result of industrial agricultural and subsistence pollution singh et al 1995 hosono et al 2011 taniguchi et al 2008 2 2 inventory of tbas in asia an updated inventory of global tbas identified 129 shared aquifers in asia igrac 2015 the total area of tbas in asia measures approximately 9 million km2 covering about 20 of the entire region according to the global tba inventory a total of 38 countries in asia are identified as having internationally shared aquifer basins in terms of tba numbers most tba basins in central asia are shared with neighbouring countries uzbekistan shares the most tba basins total number 31 followed by china 21 russia 21 tajikistan 15 kyrgyzstan 14 kazakhstan 14 mongolia 14 azerbaijan 13 and iran 10 fig 2 illustrates the location of major tbas area 10 000 km2 together with their international codes in terms of single tbas the iryhsh obsky aquifer basin as150 between russia and kazakhstan is the largest 1 368 000 km2 followed by as141 umm er radhuma damman aquifer south between the united arab emirates and yemen as131 wajid aquifer system between saudi arabia and yemen as36 syr darya aquifer between kazakhstan and uzbekistan and as79 south of the outer himalayas aquifer between india and nepal the major aquifer lithology of the tba is composed of porous layers or a combination of porous and fissured sedimentary rocks which are associated with relatively high groundwater productivity of these geologic units table 1 presents a list of the major tbas in asia requiring attention in terms of a reduction in available groundwater resources in table 1 tbas are selected with an aquifer stress index aqsi defined as groundwater exploitation rate divided by aquifer recharge greater than 50 0 5 or aquifers where notable rates of groundwater level decrease were reported igrac 2015 twap 2014 wada and heinrich 2013 some important tbas in the region might not be included in the list mainly due to the lack of available data despite this lack it is apparent that groundwater is aggressively exploited in many parts of the tbas leading to increased aquifer vulnerability and unsustainable aquifer management conditions gleeson et al 2012 and wada and heinrich 2013 reported that over the indus river plan as78 in table 1 the groundwater extraction rate from the tba exceeded its natural replenishment significantly implying that current groundwater consumption cannot be maintained sustainably due to the rapid expansion of human activities groundwater resources from the tbas in western asia as125 131 140 143 etc are also vastly over exploited the aqsi for these aquifers has increased more than 250 over the last 50 years wada and heinrich 2013 for example in the saq ram aquifer system as126 between saudi arabia and jordan the groundwater extraction rate has dramatically increased since 1980 in order to support wheat production and the domestic water supply resulting in a reversal of the groundwater flow field between the two countries several tbas in central asia as11 77 80 etc have also experienced similar problems in southeast asia the increasing abstraction of groundwater in the mekong delta as89 region has resulted in continuous depletion of groundwater resources and related environmental issues such as land subsidence ho chi minh city suffered the greatest land subsidence in the delta region 4 cm yr erban et al 2014 the groundwater quality of tbas in asia showed varying characteristics depending on climate geological medium and human activities the regional tba survey carried out by twap transboundary water assessment programme identified that among 25 tbas in south southeast and east asia almost 50 of the region s tbas are suitable for human consumption twap 2014 some tbas on the other hand showed serious groundwater quality problems in the indus river plain aquifer as78 it was estimated that about 80 of the aquifer area within the pakistan territory is unsuitable for human consumption as a result of elevated amounts of natural salinity as well as high levels of fluoride and arsenic several tbas in western asia as125 128 130 141 etc also do not satisfy water drinking standards mainly due to the natural salinity and continuous deterioration of groundwater quality by human activity in the case of the mekong delta aquifer on the vietnam side as89 intensive groundwater extraction for agricultural activities has led to seawater intrusion into the aquifer elevated nitrate concentration caused by excessive use of fertilisers is another rising issue for groundwater quality management of the tbas twap 2014 unesco 2010b 3 socio economic implication of tbas groundwater plays a significant role in socio economic development and provides numerous benefits including drinking water supply mitigation of natural disasters increased food production job creation and livelihood enhancement these benefits are closely linked to the inherent characteristics of groundwater as a resource for instance the high buffering capacities of aquifers against climate variations help to stabilise the water supply for human consumption or agricultural activities during peak drought seasons the almost ubiquitous availability of groundwater makes it easy to access and provides a valuable source of drinking water in some regions a significant proportion of the economy is attributed to tourism such as groundwater springs which generate revenue for local business and create jobs wwap 2016 the social and economic benefits of groundwater are of particular importance to the agricultural activities of asia agriculture is the key to general economic development especially in many asian developing countries global estimates suggest that irrigated agriculture accounts for approximately 79 of the total water withdrawals in asia which is higher than the global average of 70 fao 2016 wwap 2016 groundwater has served as an important source of irrigation for asia contributing towards food security and alleviating poverty in the region about 38 of the total irrigated area in asia is estimated to rely on groundwater resources for water supply fao 2016 the considerable dependence of agricultural practices on groundwater is highly attributed to the increase in food productivity or lack of an available surface water resource particularly in central and western asia for example india with the explosive growth in population increasing by 190 between 1960 and 2015 the overall food production index of the nation was boosted by approximately 330 datasource http data worldbank org groundwater is a critical component for achieving dramatic food production growth serving about 60 of the irrigated areas shah 2007 in pakistan groundwater is known to provide about 40 of the total water requirements for irrigation qureshi and barrett lennard 1998 water use for irrigation activity is also inextricably linked to job creation employment rates in the agricultural sector are 39 in south east asia and 44 5 in south and south west asia respectively ilo 2014 wwap 2016 in india it has been estimated that more than half of the total workforce remains in the agricultural sector chand and parappurathu 2012 some evidence suggests that a casual link between local gdp and groundwater abstraction exists in the major cities of asia consequently groundwater aids urban growth and its rapid economic development iges 2007 the role of tbas in asia cannot be separated from the social and socio economic development aspects despite a lack of proper estimation the simple combination of national population density data and areal extent of tbas suggests that more than 500 million people in asia reside in tba regions data source www un igrac org several agricultural systems of global importance are also located in shared aquifer basins such as the east ganges river plain aquifer as80 cambodia mekong river delta aquifer as89 etc in these basins groundwater has contributed significantly to growth in irrigated areas and agriculture productivity for most of the tbas in west asia region as125 131 140 141 143 groundwater is vastly exploited for domestic and agricultural use in china groundwater from the illi river basin aquifer as72 has sustained the socio economic development of the xinjiang province in china and regions with large populations in kazakhstan zaisheng et al 2008 however the intensive use of shared groundwater resources has led to simultaneous aquifer depletion and pollution in india s east ganges river plain basin the increased water demand associated with intensive cultivation such as rice wheat rotation has resulted in salinity water logging and groundwater depletion problems pingali and shah 2001 the over exploitation of groundwater in the tbas between lebanon and syria as4 has caused gradual decreases in the discharge of freshwater springs which have served as the main source of drinking water supply to the nearby city damascus for tbas between jordan and saudi arabia as129 a serious overdraft of fresh groundwater from the large commercial farms in the saudi part has reportedly led to an increase in groundwater salinity and now poses a long term negative impact on the groundwater quality in both the upstream saudi and the downstream jordanian of the tba igrac 2017 4 legal and institutional frameworks for tba management in asia given the significant role of tbas in linking hydrological social and economic sectors between neighbouring countries the issues relating to shared aquifer management should be dealt with by institutional and legal frameworks based on the mutual agreement of relevant stakeholders although the importance of tbas components of global water resource systems has been recognised recently the issues have been scarcely addressed in international water policy legislation and institutional instruments puri and aureli 2005 many countries do not have legal and institutional instruments to regulate the use of groundwater resources and only limited bilateral agreements exist for tba resources management consequently there are few legal instruments to address the specific characteristics of tbas and their sustainable management at global and international level similarly most countries in asia have also shown a substantial lack of water policies for dealing with internationally shared groundwater resources since the early 2000s numerous international efforts have been made to raise awareness in policy and decision makers regarding the significance of tbas and the need for a legal institutional framework to promote the sustainable use of shared aquifer resources in asia several regional initiatives have been launched for compiling a regional hydrogeological inventory and analysing legal institutional frameworks for tba management cooperation cgs 2012 he 2017 igrac 2015 twap 2014 unesco 2006 2010b zaisheng et al 2008 2013 the recent regional survey about legal institutional instruments for tba cooperation in asia has been addressed in selected literature escwa 2009 twap 2014 the results of this regional survey indicated that many tbas bordering china or mongolia are the subject of signed bilateral agreements although the scope of the issues covered varies in each case china in particular has endeavoured to cooperate internationally in shared water resource management by establishing tba institutes as well as creating mutual agreements with its neighbours most of these signed bilateral agreements however do not explicitly cover groundwater he 2017 and need to be ratified in west asia no formal agreements exist for most of the tbas with increased awareness towards water security and sustainability issues countries are beginning to recognise the importance of their tbas and the need to cooperate with their neighbours recently for example mutual negotiation has been initiated between jordan and saudi arabia for sustainable use of the saq ram aquifer system as126 straddling across the two countries escwa 2009 which is a significant milestone in the mekong region the mekong river commission provides a platform for tba cooperation although less attention has been paid to transboundary groundwater resources bach et al 2014 at national level there are institutions specialising in groundwater resources management including transboundary groundwater issues but the extent of the mandate and its capacity is uncertain for example in pakistan a national institute exists with a mandate and the capacity for tba management but the regulations on groundwater abstraction and quality management are quite limited igrac 2017 the stress on fresh water from climate change and anthropogenic activities is expected to increase the risk of freshwater security these challenges on water shortage and quality deterioration will likely exacerbate tensions between countries transboundary groundwater resources like transboundary rivers and lakes can have significant impacts on international relationships regional stability and economic development he 2017 therefore international cooperation for tba identification assessment and governance mechanisms is important to ensure the sustainability and security of future global water resources given the significant contribution of groundwater resources to the water supply and socio economic development of asia it is necessary to foster cooperation for tba management within the context of international groundwater governance and institutional support beyond national borders 5 case studies status and management of tbas in the greater mekong subregion gms 5 1 groundwater in gms the greater mekong subregion gms is an international zone of the mekong river basin in southeast asia the mekong river is the longest river in southeast asia the seventh longest in asia and the twelfth longest in the world bounded by the natural river basin the environment culture and livelihood of the gms countries cambodia lao pdr myanmar thailand and vietnam are closely linked to each other groundwater resources in the gms have been regarded as increasingly important providing water for drinking irrigation and industry as well as supporting natural river water flows and relevant ecosystems eastham et al 2008 landon 2011 the climate of gms shows strong spatial and temporal variations in general both temperature and precipitation tend to increase from north to south the entire basin is under the influence of the southwest monsoon with distinct wet and dry seasons the rainfall is not uniformly distributed about 80 of the total precipitation is concentrated during the wet season heavy rains mainly occur in the mid period of the wet season occasionally leading to severe flooding mrc 2005 2010 water scarcity during the dry season can be acute in parts of the basin eastham et al 2008 most of the flow in the mekong river system is derived from the surface runoff of precipitation followed by groundwater base flow and snowmelt an overview of the hydrogeological setting of the gms has been presented in several previous studies charuratna and phu 1992 cgs 2012 johnson 1986 landon 2011 workman 1970 the upper part of the river basin in china is characterised by the fissured rocks or karst aquifer whereas the delta region mekong delta is extensively covered by unconsolidated alluvial sediments extending from the coast to the northwest in cambodia including the tonle sap lake fig 3 in the delta region the thickness of the alluvial sediment is large and these units are characterised as the primary aquifer along the central part of the basin consolidated rock units basalt limestone fissured sandstone etc serve as localised aquifers with high potential groundwater yield landon 2011 unesco 2010b in the lower basin of the mekong river groundwater provides water for approximately 60 million people mrc 2010 frequent water shortage problems in this area are normally managed by increasing the supply from groundwater resources particularly during the dry season for this reason tbas in the gms receives increased attention from national stakeholders and international communities 5 2 tbas distribution in gms several important tbas straddle along the gms area including the cambodia mekong river delta aquifer as89 khorat plateau aquifer as90 and lower mekong river 2 aquifer as91 etc fig 4 illustrates the locations of tbas in the gms igrac 2015 details of major tbas in the regions are described in the following section 5 2 1 cambodia mekong river delta aquifer as89 the aquifer is shared by cambodia and vietnam extending from dan bian mountain in cambodia to mekong river the whole area is approximately 200 000 km2 and about 63 of the tbas lie within the cambodian territory tonle sap the largest lake in the indochina peninsular is hydraulically connected to the mekong river and serves as a natural regulating reservoir burnett et al 2017 kummu et al 2014 masumoto et al 2008 the annual precipitation is between 1400 and 2200 mm year with a subtropical climate pattern situated in the delta region the tba shows the typical characteristics of an alluvial aquifer the aquifer consists of quaternary sediment with a varying depth up to 800 m the lithology of the aquifer in the delta region is divided into eight alluvial units multi layered separated by interbedded clay units fig 5 each alluvial unit is deposited during different geological times from miocene to holocene although groundwater is abstracted from all aquifers the upper middle pleistocene and middle pliocene aquifers are considered to be the two primary groundwater production aquifers vuong et al 2016 the groundwater resources in this tba have a considerable impact on human livelihoods and socio economic development in major cities such as phnom penh and some other cities in vietnam groundwater is utilised for urban water supply in vietnam rice production from the delta regions makes a substantial contribution to the national gdp including half of vietnam s rice production and more than 80 of rice exports unesco 2010b in cambodia the agriculture sector accounts for half of the gdp and employs 80 85 of the labour force for these reasons the aquifers are heavily exploited for irrigation and water supply the annual groundwater extraction rate throughout the tba is estimated to be about 800 900 million m3 year vuong et al 2016 igrac 2017 due to the rapidly increasing population and fast economic development the demand for water resources has also rapidly increased leading to the over exploitation of groundwater the resulting groundwater reduction and quality deterioration are the main problems threatening future water security erban and gorelick 2016 groundwater levels have significantly declined particularly in the delta area monitored groundwater levels indicate a significant drop in water level over 20 m since the 1990s in many parts of the delta the observed decreasing levels of groundwater range from 10 to 80 cm yr vuong et al 2016 increased groundwater salinity has also significantly affected freshwater supply capacity according to the study by vuong et al 2016 the distribution of saline groundwater in the aquifers covers 62 84 of total area posing an immediate threat to the water supply due to the low geographical topography sea level rises and increased groundwater consumption the aquifers in the delta are increasingly vulnerable to seawater intrusion besides seawater intrusion salty groundwater in the delta is likely to be influenced by multiple causes including old seawater trapped during the deposition of sediments dissolution of aquifer materials and re circulation of irrigation water khoi et al 2002 larsen et al 2017 renaud et al 2015 another quality issue for tbas is the occurrence of arsenic contaminated groundwater and water pollution by increased anthropogenic activities in cambodia around 20 of aquifers are not suitable for human consumption mainly associated with elevated levels of arsenic igrac 2017 some anthropogenic groundwater pollution by households and agricultural practices has been identified causing the deterioration of shallow aquifers chamroeun and sokuntheara 2016 one of the major issues in terms of tba management in this area is the limited institutional framework for the co investigation of tbas and inconsistent hydrological database between the two countries in vietnam at least eight alluvium aquifers were distinguished on the basis of depositional sequences vuong et al 2016 whereas the lithology in cambodia involves a simpler division young alluvium and old sediment deposits chamroeun and sokuntheara 2016 the inconsistent database and different levels of understanding of the tba system have restricted the strategic planning of cooperative groundwater resources management furthermore different groundwater management policies between cambodia and vietnam increase the difficulty in reaching a bilateral agreement for sustainable tba development the cooperative management of this tba system is of particular importance because the mekong delta and its surrounding area are considered as a region with high economic dependence on water resources low levels of socio economic development and high exposure to climate related risks floods and droughts for vietnam the security of water resources in this area cannot be achieved without a proper understanding of the regional groundwater flow regimes especially with regard to the up gradient recharge zones within the cambodian territory developing an improved hydrogeological database for tbas is also a priority task for cambodia since much of the country suffers from a lack of available hydrogeological information 5 2 2 khorat plateau aquifer as90 this tba is located across the border between thailand and lao pdr the whole area is about 109 000 km2 and thailand covers most of it 91 000 km2 while lao pdr accounts for a small section in the northeastern area the mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm year the brackish saline groundwater is locally observed due to the existence of salt rock underneath williamson et al 1989 the strata of the area is mainly composed of limestone siltstone shale sandstone and holocene loose sediments fissured rock aquifers such as basalt can be found in the eastern part mostly within the territory of lao pdr groundwater in this aquifer is mainly used for the agricultural sector associated with rice paddy or sugarcane cultivation decreasing groundwater levels and deterioration of groundwater quality salinity particularly from thailand are major concerns threatening a sustainable water supply for irrigation and domestic water demand 5 2 3 lower mekong river 2 aquifer as91 this tba covers thailand lao pdr and vietnam the area of the tba is about 122 000 km2 and lao pdr covers about 73 of the total area with thailand and vietnam accounting for 21 and 6 respectively the aquifer is mainly composed of fissured sedimentary rocks overlain by alluvial sediments although its structure is generally complex and the groundwater supply shows varying characteristics depending on the region in similarity to as90 the buried salt rock locally influences groundwater salinity although the natural rainfall is considered to be the main aquifer recharge mechanism of the region the hydraulic connection between groundwater and the mekong river is also regarded as a significant process for recharging or draining the aquifer depending on the season one of the most economically important areas of lao pdr lies within this tba including vientiane the capital and the irrigation land in the lowland plain groundwater serves for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes expansion of groundwater exploitation for irrigation domestic use and rapid urbanisation is an emerging issue particularly for areas with limited surface water access the implications for tbas has been poorly studied and not considered in groundwater management 5 3 regional cooperation and framework for shared aquifer management the essential components for the sustainable development of tba resources lie in the adequate understanding of tba systems and strengthened cooperation in the gms the mekong river commission mrc has provided a regional platform to jointly manage the shared water resources the mission of mrc is to promote and coordinate the sustainable management of water resources for the countries mutual benefit mrc 2005 although the mrc includes groundwater in its mandate the activities so far have mainly focused on surface water or integrated water resource management iwrm consequently in the gms bilateral agreements only exist under the iwrm framework and activities focusing on cooperation and shared groundwater resources management have not been sufficiently implemented however with increased groundwater usage the significance of tba resource management has now been recognised by national stakeholders regional organisations scientists intergovernmental agencies and local communities and their efforts are leading to improved understanding of the regional tba system enhanced institutional capacity for sustainable groundwater management a strengthened network through participatory workshops and increased awareness for cooperative tba management in the gms landon 2011 lee et al 2017 6 conclusions water is increasingly becoming one of the most critical environmental concerns tbas like transboundary rivers have provided vital water resources for people s livelihoods and socio economic development the international community has paid increasing attention to the proper management of tbas because prioritising the use of shared groundwater resources by one government may affect the opportunities of its neighbours and accordingly raise tensions between the bordering countries in order to manage internationally shared groundwater resources in a sustainable manner continuous efforts have been made to develop global tba inventories assess the tba resources and establish a legal and institutional framework in asia tbas have played a major role in providing vital freshwater resources as well as sustaining the economic development of the region currently asia consumes more than 70 of global groundwater in particular groundwater has supported the dramatic growth of the agricultural sector in the region many tbas in asia have been vastly exploited which has led to the reduction and quality deterioration of groundwater resources with an increase in population density and economic development stress on shared aquifer resources is expected to increase further in the future these challenges to groundwater will likely exacerbate regional conflicts by countries competing over the limited water resources the sustainable management of shared aquifer resources requires reliable tba inventories and improved knowledge on the shared groundwater systems these technical aspects are critical for managing shared groundwater resources in a reasonable and equitable manner in asia many regional cooperative activities have been undertaken to develop tba inventories and gain a better understanding of shared aquifer systems cgs 2012 unesco 2010b twap 2014 zaisheng et al 2013 considerable progress has been achieved but the level of understanding of the shared aquifer systems in asia remains limited there is still a lack of reliable tba data particularly for the developing countries suggesting that continuous efforts are necessary to improve knowledge of the tbas and facilitate information sharing and access to tba data international cooperation in the identification assessment and governance mechanisms for tbas is important in order to ensure the sustainability and security of future global water resources institutional frameworks and legal agreements are vital for achieving regional stability with regard to shared water resources management in asia several regional initiatives have been launched to promote the establishment of legal institutional frameworks for tba cooperation with these efforts many countries in asia have come to recognise the importance of their tbas and the need to cooperate with their neighbours in dealing with tba governance several countries such as china have endeavoured to cooperate internationally towards shared water resource management by establishing tba institutes as well as creating mutual agreements with neighbouring countries which is a significant milestone however despite such progress it is still hard to find formal ratified agreements exclusively dealing with tba management some developing countries do not have the capacity to carry out groundwater investigation and proper groundwater management practices consequently the sustainable and equitable management of tba resources in asia requires an increasing effort from intergovernmental agencies policy makers scientists and local communities in order to reach mutual acceptance of effective cooperation from the academic and technical perspectives more attention should be paid to establish a link between hydrogeological knowledge on groundwater management practices based on the improved understanding of tba basins and their impact on water cycles conflict of interest none 
8473,study region asia study focus internationally shared aquifers transboundary aquifers tbas are recognised as an important water resource in asia despite their importance studies on the assessment of tba resources have received less attention in comparison to transboundary rivers a lack of expertise experience and institutional support has restricted the cooperative and sustainable management of the shared aquifer resources this study attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the status of transboundary groundwater resources in asia including the tba inventories socio economic implications and future perspectives specifically the study focuses on the progress of the assessment of tbas in asia as a result of the internationally shared aquifer resources management initiative isram new hydrological insights for the region in asia tbas have played a major role in providing freshwater resources and sustaining socio economic development since 2000 many regional cooperative initiatives have achieved considerable progress in developing tba inventories of asia but the level of understanding of the shared aquifer systems remains limited particularly for the developing countries legal and institutional frameworks for regional tba cooperation are vital and many countries in asia have come to recognise the need to cooperate with their neighbours in dealing with tba governance sustainable and equitable management of tba in asia requires an increasing effort from different sectors and countries in order to reach mutual acceptance of effective cooperation keywords transboundary aquifers tbas groundwater asia region isarm 1 introduction groundwater resources play an important role in sustaining water needs of asia groundwater is widely adopted for crop irrigation food production industry and domestic use in urban and rural communities accounting for about 25 of total water usage in asia fao 2016 the groundwater withdrawal amount in asia accounts for the majority 72 of global usage value caused by intensive agricultural activities and explosive population growth over the region including bangladesh china india iran and pakistan fao 2016 gleeson et al 2012 shah 2005 groundwater also provides a valuable base flow supplying water to rivers lakes and wetlands thus serving as an essential resource for maintaining various ecosystems that depend on it bernadez et al 1993 danielopol et al 2003 kløve et al 2014 wösten et al 2008 apart from its environmental function groundwater has significant socio economic implications for instance it was estimated that groundwater irrigation in asia contributes us 10 to us 30 billion per year to its economy shah et al 2003 wwap 2015 transboundary aquifers tbas like transboundary rivers serve as vital sources of water upon which large numbers of people rely throughout asia complex relationships occur between upstream recharge areas and downstream regions across international borders and the effective management of tbas is of particular importance for the region despite their significance tbas have received less attention from policy makers scientists and local communities due to their hidden diverse nature and the difficulty in conducting hydrological investigations across international borders consequently there are substantial gaps in the water policies or agreements to manage these tbas at international level given the significant contribution of tbas to global water resources their sustainable and equitable management should be undertaken based on international acceptance for effective cooperation among all relevant stakeholders in 2000 the unesco international hydrological programme ihp and the international association of hydrogeologists iah in collaboration with the

resources in asia and 2 to summarise the progress of tba management in asia focusing on hydrogeological and institutional achievements and future perspectives 2 status of tbas in asia 2 1 groundwater in asia asia is the largest continent in the world in terms of both area 43 5 million km2 and population 3 5 billion it borders the pacific ocean in the east arctic ocean in the north the indian ocean in the south and the mediterranean sea in the west respectively asia is notable for dense and large settlements including some of the most populous countries in the world such as china india indonesia pakistan bangladesh and japan un desa 2015 asia is also characterised by extremely diverse climate zones and geographic features climates range from arctic in siberia to tropical in southeast asia and southern india the monsoon circulation dominates across southeast asia south asia and the southeastern part of east asia while central asia western asia and the inland regions of east asia are in the arid zone precipitation also varies depending on the location and climate zone annual rainfall near the equator zones is more than 2000 mm year whereas many parts of southwest and central asia have precipitation rates of less than 150 mm year zaisheng et al 2013 there are several vast deserts in the inland regions of asia such as the gobi desert in mongolia and the arabian desert in the middle east with respect to geographical features the himalayas located between nepal and china is the tallest mountain range in the world some of the world s largest rivers are located in asia including the ganges and the brahmaputra india yangtze china yenisey lena ob amur russian federation and mekong south east asia fig 1 illustrates the hydrogeological mapping results from the china geological survey cgs on a 1 8 million scale cgs 2012 the occurrence of groundwater resources varies across asia sedimentary aquifers mainly composed of floodplain alluvial deposits are developed along large rivers such as the ganges yangtze and mekong these aquifers are generally thick with good storage space providing favourable conditions for groundwater development groundwater productivity yield from the sedimentary aquifers in west asia on the other hand is generally low and these aquifers have very limited groundwater recharge sources in the mountainous regions of central and northern asia groundwater generally occurs in complexes of joint hard rocks although there is little rainfall and strong evaporation in the inland arid areas of central asia the thawing of glaciers and snow in the high mountains is favourable to groundwater recharge unesco 2010b the carbonate rocks are widely distributed in southeast asia in southern china and in some parts of the indochina peninsula there is stratified limestone from the late paleozoic and mesozoic eras in which karst systems are considerably developed a lot of quaternary volcanic rock is extensively distributed on the circum pacific islands groundwater serves as an important source of freshwater supply in asia according to a statistical analysis on global water usage by fao fao 2016 total groundwater abstraction in asia accounts for approximately 72 6 1 1011 m3 year of global usage 8 5 1011 m3 year the results also show that eight out of ten countries with the largest groundwater extraction are located in asia india china nepal bangladesh and pakistan alone account for nearly half of world s total groundwater use mostly associated with a huge population and intensive agricultural activities many countries in western and central asia mainly rely on groundwater for water supply in bangladesh and mongolia about 80 of total water withdrawal comes from groundwater several countries in western asia with no permanent rivers saudi arabia united arab emirates oman kuwait bahrain and qatar rely on groundwater for almost 100 of their renewable water source groundwater extraction has increased greatly in asia particularly since the 1970s global estimates on the sustainability of groundwater usage strongly indicate that current groundwater consumption for some regions in asia such as the upper ganges river basin or north china plain is likely to face serious aquifer depletion and water shortage problems gleeson et al 2012 for instance the groundwater extraction rate in china has increased from 57 109 m3 year in the 1970s to 111 109 m3 year in the 2000s causing many serious environmental issues such as groundwater depletion or land subsidence unesco 2006 in northern india satellite based estimates of groundwater storage change suggest that groundwater is being depleted over the area at a rate of approximately 17 7 4 5 km3 yr which is double the capacity of india s largest surface water reservoir rodell et al 2009 consequently without proper measures being taken to ensure sustainable groundwater usage over 100 million residents of the region may suffer a serious reduction in agricultural output and a shortage of potable water leading to extensive socio economic stress in thailand the increasingly heavy pumping of groundwater in bangkok between 1955 and 1982 caused a decline of 45 50 m in groundwater levels the lowering of water levels by these depths resulted in abandonment of old wells increased pumping costs and land subsidence problems gupta and babel 2005 phien wej et al 2006 vietnam has also suffered from serious groundwater depletion caused by the unsustainable consumption of groundwater for irrigation and other anthropogenic use erban et al 2014 in terms of groundwater quality a high arsenic content is easily observed in many regions of asia in bangladesh and the neighbouring indian states of western bengal a high level of arsenic in the groundwater used for drinking has become a massive public health issue brikowski et al 2014 nickson et al 1998 previous research suggests that about 35 million people in these areas are at risk of being exposed to arsenic poisoning through drinking groundwater chowdhury et al 1999 hasan et al 2009 harvey 2008 radloff et al 2011 shukla et al 2010 in china groundwater with a high arsenic level was found in inner mongolia and other areas rodríguez lado et al 2013 in southeast asia groundwater contamination by arsenic was observed mostly in the alluvial aquifers along major rivers such as the mekong delta in the southern part of vietnam and cambodia erban et al 2013 fendorf et al 2010 with an increase in economic activity groundwater quality deterioration frequently occurs in asia as a result of industrial agricultural and subsistence pollution singh et al 1995 hosono et al 2011 taniguchi et al 2008 2 2 inventory of tbas in asia an updated inventory of global tbas identified 129 shared aquifers in asia igrac 2015 the total area of tbas in asia measures approximately 9 million km2 covering about 20 of the entire region according to the global tba inventory a total of 38 countries in asia are identified as having internationally shared aquifer basins in terms of tba numbers most tba basins in central asia are shared with neighbouring countries uzbekistan shares the most tba basins total

aquifer between india and nepal the major aquifer lithology of the tba is composed of porous layers or a combination of porous and fissured sedimentary rocks which are associated with relatively high groundwater productivity of these geologic units table 1 presents a list of the major tbas in asia requiring attention in terms of a reduction in available groundwater resources in table 1 tbas are selected with an aquifer stress index aqsi defined as groundwater exploitation rate divided by aquifer recharge greater than 50 0 5 or aquifers where notable rates of groundwater level decrease were reported igrac 2015 twap 2014 wada and heinrich 2013 some important tbas in the region might not be included in the list mainly due to the lack of available data despite this lack it is apparent that groundwater is aggressively exploited in many parts of the tbas leading to increased aquifer vulnerability and unsustainable aquifer management conditions gleeson et al 2012 and wada and heinrich 2013 reported that over the indus river plan as78 in table 1 the groundwater extraction rate from the tba exceeded its natural replenishment significantly implying that current groundwater consumption cannot be maintained sustainably due to the rapid expansion of human activities groundwater resources from the tbas in western asia as125 131 140 143 etc are also vastly over exploited the aqsi for these aquifers has increased more than 250 over the last 50 years wada and heinrich 2013 for example in the saq ram aquifer system as126 between saudi arabia and jordan the groundwater extraction rate has dramatically increased since 1980 in order to support wheat production and the domestic water supply resulting in a reversal of the groundwater flow field between the two countries several tbas in central asia as11 77 80 etc have also experienced similar problems in southeast asia the increasing abstraction of groundwater in the mekong delta as89 region has resulted in continuous depletion of groundwater resources and related environmental issues such as land subsidence ho chi minh city suffered the greatest land subsidence in the delta region 4 cm yr erban et al 2014 the groundwater quality of tbas in asia showed varying characteristics depending on climate geological medium and human activities the regional tba survey carried out by twap transboundary water assessment programme identified that among 25 tbas in south southeast and east asia almost 50 of the region s tbas are suitable for human consumption twap 2014 some tbas on the other hand showed serious groundwater quality problems in the indus river plain aquifer as78 it was estimated that about 80 of the aquifer area within the pakistan territory is unsuitable for human consumption as a result of elevated amounts of natural salinity as well as high levels of fluoride and arsenic several tbas in western asia as125 128 130 141 etc also do not satisfy water drinking standards mainly due to the natural salinity and continuous deterioration of groundwater quality by human activity in the case of the mekong delta aquifer on the vietnam side as89 intensive groundwater extraction for agricultural activities has led to seawater intrusion into the aquifer elevated nitrate concentration caused by excessive use of fertilisers is another rising issue for groundwater quality management of the tbas twap 2014 unesco 2010b 3 socio economic implication of tbas groundwater plays a significant role in socio economic development and provides numerous benefits including drinking water supply mitigation of natural disasters increased food production job creation and livelihood enhancement these benefits are closely linked to the inherent characteristics of groundwater as a resource for instance the high buffering capacities of aquifers against climate variations help to stabilise the water supply for human consumption or agricultural activities during peak drought seasons the almost ubiquitous availability of groundwater makes it easy to access and provides a valuable source of drinking water in some regions a significant proportion of the economy is attributed to tourism such as groundwater springs which generate revenue for local business and create jobs wwap 2016 the social and economic benefits of groundwater are of particular importance to the agricultural activities of asia agriculture is the key to general economic development especially in many asian developing countries global estimates suggest that irrigated agriculture accounts for approximately 79 of the total water withdrawals in asia which is higher than the global average of 70 fao 2016 wwap 2016 groundwater has served as an important source of irrigation for asia contributing towards food security and alleviating poverty in the region about 38 of the total irrigated area in asia is estimated to rely on groundwater resources for water supply fao 2016 the considerable dependence of agricultural practices on groundwater is highly attributed to the increase in food productivity or lack of an available surface water resource particularly in central and western asia for example india with the explosive growth in population increasing by 190 between 1960 and 2015 the overall food production index of the nation was boosted by approximately 330 datasource http data worldbank org groundwater is a critical component for achieving dramatic food production growth serving about 60 of the irrigated areas shah 2007 in pakistan groundwater is known to provide about 40 of the total water requirements for irrigation qureshi and barrett lennard 1998 water use for irrigation activity is also inextricably linked to job creation employment rates in the agricultural sector are 39 in south east asia and 44 5 in south and south west asia respectively ilo 2014 wwap 2016 in india it has been estimated that more than half of the total workforce remains in the agricultural sector chand and parappurathu 2012 some evidence suggests that a casual link between local gdp and groundwater abstraction exists in the major cities of asia consequently groundwater aids urban growth and its rapid economic development iges 2007 the role of tbas in asia cannot be separated from the social and socio economic development aspects despite a lack of proper estimation the simple combination of national population density data and areal extent of tbas suggests that more than 500 million people in asia reside in tba regions data source www un igrac org several agricultural systems of global importance are also located in shared aquifer basins such as the east ganges river plain aquifer as80 cambodia mekong river delta aquifer as89 etc in these basins groundwater has contributed significantly to growth in irrigated areas and agriculture productivity for most of the tbas in west asia region as125 131 140 141 143 groundwater is vastly exploited for domestic and agricultural use in china groundwater from the illi river basin aquifer as72 has sustained the socio economic development of the xinjiang province in china and regions with large populations in kazakhstan zaisheng et al 2008 however the intensive use of shared groundwater resources has led to simultaneous aquifer depletion and pollution in india s east ganges river plain basin the increased water demand associated with intensive cultivation such as rice wheat rotation has resulted in salinity water logging and groundwater depletion problems pingali and shah 2001 the over exploitation of groundwater in the tbas between lebanon and syria as4 has caused gradual decreases in the discharge of freshwater springs which have served as the main source of drinking water supply to the nearby city damascus for tbas between jordan and saudi arabia as129 a serious overdraft of fresh groundwater from the large commercial farms in the saudi part has reportedly led to an increase in groundwater salinity and now poses a long term negative impact on the groundwater quality in both the upstream saudi and the downstream jordanian of the tba igrac 2017 4 legal and institutional frameworks for tba management in asia given the significant role of tbas in linking hydrological social and economic sectors between neighbouring countries the issues relating to shared aquifer management should be dealt with by institutional and legal frameworks based on the mutual agreement of relevant stakeholders although the importance of tbas components of global water resource systems has been recognised recently the issues have been scarcely addressed in international water policy legislation and institutional instruments puri and aureli 2005 many countries do not have legal and institutional instruments to regulate the use of groundwater resources and only limited bilateral agreements exist for tba resources management consequently there are few legal instruments to address the specific characteristics of tbas and their sustainable management at global and international level similarly most countries in asia have also shown a substantial lack of water policies for dealing with internationally shared groundwater resources since the early 2000s numerous international efforts have been made to raise awareness in policy and decision makers regarding the significance of tbas and the need for a legal institutional framework to promote the sustainable use of shared aquifer resources in asia several regional initiatives have been launched for compiling a regional hydrogeological inventory and analysing legal institutional frameworks for tba management cooperation cgs 2012 he 2017 igrac 2015 twap 2014 unesco 2006 2010b zaisheng et al 2008 2013 the recent regional survey about legal institutional instruments for tba cooperation in asia has been addressed in selected literature escwa 2009 twap 2014 the results of this regional survey indicated that many tbas bordering china or mongolia are the subject of signed bilateral agreements although the scope of the issues covered varies in each case china in particular has endeavoured to cooperate internationally in shared water resource management by establishing tba institutes as well as creating mutual agreements with its neighbours most of these signed bilateral agreements however do not explicitly cover groundwater he 2017 and need to be ratified in west asia no formal agreements exist for most of the tbas with increased awareness towards water security and sustainability issues countries are beginning to recognise the importance of their tbas and the need to cooperate with their neighbours recently for example mutual negotiation has been initiated between jordan and saudi arabia for sustainable use of the saq ram aquifer system as126 straddling across the two countries escwa 2009 which is a significant milestone in the mekong region the mekong river commission provides a platform for tba cooperation although less attention has been paid to transboundary groundwater resources bach et al 2014 at national level there are institutions specialising in groundwater resources management including transboundary groundwater issues but the extent of the mandate and its capacity is uncertain for example in pakistan a national institute exists with a mandate and the capacity for tba management but the regulations on groundwater abstraction and quality management are quite limited igrac 2017 the stress on fresh water from climate change and anthropogenic activities is expected to increase the risk of freshwater security these challenges on water shortage and quality deterioration will likely exacerbate tensions between countries transboundary groundwater resources like transboundary rivers and lakes can have significant impacts on international relationships regional stability and economic development he 2017 therefore international cooperation for tba identification assessment and governance mechanisms is important to ensure the sustainability and security of future global water resources given the significant contribution of groundwater resources to the water supply and socio economic development of asia it is necessary to foster cooperation for tba management within the context of international groundwater governance and institutional support beyond national borders 5 case studies status and management of tbas in the greater mekong subregion gms 5 1 groundwater in gms the greater mekong subregion gms is an international zone of the mekong river basin in southeast asia the mekong river is the longest river in southeast asia the seventh longest in asia and the twelfth longest in the world bounded by the natural river basin the environment culture and livelihood of the gms countries cambodia lao pdr myanmar thailand and vietnam are closely linked to each other groundwater resources in the gms have been regarded as increasingly important providing water for drinking irrigation and industry as well as supporting natural river water flows and relevant ecosystems eastham et al 2008 landon 2011 the climate of gms shows strong spatial and temporal variations in general both temperature and precipitation tend to increase from north to south the entire basin is under the influence of the southwest monsoon with distinct wet and dry seasons the rainfall is not uniformly distributed about 80 of the total precipitation is concentrated during the wet season heavy rains mainly occur in the mid period of the wet season occasionally leading to severe flooding mrc 2005 2010 water scarcity during the dry season can be acute in parts of the basin eastham et al 2008 most of the flow in the mekong river system is derived from the surface runoff of precipitation followed by groundwater base flow and snowmelt an overview of the hydrogeological setting of the gms has been presented in several previous studies charuratna and phu 1992 cgs 2012 johnson 1986 landon 2011 workman 1970 the upper part of the river basin in china is characterised by the fissured rocks or karst aquifer whereas the delta region mekong delta is extensively covered by unconsolidated alluvial sediments extending from the coast to the northwest in cambodia including the tonle sap lake fig 3 in the delta region the thickness of the alluvial sediment is large and these units are characterised as the primary aquifer along the central part of the basin consolidated rock units basalt limestone fissured sandstone etc serve as localised aquifers with high potential groundwater yield landon 2011 unesco 2010b in the lower basin of the mekong river groundwater provides water for approximately 60 million people mrc 2010 frequent water shortage problems in this area are normally managed by increasing the supply from groundwater resources particularly during the dry season for this reason tbas in the gms receives increased attention from national stakeholders and international communities 5 2 tbas distribution in gms several important tbas straddle along the gms area including the cambodia mekong river delta aquifer as89 khorat plateau aquifer as90 and lower mekong river 2 aquifer as91 etc fig 4 illustrates the locations of tbas in the gms igrac 2015 details of major tbas in the regions are described in the following section 5 2 1 cambodia mekong river delta aquifer as89 the aquifer is shared by cambodia and vietnam extending from dan bian mountain in cambodia to mekong river the whole area is approximately 200 000 km2 and about 63 of the tbas lie within the cambodian territory tonle sap the largest lake in the indochina peninsular is hydraulically connected to the mekong river and serves as a natural regulating reservoir burnett et al 2017 kummu et al 2014 masumoto et al 2008 the annual precipitation is between 1400 and 2200 mm year with a subtropical climate pattern situated in the delta region the tba shows the typical characteristics of an alluvial aquifer the aquifer consists of quaternary sediment with a varying depth up to 800 m the lithology of the aquifer in the delta region is divided into eight alluvial units multi layered separated by interbedded clay units fig 5 each alluvial unit is deposited during different geological times from miocene to holocene although groundwater is abstracted from all aquifers the upper middle pleistocene and middle pliocene aquifers are considered to be the two primary groundwater production aquifers vuong et al 2016 the groundwater resources in this tba have a considerable impact on human livelihoods and socio economic development in major cities such as phnom penh and some other cities in vietnam groundwater is utilised for urban water supply in vietnam rice production from the delta regions makes a substantial contribution to the national gdp including half of vietnam s rice production and more than 80 of rice exports unesco 2010b in cambodia the agriculture sector accounts for half of the gdp and employs 80 85 of the labour force for these reasons the aquifers are heavily exploited for irrigation and water supply the annual groundwater extraction rate throughout the tba is estimated to be about 800 900 million m3 year vuong et al 2016 igrac 2017 due to the rapidly increasing population and fast economic development the demand for water resources has also rapidly increased leading to the over exploitation of groundwater the resulting groundwater reduction and quality deterioration are the main problems threatening future water security erban and gorelick 2016 groundwater levels have significantly declined particularly in the delta area monitored groundwater levels indicate a significant drop in water level over 20 m since the 1990s in many parts of the delta the observed decreasing levels of groundwater range from 10 to 80 cm yr vuong et al 2016 increased groundwater salinity has also significantly affected freshwater supply capacity according to the study by vuong et al 2016 the distribution of saline groundwater in the aquifers covers 62 84 of total area posing an immediate threat to the water supply due to the low geographical topography sea level rises and increased groundwater consumption the aquifers in the delta are increasingly vulnerable to seawater intrusion besides seawater intrusion salty groundwater in the delta is likely to be influenced by multiple causes including old seawater trapped during the deposition of sediments dissolution of aquifer materials and re circulation of irrigation water khoi et al 2002 larsen et al 2017 renaud et al 2015 another quality issue for tbas is the occurrence of arsenic contaminated groundwater and water pollution by increased anthropogenic activities in cambodia around 20 of aquifers are not suitable for human consumption mainly associated with elevated levels of arsenic igrac 2017 some anthropogenic groundwater pollution by households and agricultural practices has been identified causing the deterioration of shallow aquifers chamroeun and sokuntheara 2016 one of the major issues in terms of tba management in this area is the limited institutional framework for the co investigation of tbas and inconsistent hydrological database between the two countries in vietnam at least eight alluvium aquifers were distinguished on the basis of depositional sequences vuong et al 2016 whereas the lithology in cambodia involves a simpler division young alluvium and old sediment deposits chamroeun and sokuntheara 2016 the inconsistent database and different levels of understanding of the tba system have restricted the strategic planning of cooperative groundwater resources management furthermore different groundwater management policies between cambodia and vietnam increase the difficulty in reaching a bilateral agreement for sustainable tba development the cooperative management of this tba system is of particular importance because the mekong delta and its surrounding area are considered as a region with high economic dependence on water resources low levels of socio economic development and high exposure to climate related risks floods and droughts for vietnam the security of water resources in this area cannot be achieved without a proper understanding of the regional groundwater flow regimes especially with regard to the up gradient recharge zones within the cambodian territory developing an improved hydrogeological database for tbas is also a priority task for cambodia since much of the country suffers from a lack of available hydrogeological information 5 2 2 khorat plateau aquifer as90 this tba is located across the border between thailand and lao pdr the whole area is about 109 000 km2 and thailand covers most of it 91 000 km2 while lao pdr accounts for a small section in the northeastern area the mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm year the brackish saline groundwater is locally observed due to the existence of salt rock underneath williamson et al 1989 the strata of the area is mainly composed of limestone siltstone shale sandstone and holocene loose sediments fissured rock aquifers such as basalt can be found in the eastern part mostly within the territory of lao pdr groundwater in this aquifer is mainly used for the agricultural sector associated with rice paddy or sugarcane cultivation decreasing groundwater levels and deterioration of groundwater quality salinity particularly from thailand are major concerns threatening a sustainable water supply for irrigation and domestic water demand 5 2 3 lower mekong river 2 aquifer as91 this tba covers thailand lao pdr and vietnam the area of the tba is about 122 000 km2 and lao pdr covers about 73 of the total area with thailand and vietnam accounting for 21 and 6 respectively the aquifer is mainly composed of fissured sedimentary rocks overlain by alluvial sediments although its structure is generally complex and the groundwater supply shows varying characteristics depending on the region in similarity to as90 the buried salt rock locally influences groundwater salinity although the natural rainfall is considered to be the main aquifer recharge mechanism of the region the hydraulic connection between groundwater and the mekong river is also regarded as a significant process for recharging or draining the aquifer depending on the season one of the most economically important areas of lao pdr lies within this tba including vientiane the capital and the irrigation land in the lowland plain groundwater serves for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes expansion of groundwater exploitation for irrigation domestic use and rapid urbanisation is an emerging issue particularly for areas with limited surface water access the implications for tbas has been poorly studied and not considered in groundwater management 5 3 regional cooperation and framework for shared aquifer management the essential components for the sustainable development of tba resources lie in the adequate understanding of tba systems and strengthened cooperation in the gms the mekong river commission mrc has provided a regional platform to jointly manage the shared water resources the mission of mrc is to promote and coordinate the sustainable management of water resources for the countries mutual benefit mrc 2005 although the mrc includes groundwater in its mandate the activities so far have mainly focused on surface water or integrated water resource management iwrm consequently in the gms bilateral agreements only exist under the iwrm framework and activities focusing on cooperation and shared groundwater resources management have not been sufficiently implemented however with increased groundwater usage the significance of tba resource management has now been recognised by national stakeholders regional organisations scientists intergovernmental agencies and local communities and their efforts are leading to improved understanding of the regional tba system enhanced institutional capacity for sustainable groundwater management a strengthened network through participatory workshops and increased awareness for cooperative tba management in the gms landon 2011 lee et al 2017 6 conclusions water is increasingly becoming one of the most critical environmental concerns tbas like transboundary rivers have provided vital water resources for people s livelihoods and socio economic development the international community has paid increasing attention to the proper management of tbas because prioritising the use of shared groundwater resources by one government may affect the opportunities of its neighbours and accordingly raise tensions between the bordering countries in order to manage internationally shared groundwater resources in a sustainable manner continuous efforts have been made to develop global tba inventories assess the tba resources and establish a legal and institutional framework in asia tbas have played a major role in providing vital freshwater resources as well as sustaining the economic development of the region currently asia consumes more than 70 of global groundwater in particular groundwater has supported the dramatic growth of the agricultural sector in the region many tbas in asia have been vastly exploited which has led to the reduction and quality deterioration of groundwater resources with an increase in population density and economic development stress on shared aquifer resources is expected to increase further in the future these challenges to groundwater will likely exacerbate regional conflicts by countries competing over the limited water resources the sustainable management of shared aquifer resources requires reliable tba inventories and improved knowledge on the shared groundwater systems these technical aspects are critical for managing shared groundwater resources in a reasonable and equitable manner in asia many regional cooperative activities have been undertaken to develop tba inventories and gain a better understanding of shared aquifer systems cgs 2012 unesco 2010b twap 2014 zaisheng et al 2013 considerable progress has been achieved but the level of understanding of the shared aquifer systems in asia remains limited there is still a lack of reliable tba data particularly for the developing countries suggesting that continuous efforts are necessary to improve knowledge of the tbas and facilitate information sharing and access to tba data international cooperation in the identification assessment and governance mechanisms for tbas is important in order to ensure the sustainability and security of future global water resources institutional frameworks and legal agreements are vital for achieving regional stability with regard to shared water resources management in asia several regional initiatives have been launched to promote the establishment of legal institutional frameworks for tba cooperation with these efforts many countries in asia have come to recognise the importance of their tbas and the need to cooperate with their neighbours in dealing with tba governance several countries such as china have endeavoured to cooperate internationally towards shared water resource management by establishing tba institutes as well as creating mutual agreements with neighbouring countries which is a significant milestone however despite such progress it is still hard to find formal ratified agreements exclusively dealing with tba management some developing countries do not have the capacity to carry out groundwater investigation and proper groundwater management practices consequently the sustainable and equitable management of tba resources in asia requires an increasing effort from intergovernmental agencies policy makers scientists and local communities in order to reach mutual acceptance of effective cooperation from the academic and technical perspectives more attention should be paid to establish a link between hydrogeological knowledge on groundwater management practices based on the improved understanding of tba basins and their impact on water cycles conflict of interest none 
8474,the genevese aquifer is used for the supply of drinking water harnessed from ten wells on the swiss side and four on the french side during the 1960s and 1970s overpumping lowered the groundwater level by more than 7 m thereby depleting about one third of total groundwater storage over a period of 20 years while technical and scientific studies were being undertaken to resolve the problem of over exploitation including possible artificial recharge of the aquifer negotiations were being conducted with various local and national authorities in france the aim was to engage in a collaborative effort to fund the work and to establish a joint water management system this paper will focus on a 40 year assessment of a cross border committee the identification of the roles and responsibilities of each side and the financial modalities governing the use of the resource the agreements signed in 1978 and in 2007 attest to the success of the joint management plan keywords transboundary aquifer aquifer management geneva shared water resource mar 1 introduction lake geneva and genevese groundwater provide drinking water to nearly 700 000 inhabitants of geneva and the neigbouring french region the groundwater which is shared by the commune of geneva switzerland and the department of haute savoie upper savoy in france is exploited on both sides of the border thanks to ten water catchment wells in switzerland and four in france in the 1960s and 70s the groundwater level fell drastically because of the vast amount of pumping that was being done in an uncoordinated fashion by distribution and user entities in geneva and across the border in france wells that had gone dry had to be closed this was when the first technical discussions took place both in france and in the canton of geneva to find solutions that would curb the over exploitation of genevese groundwater in an effort to preserve this shared resource political leaders as of then began to consider artificial groundwater recharge the idea was to regain exploitable levels of groundwater in the first instance and then use the common resource as a large seasonal reservoir to be used in the summer months when demand was highest from reserves built up during the winter by artificial recharge from the arve river although artificial recharge of the genevese transboundary aquifer has proven its usefulness since 1980 alongside the technical research and development negotiations on the organisational administrative financial legal and political aspects have also been developed within the cross border context so as to achieve consensus and jointly manage and protect the transboundary aquifer in an efficient and pragmatic manner the various stages of this endeaour are outlined here and explain why the franco swiss genevese aquifer is still a rare example of bilateral agreement on the management of a transboundary aquifer system 2 location of the genevese aquifer geology the genevese aquifer extends over 19 km between the lake of geneva and the rhône river on the western side of the canton of geneva fig 1 its width varies between 1 and 3 5 km the aquifer lies partly across the french border waterlogged gravel may reach up to 50 m depending on topographic conditions the average water level may range between 15 m and 80 m deep the aquifer is made up of silty sandy gravel of glacial and fluvioglacial origin wurm lying directly on the molasse formation which is considered to be the impermeable substratum this aquifer formation is overlaid by a clayish wurmian moraine which reduces meteoric water infiltration but which has the advantage of providing natural protection the darcy permeability of the aquifer is around 1 2 10 3 m s but it could reach up to 5 10 7 3 10 2 m s as a transboundary aquifer the genevese aquifer is used for supplying drinking water from 10 wells on the swiss side and 4 wells on the french side fig 2 3 historical background between 1940 and 1960 groundwater management of the genevese aquifer was very close to the average sustained yield 7 5 m m3 year the groundwater level slowly fell without serious effect between 1960 and 1980 the aquifer became overused with withdrawal rates of up to 14 million m3 year in 1971 almost twice its potential yield this over pumping lowered the groundwater level by more than 7 m in 20 years depleting total groundwater storage by about one third fig 3 consequently an urgent hydraulic management became necessary in order 1 to consider a decrease in withdrawal rates by using another water resource which required the construction of a new water filtration and treatment plant in the lake and 2 to reinforce the natural capacity of the groundwater through artificial recharge the choice between the two possibilities was difficult on the one hand a well known and controlled technology on the other artificial aquifer recharge which was still a considerable technical and political challenge at the time the choice was governed by two criteria water supply security and economics water security would require diversifying the water resources to maintain water distribution in case of a mechanical breakdown or serious contamination of the resource the cost of a new water treatment plant in the lake with the necessary modifications to the water supply system was approximately 150 million swiss francs as at 1975 the cost of a groundwater aquifer recharge mar system including an automatic laboratory system for pollution detection in the arve river was around 20 million swiss francs the decision was then taken to set up an artificial aquifer recharge plant to recover use of the wells and take advantage of the large volumes of water that could be stocked from the genevese water table an artificial recharge system was therefore inaugurated in 1980 to abstract water from the arve river which is the aquifer s main natural recharge source and channel it into the aquifer this operation effected via drains that are laid underground above the aquifer ensures the maintenance of high groundwater levels as well as seasonal stockpiling of the drinking water resource fig 4 the system has been described in previous articles on artificial recharge de los cobos 2002 2009 4 administrative management and policy 4 1 the cross border approach although the artificial recharge plant has been functioning satisfactorily since 1980 and rapidly proved the efficiency of seasonally storing water in the aquifer it was only after many years of careful thought tests and experiments on the ground to come up with appropriate techniques and systems that a successful artificial recharge system was established de los cobos 2012 the political will to develop a cross border project emerged naturally in parallel with the studies and tests that were carried out on the experimental plant indeed although roughly 90 of genevese groundwater is located in the canton of geneva the remaining 10 is to be found across the border in france in the 1970s water distribution in geneva was in the hands of two water companies société des eaux de l arve sea and services industriels de genève sig whereas on the french side a number of wells were exploited by various communities or syndicates on the geneva side there are two different water sources the lake sig and the aquifer société des eaux de l arve which use the same network several meetings and discussions were held alongside the studies and drafting of agreements in order to impose restrictions on use for as long as the diminishing groundwater threatened with total depletion was not recharged artificially establish equitable cost sharing once the recharge plant was completed and operational and would then be of mutual benefit to users on both sides of the border from the time the first franco swiss meetings were held in 1972 it was noted that groundwater resources had shrunk dramatically and continued to do so the problem not only affected geneva but the entire adjoining french region as well between 1973 and 1974 efforts were focused on drawing up an inventory of drinking water resources in the region as well as on hydrogeological issues such as losses natural recharge future pumping and fees and a whole range of factors that needed to be considered in laying the bases of a future franco swiss agreement on the french side the authorities were faced with various scenarios the aquifer is left to deplete itself geneva centres its approach on lake water the french base their approach on their own resources or purchasing water from the swiss this is an acceptable solution for the french if the resource which has recently been discovered in the region of nangy upper savoy is usable arthaz aquifer recharge of the aquifer only by geneva a the french do not participate the aquifer management is carried out primarily as a function of swiss wells with the risk that the french wells run dry studies on the arthaz aquifer have become a top priority for the french b france participates through a concession tax which compensates for the cost of the water aquifer management then focuses on a return to original levels the cost of the water is attractive for the french as long as it does not exceed operating costs for pumping at arthaz in 1975 the french declared that they would no longer use genevese groundwater and would be turning to other french resources but wished to retain the possibility of later participating in and benefiting from artificial recharge this decision certainly had an impact on cost coverage because although sig pursued their minimum extraction policy the financial burden fell onto the shoulders of société des eaux de l arve which pumped exclusively from genevese groundwater it was envisaged that the cost of artificial recharge depreciation interest usage and renovation costs would be spread among all groundwater users irrespective of the origin of the water whether natural or artificial recharge the artificial recharge fee per cubic metre of water extracted could be less than 0 07 swiss francs when the annual volume of water pumped was in excess of 20 million m3 however the fee could rise to 0 12 swiss francs or more if the volume of water pumped was less than 10 million m3 as of 1977 artificial recharge benefits for users were decided as follows société des eaux de l arve sea the company could continue to expand its network without having to seek out other resources purchase of water from sig or construction of a water pumping station to extract water from the lake sig the company could exploit all the existing pumping wells 100 000 m3 day and not have to build a new plant for treating lake water 100 million swiss francs that would only be used for a few weeks of the year french communities if necessary the french communities could extract supplementary amounts of water and pay their share of the costs beyond the annual minimum allowance of 2 million m3 which corresponded to the volumes they extracted before artificial recharge was introduced all users reserves of 15 million m3 of drinking water would be stored in the best possible conditions underground to be constantly available in the case of acute shortage in one of their other plants finally a 30 year arrangement between the state of geneva and the department of haute savoie upper savoy in france was signed on june 19 1978 4 2 description of the 1978 arrangement the main reason for the agreement reached between the state council of the republic and the canton of geneva on the one hand and the prefecture of haute savoie upper savoy on the other was the need to establish a system for joint use of genevese groundwater so as to protect that natural resource and preserve its water quality a rationale that proved to be justified from the very start of the arrangement the arrangement covered the following aspects the exploitation committee with articles on its composition mission and functioning the main characteristics of the committee are outlined below the annual aquifer management programme the mandate of the committee is to propose the yearly management programme of the genevese aquifer taking into account the needs of all the various users and to formulate any proposal required to ensure the protection of the resource the groundwater recharge installation the arrangement provides for the canton of geneva to construct and operate the required groundwater recharge installation for which it remains the sole owner the state of geneva may delegate the operation of the plant to a third party water rights water pumping is limited to a certain volume for the purpose of obtaining a satisfactory average groundwater level the french authorities and communities undertook to ensure that total abstraction by users on their territory would not exceed five million m3 per year exceptions to this limit could be granted by the exploitation committee upon the request by the user in question in order to ensure proper use of the plant each user must at the start of the year declare to the committee the amount of water it expected to abstract from the groundwater for the following twelve months the water thus drawn would be analysed on both sides of the border using standardized qualitative analysis criteria established by the committee water costs the cost of the water is related to the cost of building the plant in swiss francs this includes fees and honorariums pertaining to the construction of the plant the total construction costs civil engineering costs equipment buildings and external construction and the cost of operating electromechanical equipment the french authorities obtained an annual allowance of 2 million m3 once this quota was surpassed the price per m3 would be calculated on the basis of an equation comprising the following factors the costs of operating the plant sig expense e depreciation a total pumping swiss french ve share in natural recharge 7 5 mm3 yr an volume pumped by the french authorities minus the quota vefp french participation pf a e vefp ve an miscellaneous provisions unless it can be demonstrated that pollution would have occurred even in the absence of a recharge installation the canton of geneva would be liable for damage to the water quality resulting from failure to maintain the recharge installation or from defects in its operation in particular of its treatment plant however the french and swiss collectivities and third parties remain liable for pollution of the aquifer occurring within their national territories the arrangement was agreed for a period of 30 years and would be tacitly renewed for periods of 5 years unless terminated by either party with a year s advance notice either party may propose negotiations to amend or supplement the arrangement in which case such negotiations are to be initiated within the following six months any differences arising out of the implementation of the arrangement are to be referred to the regional franco genevese committee failing which the matter is to be decided by the mixed consultative committee following approval of the arrangement between the canton of geneva and the prefecture of haute savoie an advisory committee was set up to oversee the management of genevese groundwater recharge which would also be responsible for dealing with problems relating to the use maintenance and monitoring of the system as a whole in 1988 the water company société des eaux de l arve was bought out by sig as of which point geneva had one single water supplier 4 3 comments on the 1978 arrangement in accordance with the arrangement signed in 1978 between the state of geneva and the prefecture of haute savoie the signatory parties pointed out that it was of the utmost importance to protect the common groundwater resource for drinking water purposes over and above the purely political aspects of state sovereignty in order to adopt a strategy for common use of the transboundary resource the parties agreed to limiting abstractions of water from the genevese groundwater until the exploitation committee considered that satisfactory groundwater levels had been regained art 12 this provision testifies to the desire to tackle a common problem through pragmatic measures mainly relating to the technical and hydrogeological management of the groundwater groundwater levels pumping limits and optimization of artificial recharge the committee is fully involved in the operational management and monitoring of the groundwater the functions of the committee are clearly spelt out in article 2 of the arrangement the 1978 arrangement analysis has been developed in a specific publication on the international law and freshwater de los cobos 2013 we can hereafter recall the aspects related to the sovereignty issue because it is indeed surprising that the arrangement is silent on aspects that are typically connected to transboundary resources namely the sovereignty of the states involved this question of sovereignty was the subject of lengthy debate by the ilc in the preparation of the draft articles for the management of transboundary aquifers stephan 2015 in the case of genevese groundwater 20 of it is to be found in france four pumping wells and the rest in geneva whereas it is acknowledged that the majority of its natural recharge comes not from precipitation but from permeation from the arve river which originates in the mont blanc mountain range and flows for the most part through french territory about 90 of its course the principle of sovereignty is reflected in the principle of state responsibility according to which each party makes decisions for example on projects presented for the installation of new equipment art 5 states are also free to institute an abstraction margin of 20 in relation to the annual volume of reserved water art 10 or to make decisions concerning water levels or pumping quantities an examination by another delegation can be requested at any time art 11 thus demonstrating that notwithstanding the element of trust and confidence examinations by opposing parties could be required by the committee considering the water costs after the french had finally decided not to contribute financially to the building of the station yet sharing the hydraulic benefits of recharge the genevese took the decision to shoulder the entire financial and technical responsibility of building the plant and of the artificial recharge operations the negotiations centred on the right of the french to use the volumes of water they had pumped thus far a free share of two million metric cubes per year was accorded to them any amounts exceeding that would be calculated on the basis of a complex formula based on total pumping and recharge costs looking back over the first 30 years and with the experience gained from having to design the project as well as implement it we can honestly say that the key to the success of this arrangement arises from tackling a problem relating to international water resources at the local level rather than at the level of sovereign states in the case of the genevese area the parties involved were the canton of geneva and the department of haute savoie in switzerland cantons are sovereign and are allowed to handle transboundary matters directly under the supervision of the confederation in france since local authorities could not deal with transboundary issues directly in an autonomous fashion it was the prefecture of haute savoie that represented the sovereignty of the french state in the department besides it should be recalled that all the technical aspects hydrogeological studies management of pumping stations local hydraulic assessments have always been known and dealt with by local actors who would then relay the information to decision makers at the local level since the latter are themselves very closely acquainted with specific regional and cross border issues that no doubt was the secret to the success of the 1978 arrangement 5 the extension of the 1978 arrangement for 30 additional years between 2007 and 2008 the groundwater committee found itself facing new challenges namely the extension of the 1978 arrangement after almost 30 years of being in force particularly challenging issues on the swiss side included the transfer of geneva state assets to sig and thus the sale of the recharge plant to sig in view of these important events a sub working group of the committee was formed and met several times during 2007 this franco swiss working group composed of technical experts and political representatives of the french state and equipped with the necessary legal support produced a basic document outlining the management of genevese groundwater for the next 30 years it was to be ensured in particular that the technical specificities on which the parties agreed would be placed within a global context that was recognized at administrative and political levels de los cobos 2010 the franco swiss committee endorsed the draft of the new agreement proposed by the working group 5 1 the new agreement the first steps consisted of setting up the cross border legal bases for the new agreement the 1978 arrangement did not have a legal premise that was grounded in cross border cooperation instruments for the simple reason that there were no such instruments in existence at the time several instruments of this type appeared as of 1980 and were ratified by both switzerland and france fig 5 there were three conventions on which a new agreement governing genevese groundwater usage could be based namely the european outline convention on transfrontier co operation between territorial communities or authorities hereinafter the madrid convention of 21 may 1980 entry into force 21 december 1981 the convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes hereinafter the helsinki convention of 17 march 1992 the karlsruhe agreement on transboundary cooperation between local communities and local state entities of 23 january 1996 these three international legal instruments do not pursue the same objectives the madrid convention contains a standard inter state agreement on transboundary cooperation among local authorities and a standard contract for service supply among public law cross border local communities the helsinki convention lays down the obligations of states parties to cooperate without directly creating institutions or operational structures the transboundary river contracts to which geneva associated itself after signing the transboundary memorandum of understanding in 1997 to revitalize franco genevese rivers might have had its origins in this convention the karlsruhe agreement for its part provides for the establishment of operational structures between local communities and or local public authorities with legal personality before choosing a transboundary cooperation instrument therefore it was necessary to decide on the objective to be achieved if the aim was to replace the 1978 arrangement a local grouping of transboundary cooperation lgtc bringing together the local communities of geneva the state of geneva and sig seemed to be the way forward however when it came to water management the french entities and the state of geneva would be the main interlocutors with sig s role being restricted to artificial recharge exploitation in fact a simple solution which was limited to groundwater use and recharge was advanced in the form of a transboundary agreement among the local communities concerned on the basis of the karlsruhe agreement particularly the possibility stipulated in its article 5 of delegating a mission to one of the local communities an agreement was subsequently reached between the state of geneva and the three french communities involved the greater annemasse region the community of genevese communes and the commune of viry this option was less burdensome and more appropriate than setting up an lgtc furthermore in accordance with the swiss federal constitution cantons could sign treaties with foreign bodies within the areas of their competence cantons were thus free to act autonomously and themselves conclude international agreements of this type consequently an agreement relating to the use recharge and monitoring of franco swiss genevese groundwater was signed between on the one hand the communes of the greater annemasse region the genevese communes and the commune of viry and on the other hand the state council of the republic and the canton of geneva on december 18 2007 this new agreement succeeded the 1978 arrangement and entered into force on january 1 2008 for 30 years the agreement is a rare example of an aquifer management transboundary agreement between a swiss canton and european union communities 5 2 comments on the 2008 agreement over the years following the 1978 arrangement european countries introduced several reforms to decentralize their administrative structures so as to make way for greater regional integration and to give more autonomy to local authorities in france the political and administrative system underwent major reform between 1982 and 1987 the central government devolved a portion of its powers to subsidiary authorities at the regional and departmental levels france s water legislation also reflects european directives decisions from the river basin authorities and those from local government in switzerland because of the administrative structure of the country s political system influenced by differences in language religion and economic interests cantons have been invested with the power to exercise political authority this is the backdrop against which the revision of the 1978 arrangement was developed new legal instruments had since come into force internationally and so the new agreement was able to be established on new transboundary legal bases it was more or less natural for the new agreement to be inspired by the karlsruhe agreement which allows for the creation of operational systems among local communities because of the successful management of the genevese aquifer during the first 30 years of the 1978 arrangement the renewal of the agreement focused on the legal and technical aspects derived from international law rather than potential fallout of a political or operational type actually one could have expected that the french would have taken advantage of the new agreement to reconsider some aspects of the 1978 agreement such as the quota of 2 mm3 the financial aspects related to calculation of the water taxes or the method of payment between the french communities the state of geneva and sig but the basic provisions of the original agreement that specified the mechanisms for managing the aquifer were retained some aspects of applicable law and dispute settlement provisions were added art 20 indicating notably that problems relating to the interpretation of the agreement should be resolved in accordance with swiss law each country carries out its own water quality assessments chap 16 as the french and swiss standards are relatively similar in both cases these standards have been aligned to european directives amendments centred more on the specification of the legal instruments legitimizing the arrangement and the direct inclusion of french communities whose authority had formally and officially increased indeed it was the french communes and their communities which were the signatories of the new arrangement thereafter referred to as an agreement the preamble of the agreement lists the international agreements and national laws both french and swiss that validate its legitimacy this is the result of what could be considered the legal validation of a pragmatic approach the role of the committee thanks to the work of the working group was fundamental in the implementation of this new agreement 6 the role of the committee as the main stakeholder the committee being at the centre of all discussions and all meetings was crucial to this success the committee would regularly assess the status of the resource in terms of pumping and artificial recharge stocked volumes of water the amount of water each user was expected to use for the coming year were discussed and accepted on the basis of conditions pertaining to water quantity and quality and the operation of the artificial recharge plant initially from the swiss side the committee was comprised of two state council designated representatives one representative from the cantonal committee for water conservation and one representative for each water company sig and société des eaux de l arve committee members could be accompanied by experts one of the state council designated representatives would chair the committee the committee would be mainly responsible for reviewing the annual artificial recharge programme drawn up on the basis of groundwater levels and forecasts of water user needs the budget that was prepared in line with the recharge programme the operating costs and water quality control test results provisions governing quantities reserved for each party for the coming year water quality and the warning system in the event of accidental pollution were also matters that would be discussed and adopted by the committee the committee would meet once to twice per year alternatively in france and in switzerland it could also meet more frequently if necessary in practice the head of the french delegation holds the chair when meetings are held in france and the head of the swiss delegation holds the chair when meetings are held in switzerland the committee which is defined in general terms as being purely consultative plays nonetheless a primary role in groundwater management as it is fully involved in the operational management and monitoring of the groundwater laid down in the annual management programme of the arrangement chapter 4 the functions of the committee are clearly spelt out in article 2 of the arrangement it is evident that the committee which initially had a purely advisory role has gradually become more involved in the management of genevese groundwater and the protection of its aquifer whereas at the start the committee issued warnings on all matters submitted to it notably as concerned groundwater management pumping and artificial recharge it has become increasingly more involved in the protection of the genevese aquifer in respect of the various swiss or french water protection and management plans the committee thus dealt with various problems which arose in 2011 such as the fukushima accident and the extreme drought experienced in the spring of 2011 the drought was considered exceptional because it was the worst drought that had been recorded since meteorological measurements were first taken in switzerland 150 years previously transboundary action plans were instituted by the committee as preventive measures to counter all risks of pollution or water scarcity in the transboundary basin de los cobos 2015 7 keys of success from a review of the last 40 years or so we wish to highlight some key elements which have contributed to the success of the 1978 arrangement and the drafting of its successor agreement focus on the common water resource it was absolutely necessary to safeguard the water resource in the face of the danger posed by over exploitation the excellent geological and hydrogeological knowledge that emerged from the accumulation of technical data and monitoring of the groundwater helped to undergird the efforts to protect the aquifer the specific geological characteristics of the genevese region allowed for the establishment of an efficient recharge system setting it apart from other aquifer systems in the world moreover without the serious and specific problems that occurred during the 1960s and 70s in geneva the question could be asked whether there might have been a need for this cross border collaboration the handling of the administrative and policy aspects of aquifer management at the local level it was noted that between the negotiations conducted in the 1970s to finalize the arrangement politically and administratively and the in depth work that was required to draft the new agreement this agreement was easily concluded to the satisfaction of the french communes and communities thanks in particular to the existing international legal provisions the latter felt more involved in the groundwater management because they were now directly accountable to their own citizens and could act with more autonomy and with greater ease as signatories the sub prefect of st julien en genevois as co chairperson of the committee guarantees the legitimacy of local bodies to the central authority of the french state the ability of the canton of geneva to handle transboundary matters directly the fact that the canton led the recharge project and the management of the various players in addition to the general authority accorded to cantons to handle cross border matters certainly contributed positively to the crafting of the 1978 document in addition the canton demonstrated its ability to guarantee optimal groundwater management over the first thirty years experience has shown that whereas it might be necessary to deal with ten different interlocutors in a project with the french neighbours in the state of geneva there is usually only one entity with which to contend this is clearly a benefit to be derived from typical swiss organisation although the success of the franco genevese agreement was described as a dream accord at a recent presentation to an israeli palestinian delegation it must not be forgotten that it was not easy to set up everything and that the work on the first arrangement required long years of negotiation which were not always smooth a number of thorny and complicated issues remain in terms of organisation and governance in accordance with how governance is defined on either side of the border 8 challenges although water is increasingly considered in europe as a resource which is a common heritage regardless of ownership groundwater remains subject to private ownership in france dionnet grivet 2014 on the geneva side as for the rest of switzerland groundwater is the property of the cantons in france however groundwater usage is a shared right it is not free pumping in excess of 8 m3 hour has to be authorised by the prefect of the department since the 2000 eu water framework directive was passed management has passed into the hands of water basin committees closer to participatory democracy and decentralisation methods as a result the organisation of administrative structures involved in water management is highly fragmented and diversified in france fig 6 in france the community body responsible for water management must deal with the ars health regional agency when it comes to water quality the water basin agency for management the prefect for legal aspects and the region for organisational matters although issues relating to road or urban development may pose risks for water protection communities cannot manage or interfere directly in aspects for which they do not have the competency and must go through various stages and bodies to communicate their position this somewhat complicates their ability to react and communities faced with a real risk to their resources have very few available options in geneva the canton is organised administratively in such a way that the authorities involved in groundwater management and protection can authorise or deny drilling or pumping everything happens within the same department of the canton or in collaboration with other departments involved the same department that is involved in the groundwater management committee also deals with the management of authorisations for using and protecting the water which is a clear advantage to ensure proper supervision and protection of the genevese aquifer another marked difference lies in the tools used by the french to monitor the groundwater which unfortunately are still very basic and do not help to develop geological and hydrogeological knowledge about the genevese aquifer before the signing of the 1978 agreement between the state of geneva and haute savoie upper savoy many years of hydrogeological study and work pilot tests and plant were carried out to gain a better understanding of the functioning of the genevese aquifer and to assess the groundwater for the purpose of calibrating the future genevese artificial recharge plant the plant was supposed to be the solution to considerable groundwater overuse in the 1960s and 70s which had jeopardized continued use of the water for the wells on both the french and swiss sides of the border now thirty years later with a clearer view of the hydraulic situation of the aquifer more control points and a few decades of piezometric and hydraulic measurement we realize that there are still many unknowns especially in the southern part of the aquifer the french section since estimates done on the lateral inflows were proven incorrect by a number of drillings which revealed that there were no gravel or sand saturated levels this is an important point of consideration in the transboundary management of the aquifer because when it came to discussing the pumping quota attributed to the french in the framework of the 1978 agreement and even when the agreement was to be renewed in 2007 many said that this quota should be calculated against the inflows from the french zone however in assessments done then and more recently and from checks made along the full length of the border estimated inflows do not exceed 600 000 m3 per year the quota of 2 million m3 per year accorded on the basis of the volumes that were being pumped by the french between 1974 and 1977 is therefore favorable to the french side but unsubstantiated from a hydrogeological point of view this example is a perfect illustration of the type of geological and hydrogeological detail which must be factored into the study of an aquifer and which is indispensable for analysis purposes each party to a transboundary agreement is thus able to negotiate on a recognized scientific basis and most importantly no party ends up being disadvantaged due to a lack of scientific knowledge on the aquifer 9 evaluations and conclusions in 37 years of operation the genevese artificial recharge system contributed over 300 million m3 of water filtered from genevese groundwater the choice made in the 1970s between a new plant for treating lake water and the creation of a recharge plant proved to be a judicious one not only from a financial point of view but also in terms of water resources management transboundary groundwater management coupled with the technical success of the aquifer recharge system has guaranteed safe drinking water for geneva and the surrounding region by diversifying and optimizing the quantitative and qualitative potential of existing water resources due to the radical change in demographics over the past five years and the economic attractiveness of the genevese region there is an ever greater trend towards establishing a cross border approach a committee on a transboundary water community was formed in 2007 this water community will be included in the franco valdo genevese regional project which will serve to create a common strategic environmental vision across the territory and will include patrimonial social and economic aspects the successful management of genevese groundwater was the basis for the establishment of this transboundary water community which was made official with the signing of a memorandum of understanding for cross border cooperation on water on december 12 2012 this demonstrates the recognition accorded to the committee s almost 40 years of work notwithstanding the difficulties and efforts required to make it even more effective the committee seeks to create efficient beneficial and dynamic cross border relations the genevese groundwater agreement is an unusual example of a transboundary agreement on aquifer management between communities belonging to the european union and a swiss canton it is the result of what could be considered the legal validation of a pragmatic approach conflict of interest none acknowledgements the author would like to acknowledge the great opportunity provided by unesco ihp in 2005 to present the geneva transboundary aquifer agreement which became through the years a unique source to share internationally this very exciting issue around the world appendix a supplementary data agreements the 1978 agreement can be found at http www internationalwaterlaw org documents regionaldocs franko

8474,the genevese aquifer is used for the supply of drinking water harnessed from ten wells on the swiss side and four on the french side during the 1960s and 1970s overpumping lowered the groundwater level by more than 7 m thereby depleting about one third of total groundwater storage over a period of 20 years while technical and scientific studies were being undertaken to resolve the problem of over exploitation including possible artificial recharge of the aquifer negotiations were being conducted with various local and national authorities in france the aim was to engage in a collaborative effort to fund the work and to establish a joint water management system this paper will focus on a 40 year assessment of a cross border committee the identification of the roles and responsibilities of each side and the financial modalities governing the use of the resource the agreements signed in 1978 and in 2007 attest to the success of the joint management plan keywords transboundary aquifer aquifer management geneva shared water resource mar 1 introduction lake geneva and genevese groundwater provide drinking water to nearly 700 000 inhabitants of geneva and the neigbouring french region the groundwater which is shared by the commune of geneva switzerland and the department of haute savoie upper savoy in france is exploited on both sides of the border thanks to ten water catchment wells in switzerland and four in france in the 1960s and 70s the groundwater level fell drastically because of the vast amount of pumping that was being done in an uncoordinated fashion by distribution and user entities in geneva and across the border in france wells that had gone dry had to be closed this was when the first technical discussions took place both in france and in the canton of geneva to find solutions that would curb the over exploitation of genevese groundwater in an effort to preserve this shared resource political leaders as of then began to consider artificial groundwater recharge the idea was to regain exploitable levels of groundwater in the first instance and then use the common resource as a large seasonal reservoir to be used in the summer months when demand was highest from reserves built up during the winter by artificial recharge from the arve river although artificial recharge of the genevese transboundary aquifer has proven its usefulness since 1980 alongside the technical research and development negotiations on the organisational administrative financial legal and political aspects have also been developed within the cross border context so as to achieve consensus and jointly manage and protect the transboundary aquifer in an efficient and pragmatic manner the various stages of this endeaour are outlined here and explain why the franco swiss genevese aquifer is still a rare example of bilateral agreement on the management of a transboundary aquifer system 2 location of the genevese aquifer geology the genevese aquifer extends over 19 km between the lake of geneva and the rhône river on the western side of the canton of geneva fig 1 its width varies between 1 and 3 5 km the aquifer lies partly across the french border waterlogged gravel may reach up to 50 m depending on topographic conditions the average water level may range between 15 m and 80 m deep the aquifer is made up of silty sandy gravel of glacial and fluvioglacial origin wurm lying directly on the molasse formation which is considered to be the impermeable substratum this aquifer formation is overlaid by a clayish wurmian moraine which reduces meteoric water infiltration but which has the advantage of providing natural protection the darcy permeability of the aquifer is around 1 2 10 3 m s but it could reach up to 5 10 7 3 10 2 m s as a transboundary aquifer the genevese aquifer is used for supplying drinking water from 10 wells on the swiss side and 4 wells on the french side fig 2 3 historical background between 1940 and 1960 groundwater management of the genevese aquifer was very close to the average sustained yield 7 5 m m3 year the groundwater level slowly fell without serious effect between 1960 and 1980 the aquifer became overused with withdrawal rates of up to 14 million m3 year in 1971 almost twice its potential yield this over pumping lowered the groundwater level by more than 7 m in 20 years depleting total groundwater storage by about one third fig 3 consequently an urgent hydraulic management became necessary in order 1 to consider a decrease in withdrawal rates by using another water resource which required the construction of a new water filtration and treatment plant in the lake and 2 to reinforce the natural capacity of the groundwater through artificial recharge the choice between the two possibilities was difficult on the one hand a well known and controlled technology on the other artificial aquifer recharge which was still a considerable technical and political challenge at the time the choice was governed by two criteria water supply security and economics water security would require diversifying the water resources to maintain water distribution in case of a mechanical breakdown or serious contamination of the resource the cost of a new water treatment plant in the lake with the necessary modifications to the water supply system was approximately 150 million swiss francs as at 1975 the cost of a groundwater aquifer recharge mar system including an automatic laboratory system for pollution detection in the arve river was around 20 million swiss francs the decision was then taken to set up an artificial aquifer recharge plant to recover use of the wells and take advantage of the large volumes of water that could be stocked from the genevese water table an artificial recharge system was therefore inaugurated in 1980 to abstract water from the arve river which is the aquifer s main natural recharge source and channel it into the aquifer this operation effected via drains that are laid underground above the aquifer ensures the maintenance of high groundwater levels as well as seasonal stockpiling of the drinking water resource fig 4 the system has been described in previous articles on artificial recharge de los cobos 2002 2009 4 administrative management and policy 4 1 the cross border approach although the artificial recharge plant has been functioning satisfactorily since 1980 and rapidly proved the efficiency of seasonally storing water in the aquifer it was only after many years of careful thought tests and experiments on the ground to come up with appropriate techniques and systems that a successful artificial recharge system was established de los cobos 2012 the political will to develop a cross border project emerged naturally in parallel with the studies and tests that were carried out on the experimental plant indeed although roughly 90 of genevese groundwater is located in the canton of geneva the remaining 10 is to be found across the border in france in the 1970s water distribution in geneva was in the hands of two water companies société des eaux de l arve sea and services industriels de genève sig whereas on the french side a number of wells were exploited by various communities or syndicates on the geneva side there are two different water sources the lake sig and the aquifer société des eaux de l arve which use the same network several meetings and discussions were held alongside the studies and drafting of agreements in order to impose restrictions on use for as long as the diminishing groundwater threatened with total depletion was not recharged artificially establish equitable cost sharing once the recharge plant was completed and operational and would then be of mutual benefit to users on both sides of the border from the time the first franco swiss meetings were held in 1972 it was noted that groundwater resources had shrunk dramatically and continued to do so the problem not only affected geneva but the entire adjoining french region as well between 1973 and 1974 efforts were focused on drawing up an inventory of drinking water resources in the region as well as on hydrogeological issues such as losses natural recharge future pumping and fees and a whole range of factors that needed to be considered in laying the bases of a future franco swiss agreement on the french side the authorities were faced with various scenarios the aquifer is left to deplete itself geneva centres its approach on lake water the french base their approach on their own resources or purchasing water from the swiss this is an acceptable solution for the french if the resource which has recently been discovered in the region of nangy upper savoy is usable arthaz aquifer recharge of the aquifer only by geneva a the french do not participate the aquifer management is carried out primarily as a function of swiss wells with the risk that the french wells run dry studies on the arthaz aquifer have become a top priority for the french b france participates through a concession tax which compensates for the cost of the water aquifer management then focuses on a return to original levels the cost of the water is attractive for the french as long as it does not exceed operating costs for pumping at arthaz in 1975 the french declared that they would no longer use genevese groundwater and would be turning to other french resources but wished to retain the possibility of later participating in and benefiting from artificial recharge this decision certainly had an impact on cost coverage because although sig pursued their minimum extraction policy the financial burden fell onto the shoulders of société des eaux de l arve which pumped exclusively from genevese groundwater it was envisaged that the cost of artificial recharge depreciation interest usage and renovation costs would be spread among all groundwater users irrespective of the origin of the water whether natural or artificial recharge the artificial recharge fee per cubic metre of water extracted could be less than 0 07 swiss francs when the annual volume of water pumped was in excess of 20 million m3 however the fee could rise to 0 12 swiss francs or more if the volume of water pumped was less than 10 million m3 as of 1977 artificial recharge benefits for users were decided as follows société des eaux de l arve sea the company could continue to expand its network without having to seek out other resources purchase of water from sig or construction of a water pumping station to extract water from the lake sig the company could exploit all the existing pumping wells 100 000 m3 day and not have to build a new plant for treating lake water 100 million swiss francs that would only be used for a few weeks of the year french communities if necessary the french communities could extract supplementary amounts of water and pay their share of the costs beyond the annual minimum allowance of 2 million m3 which corresponded to the volumes they extracted before artificial recharge was introduced all users reserves of 15 million m3 of drinking water would be stored in the best possible conditions underground to be constantly available in the case of acute shortage in one of their other plants finally a 30 year arrangement between the state of geneva and the department of haute savoie upper savoy in france was signed on june 19 1978 4 2 description of the 1978 arrangement the main reason for the agreement reached between the state council of the republic and the canton of geneva on the one hand and the prefecture of haute savoie upper savoy on the other was the need to establish a system for joint use of genevese groundwater so as to protect that natural resource and preserve its water quality a rationale that proved to be justified from the very start of the arrangement the arrangement covered the following aspects the exploitation committee with articles on its composition mission and functioning the main characteristics of the committee are outlined below the annual aquifer management programme the mandate of the committee is to propose the yearly management programme of the genevese aquifer taking into account the needs of all the various users and to formulate any proposal required to ensure the protection of the resource the groundwater recharge installation the arrangement provides for the canton of geneva to construct and operate the required groundwater recharge installation for which it remains the sole owner the state of geneva may delegate the operation of the plant to a third party water rights water pumping is limited to a certain volume for the purpose of obtaining a satisfactory average groundwater level the french authorities and communities undertook to ensure that total abstraction by users on their territory would not exceed five million m3 per year exceptions to this limit could be granted by the exploitation committee upon the request by the user in question in order to ensure proper use of the plant each user must at the start of the year declare to the committee the amount of water it expected to abstract from the groundwater for the following twelve months the water thus drawn would be analysed on both sides of the border using standardized qualitative analysis criteria established by the committee water costs the cost of the water is related to the cost of building the plant in swiss francs this includes fees and honorariums pertaining to the construction of the plant the total construction costs civil engineering costs equipment buildings and external construction and the cost of operating electromechanical equipment the french authorities obtained an annual allowance of 2 million m3 once this quota was surpassed the price per m3 would be calculated on the basis of an equation comprising the following factors the costs of operating the plant sig expense e depreciation a total pumping swiss french ve share in natural recharge 7 5 mm3 yr an volume pumped by the french authorities minus the quota vefp french participation pf a e vefp ve an miscellaneous provisions unless it can be demonstrated that pollution would have occurred even in the absence of a recharge installation the canton of geneva would be liable for damage to the water quality resulting from failure to maintain the recharge installation or from defects in its operation in particular of its treatment plant however the french and swiss collectivities and third parties remain liable for pollution of the aquifer occurring within their national territories the arrangement was agreed for a period of 30 years and would be tacitly renewed for periods of 5 years unless terminated by either party with a year s advance notice either party may propose negotiations to amend or supplement the arrangement in which case such negotiations are to be initiated within the following six months any differences arising out of the implementation of the arrangement are to be referred to the regional franco genevese committee failing which the matter is to be decided by the mixed consultative committee following approval of the arrangement between the canton of geneva and the prefecture of haute savoie an advisory committee was set up to oversee the management of genevese groundwater recharge which would also be responsible for dealing with problems relating to the use maintenance and monitoring of the system as a whole in 1988 the water company société des eaux de l arve was bought out by sig as of which point geneva had one single water supplier 4 3 comments on the 1978 arrangement in accordance with the arrangement signed in 1978 between the state of geneva and the prefecture of haute savoie the signatory parties pointed out that it was of the utmost importance to protect the common groundwater resource for drinking water purposes over and above the purely political aspects of state sovereignty in order to adopt a strategy for common use of the transboundary resource the parties agreed to limiting abstractions of water from the genevese groundwater until the exploitation committee considered that satisfactory groundwater levels had been regained art 12 this provision testifies to the desire to tackle a common problem through pragmatic measures mainly relating to the technical and hydrogeological management of the groundwater groundwater levels pumping limits and optimization of artificial recharge the committee is fully involved in the operational management and monitoring of the groundwater the functions of the committee are clearly spelt out in article 2 of the arrangement the 1978 arrangement analysis has been developed in a specific publication on the international law and freshwater de los cobos 2013 we can hereafter recall the aspects related to the sovereignty issue because it is indeed surprising that the arrangement is silent on aspects that are typically connected to transboundary resources namely the sovereignty of the states involved this question of sovereignty was the subject of lengthy debate by the ilc in the preparation of the draft articles for the management of transboundary aquifers stephan 2015 in the case of genevese groundwater 20 of it is to be found in france four pumping wells and the rest in geneva whereas it is acknowledged that the majority of its natural recharge comes not from precipitation but from permeation from the arve river which originates in the mont blanc mountain range and flows for the most part through french territory about 90 of its course the principle of sovereignty is reflected in the principle of state responsibility according to which each party makes decisions for example on projects presented for the installation of new equipment art 5 states are also free to institute an abstraction margin of 20 in relation to the annual volume of reserved water art 10 or to make decisions concerning water levels or pumping quantities an examination by another delegation can be requested at any time art 11 thus demonstrating that notwithstanding the element of trust and confidence examinations by opposing parties could be required by the committee considering the water costs after the french had finally decided not to contribute financially to the building of the station yet sharing the hydraulic benefits of recharge the genevese took the decision to shoulder the entire financial and technical responsibility of building the plant and of the artificial recharge operations the negotiations centred on the right of the french to use the volumes of water they had pumped thus far a free share of two million metric cubes per year was accorded to them any amounts exceeding that would be calculated on the basis of a complex formula based on total pumping and recharge costs looking back over the first 30 years and with the experience gained from having to design the project as well as implement it we can honestly say that the key to the success of this arrangement arises from tackling a problem relating to international water resources at the local level rather than at the level of sovereign states in the case of the genevese area the parties involved were the canton of geneva and the department of haute savoie in switzerland cantons are sovereign and are allowed to handle transboundary matters directly under the supervision of the confederation in france since local authorities could not deal with transboundary issues directly in an autonomous fashion it was the prefecture of haute savoie that represented the sovereignty of the french state in the department besides it should be recalled that all the technical aspects hydrogeological studies management of pumping stations local hydraulic assessments have always been known and dealt with by local actors who would then relay the information to decision makers at the local level since the latter are themselves very closely acquainted with specific regional and cross border issues that no doubt was the secret to the success of the 1978 arrangement 5 the extension of the 1978 arrangement for 30 additional years between 2007 and 2008 the groundwater committee found itself facing new challenges namely the extension of the 1978 arrangement after almost 30 years of being in force particularly challenging issues on the swiss side included the transfer of geneva state assets to sig and thus the sale of the recharge plant to sig in view of these important events a sub working group of the committee was formed and met several times during 2007 this franco swiss working group composed of technical experts and political representatives of the french state and equipped with the necessary legal support produced a basic document outlining the management of genevese groundwater for the next 30 years it was to be ensured in particular that the technical specificities on which the parties agreed would be placed within a global context that was recognized at administrative and political levels de los cobos 2010 the franco swiss committee endorsed the draft of the new agreement proposed by the working group 5 1 the new agreement the first steps consisted of setting up the cross border legal bases for the new agreement the 1978 arrangement did not have a legal premise that was grounded in cross border cooperation instruments for the simple reason that there were no such instruments in existence at the time several instruments of this type appeared as of 1980 and were ratified by both switzerland and france fig 5 there were three conventions on which a new agreement governing genevese groundwater usage could be based namely the european outline convention on transfrontier co operation between territorial communities or authorities hereinafter the madrid convention of 21 may 1980 entry into force 21 december 1981 the convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes hereinafter the helsinki convention of 17 march 1992 the karlsruhe agreement on transboundary cooperation between local communities and local state entities of 23 january 1996 these three international legal instruments do not pursue the same objectives the madrid convention contains a standard inter state agreement on transboundary cooperation among local authorities and a standard contract for service supply among public law cross border local communities the helsinki convention lays down the obligations of states parties to cooperate without directly creating institutions or operational structures the transboundary river contracts to which geneva associated itself after signing the transboundary memorandum of understanding in 1997 to revitalize franco genevese rivers might have had its origins in this convention the karlsruhe agreement for its part provides for the establishment of operational structures between local communities and or local public authorities with legal personality before choosing a transboundary cooperation instrument therefore it was necessary to decide on the objective to be achieved if the aim was to replace the 1978 arrangement a local grouping of transboundary cooperation lgtc bringing together the local communities of geneva the state of geneva and sig seemed to be the way forward however when it came to water management the french entities and the state of geneva would be the main interlocutors with sig s role being restricted to artificial recharge exploitation in fact a simple solution which was limited to groundwater use and recharge was advanced in the form of a transboundary agreement among the local communities concerned on the basis of the karlsruhe agreement particularly the possibility stipulated in its article 5 of delegating a mission to one of the local communities an agreement was subsequently reached between the state of geneva and the three french communities involved the greater annemasse region the community of genevese communes and the commune of viry this option was less burdensome and more appropriate than setting up an lgtc furthermore in accordance with the swiss federal constitution cantons could sign treaties with foreign bodies within the areas of their competence cantons were thus free to act autonomously and themselves conclude international agreements of this type consequently an agreement relating to the use recharge and monitoring of franco swiss genevese groundwater was signed between on the one hand the communes of the greater annemasse region the genevese communes and the commune of viry and on the other hand the state council of the republic and the canton of geneva on december 18 2007 this new agreement succeeded the 1978 arrangement and entered into force on january 1 2008 for 30 years the agreement is a rare example of an aquifer management transboundary agreement between a swiss canton and european union communities 5 2 comments on the 2008 agreement over the years following the 1978 arrangement european countries introduced several reforms to decentralize their administrative structures so as to make way for greater regional integration and to give more autonomy to local authorities in france the political and administrative system underwent major reform between 1982 and 1987 the central government devolved a portion of its powers to subsidiary authorities at the regional and departmental levels france s water legislation also reflects european directives decisions from the river basin authorities and those from local government in switzerland because of the administrative structure of the country s political system influenced by differences in language religion and economic interests cantons have been invested with the power to exercise political authority this is the backdrop against which the revision of the 1978 arrangement was developed new legal instruments had since come into force internationally and so the new agreement was able to be established on new transboundary legal bases it was more or less natural for the new agreement to be inspired by the karlsruhe agreement which allows for the creation of operational systems among local communities because of the successful management of the genevese aquifer during the first 30 years of the 1978 arrangement the renewal of the agreement focused on the legal and technical aspects derived from international law rather than potential fallout of a political or operational type actually one could have expected that the french would have taken advantage of the new agreement to reconsider some aspects of the 1978 agreement such as the quota of 2 mm3 the financial aspects related to calculation of the water taxes or the method of payment between the french communities the state of geneva and sig but the basic provisions of the original agreement that specified the mechanisms for managing the aquifer were retained some aspects of applicable law and dispute settlement provisions were added art 20 indicating notably that problems relating to the interpretation of the agreement should be resolved in accordance with swiss law each country carries out its own water quality assessments chap 16 as the french and swiss standards are relatively similar in both cases these standards have been aligned to european directives amendments centred more on the specification of the legal instruments legitimizing the arrangement and the direct inclusion of french communities whose authority had formally and officially increased indeed it was the french communes and their communities which were the signatories of the new arrangement thereafter referred to as an agreement the preamble of the agreement lists the international agreements and national laws both french and swiss that validate its legitimacy this is the result of what could be considered the legal validation of a pragmatic approach the role of the committee thanks to the work of the working group was fundamental in the implementation of this new agreement 6 the role of the committee as the main stakeholder the committee being at the centre of all discussions and all meetings was crucial to this success the committee would regularly assess the status of the resource in terms of pumping and artificial recharge stocked volumes of water the amount of water each user was expected to use for the coming year were discussed and accepted on the basis of conditions pertaining to water quantity and quality and the operation of the artificial recharge plant initially from the swiss side the committee was comprised of two state council designated representatives one representative from the cantonal committee for water conservation and one representative for each water company sig and société des eaux de l arve committee members could be accompanied by experts one of the state council designated representatives would chair the committee the committee would be mainly responsible for reviewing the annual artificial recharge programme drawn up on the basis of groundwater levels and forecasts of water user needs the budget that was prepared in line with the recharge programme the operating costs and water quality control test results provisions governing quantities reserved for each party for the coming year water quality and the warning system in the event of accidental pollution were also matters that would be discussed and adopted by the committee the committee would meet once to twice per year alternatively in france and in switzerland it could also meet more frequently if necessary in practice the head of the french delegation holds the chair when meetings are held in france and the head of the swiss delegation holds the chair when meetings are held in switzerland the committee which is defined in general terms as being purely consultative plays nonetheless a primary role in groundwater management as it is fully involved in the operational management and monitoring of the groundwater laid down in the annual management programme of the arrangement chapter 4 the functions of the committee are clearly spelt out in article 2 of the arrangement it is evident that the committee which initially had a purely advisory role has gradually become more involved in the management of genevese groundwater and the protection of its aquifer whereas at the start the committee issued warnings on all matters submitted to it notably as concerned groundwater management pumping and artificial recharge it has become increasingly more involved in the protection of the genevese aquifer in respect of the various swiss or french water protection and management plans the committee thus dealt with various problems which arose in 2011 such as the fukushima accident and the extreme drought experienced in the spring of 2011 the drought was considered exceptional because it was the worst drought that had been recorded since meteorological measurements were first taken in switzerland 150 years previously transboundary action plans were instituted by the committee as preventive measures to counter all risks of pollution or water scarcity in the transboundary basin de los cobos 2015 7 keys of success from a review of the last 40 years or so we wish to highlight some key elements which have contributed to the success of the 1978 arrangement and the drafting of its successor agreement focus on the common water resource it was absolutely necessary to safeguard the water resource in the face of the danger posed by over exploitation the excellent geological and hydrogeological knowledge that emerged from the accumulation of technical data and monitoring of the groundwater helped to undergird the efforts to protect the aquifer the specific geological characteristics of the genevese region allowed for the establishment of an efficient recharge system setting it apart from other aquifer systems in the world moreover without the serious and specific problems that occurred during the 1960s and 70s in geneva the question could be asked whether there might have been a need for this cross border collaboration the handling of the administrative and policy aspects of aquifer management at the local level it was noted that between the negotiations conducted in the 1970s to finalize the arrangement politically and administratively and the in depth work that was required to draft the new agreement this agreement was easily concluded to the satisfaction of the french communes and communities thanks in particular to the existing international legal provisions the latter felt more involved in the groundwater management because they were now directly accountable to their own citizens and could act with more autonomy and with greater ease as signatories the sub prefect of st julien en genevois as co chairperson of the committee guarantees the legitimacy of local bodies to the central authority of the french state the ability of the canton of geneva to handle transboundary matters directly the fact that the canton led the recharge project and the management of the various players in addition to the general authority accorded to cantons to handle cross border matters certainly contributed positively to the crafting of the 1978 document in addition the canton demonstrated its ability to guarantee optimal groundwater management over the first thirty years experience has shown that whereas it might be necessary to deal with ten different interlocutors in a project with the french neighbours in the state of geneva there is usually only one entity with which to contend this is clearly a benefit to be derived from typical swiss organisation although the success of the franco genevese agreement was described as a dream accord at a recent presentation to an israeli palestinian delegation it must not be forgotten that it was not easy to set up everything and that the work on the first arrangement required long years of negotiation which were not always smooth a number of thorny and complicated issues remain in terms of organisation and governance in accordance with how governance is defined on either side of the border 8 challenges although water is increasingly considered in europe as a resource which is a common heritage regardless of ownership groundwater remains subject to private ownership in france dionnet grivet 2014 on the geneva side as for the rest of switzerland groundwater is the property of the cantons in france however groundwater usage is a shared right it is not free pumping in excess of 8 m3 hour has to be authorised by the prefect of the department since the 2000 eu water framework directive was passed management has passed into the hands of water basin committees closer to participatory democracy and decentralisation methods as a result the organisation of administrative structures involved in water management is highly fragmented and diversified in france fig 6 in france the community body responsible for water management must deal with the ars health regional agency when it comes to water quality the water basin agency for management the prefect for legal aspects and the region for organisational matters although issues relating to road or urban development may pose risks for water protection communities cannot manage or interfere directly in aspects for which they do not have the competency and must go through various stages and bodies to communicate their position this somewhat complicates their ability to react and communities faced with a real risk to their resources have very few available options in geneva the canton is organised administratively in such a way that the authorities involved in groundwater management and protection can authorise or deny drilling or pumping everything happens within the same department of the canton or in collaboration with other departments involved the same department that is involved in the groundwater management committee also deals with the management of authorisations for using and protecting the water which is a clear advantage to ensure proper supervision and protection of the genevese aquifer another marked difference lies in the tools used by the french to monitor the groundwater which unfortunately are still very basic and do not help to develop geological and hydrogeological knowledge about the genevese aquifer before the signing of the 1978 agreement between the state of geneva and haute savoie upper savoy many years of hydrogeological study and work pilot tests and plant were carried out to gain a better understanding of the functioning of the genevese aquifer and to assess the groundwater for the purpose of calibrating the future genevese artificial recharge plant the plant was supposed to be the solution to considerable groundwater overuse in the 1960s and 70s which had jeopardized continued use of the water for the wells on both the french and swiss sides of the border now thirty years later with a clearer view of the hydraulic situation of the aquifer more control points and a few decades of piezometric and hydraulic measurement we realize that there are still many unknowns especially in the southern part of the aquifer the french section since estimates done on the lateral inflows were proven incorrect by a number of drillings which revealed that there were no gravel or sand saturated levels this is an important point of consideration in the transboundary management of the aquifer because when it came to discussing the pumping quota attributed to the french in the framework of the 1978 agreement and even when the agreement was to be renewed in 2007 many said that this quota should be calculated against the inflows from the french zone however in assessments done then and more recently and from checks made along the full length of the border estimated inflows do not exceed 600 000 m3 per year the quota of 2 million m3 per year accorded on the basis of the volumes that were being pumped by the french between 1974 and 1977 is therefore favorable to the french side but unsubstantiated from a hydrogeological point of view this example is a perfect illustration of the type of geological and hydrogeological detail which must be factored into the study of an aquifer and which is indispensable for analysis purposes each party to a transboundary agreement is thus able to negotiate on a recognized scientific basis and most importantly no party ends up being disadvantaged due to a lack of scientific knowledge on the aquifer 9 evaluations and conclusions in 37 years of operation the genevese artificial recharge system contributed over 300 million m3 of water filtered from genevese groundwater the choice made in the 1970s between a new plant for treating lake water and the creation of a recharge plant proved to be a judicious one not only from a financial point of view but also in terms of water resources management transboundary groundwater management coupled with the technical success of the aquifer recharge system has guaranteed safe drinking water for geneva and the surrounding region by diversifying and optimizing the quantitative and qualitative potential of existing water resources due to the radical change in demographics over the past five years and the economic attractiveness of the genevese region there is an ever greater trend towards establishing a cross border approach a committee on a transboundary water community was formed in 2007 this water community will be included in the franco valdo genevese regional project which will serve to create a common strategic environmental vision across the territory and will include patrimonial social and economic aspects the successful management of genevese groundwater was the basis for the establishment of this transboundary water community which was made official with the signing of a memorandum of understanding for cross border cooperation on water on december 12 2012 this demonstrates the recognition accorded to the committee s almost 40 years of work notwithstanding the difficulties and efforts required to make it even more effective the committee seeks to create efficient beneficial and dynamic cross border relations the genevese groundwater agreement is an unusual example of a transboundary agreement on aquifer management between communities belonging to the european union and a swiss canton it is the result of what could be considered the legal validation of a pragmatic approach conflict of interest none acknowledgements the author would like to acknowledge the great opportunity provided by unesco ihp in 2005 to present the geneva transboundary aquifer agreement which became through the years a unique source to share
