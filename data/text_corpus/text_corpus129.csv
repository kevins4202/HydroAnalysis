645,fluvial sediment laden flow represents a class of fluid solid two phase flows which typically involve multi grain sizes interphase and particle particle interactions and mass exchange with the bed however existing depth averaged models ignore one or more of these physical aspects here a physically enhanced coupled depth averaged two phase model is proposed for fluvial sediment laden flow which explicitly incorporates all these aspects and also turbulent reynolds stresses a well balanced numerical algorithm is applied to solve the governing equations of the model the present model is benchmarked against a series of typical cases concerning refilling of a dredged trench bed aggradation due to sediment overloading and flood flows due to landslide dam failure it features encouraging performance as compared to measured data and a quasi single phase mixture model the present model reveals that the larger the grain size the slower the sediment fraction transports which concurs with prior findings from experimental observations and field data also the fluid phase reynolds stresses are considerable where the flow rapidly varies whilst the solid phase reynolds stresses are negligible if sediment concentration is sufficiently low keywords open channel flow sediment laden flow shallow water two phase model erodible bed multi grain sizes 1 introduction fluvial flows can induce sediment transport and morphological changes which in turn conspire to modify the flows cao et al 2017 accordingly there exist active interactions among the flow sediment and morphology and also among particles with different grain sizes physically fluvial sediment laden flow over erodible beds is a typical class of fluid solid two phase flows involving multi grain sizes interphase and particle particle interactions and mass exchange between the flow and the bed refined modelling of fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds is essential for not only river engineering practice but also flood risk management and environmental protection wu 2007 frey and church 2009 in principle mathematical models for fluvial sediment laden flows can be divided into two distinct categories i e depth resolving models and depth averaged models while the depth resolving models can resolve detailed evolution process and vertical structure of fluvial sediment laden flows from either single phase flow perspective e g wu et al 2000 fang and wang 2000 marsooli and wu 2015 or two phase flow viewpoint e g drew 1983 greimann et al 1999 greimann and holly 2001 hsu et al 2003 longo 2005 chauchat and guillou 2008 chiodi et al 2014 they require excessively high computing costs and thus may not be unrealistic for large scale prototype river engineering applications comparatively depth averaged models have been widely used in modelling fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds this is sensible because a balance between theoretical integrity and practical applicability can be achieved most depth averaged models for fluvial sediment laden flows to date are based on the quasi single phase perspective which regards the fluid water and solid sediment mixture as a single phase fluid e g armanini and di silvio 1988 cui et al 1996 hoey and ferguson 1994 cao et al 2004 wu 2004 2007 wu and wang 2008 viparelli et al 2010 hu et al 2014 qian et al 2015 guan et al 2016 in general these depth averaged models cannot resolve the vertical profiles of velocity and sediment concentration in this regard it is noted that in some enhanced depth averaged quasi single phase mixture models especially those for the sediment laden flows in meandering or curved channels presumed vertical profiles of velocity and sediment concentration are incorporated in the depth averaging procedure and thus modified results could be obtained e g yeh and kennedy 1993 guo and jin 1999 wu 2007 vasquez et al 2011 uchida and fukuoka 2014 yet the modelling accuracy of such models largely depends on the presumed vertical profile function xia and jin 2006 generally depth averaged quasi single phase mixture models only incorporate a single momentum conservation equation for the water sediment mixture despite the fact that the respective mass conservation equations for the water sediment mixture and sediment phases consequently only the depth averaged velocity of water sediment mixture is solved numerically while the depth averaged velocities of the sediment phases are a priori empirically determined by the mixture velocity along with the modification coefficient β normally β 1 which is originally developed for a single size class of sediments due to the experimental data albeit far from perfect from theoretical perspectives the depth averaged quasi single phase mixture models to date actually perform well and achieve satisfactory results in modelling fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds more broadly they have been extended to sharply stratified processes for which the double layer averaged quasi single phase mixture models are warranted li et al 2013 cao et al 2015b zech et al 2015 however interphase water to sediment and particle particle interactions which characterize the fluid solid two phase flows need to be incorporated and estimated properly in modelling fluvial sediment laden flows briefly for fluvial processes bed load velocity is appreciably lower than the flow chien and wan 1999 wu et al 2006 greimann et al 2008 and a velocity lag between the flow and the suspended load sediments is also observed in experiments muste et al 2005 both of which actually feature interphase interactions moreover sediment particles of different grain sizes feature different velocities drake et al 1988 wilcock 1997 ferguson and wathen 1998 lenzi 2004 characterizing particle particle interactions in this regard two phase modelling shows great promise for fluvial sediment laden flows modelling as more refined physical mechanisms are accommodated specifically the fluid and solid phases are resolved separately due to their respective mass and momentum conservation laws while depth averaged two phase models have been used extensively in the field of earth surface flows such as debris flows and granular flows e g pitman and le 2005 pudasaini 2012 bouchut et al 2015 their applications and developments for fluvial processes remain at the early stage arguably due to the complexity of numerical solution and the demand for extra relationships to close the governing equations notably based on the work of greco et al 2012 an extended depth averaged two phase model is proposed for modeling dam break flows over erodible beds di cristo et al 2016 yet their models are confined to single sized sediment transport i e the sediment size is kept at a single value normally the median or mean sediment diameter throughout the modeling indeed existing depth averaged two phase modes for not only fluvial processes but also earth surface flows have exclusively not incorporated multi grain sizes of sediments clearly the models assuming a single size of sediments cannot reflect the nature of fluvial sediment laden flows typically characterized by broad particle size distribution for example downstream fining is rather common in natural rivers paola et al 1992 as a consequence there is a lack of physically enhanced models available for resolving the depth averaged size specific longitudinal sediment velocity which is however critical to dynamics of sediment transport haschenburger and church 1998 greimann et al 2003 notably the finding that the depth averaged longitudinal sediment velocity decreases with increasing grain size in non uniform sediment transport has not yet been reproduced numerically by existing depth averaged models although it has been revealed for long from experiment observations wilcock 1997 and field data drake et al 1988 ferguson and wathen 1998 lenzi 2004 here a coupled depth averaged two phase model is presented for fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds accommodating multi grain sizes interphase and particle particle interactions mass exchange between the flow and the bed as well as the depth averaged turbulent reynolds stresses essentially multi grain sizes of sediments are explicitly incorporated in the present model representing a step forward as compared to existing depth averaged two phase model based on single sized sediment transport also the present model is capable of resolving the interphase and particle particle interactions numerically rather than by the empirical relationship which is used in depth averaged quasi single phase mixture models a well balanced algorithm employing the surface gradient method along with the finite volume slic scheme is used to solve the governing equations the present depth averaged two phase model is tested against a series of cases concerning refilling of a dredged trench van rijn 1986 armanini and di silvio 1988 bed aggradation due to sediment overloading seal et al 1997 and flood flows due to landslide dam failure cao et al 2011 the model has also been compared with existing depth averaged quasi single phase models qian et al 2015 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations consider one dimensional fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds composed of non cohesive sediments with n size classes let dk denotes the diameter of kth size of the sediments where subscript k 1 2 n sediment feeding is included while the fed materials are assumed to enter the water sediment mixture directly the model is based on the three layer structure incorporating the bed load layer the active layer and the substrate layer hirano 1971 parker 1991a b following qian et al 2015 the bed load layer is extended to the sediment transport layer in which both the bed load and the suspended load may coexist the active layer is located between the sediment transport layer and the substrate layer sediments within the active layer are assumed to be well mixed in the vertical and can exchange freely with the upper and lower layers the substrate layer with certain structure is known as the stratigraphy of the deposit and may vary temporally on the basis of continuum theory for both the fluid phase water and the solid phase sediment a set of one dimensional depth averaged equations for the mass and momentum conservation for the fluid solid mixture fluid and solid phases is developed by transforming the basic three dimensional two phase flow equations pai 1977 into a relatively simple set of equations here sediment concentration solid fraction is presumed not to be too low to negate the applicability of the continuum assumption though a threshold value is not yet available to date moreover depth averaged illustrates that the physical quantities velocity and volume fraction are integrated and averaged along the depth of the flow in the present study the shape factor which arises from the depth averaging procedure and represents the effects of non uniformity of vertical structure of velocity and sediment concentration are presumed to be unit indeed it is a conventional practice in shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamics models wu et al 2007 which implies the effects of shape factors are neglected however this practice does not mean that the velocity and sediment concentration are assumed to be constant along the flow depth the depth averaged turbulent reynolds stresses for both the fluid and solid phases can be readily obtained through the conventional reynolds averaging procedure in general there exist interactions among flow sediments and erodible bed and also among particles of different grain sizes coupled modelling is generally justified which has been more and more implemented in computational rive dynamics since the work of cao et al 2004 this is followed in the present depth averaged two phase model the detailed derivation of the depth averaged governing equations is given in supplementary a the depth averaged mass and momentum conservation equations for the fluid solid mixture are 1 t ρ m h x ρ m h u m ρ 0 z

dk is the size specific net flux of sediment exchange between the flow and the bed and ft fk where ek and dk are the size specific sediment entrainment and deposition fluxes respectively ha is the

the kth size sediment in the interface between the active layer and the substrate layer and fik 1 for multi grain sizes the widely used active layer formulation due to hirano 1971 eq 8 is adopted to resolve bed grain size stratigraphic evolution according to hoey and ferguson 1994 ha 2d 84 where d 84 is the particle size at which 84 of the sediments are finer the complete governing equations for single sized sediment transport can be obtained easily if n 1 in eqs 1 8 physically there is no any real momentum exchange involved in the mass exchange between the flow and the bed as highlighted by cao et al 2017 this is certainly justified because the flow momentum would not change as the sediment and water entrained from the static bed does not have any momentum initially likewise the flow momentum does not vary due to the sediment deposited into the bed cao et al 2017 actually this proposition has been correctly manifested in models for fluvial processes e g cao et al 2004 wu 2007 and also for earth surface flows such as debris flows bridge and demicco 2008 as demonstrated by eqs 2 4 and 6 in summary the model equations of the present depth averaged two phase model for fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds can be derived from the conservation laws under the framework of shallow water hydrodynamics including the complete mass and momentum conservation equations for the fluid solid mixture eqs 1 and 2 the size specific mass and momentum conservation equations for the solid phase eqs 3 and 4 the mass and momentum conservation equations for the fluid phase eqs 5 and 6 the global mass conservation equation for the sediments in the bed eq 7 and the size specific mass conservation equation for the sediments in the active layer of the bed surface eq 8 indeed the mass and momentum conservation equations for the fluid solid mixture can be derived by adding their counterparts for the fluid and solid phases respectively specifically eq 1 is the sum of eqs 3 and 5 and eq 2 is obtained by adding eq 4 to eq 6 therefore two of the three governing equation systems for the fluid solid mixture eqs 1 and 2 the solid phase eqs 3 and 4 and the fluid phase eqs 5 and 6 are independent numerically and can be used to formulate the mathematical model for fluvial sediment laden flows accordingly there are two distinct options available for numerical solution of the governing equations of the present two phase model specifically one concerns the equations for the fluid and solid phases respectively while the other pertains to the equations for the fluid solid mixture and solid phase however when the former alternative is used the exact roots of the characteristic polynomial equations cannot be readily derived even for the relatively simple case of single sized sediment i e n 1 specifically when the second order terms are not present the eigenvalues may become complex conjugate leading to hyperbolicity loss pelanti et al 2008 pudasaini 2012 in this case complexities arise in terms of numerical algorithm selection and boundary condition implementation in contrast the latter approach is certainly more attractive because the system composed of the equations for the fluid solid mixture and solid phase when the second order terms are not present is hyperbolic and thus the real and distinct eigenvalues can be derived straightforward in accordance the eigenvalues are 9a λ m 1 2 u m g h 9b λ s k 3 4 u s k 0 5 ρ m ρ s g h where λ m and λ sk are the eigenvalues related to the motion of the fluid solid mixture and solid phase respectively therefore in the present study the governing equation systems for the fluid solid mixture i e eqs 1 and 2 and the solid phase i e eqs 3 and 4 along with the bed deformation equation eq 7 and the active layer equation eq 8 are solved numerically 2 2 comparisons with existing models physically the present model represents a step forward as compared to the previous models for fluvial flows over erodible beds table 1 compares the key physical factors included in the present and previous models briefly compared to existing depth averaged two phase models e g di cristo et al 2016 the present model is extended due to the incorporation of multi grain sizes which reflects the real fluvial sediment laden flows better than those models assuming a single size class in comparison with the quasi single phase mixture models the depth averaged velocities of the size specific sediment phase are numerically resolved by virtue of the momentum conservation equation one for each sediment size group thus the interphase and particle particle interactions are explicitly represented additionally a single sediment transport equation is used for modelling bed load and suspended load simultaneously in the present study and quasi single phase mixture models by qian et al 2015 while separate equations are solved for estimating bed load and suspended load sediment transport respectively in di cristo et al 2016 the present approach is appropriate as it can not only ensure the smooth transition of sediment variables between bed load and suspended load for each size group but also simplify the accounting of sediment and speed the computation greimann et al 2008 indeed under certain premises the present two phase model can degenerate into the traditional depth averaged quasi single phase mixture models e g qian et al 2015 briefly modification coefficient β k u s k u m is introduced to estimate the velocity discrepancy between the size specific sediment phase and the water sediment mixture flow physically similar parameters have been proposed by wu et al 2006 and greimann et al 2008 suggesting β k 1 introducing β k in the model equations is physically justified as the depth averaged mean longitudinal velocity of bed load is appreciably lower than that of the flow chien and wan 1999 while for suspended load sediment the value of β k is generally set to be unity as suspended sediment transport has nearly the same depth averaged longitudinal velocity as the water sediment mixture in line with this status eq 4 is not needed and thus the remaining equations i e eqs 1 3 5 7 and 8 become the same as those of the quasi single phase mixture model e g qian et al 2015 when the second order terms are not present for bed load sediment β k can be empirically determined by greimann et al 2008 10 β k u s k u m u u m 1 1 θ k 0 047 0 17 1 exp 5 θ k 0 047 0 047 where u is the bed shear velocity θ k u 2 s g d k is the size specific shields parameter with the specific gravity of sediment s ρ s ρ f ρ f 2 3 model closures to close the governing equations of the present depth averaged two phase model a set of relationships have to be introduced to determine the bed shear stresses sediment exchange fluxes in addition to interphase and particle particle interaction forces and turbulent reynolds stresses 2 3 1 bed shear stresses in general boundary resistances of unsteady and non uniform flows are substantially different from those of steady and uniform flows when sediment transport is involved this is more pronounced as morphological changes are generated however to date there are no generally applicable relationships available to represent the boundary resistances for the fluid and solid phases in fluvial sediment laden flows empiricism is inevitably introduced in terms of the bed shear stress estimation which is common to all models for fluvial sediment laden flows the conventional practice in two phase flow modeling e g greco et al 2012 di cristo et al 2016 in which the total bed shear stress for the fluid solid mixture is separated into the respective bed shear stress exerted on the fluid and solid phases is followed in the present study 11 τ b τ f b τ s k b the solid phase resistance is determined by the coulomb friction law savage and hutter 1989 which expresses the collinearity of shear stress and normal stress through a friction coefficient tan δ following this practice the bed shear stress exerted on the solid phase is given as follows 12a τ s k b ρ s g h s k tan δ m b sgn u s k where m b 1 z b x 2 separately the resistance relationship initially developed for steady and uniform flows which is usually based on the manning s equation is employed to determine the fluid bed resistance 12b τ f b ρ f g h f n 2 u f 2 h f 4 3 m b where n is the manning roughness parameter in the present study the roughness of flume is directly used as the manning roughness 2 3 2 sediment exchange between the flow and the bed generally there are two distinct mechanisms involved in sediment exchange between the flow and the bed i e bed sediment entrainment due to turbulence and sediment deposition by gravitational action though sediment particle particle interactions may modify the exchange to some extent in terms of the determination of the entrainment and deposition fluxes it continues to be one of the pivotal components of computational models for sediment transport and morphological evolution however current formulations hinge upon a series of premises here the conventional practice in fluvial hydraulics is followed in the present study wu 2007 the deposition flux can be practically determined due to the local near bed sediment concentration and settling velocity to specify the entrainment fluxes one of the most widely used approaches is followed which assumes that entrainment always occurs at the same rate as it does under capacity regime in capacity conditions the entrainment flux is equal to the deposition flux therefore bed sediment entrainment flux can be computed by using near bed sediment concentration at capacity and settling velocity accordingly the entrainment and deposition fluxes are estimated by 13a e k α k ω k c e k 13b d k α k ω k c k where ω k is the settling velocity of the kth grain size calculated using zhang s formula zhang and xie 1993 14 ω k 13 95 ν μ f d k 2 1 09 s g d k 13 95 ν μ f d k where νμf is kinematic viscosity of the fluid phase α k is an empirical parameter representing the difference between the near bed sediment concentration cbk and the depth averaged sediment concentration ck here a unified and constant α k is used and estimated by calibration in the computation qian et al 2015 the size specific sediment concentration cek at capacity is computed as 15a c e k a k q k h u m where qk is the size specific transport rate at capacity regime which is calculated by wu formula wu 2007 ak is the areal exposure fraction of kth sediment on the bed surface given by parker 1991a b as below 15b a k f a k d k f a k d k wu 2007 suggested that each sediment size is transported as bed load and suspended load at the same time therefore sediment transport rate of any size fraction can be determined as 15c q k φ k s g d k 3 0 0053 n n b 1 5 τ b τ c k 1 2 2 0 0000262 τ τ c k 1 u m ω k 1 74 where ϕ k is the modification coefficient n d 50 1 6 20 is the manning roughness corresponding to grain resistance τ is the shear stress at channel cross section τ ck is the critical shear stress for incipient motion of bed material approximated by τ ck 0 03γ k ρ s ρ f gdk with γ k representing the correction factor accounting for the hiding and exposure mechanisms in multi grain sizes of sediments wu 2007 it is also noted that eq 13a is applicable when there is sufficient sediment supply from the bed otherwise the sediment entrainment flux vanishes where the bed is made of rigid material e g steel or concrete and is locally non erodible the following relation is employed to evaluate fik hoey and ferguson 1994 toro escobar et al 1996 16 f i k f s k ξ t 0 φ c k c t 1 φ f a k ξ t 0 where fsk is the fraction of the kth size sediment in the substrate layer φ is the empirical weighting parameter 2 3 3 interaction force the interphase interaction force mainly includes drag force virtual added mass force and lift force in general the latter two forces can be ignored in shallow water hydrodynamic models e g pitman and le 2005 pelanti et al 2008 greco et al 2012 di cristo et al 2016 except the two phase model for debris flows by pudasaini 2012 which especially include the virtual mass force indeed the effect of the virtual mass force is negligible according to the numerical results in pudasaini 2012 the interphase drag force fdk can be expressed as below 17a f d k ρ f d r k h u f u s k where drk is the drag function and can be determined on the base of the drag correlation of gidaspow 1994 17b d r k 150 c k 2 ν μ f 1 c k d k 2 7 4 c

depth averaged turbulent reynolds stresses for the fluid and solid phases which explicitly describe their respective contributions to the fluid and solid momentums can be readily derived by transforming the basic three dimensional two phase equations through reynolds averaging procedure although the depth averaged turbulent reynolds stresses are generally negligible in fluvial sediment laden flow modelling it is sensible to incorporate its effect for wide applicability the depth averaged turbulent reynolds stresses for the fluid and solid phases including t r f ρ f u f 2 t r s k ρ s

specific maximum sediment volumetric concentration in the present study c k max is assumed to be equal to ccritical the volume fraction of random close packing rcp which is defined as the densest amorphous packing of rigid particles in the broad field of physics the practice of using unified value for c k max demonstrates that the sediment concentration of any size group can reach the volume

model originating from the kinetic theory of granular flows jenkins and richman 1985 in which two transport equations are solved respectively for the turbulent kinetic energy for the solid phase k s k and the fluid particle covariance k s k f specifically the fluid turbulent stress is determined by the standard depth averaged kf ε f turbulence model proposed by rastogi and rodi 1978 along with a

the contact value of the radial distribution function at the freezing packing fraction cfreeze which is closely related to ccritical torquato and stillinger 2007 theoretically the volume fractions of random close packing and freezing packing are both influenced by the grain size distribution and relative grain size of sediment mixture torquato and stillinger 2010 desmond and weeks 2014 however to date there are no universally applicable formula for determining the volume fraction of random close packing as previous studies in this regard e g torquato and stillinger 2010 desmond and weeks 2014 are generally based on the presumed function for particle size distribution moreover as illustrated by desmond and weeks 2014 the value of random close packing fraction varies in a narrow range of 0 64 to 0 70 in this connection the effects of particle size distribution on the fraction of random close packing can be actually neglected in numerical computation therefore following torquato 1995 the

e g greco et al 2012 di cristo et al 2016 the present model represents a step forward in two phase modeling of fluvial processes over erodible beds by explicitly incorporating multi grain sizes of sediments the present depth averaged two phase model is solved by the numerical algorithm adapted from cao et al 2015a which is described in supplementary b 3 computational case studies a series of test cases are resolved to evaluate the present depth averaged two phase model tpe including comparisons with the quasi single phase mixture models qian et al 2015 the test cases concern 1 the refilling of a dredged trench documented by van rijn 1986 2 an extended case of trench refilling presented by armanini and di silvio 1988 3 bed aggradation due to sediment overloading seal et al 1997 and 4 flood flows due to landslide dam failure cao et al 2011 respectively in addition the case concerning bed degradation due to flash floods reid et al 1995 is also revisited supplementary c which further substantiates the applicability of the present tpe model in this regard it is noted that more test cases involving relatively higher sediment concentrations are required to further demonstrate the present model s advantages over quasi singe phase models to evaluate the discrepancy between the numerical solution and the measured data the non dimensional discrepancy is defined based on the l

deformation depth is defined by δzb zb zb t 0 and η z b are measured stage and bed deformation whilst η zb are the stage and bed deformation computed from a numerical solution in the present work a fixed uniform mesh is used the friction angle δ 32º the empirical weighting parameter φ which was suggested to vary between 0 61 and 0 81 based on the sediment size toro escobar et al 1996 is calibrated to be 0 65 for the present computational cases the values of the other common parameters are ρ f 1000 kg m3 ρ s 2650 kg m3 and g 9 8 m2 s unless otherwise specified the bed porosity is estimated by p 0 13 0 21 1000 d 50 0 002 0 2 wu and wang 2006 where d 50 is the particle size at which 50 of the sediments are finer the values of the modification coefficient ϕ and the empirical parameter α need to be calibrated based on measured data the modelling parameters are listed in table 3 notably the modelling parameters used in the tpe model table 3 are the same as those in the quasi single phase mixture model by qian et al 2015 table 2 theoretically in this instance the superiority of the tpe model over the quasi single phase mixture model can be demonstrated when the tpe model performs better 3 1 refilling of a dredged trench case 1 first the present two phase model was applied to a flume experiment carried out at delft hydraulics laboratory concerning the refilling of a dredged trench a gentle sided 1 10 trench with an initial depth of 0 15 m was set up in a flume of dimensions 30 0 5 0 7 m a constant unit inflow discharge of 0 2 m2 s was specified at the inlet with the mean flow depth and velocity stabilizing at 0 39 m and 0 51 m s respectively the bed was composed of fine sand 0 16 mm with the setting velocity of 0 013 m s the manning roughness n is 0 011 s m1 3 during the experiment equilibrium sediment transport was maintained at the inlet boundary thus the corresponding equilibrium rate was 0 03 kg m s and the sediment concentration by weight at the cross section was 0 1508 kg m3 fig 1 shows the stage and bed profiles computed by the tpe model and the quasi single phase mixture model by qian et al 2015 along with the measured bed data the bed deformations are well reproduced by both models as compared to the measured data the stage profiles from tpe model and quasi single phase mixture model by qian et al 2015 are both rather smooth quantitatively the values of the l b e d 1 norms of the tpe model and qian et al 2015 are similar table 4 while the tpe model features a slight improvement fig 2 illustrates the depth averaged longitudinal velocity profiles of the water sediment mixture fluid water and sediment phase computed by the tpe model it is shown that the sediment is transported as bed load because its depth averaged longitudinal velocity is appreciably lower than the depth averaged fluid velocity and the suspension index si is larger than 2 6 not shown where s i ω κ u and κ 0 4 von karman constant in general si 2 5 ensures that bed load sediment dominates over suspension yet as the sediment concentration is relatively low the water sediment mixture s velocity is approximately equal to the fluid velocity and thus the discrepancy between them is indistinguishable from fig 2 3 2 extended case of dredged filling case 2 to evaluate the capability of the tpe model in modelling non uniform sediment transport and morphological evolution an extended case of trench refilling designed by armanini and di silvio 1988 is revisited in this case a trench of the rather steep side slope 1 3 was set up and the sediment mixture consisted of two fractions d 1 0 075 mm 50 and d 2 0 3 mm 50 the unit inflow discharge was kept constant as 0 2 m2 s fig 3 illustrates the computed stage and bed profiles at 7 5 h and 15 h from the tpe model and qian et al 2015 along with the bed profiles computed by quasi single phase mixture model by armanini and di silvio 1988 seen from fig 3 rather limited differences in the bed profiles are observed for this case featuring similar performances of the tpe model qian et al 2015 and armanini and di silvio 1988 the depth averaged longitudinal velocity profiles of the water sediment mixture fluid and the size specific sediment phases at 7 5 h and 15 h from the tpe model are illustrated in fig 4 here the profiles of the depth averaged mean sediment velocity u s u s k c k c t are also included the sediment phase with finer grain size d 1 0 075 mm exhibits as suspended load suspension index si 0 5 and has nearly the same depth averaged longitudinal velocity as the water sediment mixture and the fluid phase whilst a marginal velocity lag can be observed in contrast the coarser grains d 2 0 3 mm are transported as bed load sediment because the depth averaged velocity of the sediment phase is shown to be remarkably lower than that of the water sediment mixture and the fluid phase and suspension index si is greater than 4 0 similarly due to the relatively low sediment concentration indistinguishable velocity difference can be observed between the water sediment mixture and the fluid phase notably the larger the grain size the smaller the depth averaged sediment velocity although measured data is unavailable to quantitatively verify the computed results this finding is qualitatively consistent with existing experimental observations wilcock 1997 and field data drake et al 1988 ferguson and wathen 1998 lenzi 2004 which further demonstrates the performance of the present model in contrast the velocity discrepancy among particles of different grain sizes cannot be resolved numerically by the depth averaged quasi single phase mixture model and by existing depth averaged two phase models based on a single size of sediments arguably this is why it has not been reproduced numerically until the present work although it has been observed for long 3 3 aggradation due to sediment overloading case 3 bed aggradation due to sediment overloading was performed at the st antony fall laboratory seal et al 1997 in a flume of 45 m long and 0 305 m wide with a uniform slope of 0 002 fig 5 a constant clear water inflow of 0 049 m3 s was released at the inlet boundary and a constant water level 0 4 m was maintained at the outlet boundary sediment mixture was fed into the flume manually at 1 m downstream of the headgate of the flume with a constant rate fig 5 leading to the formation of a depositional wedge table 5 summarizes the grain size distribution of the fed sediment three runs of experiments were conducted here run 1 was revisited to test the performance of the tpe model the sediment feeding rate was 11 3 kg min and was maintained for 16 8 h the roughness is estimated as n b n b 3 2 2 h n w 3 2 b 2 h 2 3 where nb 0 028 m 1 3 s and nw 0 009 m 1 3 s are bed and wall roughness respectively for this modelling exercise the sediment input was treated as source terms in the governing eqs 1 and 3 in a similar way to wu and wang 2008 and qian et al 2015 besides mass collapse was incorporated as it was observed frequently on the upstream side of the wedge during the experiments because its slope was steeper that the sediment repose angle 32º fig 6 illustrates the computed bed profiles at selected instants and final stage profile from tpe model and qian et al 2015 as compared to the measured data in response to sediment feeding the original clear water becomes over loaded gradually leading to the formation of a wedge with rather steep leading edge and the depositional front as well as their progressive propagation downstream seen from fig 6 the wedge shaped bed profiles and the depositional front propagation are reproduced fairly well by both models which are corroborated quantitatively by the values of l b e d 1 table 6 and l s t a g e 1 table 7 also seen from tables 6 and 7 the tpe model features appreciable improvement in modelling performance fig 7 shows the measured and computed characteristic grain sizes d 10 d 50 and d 90 of the substrate layer in the 0 5 h and 5 10 h timeline respectively where d 10 d 50 and d 90 denote the particle size at which 10 50 and 90 of the sediment are finer respectively as shown in fig 7 the general downstream fining at the bed surface in the longitudinal direction is well captured by the tpe model fig 8 shows the depth averaged longitudinal velocity profiles of the water sediment mixture fluid and selected size specific sediment phases along with the profiles of the depth averaged mean sediment velocity seen from fig 8 all the sediment phases exhibit as bed load because their depth averaged longitudinal velocities are appreciably lower than the water sediment mixture and fluid velocities and the suspension index si are exclusively larger than 2 63 similar to cases 1 and 2 above the velocity discrepancy between the water sediment mixture and the fluid phase is indistinguishable because the volumetric sediment concentration is low moreover the tpe model clearly resolve the phenomenon that the larger the grain size the lower the depth averaged sediment velocity 3 4 flood flows due to landslide dam failure here the present tpe model was further evaluated as applied to the modelling of flood flows due to landslide dam failure in contrast to the general fluvial flows revisited above a series of flume experiments on landslide dam breach and the resulting floods are documented by cao et al 2011 these experiments were carried out in a flume of dimensions 80 m 1 2 m 0 8 m fig 9 and bed slope 0 001 and bed roughness n 0 012 m 1 3 s a set of 12 automatic water level probes was used to measure the stage hydrographs at 12 cross sections along the flume to demonstrate the performance of the model a non uniform sediment case with no initial breach i e f case 16 is revisited here in this case the dam with a crest width of 0 2 m was initially 0 4 m high located at approximately 41 m from the inlet of the flume the initial upstream and downstream slopes of the dam were 1 4 and 1 5 respectively the inlet flow discharge was 0 025 m3 s the initial static water depths immediately upstream and downstream of the dam were 0 054 m and 0 048 m respectively and a 0 15 m high weir was installed at the outlet of the flume to hold the downstream water under the initial condition the dam material was sediment mixture composed of the sand and gravel with the median diameter of 2 0 mm according to the gradation curves the mixture is separated here to two size fractions d 1 0 8 mm 70 and d 2 5 mm 30 in the experiments the dams failed due to the erosion of the overtopping flow when the dam failure commences the flow upstream the dam recedes quickly in contrast the flow downstream the dam experiences three stages the initial rising subsequent gradual recession and final stabilization these processes have been documented in details in cao et al 2011 fig 10 shows the computed stage hydrographs by tpe model and qian et al 2015 and the measured data at selected cross sections specifically the cross sections cs 1 cs 5 cs 8 and cs 12 are located at 19 m 40 m 54 m and 73 5 m respectively from the inlet fig 9 the former two cross sections cs 1 and cs 5 are upstream the dam while the rest two cs 8 and cs 12 are downstream the dam it is seen from fig 10 that the stage hydrographs are well reproduced by both tpe model and qian et al 2015 fig 11 illustrates the stage and bed profiles from tpe model and qian et al 2015 along with the measured data for the stages shortly after the dam failure e g t 670 s 700 s and 730 s the performances of both models are nearly the same however during the later period i e t 900 s tpe model is demonstrated to be better than qian et al 2015 in reproducing bed deformation as some oscillations are exhibited on bed profiles from qian et al 2015 yet it is premature to conclude if the oscillations stem from the empirical relationship for determining the sediment velocity embedded in the quasi single phase mixture model thus further investigations are necessary to qualitatively delimit the impacts of empirical formula for the sediment velocity on modelling fluvial sediment laden flows moreover the values of l s t a g e 1 illustrated in table 8 shows that the tpe model is relatively more close to the measured stage than qian et al 2015 fig 12 presents the computed depth averaged longitudinal velocity profiles of the water sediment mixture fluid and sediment phases along with the profiles of the depth averaged mean sediment velocity at selected instants in contrast to the cases revisited above cases 1 3 appreciable velocity discrepancy between the water sediment mixture and the fluid phase can be observed due to the existence of relatively high sediment concentrations 0 1 fig 12a and b the two sediment fractions are both transported as bed load with the suspension index si 3 1 and the appreciable smaller depth averaged velocities as compared to those of the water sediment mixture and the fluid phase moreover the larger the grain size the slower the sediment fraction transports 3 5 discussion 3 5 1 influences of turbulent reynolds stresses in relation to cases 3 and 4 figs 13 and 14 respectively show the spatial distributions of s t r f s b and s t r s s b at specific instants where s t r f h c f t r f x and s t r s h c k t r s k x represent the depth averaged fluid and solid turbulent reynolds stress terms and sb abs τ b denotes the frictional term it is seen from figs 13 and 14 the influence of the depth averaged solid turbulent reynolds stress s t r s can be neglected as the sediment concentration is sufficiently low for case 3 s t r f plays a minor role as the peak value of s t r f s b is less than 0 08 while for case 4 the influence of s t r f is relatively greater with the maximum value of s t r f s b reaching 0 3 in general the value of s t r f is negligible where the flow is gradually varied longitudinally while it is relatively considerable where the flow is rapidly varied and clearly exhibits complex structure like hydraulic jump figs 13 and 14 3 5 2 cpu runtime the tpe model facilitates deeper insight into sediment laden flows than the quasi single phase mixture model yet the cpu runtime of the tpe model relative to its counterpart of the quasi single phase mixture model increases inevitably with the number of the size groups of the sediments because a separate momentum conservation equation for each sediment size has to be solved table 9 lists the cpu runtime of tpe model relative to the counterpart of the quasi single phase mixture model technically a major concern arises from the great increase in computational cost especially when the tpe model is applied for modeling natural large scale fluvial processes characterized by a broad particle size distribution in this connection the technique of adaptive mesh refining can be employed which can efficiently save computational time by an order of magnitude huang et al 2015 overall the present two phase model performs rather well in modelling fluvial sediment laden flows with appreciable improvement in modelling accuracy tables 4 6 8 and an increase in computational cost table 9 as compared to quasi single phase mixture model essentially it is the physically enhanced capability rather than modelling accuracy or computational efficiency that distinguishes the present two phase model from the quasi single phase mixture model in general one of the most important strategies to enhance the quality of computational models for fluvial processes is to incorporate as much physics as possible and thereby minimize the assumptions the present work is just one of the examples with respect to this philosophy i e eliminating the empirical relationship for size specific sediment velocities generic to quasi single phase mixture models by applying the fundamental momentum conservation law for the sediment phase one for each size group to date it remains unclear if such empirical approach is universally applicable for fluvial sediment laden flows most importantly the present tpe model reproduces the finding that the depth averaged longitudinal sediment velocity decreases with the increase of grain size which has been revealed for long by the existing experimental observations and field data but not yet resolved numerically by depth averaged models from this perspective the advantage of the tpe model is obvious it is appreciated that more modelling case studies with observed data are warranted to further demonstrate the superiority of the tpe model over quasi single phase mixture model extension of the present tpe model to two dimensions is warranted for field cases in natural river with complex and irregular topography then it should find wider applications in modelling fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds 4 conclusions a physically enhanced depth averaged two phase model is presented for fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds it is fully coupled and generally applicable as the interactions among water flow sediment and the bed and also among particles of different grain sizes are explicitly accounted for it has been demonstrated to perform rather well when tested against a series of typical cases essentially the present model reproduces the finding that the longitudinal sediment velocity decreases with the increase of grain size which has been revealed for long by the existing experimental observations and field data the depth averaged turbulent reynolds stresses of the fluid phase can be considerable where the flow varies rapidly whilst those of the solid phase are negligible the present work facilitates a promising depth averaged two phase modeling framework for fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds yet inevitable uncertainty of the model arises from the estimations of mass exchange between the flow and the bed as well as bed resistances which certainly require systematic fundamental investigations of the mechanisms of fluvial sediment laden flows extension to two dimensions is warranted for

645,fluvial sediment laden flow represents a class of fluid solid two phase flows which typically involve multi grain sizes interphase and particle particle interactions and mass exchange with the bed however existing depth averaged models ignore one or more of these physical aspects here a physically enhanced coupled depth averaged two phase model is proposed for fluvial sediment laden flow which explicitly incorporates all these aspects and also turbulent reynolds stresses a well balanced numerical algorithm is applied to solve the governing equations of the model the present model is benchmarked against a series of typical cases concerning refilling of a dredged trench bed aggradation due to sediment overloading and flood flows due to landslide dam failure it features encouraging performance as compared to measured data and a quasi single phase mixture model the present model reveals that the larger the grain size the slower the sediment fraction transports which concurs with prior findings from experimental observations and field data also the fluid phase reynolds stresses are considerable where the flow rapidly varies whilst the solid phase reynolds stresses are negligible if sediment concentration is sufficiently low keywords open channel flow sediment laden flow shallow water two phase model erodible bed multi grain sizes 1 introduction fluvial flows can induce sediment transport and morphological changes which in turn conspire to modify the flows cao et al 2017 accordingly there exist active interactions among the flow sediment and morphology and also among particles with different grain sizes physically fluvial sediment laden flow over erodible beds is a typical class of fluid solid two phase flows involving multi grain sizes interphase and particle particle interactions and mass exchange between the flow and the bed refined modelling of fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds is essential for not only river engineering practice but also flood risk management and environmental protection wu 2007 frey and church 2009 in principle mathematical models for fluvial sediment laden flows can be divided into two distinct categories i e depth resolving models and depth averaged models while the depth resolving models can resolve detailed evolution process and vertical structure of fluvial sediment laden flows from either single phase flow perspective e g wu et al 2000 fang and wang 2000 marsooli and wu 2015 or two phase flow viewpoint e g drew 1983 greimann et al 1999 greimann and holly 2001 hsu et al 2003 longo 2005 chauchat and guillou 2008 chiodi et al 2014 they require excessively high computing costs and thus may not be unrealistic for large scale prototype river engineering applications comparatively depth averaged models have been widely used in modelling fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds this is sensible because a balance between theoretical integrity and practical applicability can be achieved most depth averaged models for fluvial sediment laden flows to date are based on the quasi single phase perspective which regards the fluid water and solid sediment mixture as a single phase fluid e g armanini and di silvio 1988 cui et al 1996 hoey and ferguson 1994 cao et al 2004 wu 2004 2007 wu and wang 2008 viparelli et al 2010 hu et al 2014 qian et al 2015 guan et al 2016 in general these depth averaged models cannot resolve the vertical profiles of velocity and sediment concentration in this regard it is noted that in some enhanced depth averaged quasi single phase mixture models especially those for the sediment laden flows in meandering or curved channels presumed vertical profiles of velocity and sediment concentration are incorporated in the depth averaging procedure and thus modified results could be obtained e g yeh and kennedy 1993 guo and jin 1999 wu 2007 vasquez et al 2011 uchida and fukuoka 2014 yet the modelling accuracy of such models largely depends on the presumed vertical profile function xia and jin 2006 generally depth averaged quasi single phase mixture models only incorporate a single momentum conservation equation for the water sediment mixture despite the fact that the respective mass conservation equations for the water sediment mixture and sediment phases consequently only the depth averaged velocity of water sediment mixture is solved numerically while the depth averaged velocities of the sediment phases are a priori empirically determined by the mixture velocity along with the modification coefficient β normally β 1 which is originally developed for a single size class of sediments due to the experimental data albeit far from perfect from theoretical perspectives the depth averaged quasi single phase mixture models to date actually perform well and achieve satisfactory results in modelling fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds more broadly they have been extended to sharply stratified processes for which the double layer averaged quasi single phase mixture models are warranted li et al 2013 cao et al 2015b zech et al 2015 however interphase water to sediment and particle particle interactions which characterize the fluid solid two phase flows need to be incorporated and estimated properly in modelling fluvial sediment laden flows briefly for fluvial processes bed load velocity is appreciably lower than the flow chien and wan 1999 wu et al 2006 greimann et al 2008 and a velocity lag between the flow and the suspended load sediments is also observed in experiments muste et al 2005 both of which actually feature interphase interactions moreover sediment particles of different grain sizes feature different velocities drake et al 1988 wilcock 1997 ferguson and wathen 1998 lenzi 2004 characterizing particle particle interactions in this regard two phase modelling shows great promise for fluvial sediment laden flows modelling as more refined physical mechanisms are accommodated specifically the fluid and solid phases are resolved separately due to their respective mass and momentum conservation laws while depth averaged two phase models have been used extensively in the field of earth surface flows such as debris flows and granular flows e g pitman and le 2005 pudasaini 2012 bouchut et al 2015 their applications and developments for fluvial processes remain at the early stage arguably due to the complexity of numerical solution and the demand for extra relationships to close the governing equations notably based on the work of greco et al 2012 an extended depth averaged two phase model is proposed for modeling dam break flows over erodible beds di cristo et al 2016 yet their models are confined to single sized sediment transport i e the sediment size is kept at a single value normally the median or mean sediment diameter throughout the modeling indeed existing depth averaged two phase modes for not only fluvial processes but also earth surface flows have exclusively not incorporated multi grain sizes of sediments clearly the models assuming a single size of sediments cannot reflect the nature of fluvial sediment laden flows typically characterized by broad particle size distribution for example downstream fining is rather common in natural rivers paola et al 1992 as a consequence there is a lack of physically enhanced models available for resolving the depth averaged size specific longitudinal sediment velocity which is however critical to dynamics of sediment transport haschenburger and church 1998 greimann et al 2003 notably the finding that the depth averaged longitudinal sediment velocity decreases with increasing grain size in non uniform sediment transport has not yet been reproduced numerically by existing depth averaged models although it has been revealed for long from experiment observations wilcock 1997 and field data drake et al 1988 ferguson and wathen 1998 lenzi 2004 here a coupled depth averaged two phase model is presented for fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds accommodating multi grain sizes interphase and particle particle interactions mass exchange between the flow and the bed as well as the depth averaged turbulent reynolds stresses essentially multi grain sizes of sediments are explicitly incorporated in the present model representing a step forward as compared to existing depth averaged two phase model based on single sized sediment transport also the present model is capable of resolving the interphase and particle particle interactions numerically rather than by the empirical relationship which is used in depth averaged quasi single phase mixture models a well balanced algorithm employing the surface gradient method along with the finite volume slic scheme is used to solve the governing equations the present depth averaged two phase model is tested against a series of cases concerning refilling of a dredged trench van rijn 1986 armanini and di silvio 1988 bed aggradation due to sediment overloading seal et al 1997 and flood flows due to landslide dam failure cao et al 2011 the model has also been compared with existing depth averaged quasi single phase models qian et al 2015 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations consider one dimensional fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds composed of non cohesive sediments with n size classes let dk denotes the diameter of kth size of the sediments where subscript k 1 2 n sediment feeding is included while the fed materials are assumed to enter the water sediment mixture directly the model is based on the three layer structure incorporating the bed load layer the active layer and the substrate layer hirano 1971 parker 1991a b following qian et al 2015 the bed load layer is extended to the sediment transport layer in which both the bed load and the suspended load may coexist the active layer is located between the sediment transport layer and the substrate layer sediments within the active layer are assumed to be well mixed in the vertical and can exchange freely with the upper and lower layers the substrate layer with certain structure is known as the stratigraphy of the deposit and may vary temporally on the basis of continuum theory for both the fluid phase water and the solid phase sediment a set of one dimensional depth averaged equations for the mass and momentum conservation for the fluid solid mixture fluid and solid phases is developed by transforming the basic three dimensional two phase flow equations pai 1977 into a relatively simple set of equations here sediment concentration solid fraction is presumed not to be too low to negate the applicability of the continuum assumption though a threshold value is not yet available to date moreover depth averaged illustrates that the physical quantities velocity and volume fraction are integrated and averaged along the depth of the flow in the present study the shape factor which arises from the depth averaging procedure and represents the effects of non uniformity of vertical structure of velocity and sediment concentration are presumed to be unit indeed it is a conventional practice in shallow water hydro sediment morphodynamics models wu et al 2007 which implies the effects of shape factors are neglected however this practice does not mean that the velocity and sediment concentration are assumed to be constant along the flow depth the depth averaged turbulent reynolds stresses for both the fluid and solid phases can be readily obtained through the conventional reynolds averaging procedure in general there exist interactions among flow sediments and erodible bed and also among particles of different grain sizes coupled modelling is generally justified which has been more and more implemented in computational rive dynamics since the work of cao et al 2004 this is followed in the present depth averaged two phase model the detailed

resolve bed grain size stratigraphic evolution according to hoey and ferguson 1994 ha 2d 84 where d 84 is the particle size at which 84 of the sediments are finer the complete governing equations for single sized sediment transport can be obtained easily if n 1 in eqs 1 8 physically there is no any real momentum exchange involved in the mass exchange between the flow and the bed as highlighted by cao et al 2017 this is certainly justified because the flow momentum would not change as the sediment and water entrained from the static bed does not have any momentum initially likewise the flow momentum does not vary due to the sediment deposited into the bed cao et al 2017 actually this proposition has been correctly manifested in models for fluvial processes e g cao et al 2004 wu 2007 and also for earth surface flows such as debris flows bridge and demicco 2008 as demonstrated by eqs 2 4 and 6 in summary the model equations of the present depth averaged two phase model for fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds can be derived from the conservation laws under the framework of shallow water hydrodynamics including the complete mass and momentum conservation equations for the fluid solid mixture eqs 1 and 2 the size specific mass and momentum conservation equations for the solid phase eqs 3 and 4 the mass and momentum conservation equations for the fluid phase eqs 5 and 6 the global mass conservation equation for the sediments in the bed eq 7 and the size specific mass conservation equation for the sediments in the active layer of the bed surface eq 8 indeed the mass and momentum conservation equations for the fluid solid mixture can be derived by adding their counterparts for the fluid and solid phases respectively specifically eq 1 is the sum of eqs 3 and 5 and eq 2 is obtained by adding eq 4 to eq 6 therefore two of the three governing equation systems for the fluid solid mixture eqs 1 and 2 the solid phase eqs 3 and 4 and the fluid phase eqs 5 and 6 are independent numerically and can be used to formulate the mathematical model for fluvial sediment laden flows accordingly there are two distinct options available for numerical solution of the governing equations of the present two phase model specifically one concerns the equations for the fluid and solid phases respectively while the other pertains to the equations for the fluid solid mixture and solid phase however when the former alternative is used the exact roots of the characteristic polynomial equations cannot be readily derived even for the relatively simple case of single sized sediment i e n 1 specifically when the second order terms are not present the eigenvalues may become complex conjugate leading to hyperbolicity loss pelanti et al 2008 pudasaini 2012 in this case complexities arise in terms of numerical algorithm selection and boundary condition implementation in contrast the latter approach is certainly more attractive because the system composed of the equations for the fluid solid mixture and solid phase when the second order terms are not present is hyperbolic and thus the real and distinct eigenvalues can be derived straightforward in accordance the eigenvalues are 9a λ m 1 2 u m g h 9b λ s k 3 4 u s k 0 5 ρ m ρ s g h where λ m and λ sk are the eigenvalues related to the motion of the fluid solid mixture and solid phase respectively therefore in the present study the governing equation systems for the fluid solid mixture i e eqs 1 and 2 and the solid phase i e eqs 3 and 4 along with the bed deformation equation eq 7 and the active layer equation eq 8 are solved numerically 2 2 comparisons with existing models physically the present model represents a step forward as compared to the previous models for fluvial flows over erodible beds table 1 compares the key physical factors included in the present and previous models briefly compared to existing depth averaged two phase models e g di cristo et al 2016 the present model is extended due to the incorporation of multi grain sizes which reflects the real fluvial sediment laden flows better than those models assuming a single size class in comparison with the quasi single phase mixture models the depth averaged velocities of the size specific sediment phase are numerically resolved by virtue of the momentum conservation equation one for each sediment size group thus the interphase and particle particle interactions are explicitly represented additionally a single sediment transport equation is used for modelling bed load and suspended load simultaneously in the present study and quasi single phase mixture models by qian et al 2015 while separate equations are solved for estimating bed load and suspended load sediment transport respectively in di cristo et al 2016 the present approach is appropriate as it can not only ensure the smooth transition of sediment variables between bed load and suspended load for each size group but also simplify the accounting of sediment and speed the computation greimann et al 2008 indeed under certain premises the present two phase model can degenerate into the traditional depth averaged quasi single phase mixture models e g qian et al 2015 briefly modification coefficient β k u s k u m is introduced to estimate the velocity discrepancy between the size specific sediment phase and the water sediment mixture flow physically similar parameters have been proposed by wu et al 2006 and greimann et al 2008 suggesting β k 1 introducing β k in the model equations is physically justified as the depth averaged mean longitudinal velocity of bed load is appreciably lower than that of the flow chien and wan 1999 while for suspended load sediment the value of β k is generally set to be unity as suspended sediment transport has nearly the same depth averaged longitudinal velocity as the water sediment mixture in line with this status eq 4 is not needed and thus the remaining equations i e eqs 1 3 5 7 and 8 become the same as those of the quasi single phase mixture model e g qian et al 2015 when the second order terms are not present for bed load sediment β k can be empirically determined by greimann et al 2008 10 β k u s k u m u u m 1 1 θ k 0 047 0 17 1 exp 5 θ k 0 047 0 047 where u is the bed shear velocity θ k u 2 s g d k is the size specific shields parameter with the specific gravity of sediment s ρ s ρ f ρ f 2 3 model closures to close the governing equations of the present depth averaged two phase model a set of relationships have to be introduced to determine the bed shear stresses sediment exchange fluxes in addition to interphase and particle particle interaction forces and turbulent reynolds stresses 2 3 1 bed shear stresses in general boundary resistances of unsteady and non uniform flows are substantially different from those of steady and uniform flows when sediment transport is involved this is more pronounced as morphological changes are generated however to date there are no generally applicable relationships available to represent the boundary resistances for the fluid and solid phases in fluvial sediment laden flows empiricism is inevitably introduced in terms of the bed shear stress estimation which is common to all models for fluvial sediment laden flows the conventional practice in two phase flow modeling e g greco et al 2012 di cristo et al 2016 in which the total bed shear stress for the fluid solid mixture is separated into the respective bed shear stress exerted on the fluid and solid phases is followed in the present study 11 τ b τ f b τ s k b the solid phase resistance is determined by the coulomb friction law savage and hutter 1989 which expresses the collinearity of shear stress and normal stress through a friction coefficient tan δ following this practice the bed shear stress exerted on the solid phase is given as follows 12a τ s k b ρ s g h s k tan δ m b sgn u s k where m b 1 z b x 2 separately the resistance relationship initially developed for steady and uniform flows which is usually based on the manning s equation is employed to determine the fluid bed resistance 12b τ f b ρ f g h f n 2 u f 2 h f 4 3 m b where n is the manning roughness parameter in the present study the roughness of flume is directly used as the manning roughness 2 3 2 sediment exchange between the flow and the bed generally there are two distinct mechanisms involved in sediment exchange between the flow and the bed i e bed sediment entrainment due to turbulence and sediment deposition by gravitational action though sediment particle particle interactions may modify the exchange to some extent in terms of the determination of the entrainment and deposition fluxes it continues to be one of the pivotal components of computational models for sediment transport and morphological evolution however current formulations hinge upon a series of premises here the conventional practice in fluvial hydraulics is followed in the present study wu 2007 the deposition flux can be practically determined due to the local near bed sediment concentration and settling velocity to specify the entrainment fluxes one of the most widely used approaches is followed which assumes that entrainment always occurs at the same rate as it does under capacity regime in capacity conditions the entrainment flux is equal to the deposition flux therefore bed sediment entrainment flux can be computed by using near bed sediment concentration at capacity and settling velocity accordingly the entrainment and deposition fluxes are estimated by 13a e k α k ω k c e k 13b d k α k ω k c k where ω k is the settling velocity of the kth grain size calculated using zhang s formula zhang and xie 1993 14 ω k 13 95 ν μ f d k 2 1 09 s g d k 13 95 ν μ f

parker 1991a b as below 15b a k f a k d k f a k d k wu 2007 suggested that each sediment size is transported as bed load and suspended load at the same time therefore sediment transport rate of any size fraction can be determined as 15c q k φ k s g d k 3 0 0053 n n b 1 5 τ b τ c k 1 2 2 0 0000262 τ τ c k 1 u m ω k 1 74 where ϕ k is the modification coefficient n d 50 1 6 20 is the manning

gdk with γ k representing the correction factor accounting for the hiding and exposure mechanisms in multi grain sizes of sediments wu 2007 it is also noted that eq 13a is applicable when there is sufficient sediment supply from the bed otherwise the sediment entrainment flux vanishes where the bed is made of rigid material e g steel or concrete and is locally non erodible the following relation is employed to evaluate fik hoey and ferguson 1994 toro escobar et al 1996 16 f i k f s k ξ t 0 φ c k c t 1 φ f a k ξ t 0 where fsk is the fraction of the kth size sediment in the substrate

forces can be ignored in shallow water hydrodynamic models e g pitman and le 2005 pelanti et al 2008 greco et al 2012 di cristo et al 2016 except the two phase model for debris flows by pudasaini 2012 which especially include the virtual mass force indeed the effect of the virtual mass force is negligible according to the numerical results in pudasaini 2012 the interphase drag force fdk can be expressed as below 17a f d k ρ f d r k h u f u s k where drk is the drag function and can be determined on the base of the drag correlation of gidaspow 1994 17b d r k 150 c k 2 ν μ f 1 c k d k 2 7 4 c

depth averaged turbulent reynolds stresses for the fluid and solid phases which explicitly describe their respective contributions to the fluid and solid momentums can be readily derived by transforming the basic three dimensional two phase equations through reynolds averaging procedure although the depth averaged turbulent reynolds stresses are generally negligible in fluvial sediment laden flow modelling it is sensible to incorporate its effect for wide applicability the depth averaged turbulent reynolds stresses for the fluid and solid phases including t r f ρ f u f 2 t r s k ρ s

viscosity related to inter granular stress which can be evaluated based on ahilan and sleath 1987 formula 21 ν μ s k 1 2 ρ f ρ s c k max c k 1 3 1 2 ν μ f where c k max is the depth averaged size specific maximum sediment volumetric concentration in the present study c k max is assumed to be equal to ccritical the volume fraction of random close packing rcp which is defined as the densest amorphous packing of rigid particles in the broad field of physics the practice of using unified value for c k max demonstrates that the sediment concentration of any size group can reach the volume fraction of random close packing theoretically and it is reasonable to assume t r c k t r s k c f t r f t μ c k t μ s k c f t μ f here the fluid turbulence is modelled by the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate model i e kf ε f model where ε f is the depth averaged dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy while the turbulent reynolds stress for the solid phase is modelled by a closure model originating from the kinetic theory of granular flows jenkins and richman 1985 in which two transport equations are solved respectively for the turbulent kinetic energy for the solid phase k s k and the fluid particle covariance k s k f specifically the fluid turbulent stress is determined by the standard depth averaged kf ε f turbulence model proposed by rastogi and rodi 1978 along with a modified component accounting for the influence of particles simonin and viollet 1990 equations for the depth averaged turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy of the

dispersion of particles by the large scale of the turbulent motion in the fluid phase large with respect to the particle diameter simonin and viollet 1990 according to deutsch and simonin 1991 the drift velocity can be defined as 25 u d k t f p k t k s k f 3 1 c k c k x 1 c f c f x where t f p k t is the fluid particle turbulent time scale and expressed as t f p k t γ s k t f t and γ s k 1 c β

term for dissipation and has been determined empirically from turbulent gas particle jet flows elghobashi and abou arab 1983 the k s k k s k f turbulence model for the solid phase originates from the

which accounts for the increase in the probability of collisions when the sediment concentration increases here the radial distribution function suggested by torquato 1995 is used 30 g 0 1 c k 2 1 c k

the contact value of the radial distribution function at the freezing packing fraction cfreeze which is closely related to ccritical torquato and stillinger 2007 theoretically the volume fractions of random close packing and freezing packing are both influenced by the grain size distribution and relative grain size of sediment mixture torquato and stillinger 2010 desmond and weeks 2014 however to date there are no universally applicable formula for determining the volume fraction of random close packing as previous studies in this regard e g torquato and stillinger 2010 desmond and weeks 2014 are generally based on the presumed function for particle size distribution moreover as illustrated by desmond and weeks 2014 the value of random close packing fraction varies in a narrow range of 0 64 to 0 70 in this connection the effects of particle size distribution on the fraction of random close packing can be actually neglected in numerical computation therefore following torquato 1995 the values of the random close packing fraction ccritical and freezing packing fraction cfreeze are assumed to be constant and taken to be 0 64 and 0 49 respectively t s k c is the inter particle

phases are summarized in table 2 the depth averaged two phase model equations along with the model closures have been presented above physically as compared to existing depth averaged two phase models e g greco et al 2012 di cristo et al 2016 the present model represents a step forward in two phase modeling of fluvial processes over erodible beds by explicitly incorporating multi grain sizes of sediments the present depth averaged two phase model is solved by the numerical algorithm adapted from cao et al 2015a which is described in supplementary b 3 computational case studies a series of test cases are resolved to evaluate the present depth averaged two phase model tpe including comparisons with the quasi single phase mixture models qian et al 2015 the test cases concern 1 the refilling of a dredged trench documented by van rijn 1986 2 an extended case of trench refilling presented by armanini and di silvio 1988 3 bed aggradation due to sediment overloading seal et al 1997 and 4 flood flows due to landslide dam failure cao et al 2011 respectively in addition the case concerning bed degradation due to flash floods reid et al 1995 is also revisited supplementary c which further substantiates the applicability of the present tpe model in this regard it is noted that more test cases involving relatively higher sediment concentrations are required to further demonstrate the present model s advantages over quasi singe phase models to evaluate the discrepancy between the numerical solution and the measured data the non dimensional discrepancy is defined based on the l

fixed uniform mesh is used the friction angle δ 32º the empirical weighting parameter φ which was suggested to vary between 0 61 and 0 81 based on the sediment size toro escobar et al 1996 is calibrated to be 0 65 for the present computational cases the values of the other common parameters are ρ f 1000 kg m3 ρ s 2650 kg m3 and g 9 8 m2 s unless otherwise specified the bed porosity is estimated by p 0 13 0 21 1000 d 50 0 002 0 2 wu and wang 2006 where d 50 is the particle size at which 50 of the sediments are finer the values of the modification coefficient ϕ and the empirical parameter α need to be calibrated based on measured data the modelling parameters are listed in table 3 notably the modelling parameters used in the tpe model table 3 are the same as those in the quasi single phase mixture model by qian et al 2015 table 2 theoretically in this instance the superiority of the tpe model over the quasi single phase mixture model can be demonstrated when the tpe model performs better 3 1 refilling of a dredged trench case 1 first the present two phase model was applied to a flume experiment carried out at delft hydraulics laboratory concerning the refilling of a dredged trench a gentle sided 1 10 trench with an initial depth of 0 15 m was set up in a flume of dimensions 30 0 5 0 7 m a constant unit inflow discharge of 0 2 m2 s was specified at the inlet with the mean flow depth and velocity stabilizing at 0 39 m and 0 51 m s respectively the bed was composed of fine sand 0 16 mm with the setting velocity of 0 013 m s the manning roughness n is 0 011 s m1 3 during the experiment equilibrium sediment transport was maintained at the inlet boundary thus the corresponding equilibrium rate was 0 03 kg m s and the sediment concentration by weight at the cross section was 0 1508 kg m3 fig 1 shows the stage and bed profiles computed by the tpe model and the quasi single phase mixture model by qian et al 2015 along with the measured bed data the bed deformations are well reproduced by both models as compared to the measured data the stage profiles from tpe model and quasi single phase mixture model by qian et al 2015 are both rather smooth quantitatively the values of the l b e d 1 norms of the tpe model and qian et al 2015 are similar table 4 while the tpe model features a slight improvement fig 2 illustrates the depth averaged longitudinal velocity profiles of the water sediment mixture fluid water and sediment phase computed by the tpe model it is shown that the sediment is transported as bed load because its depth averaged longitudinal velocity is appreciably lower than the depth averaged fluid velocity and the suspension index si is larger than 2 6 not shown where s i ω κ u and κ 0 4 von karman constant in general si 2 5 ensures that bed load sediment dominates over suspension yet as the sediment concentration is relatively low the water sediment mixture s velocity is approximately equal to the fluid velocity and thus the discrepancy between them is indistinguishable from fig 2 3 2 extended case of dredged filling case 2 to evaluate the capability of the tpe model in modelling non uniform sediment transport and morphological evolution an extended case of trench refilling designed by armanini and di silvio 1988 is revisited in this case a trench of the rather steep side slope 1 3 was set up and the sediment mixture consisted of two fractions d 1 0 075 mm 50 and d 2 0 3 mm 50 the unit inflow discharge was kept constant as 0 2 m2 s fig 3 illustrates the computed stage and bed profiles at 7 5 h and 15 h from the tpe model and qian et al 2015 along with the bed profiles computed by quasi single phase mixture model by armanini and di silvio 1988 seen from fig 3 rather limited differences in the bed profiles are observed for this case featuring similar performances of the tpe model qian et al 2015 and armanini and di silvio 1988 the depth averaged longitudinal velocity profiles of the water sediment mixture fluid and the size specific sediment phases at 7 5 h and 15 h from the tpe model are illustrated in fig 4 here the profiles of the depth averaged mean sediment velocity u s u s k c k c t are also included the sediment phase with finer grain size d 1 0 075 mm exhibits as suspended load suspension index si 0 5 and has nearly the same depth averaged longitudinal velocity as the water sediment mixture and the fluid phase whilst a marginal velocity lag can be observed in contrast the coarser grains d 2 0 3 mm are transported as bed load sediment because the depth averaged velocity of the sediment phase is shown to be remarkably lower than that of the water sediment mixture and the fluid phase and suspension index si is greater than 4 0 similarly due to the relatively low sediment concentration indistinguishable velocity difference can be observed between the water sediment mixture and the fluid phase notably the larger the grain size the smaller the depth averaged sediment velocity although measured data is unavailable to quantitatively verify the computed results this finding is qualitatively consistent with existing experimental observations wilcock 1997 and field data drake et al 1988 ferguson and wathen 1998 lenzi 2004 which further demonstrates the performance of the present model in contrast the velocity discrepancy among particles of different grain sizes cannot be resolved numerically by the depth averaged quasi single phase mixture model and by existing depth averaged two phase models based on a single size of sediments arguably this is why it has not been reproduced numerically until the present work although it has been observed for long 3 3 aggradation due to sediment overloading case 3 bed aggradation due to sediment overloading was performed at the st antony fall laboratory seal et al 1997 in a flume of 45 m long and 0 305 m wide with a uniform slope of 0 002 fig 5 a constant clear water inflow of 0 049 m3 s was released at the inlet boundary and a constant water level 0 4 m was maintained at the outlet boundary sediment mixture was fed into the flume manually at 1 m downstream of the headgate of the flume with a constant rate fig 5 leading to the formation of a depositional wedge table 5 summarizes the grain size distribution of the fed sediment three runs of experiments were conducted here run 1 was revisited to test the performance of the tpe model the sediment feeding rate was 11 3 kg min and was maintained for 16 8 h the roughness is estimated as n b n b 3 2 2 h n w 3 2 b 2 h 2 3 where nb 0 028 m 1 3 s and nw 0 009 m 1 3 s are bed and wall roughness respectively for this modelling exercise the sediment input was treated as source terms in the governing eqs 1 and 3 in a similar way to wu and wang 2008 and qian et al 2015 besides mass collapse was incorporated as it was observed frequently on the upstream side of the wedge during the experiments because its slope was steeper that the sediment repose angle 32º fig 6 illustrates the computed bed profiles at selected instants and final stage profile from tpe model and qian et al 2015 as compared to the measured data in response to sediment feeding the original clear water becomes over loaded gradually leading to the formation of a wedge with rather steep leading edge and the depositional front as well as their progressive propagation downstream seen from fig 6 the wedge shaped bed profiles and the depositional front propagation are reproduced fairly well by both models which are corroborated quantitatively by the values of l b e d 1 table 6 and l s t a g e 1 table 7 also seen from tables 6 and 7 the tpe model features appreciable improvement in modelling performance fig 7 shows the measured and computed characteristic grain sizes d 10 d 50 and d 90 of the substrate layer in the 0 5 h and 5 10 h timeline respectively where d 10 d 50 and d 90 denote the particle size at which 10 50 and 90 of the sediment are finer respectively as shown in fig 7 the general downstream fining at the bed surface in the longitudinal direction is well captured by the tpe model fig 8 shows the depth averaged longitudinal velocity profiles of the water sediment mixture fluid and selected size specific sediment phases along with the profiles of the depth averaged mean sediment velocity seen from fig 8 all the sediment phases exhibit as bed load because their depth averaged longitudinal velocities are appreciably lower than the water sediment mixture and fluid velocities and the suspension index si are exclusively larger than 2 63 similar to cases 1 and 2 above the velocity discrepancy between the water sediment mixture and the fluid phase is indistinguishable because the volumetric sediment concentration is low moreover the tpe model clearly resolve the phenomenon that the larger the grain size the lower the depth averaged sediment velocity 3 4 flood flows due to landslide dam failure here the present tpe model was further evaluated as applied to the modelling of flood flows due to landslide dam failure in contrast to the general fluvial flows revisited above a series of flume experiments on landslide dam breach and the resulting floods are documented by cao et al 2011 these experiments were carried out in a flume of dimensions 80 m 1 2 m 0 8 m fig 9 and bed slope 0 001 and bed roughness n 0 012 m 1 3 s a set of 12 automatic water level probes was used to measure the stage hydrographs at 12 cross sections along the flume to demonstrate the performance of the model a non uniform sediment case with no initial breach i e f case 16 is revisited here in this case the dam with a crest width of 0 2 m was initially 0 4 m high located at approximately 41 m from the inlet of the flume the initial upstream and downstream slopes of the dam were 1 4 and 1 5 respectively the inlet flow discharge was 0 025 m3 s the initial static water depths immediately upstream and downstream of the dam were 0 054 m and 0 048 m respectively and a 0 15 m high weir was installed at the outlet of the flume to hold the downstream water under the initial condition the dam material was sediment mixture composed of the sand and gravel with the median diameter of 2 0 mm according to the gradation curves the mixture is separated here to two size fractions d 1 0 8 mm 70 and d 2 5 mm 30 in the experiments the dams failed due to the erosion of the overtopping flow when the dam failure commences the flow upstream the dam recedes quickly in contrast the flow downstream the dam experiences three stages the initial rising subsequent gradual recession and final stabilization these processes have been documented in details in cao et al 2011 fig 10 shows the computed stage hydrographs by tpe model and qian et al 2015 and the measured data at selected cross sections specifically the cross sections cs 1 cs 5 cs 8 and cs 12 are located at 19 m 40 m 54 m and 73 5 m respectively from the inlet fig 9 the former two cross sections cs 1 and cs 5 are upstream the dam while the rest two cs 8 and cs 12 are downstream the dam it is seen from fig 10 that the stage hydrographs are well reproduced by both tpe model and qian et al 2015 fig 11 illustrates the stage and bed profiles from tpe model and qian et al 2015 along with the measured data for the stages shortly after the dam failure e g t 670 s 700 s and 730 s the performances of both models are nearly the same however during the later period i e t 900 s tpe model is demonstrated to be better than qian et al 2015 in reproducing bed deformation as some oscillations are exhibited on bed profiles from qian et al 2015 yet it is premature to conclude if the oscillations stem from the empirical relationship for determining the sediment velocity embedded in the quasi single phase mixture model thus further investigations are necessary to qualitatively delimit the impacts of empirical formula for the sediment velocity on modelling fluvial sediment laden flows moreover the values of l s t a g e 1 illustrated in table 8 shows that the tpe model is relatively more close to the measured stage than qian et al 2015 fig 12 presents the computed depth averaged longitudinal velocity profiles of the water sediment mixture fluid and sediment phases along with the profiles of the depth averaged mean sediment velocity at selected instants in contrast to the cases revisited above cases 1 3 appreciable velocity discrepancy between the water sediment mixture and the fluid phase can be observed due to the existence of relatively high sediment concentrations 0 1 fig 12a and b the two sediment fractions are both transported as bed load with the suspension index si 3 1 and the appreciable smaller depth averaged velocities as compared to those of the water sediment mixture and the fluid phase moreover the larger the grain size the slower the sediment fraction transports 3 5 discussion 3 5 1 influences of turbulent reynolds stresses in relation to cases 3 and 4 figs 13 and 14 respectively show the spatial distributions of s t r f s b and s t r s s b at specific instants where s t r f h c f t r f x and s t r s h c k t r s k x represent the depth averaged fluid and solid turbulent reynolds stress terms and sb abs τ b denotes the frictional term it is seen from figs 13 and 14 the influence of the depth averaged solid turbulent reynolds stress s t r s can be neglected as the sediment concentration is sufficiently low for case 3 s t r f plays a minor role as the peak value of s t r f s b is less than 0 08 while for case 4 the influence of s t r f is relatively greater with the maximum value of s t r f s b reaching 0 3 in general the value of s t r f is negligible where the flow is gradually varied longitudinally while it is relatively considerable where the flow is rapidly varied and clearly exhibits complex structure like hydraulic jump figs 13 and 14 3 5 2 cpu runtime the tpe model facilitates deeper insight into sediment laden flows than the quasi single phase mixture model yet the cpu runtime of the tpe model relative to its counterpart of the quasi single phase mixture model increases inevitably with the number of the size groups of the sediments because a separate momentum conservation equation for each sediment size has to be solved table 9 lists the cpu runtime of tpe model relative to the counterpart of the quasi single phase mixture model technically a major concern arises from the great increase in computational cost especially when the tpe model is applied for modeling natural large scale fluvial processes characterized by a broad particle size distribution in this connection the technique of adaptive mesh refining can be employed which can efficiently save computational time by an order of magnitude huang et al 2015 overall the present two phase model performs rather well in modelling fluvial sediment laden flows with appreciable improvement in modelling accuracy tables 4 6 8 and an increase in computational cost table 9 as compared to quasi single phase mixture model essentially it is the physically enhanced capability rather than modelling accuracy or computational efficiency that distinguishes the present two phase model from the quasi single phase mixture model in general one of the most important strategies to enhance the quality of computational models for fluvial processes is to incorporate as much physics as possible and thereby minimize the assumptions the present work is just one of the examples with respect to this philosophy i e eliminating the empirical relationship for size specific sediment velocities generic to quasi single phase mixture models by applying the fundamental momentum conservation law for the sediment phase one for each size group to date it remains unclear if such empirical approach is universally applicable for fluvial sediment laden flows most importantly the present tpe model reproduces the finding that the depth averaged longitudinal sediment velocity decreases with the increase of grain size which has been revealed for long by the existing experimental observations and field data but not yet resolved numerically by depth averaged models from this perspective the advantage of the tpe model is obvious it is appreciated that more modelling case studies with observed data are warranted to further demonstrate the superiority of the tpe model over quasi single phase mixture model extension of the present tpe model to two dimensions is warranted for field cases in natural river with complex and irregular topography then it should find wider applications in modelling fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds 4 conclusions a physically enhanced depth averaged two phase model is presented for fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds it is fully coupled and generally applicable as the interactions among water flow sediment and the bed and also among particles of different grain sizes are explicitly accounted for it has been demonstrated to perform rather well when tested against a series of typical cases essentially the present model reproduces the finding that the longitudinal sediment velocity decreases with the increase of grain size which has been revealed for long by the existing experimental observations and field data the depth averaged turbulent reynolds stresses of the fluid phase can be considerable where the flow varies rapidly whilst those of the solid phase are negligible the present work facilitates a promising depth averaged two phase modeling framework for fluvial sediment laden flows over erodible beds yet inevitable uncertainty of the model arises from the estimations of mass exchange between the flow and the bed as well as bed resistances which certainly require systematic fundamental investigations of the mechanisms of fluvial sediment laden flows extension to two dimensions is warranted for

646,interactions between the uprush and backwash waves around a swash zone cause a complex water surface with wave breaking infiltration and exfiltration on a permeable beach face produce significant effects on the bottom shear stress abrupt changes of the bottom shear stress induced by uprush waves onto a dry bed have a significant impact on the estimation of sediment flux in order to simulate with a high degree of accuracy a violent flow with wave breaking and complex moving bed boundaries along the on off shore direction wave motions are solved by using an enhanced particle method based on the mps moving particle semi implicit method while the dem discrete element method is used for a movable bed simulation consequently the high potential of a mps dem coupling model to simulate the swash beach process is clearly demonstrated by comparison with previous experimental results furthermore the significance of the seepage flow in the swash beach process is shown with referring the nielsen s modified shields number keywords mps method dem swash zone sediment transport seepage flow 1 introduction an estimation of swash sediment flux which is driven by an active sediment transport occurs strongly affects the prediction of a beach profile a swash sediment transport rate considerably affects a beach topography change hence the swash sediment transport attracts a high interest for instance the special issue on swash zone processes puleo and butt 2006 puleo and torres freyermuth 2016 has been published in which forefront knowledge of physical processes in the swash zone and less understanding matters have been reviewed exhaustively from the viewpoint of experiments field observations and numerical modeling in the swash zone an active change in the water surface with collapsing turbulent bore and splashes stems from the interaction between uprush and backwash waves consequently complex boundary flows with a drastic change in bottom shear stress are related to the effects of infiltration and exfiltration through the permeable beach face e g butt et al 2001 horn 2006 despite the significance of sediment flux in the swash zone there is insufficient understanding of the mechanisms of sediment transport this is due to the considerable difficulties involved in direct measurement of the swash sediment transport in uprush and backwash waves under shallow water conditions the mechanisms of the swash sediment transport have been investigated based on measurements from on site observations and laboratory experiments which aimed at understanding its mechanism in the last decades there are several findings on the effects of the bottom shear stress bottom friction and seepage flows on the sediment transport as the boundary conditions on the surface of the movable bed they are indispensable for prediction of the swash beach process numerical fluid solvers used in the previous simulations are typically as follows i shallow water equation based swe based model e g packwood 1983 li et al 2002 horn and li 2006 jamal et al 2014 and ii reynolds averaged navier stokes based rans based model e g lara et al 2006 hsu and raubenheimer 2006 lee et al 2007 the volume of fluid vof method is usually applied to capture the free water surface boundaries in the rans based model and the accuracy of the water surface boundaries will be higher than those in the swe based model however the fluid flow field is solved with the eulerian grid in both the swe based and rans based models hence the numerical diffusion due to the advection term cannot be avoided meanwhile sand gravel beach is modeled as a fixed bed including the effects of seepage flow and water table simulations using a movable bed model are rarely found in simulations employing either the swe based or the rans based models for a fluid phase calantoni et al 2006 performed the numerical simulation of swash sediment motions using a dpm discrete particle model as the movable bed model however momentum interactions between solid and fluid solver were not considered preparing accurate boundary conditions for the interstitial swash beach face is one of the key points to perform a reliable simulation of the swash beach process furthermore because violent flows with splashes have a considerable effect on the swash sediment transport applying a numerical solver appropriate for calculating violent flows is of great importance in order to make an accurate prediction of the swash beach process to overcome the numerical diffusion caused by an intrinsic non linearity in the eulerian fluid solver as well as to accurately simulate the swash beach morphology from the particle scale the lagrange lagrange coupling model is considered as a reasonable numerical method for simulating the swash sediment transport two well known lagrangian fluid solvers namely sph smoothed particle hydrodynamics gingold and monaghan 1977 and mps moving particle semi implicit koshizuka and oka 1996 methods have been proven to possess a distinct advantage for simulation of violent free surface fluid flows e g gomez gesteira et al 2010 gotoh and khayyer 2016 the lagrange lagrange model by coupling sph mps with dem discrete element method cundall and strack 1979 has been developed e g robinson et al 2013 tsuruta et al 2017 as well as applied to practical engineering problems e g ren et al 2013 tsuruta et al 2016 however to the best knowledge of authors those lagrange lagrange coupling model has not been applied to the simulation of the swash sediment transport in this paper two dimensional simulation of the swash beach process is carried out applying the enhanced particle method based on the mps method i e mps hs hl ecs gc ds method which is capable of effective simulation of violent flows while the dem is used for the lagrange tracking of individual sediment particles consequently the high potentiality of the proposed mps dem coupling model to simulate swash sediment transport is demonstrated by comparison with the previous experimental results by ma et al 2004 furthermore the mobility of a particle on the surface of the numerical movable bed is evaluated with the nielsen s modified shields number nielsen 1997 including the effect of seepage flows inside the bed because the bottom shear stress is supposed to be affected with these flows as shown in the simulation results the effect of the seepage flows on the sediment transport in the swash zone is clearly derived from the difference of the spatial distributions of the shields number this result supports the significance of seepage flows on the swash beach process 2 outline of numerical simulation 2 1 fluid phase the governing equations of an incompressible viscous fluid are the continuity and the navier stokes equations 1 u l 0 2 d u l d t 1 ρ l p ν 2 u l g 1 ρ l f d r a g where t is the time ρl is the density of the fluid u l is the velocity vector p is the pressure ν is the kinematic viscosity g is the gravitational acceleration vector and f drag is the interaction force vector between the solid and fluid phases it should be noted that the turbulence models such as les or rans are not employed in this study due to the difficulty of setting of boundary conditions for the turbulence models around uneven movable bed as well as due to lack of investigation of turbulent modulation with particle laden for the incorporation with dem particle in the present study the above equations are discretized by an enhanced particle method based on the mps method the enhanced mps method benefits from 5 refined schemes and is abbreviated as mps hs hl ecs gc ds here a concise description of the enhanced mps method which is applied for calculation of the fluid phase is presented detailed descriptions are found in khayyer and gotoh 2009 2010 2011 tsuruta et al 2013 and gotoh and khayyer 2016 the mps method is founded on chorin s projection method corresponding to a helmholtz hodge decomposition chorin 1968 chorin and marsden 1993 where an intermediate velocity field is considered to be composed of a divergence free solenoidal velocity field plus the gradient of a scalar irrotational field as illustrated by khayyer and gotoh 2011 the intermediate velocity field is obtained during a prediction step by considering gravitational and viscous accelerations the interaction forces such as the drag force f drag in eq 2 are also considered at the prediction step the correction step is then performed by considering particles intermediate velocities and positions to obtain the updated pressure field and corresponding pressure gradients projecting the intermediate velocities to a divergence free space the updated pressure field in correction step is obtained through solving a poisson pressure equation ppe which is formulated as follows 3 2 p k 1 i ρ l n 0 δ t d n d t i n i j w r i j i j w i j r i j r j r i where n denotes particle number density n 0 represents the reference initial particle number density r presents the particle position vector w presents kernel function k signifies the calculation step number and δt symbolizes the calculation time step in eq 3 i and j represent a target particle i and a typical neighboring particle j the superscript denotes the pseudo time step k 1 2 corresponding to the end of a prediction step discretization of the source term of ppe right hand side of eq 3 and the laplacian of pressure left hand side of eq 3 are performed by hs higher order source khayyer and gotoh 2009 and hl higher order laplacian khayyer and gotoh 2010 schemes if boundary conditions are precisely prescribed theoretically the pressure field obtained from a ppe in a helmholtz decomposition must lead to an exact projection satisfaction of fluid s incompressibility however due to approximations related to numerical discretizations the projection will not be an exact one and calculations will be accompanied by both instantaneous and accumulative numerical errors to minimize these projection related numerical errors we may benefit from a so called ecs error compensating source scheme the ecs scheme proposed by khayyer and gotoh 2011 is applied in this study accordingly the modified ppe is written as follows 4 2 p k 1 i ρ l n 0 δ t d n d t i s e c s s e c s ρ l δ t α n 0 d n d t i k β δ t n i k n 0 n 0 α n i k n 0 n 0 β δ t n 0 d n d t i k hence the source term of ppe will be comprised of a high order main term hs scheme and ecs term sec s that comprises of two error mitigators multiplied by dynamic coefficients α β as functions of instantaneous flow field another condition for a precise projection is to have accurate calculation of pressure gradients in this regards several issues including stability and consistency are to be considered a proper taylor series consistent pressure gradient model with gradient correction gc khayyer and gotoh 2011 and dynamic stabilization ds tsuruta et al 2013 schemes is expressed as 5 p ρ l i d s ρ l n 0 j i p j p i r i j 2 c i r i j w i j s d s where the gradient correction gc matrix c i is written as 6 c i 1 d s v i j i r i j r i j r i j 2 w i j 1 v i 1 j i w i j with ds being the number of space dimensions in eq 5 the gc matrix guarantees an exact first order consistency and the ds term sds generates minimum required repulsive inter particle forces to avoid particle inter penetration and thus this term ensures the stability of calculations the ds related repulsive forces are dynamically generated based on instantaneous state of flow field and are applied in a radial and anti symmetric and thus momentum conservative form 2 2 solid phase the motion of the individual gravel or plastic particle is simulated by the granular material model gotoh and sakai

as below the relative displacement between contacting particles i and j in the numerical time marching step δts 2 0 10 5 s on the local coordinate o ξζ is written as follows 9 δ ξ i j δ ξ e ξ δ ζ e ς

direction cξ and cζ are the dashpot constants in each direction these spring and dashpot constants are determined based on the hertzian contact theory harada and gotoh 2008 in which the value of the young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν pos are set at e 5 0 106 pa and ν pos 0 3 respectively the inter particle force f clopζ in eq 11 is modified with the frictional coefficient μ 0 577 for gravel 0 3 for plastic particle as follows 12 f c o l p ζ μ f c o l p ξ t h e n f c o l p ζ μ s i g n f c o l p ξ f c o l p ζ where sign l r means the absolute value of l with the sign of r the inter

transport has been demonstrated e g kidanemariam and uhlmann 2014 fukuoka et al 2014 harada et al 2015 2 3 interaction between solid and fluid phases the drag force acting between the solid and fluid

in fig 5 the radius is a parameter and determined so as to yield a reasonable numerical sediment transport rate by comparison to the previous experimental results which will be described in the section 3 1 the drag force acting on the dem solid particle is distributed to the mps fluid particles so that the momentum balance of the interactions between solid and fluid phases is consistently conserved in the present numerical procedure the relation between f drag and f drag i is described as follows 18 f d r a g i 1 n s p f d r a g i w i j j w i j where nsp is the number of solid

the distance between neighboring fluid particles used in the enhanced particle method based on the mps method is 5 0 mm that is the same size as the diameter of solid gravel particle present study simulates the swash beach processes therefore simulations of the sediment transport under unsteady flow conditions will be further required in validation of the mps dem coupling model the simulated sediment transport rate under symmetrical oscillatory flow conditions is compared with the previous experimental results the simulated normalized sediment transport rate over a half period φ to the mobility number θ shows reasonable agreement with the previous experimental results sawamoto and yamashita 1986 as shown in fig 4 which will validate the reproducibility of the mps dem coupling model in addition the comparisons are made by choosing the particle properties of the previous experiments which is similar to that of the present simulation here the normalized sediment transport rate φ is described as follows 22 φ q a v e w 0 d where qave is the averaged sediment transport rate over a half period and w 0 is the settling velocity which is estimated with rubey s equation rubey 1933 the mobility number θ is defined as follows 23 θ 0 5 u 2 σ g 1 g d where u is the amplitude of the velocity outside of the boundary layer 3 3 flows inside permeable bed to show the reproducibility of the mps dem coupling model to the swash beach process the flow field inside a permeable gravel bed is compared with the experimental results by ma et al 2004 the computational domain which is determined based on the experimental setup by ma et al 2004 is depicted in fig 5 the permeable bed comprising of spatially fixed gravel particles diameter d 5 0 mm specific density σg 2 65 with 0 15 m thickness is placed over the impermeable bed with a slope of 1 7 the flows inside the permeable bed under regular wave action with the wave period t 1 7 s and with the wave height of h 0 06 m are examined waves are generated at the end side of the 2 d numerical flume under a water depth of h 0 4 m in the simulation of the section 3 3 the distance between neighboring fluid particles is 5 0 mm that is the same size as the diameter of solid gravel particle the simulated averaged water surface profile on the cross shore direction is compared with the experimental results as well as vof results by ma et al 2004 as shown in fig 6 note that due to computational cost averaged water surface profile is calculated by averaging 10 waves from 9 7 s to 26 7 s although the number of waves is not enough to well reproduce the tendency of wave set up set down toward further rigorous investigation continuous efforts must be made to perform long time simulation by taking advantages of parallel computing the height of the water surface is higher than the experiment in the range from shoreline to x 0 5 m in this area so called swash and surf zones a splashing is observed by the incident plunging jet hence the definition of water surface is considerably difficult here averaged water profile is calculated by the phase averaging of the maximum height of mps fluid particles at the arbitrary x coordinate therefore the tendency of the surface profile with high level is expected to be found in the present simulation moreover the definition of the water surface around swash and surf zones is not sufficiently found in the research paper by ma et al 2004 hence sufficient comparisons of the averaged water surface profile between the previous experiments and the present simulations can not be carried out around swash and surf zones furthermore free surface in the permeable bed is composed of solid liquid gas three phases while the drag force term in this study considers merely solid liquid two phases which will result in the lower level of the simulated water table than that of the experimental one therefore although there will be such discrepancy in the swash surf zones as well as inside permeable bed the tendency of the simulated water surface profile reasonably coincides with that of experiment as well as vof fig 7 shows the simulated flows inside the permeable bed which are compared with the experiment performed by ma et al 2004 the wave breaking is occurred around x 0 45 m in the experiment by ma et al 2004 note that wave breaking is defined as the instant when the wave crest begins to deform similarly that in the present simulation is observed around x 0 45 m the flows are visualized with the injected dye into the permeable bed in the experiment on the other hand in the present simulation that is visualized with the lagrangian massless marker particles allocated as tracers which are moved with the flow velocity in addition the tracers are tracked by the numerical integration with respect to the numerical time marching step by specifically looking at the behavior of the dye in the experiment indicated with arrows in vicinity of the permeable bed surface the exfiltration of dye is found at the foot at x 0 25 m as shown in both snapshots and images which are labeled b c and d in fig 7 then the exuded ink is conveyed onshore although the simulated wave breaking profile shows slight difference with experimental result the exfiltration processes of the dye in the simulation have similar tendencies with those in the experiment 4 morphodynamics in swash zone 4 1 numerical conditions applying the light weight particle to erode a movable bed will be a rational approach to clearly simulate the swash morphodynamics with small number of incident waves in this chapter the numerical movable bed is formed by mixing light weight plastic particles into the gravel particles a schematic diagram of the computational domain is depicted in fig 5 that is the same as the domain used in the section 3 3 except for the properties of the movable bed the movable bed with 0 2 m thickness is composed of gravel specific density σg 2 65 diameter d 5 0 mm and plastic particles specific density σp 1 81 diameter d 5 0 mm whereas the volume ratio of gravel to plastic particles is 7 to 3 the swash beach process is simulated with sorting caused by the regular incident waves with a wave height of h 0 1 m and a wave period t 2 2 s generated from the offshore side of the computational 2 d numerical wave flume under a water depth of h 0 4 m these numerical conditions are determined based on the previous experimental setup by ma et al 2005 and some discussions are made in section 4 4 furthermore in chapter 4 the distance between neighboring fluid particles is 5 0 mm that is the same size as the diameter of solid gravel plastic particles it must be highlighted here that the coarse gravel particles as well as the plastic particles which do not correspond to the natural swash zone gravels are employed in the simulation accordingly the shields number in the simulation is different from that in the natural swash zone resulting in the smaller motions of gravels in addition according to previous studies e g butt et al 2001 the effect of infiltration exfiltration is of little importance when the particle size is larger than 0 5 mm although the particle size in this study is considered to be 5 mm however the influence of infiltration exfiltration is still portrayed in the difference of shields parameters in eqs 24 and 26 described in section 4 2 and furthermore the numerical results are considered to be still worth understanding the mechanism of swash sediment transport which is difficult to be considered by direct measurement 4 2 effect of infiltration and exfiltration fig 8 indicates the snapshot and the difference between the nielsen s modified shields number ψb and usual shields number ψ around the surface of the movable bed during the 1st to 2nd and 9th to 10th periods the shields number ψ for the gravel particle is defined as follows 24 ψ u 2 g d σ g 1 where u is the friction velocity the friction velocity u is estimated with the log law on the rough bed condition using the following equation 25 u u 0 4 in 30 z b 2 5 d where z b is the reference height corresponding to the height of the closest water particle just above the movable bed surface it must be noted that in this study roughness is set equal to 2 5d although the reliability and accuracy of the parameter have not been investigated rigorously this study aims at investigating the effect of infiltration exfiltration and therefore 2 5d is applied meanwhile continuous efforts must be made to perform comprehensive verifications on the sensitivity and reliance of the parameter the velocity component u in the x direction at the reference height and z b are used for the estimation of u the modified shields number ψb is defined as follows 26 ψ b u 2 g d σ g 1 b b β w k where w is the component of the seepage flows in the z direction around the surface of the movable bed β 0 4 is the correction factor for pore effect and k is the hydraulic conductivity here the pressure gradient force showing the effect of the seepage flows infiltration w 0 exfiltration w 0 around the surface of the movable bed is considered by the value of b that is in the denominator of eq 26 in addition the value of β is chosen by referring to the experiments by martin and aral 1971 furthermore since the experiment by martin and aral was carried out with sand the specific density σg 2 65 is applied for the calculation of shields parameter eqs 24 and 26 as for the saturated movable bed case the hydraulic conductivity k is given by the kozeny carman equation carman 1956 as follows 27 k k 0 g d 2 180 v v p v 3 v s v 2 where v is the control volume see fig 5 vp is the volume of the interstitial space fully filled with water in the control volume v and vs is the solid volume for gravel plastic particles in the control volume v while for the unsaturated case the hydraulic conductivity k is described by irmay equation bear et al 1968 as follows 28 k k 0 v w v 3 v s v 2 where vw is the volume of the interstitial space partially filled with water in the control volume v note that in this simulation the effect of the surface tension acting on the interstitial water is neglected the difference between the modified shields number ψb and the usual shields number ψ is normalized by the usual shields number ψ from fig 8 a spatial difference by ranging from 5 to 10 is found around the surface of the movable bed the tip of the uprush wave 0 2 m x 0 4 m in the phase φ 0 4 π 0 1 m x 0 2 m in the phase φ 1 4 π and 0 2 m x 0 4 m in the phase φ 8 4 π and the tip of the backwash wave 0 0 m x 0 1 m in the phase φ 5 4 π consequently the effect of the seepage flows on the swash sediment transport has been found and the significance of the seepage flows to the swash beach process is indicated 4 3 inner structure of movable bed fig 9 depicts the distributions of the particle velocity components up wp and the distribution of the seepage flow velocity components u w in the x and z directions respectively for the typical three moments of wave breaking uprush and backwash at the time t t 5 204 the impinging jet on the surface of the movable bed is observed at the tip of the collapsing wave as shown in the surrounded area by the dashed line the downward infiltration seems to be promoted by the impulsive pressure caused by the impinging jet on the other hand around the fringe of the infiltration area the upward interstitial water toward the surface of the movable bed exfiltration is observed moreover some bed load particles are transported in the onshore direction the snapshot at time t t 5 250 shows the uprushing bore the infiltration flows toward the onshore direction are found inside the surface layer of the movable bed beneath the tip of the uprushing bore and simultaneously there the particles are transported in the onshore direction at the time t t 5 682 although slight seepage flows in the vertical direction occur and remarkable infiltration and exfiltration is not found on the surface of the movable bed the seepage flow toward offshore direction is predominant beneath the tip of the backwash wave and there concurrently particles being transported to the offshore direction are found 4 4 discussions regarding the difference between the modified shields number ψb and the usual shields number ψ and the value of b showing the effect of the infiltration and exfiltration these spatial distributions are shown in fig 10 furthermore the spatial distribution for the magnitude of the bottom friction velocity u is shown in fig 11 at the time t t 5 204 around the area where impinging jet is observed 0 1 m x 0 0 m the modified shields number ψb has a small value as compared to the usual shields number ψ without taking the effect of the seepage flows into account this difference is just attributable to the seepage flows induced by the impinged jet therefore the contribution of the seepage flows to the stability of the surface of the movable bed has been understood in addition the local increase of the bottom friction velocity is confirmed in the same area as shown in fig 11 thus the transport of the particles in the onshore direction in the bed load regime as shown in fig 9 is mainly caused by the local bottom friction velocity resulting from the impinged jet on the surface of the movable bed likewise a decrease of the modified shields number ψb by approx 20 from the normal shields number ψ is observed at the time t t 5 250 and t t 5 682 around the tip of the uprush x 0 2 m and backwash x 0 0 m in fig 10 respectively in the area showing the high value for the bottom friction velocity a significant change is indicated by the difference between the modified shields number ψb and the usual shields number ψ even though the magnitude of the bottom friction velocity is slight the effect of the seepage flows causes the difference between the modified shields number ψb and the normal shields number ψ the discussions mentioned above suggest the possibility of an overestimation of the sediment transport rate when the usual shields number ψ is applied so as to assess it in the area where significant bottom friction velocity u and seepage flow is observed in the aforementioned discussion the friction velocity is derived from logarithmic law corresponding to eq 25 meanwhile in the view of particle based simulation of granular model bottom friction could also be directly obtained by calculating the particle stress 29 u σ z x ρ σ z x 1 n d e m a 2 d 2 j 1 n d e m f c o l p i z l x where a 2 is the two dimensional geometrical coefficient ndem is the number of contacting dem particles over the circle control volume with the radius of 2 4d as shown in fig 5 fcolp i z is vertical component of contact force and lx is horizontal component of distance between contact particles fig 12 presents the horizontal distributions of friction velocity calculated by eq 29 comparing figs 11 and 12 the friction velocity by eq 29 appears to be larger than that by eq 25 as discussed in section 4 2 due to inadequate reliability of the parameter of roughness eq 29 could be an alternative approach to obtain friction velocity on the other hand fig 12 also portrays a certain degree of fluctuation which would be caused from the present simulation using coarse dem particles continuous efforts should be conducted toward improvement as well as development of the appropriate evaluation for friction velocity in order to carry out rigorous investigations in the present simulation the bed morphology in the swash zone is mainly formed by the particles transported in the bed load regime fig 13 portrays two snapshots showing bed morphology and the occupancy of the plastic particles on the surface layer of the movable bed depicted with the color bar at the normalized times of t t 0 0 and t t 10 0 the local deposition with the locally sorted plastic particles is found around the bed surface of the swash zone 0 3 m x 0 1 m at the time t t 10 0 in comparison to that at the time t t 0 0 this kind of depositional tendency found in the swash bed morphology with the sorted particles have been observed in the previous experimental result by ma et al 2005 and a certain level of reproducibility to simulate the swash sediment transport by the mps dem coupling model will be qualitatively indicated 5 conclusions the effect of infiltration and exfiltration on the process of swash sediment transport corresponding to a gravel beach is computationally investigated an enhanced particle method based on the mps method is used for simulating the fluid dynamics whereas the dem is utilized for simulation of the sediment dynamics the newly developed lagrange lagrange coupling model allows simulations to be performed under complex moving boundaries such as the water surface of the breaking wave and the surface of the bottom movable bed these results shall ensure a substantial contribution to the estimation of bottom shear stress necessary for the estimation of the sediment transport rate the effect of seepage flow on the bottom shear stress is shown with referring to a modified shields number the results of the simulation reveal the importance of the seepage flows in the estimation of the sediment transport rate in the near future the hydrodynamic forces acting on each solid particle should be computationally solved using a numerical resolution higher than that in the present simulation in order to achieve more rigorous investigation for the effect of pore water and the effect of the seepage flows on the swash coastal process should be investigated in detail future works also include employment of turbulence models with proper boundary condition around uneven movable bed surface development of enhanced drag force term as well as careful investigations on the accurate evaluation of friction velocity the authors of this paper believe that the development of this kind of lagrange lagrange coupling model will be a powerful and promising tool to assess the swash coastal process acknowledgments we would like to

646,interactions between the uprush and backwash waves around a swash zone cause a complex water surface with wave breaking infiltration and exfiltration on a permeable beach face produce significant effects on the bottom shear stress abrupt changes of the bottom shear stress induced by uprush waves onto a dry bed have a significant impact on the estimation of sediment flux in order to simulate with a high degree of accuracy a violent flow with wave breaking and complex moving bed boundaries along the on off shore direction wave motions are solved by using an enhanced particle method based on the mps moving particle semi implicit method while the dem discrete element method is used for a movable bed simulation consequently the high potential of a mps dem coupling model to simulate the swash beach process is clearly demonstrated by comparison with previous experimental results furthermore the significance of the seepage flow in the swash beach process is shown with referring the nielsen s modified shields number keywords mps method dem swash zone sediment transport seepage flow 1 introduction an estimation of swash sediment flux which is driven by an active sediment transport occurs strongly affects the prediction of a beach profile a swash sediment transport rate considerably affects a beach topography change hence the swash sediment transport attracts a high interest for instance the special issue on swash zone processes puleo and butt 2006 puleo and torres freyermuth 2016 has been published in which forefront knowledge of physical processes in the swash zone and less understanding matters have been reviewed exhaustively from the viewpoint of experiments field observations and numerical modeling in the swash zone an active change in the water surface with collapsing turbulent bore and splashes stems from the interaction between uprush and backwash waves consequently complex boundary flows with a drastic change in bottom shear stress are related to the effects of infiltration and exfiltration through the permeable beach face e g butt et al 2001 horn 2006 despite the significance of sediment flux in the swash zone there is insufficient understanding of the mechanisms of sediment transport this is due to the considerable difficulties involved in direct measurement of the swash sediment transport in uprush and backwash waves under shallow water conditions the mechanisms of the swash sediment transport have been investigated based on measurements from on site observations and laboratory experiments which aimed at understanding its mechanism in the last decades there are several findings on the effects of the bottom shear stress bottom friction and seepage flows on the sediment transport as the boundary conditions on the surface of the movable bed they are indispensable for prediction of the swash beach process numerical fluid solvers used in the previous simulations are typically as follows i shallow water equation based swe based model e g packwood 1983 li et al 2002 horn and li 2006 jamal et al 2014 and ii reynolds averaged navier stokes based rans based model e g lara et al 2006 hsu and raubenheimer 2006 lee et al 2007 the volume of fluid vof method is usually applied to capture the free water surface boundaries in the rans based model and the accuracy of the water surface boundaries will be higher than those in the swe based model however the fluid flow field is solved with the eulerian grid in both the swe based and rans based models hence the numerical diffusion due to the advection term cannot be avoided meanwhile sand gravel beach is modeled as a fixed bed including the effects of seepage flow and water table simulations using a movable bed model are rarely found in simulations employing either the swe based or the rans based models for a fluid phase calantoni et al 2006 performed the numerical simulation of swash sediment motions using a dpm discrete particle model as the movable bed model however momentum interactions between solid and fluid solver were not considered preparing accurate boundary conditions for the interstitial swash beach face is one of the key points to perform a reliable simulation of the swash beach process furthermore because violent flows with splashes have a considerable effect on the swash sediment transport applying a numerical solver appropriate for calculating violent flows is of great importance in order to make an accurate prediction of the swash beach process to overcome the numerical diffusion caused by an intrinsic non linearity in the eulerian fluid solver as well as to accurately simulate the swash beach morphology from the particle scale the lagrange lagrange coupling model is considered as a reasonable numerical method for simulating the swash sediment transport two well known lagrangian fluid solvers namely sph smoothed particle hydrodynamics gingold and monaghan 1977 and mps moving particle semi implicit koshizuka and oka 1996 methods have been proven to possess a distinct advantage for simulation of violent free surface fluid flows e g gomez gesteira et al 2010 gotoh and khayyer 2016 the lagrange lagrange model by coupling sph mps with dem discrete element method cundall and strack 1979 has been developed e g robinson et al 2013 tsuruta et al 2017 as well as applied to practical engineering problems e g ren et al 2013 tsuruta et al 2016 however to the best knowledge of authors those lagrange lagrange coupling model has not been applied to the simulation of the swash sediment transport in this paper two dimensional simulation of the swash beach process is carried out applying the enhanced particle method based on the mps method i e mps hs hl ecs gc ds method which is capable of effective simulation of violent flows while the dem is used for the lagrange tracking of individual sediment particles consequently the high potentiality of the proposed mps dem coupling model to simulate swash sediment transport is demonstrated by comparison with the previous experimental results by ma et al 2004 furthermore the mobility of a particle on the surface of the numerical movable bed is evaluated with the nielsen s modified shields number nielsen 1997 including the effect of seepage flows inside the bed because the bottom shear stress is supposed to be affected with these flows as shown in the simulation results the effect of the seepage flows on the sediment transport in the swash zone is clearly derived from the difference of the spatial distributions of the shields number this result supports the significance of seepage flows on the swash beach process 2 outline of numerical simulation 2 1 fluid phase the governing equations of an incompressible viscous fluid are the continuity and the navier stokes equations 1 u l 0 2 d u l d t 1 ρ l p ν 2 u l g 1 ρ l f d r a g where t is the time ρl is the density of the fluid u l is the velocity vector p is the pressure ν is the kinematic viscosity g is the gravitational acceleration vector and f drag is the interaction force vector between the solid and fluid phases it should be noted that the turbulence models such as les or rans are not employed in this study due to the difficulty of setting of boundary conditions for the turbulence models around uneven movable bed as well as due to lack of investigation of turbulent modulation with particle laden for the incorporation with dem particle in the present study the above equations are discretized by an enhanced particle method based on the mps method the enhanced mps method benefits from 5 refined schemes and is abbreviated as mps hs hl ecs gc ds here a concise description of the enhanced mps method which is applied for calculation of the fluid phase is presented detailed descriptions are found in khayyer and gotoh 2009 2010 2011 tsuruta et al 2013 and gotoh and khayyer 2016 the mps method is founded on chorin s projection method corresponding to a helmholtz hodge decomposition chorin 1968 chorin and marsden 1993 where an intermediate velocity field is considered to be composed of a divergence free solenoidal velocity field plus the gradient of a scalar irrotational field as illustrated by khayyer and gotoh 2011 the intermediate velocity field is obtained during a prediction step by considering gravitational and viscous accelerations the interaction forces such as the drag force f drag in eq 2 are also considered at the prediction step the correction step is then performed by considering particles intermediate velocities and positions to obtain the updated pressure field and corresponding pressure gradients projecting the intermediate velocities to a divergence free space the updated pressure field in correction step is obtained through solving a poisson pressure equation ppe which is formulated as follows 3 2 p k 1 i ρ l n 0 δ t d n d t i n i j w r i j i j w i j r i j r j r i where n denotes particle number density n 0 represents the reference initial particle number density r presents the particle position vector w presents kernel function k signifies the calculation step number and δt symbolizes the calculation time step in eq 3 i and j represent a target particle i and a typical neighboring particle j the superscript denotes the pseudo time step k 1 2 corresponding to the end of a prediction step discretization of the source term of ppe right hand side of eq 3 and the laplacian of pressure left hand side of eq 3 are performed by hs higher order source khayyer and gotoh 2009 and hl higher order laplacian khayyer and gotoh 2010 schemes if boundary conditions are precisely prescribed theoretically the pressure field obtained from a ppe in a helmholtz decomposition must lead to an exact projection satisfaction of fluid s incompressibility however due to approximations related to numerical discretizations the projection will not be an exact one and calculations will be accompanied by both instantaneous and accumulative numerical errors to minimize these projection related numerical errors we may benefit from a so called ecs error compensating source scheme the ecs scheme proposed by khayyer and gotoh 2011 is applied in this study accordingly the modified ppe is written as follows 4 2 p k 1 i ρ l n 0 δ t d n d t i s e c s s e c s ρ l δ t α n 0 d n d t i k β δ t n i k n 0 n 0 α n i k n 0 n 0 β δ t n 0 d n d t i k hence the source term of ppe will be comprised of a high order main term hs scheme and ecs term sec s that comprises of two error mitigators multiplied by dynamic coefficients α β as functions of instantaneous flow field another condition for a precise projection is to have accurate calculation of pressure gradients in this regards several issues including stability and consistency are to be considered a proper taylor series consistent pressure gradient model with gradient correction gc khayyer and gotoh 2011 and dynamic stabilization ds tsuruta et al 2013 schemes is expressed as 5 p ρ l i d s ρ l n 0 j i p j p i r i j 2 c i r i j w i j s d s where the gradient correction gc matrix c i is written as 6 c i 1 d s v i j i r i j r i j r i j 2 w i j 1 v i 1 j i w i j with ds being the number of space dimensions in eq 5 the gc matrix guarantees an exact first order consistency and the ds term sds generates minimum required repulsive inter particle forces to avoid particle inter penetration and thus this term ensures the stability of calculations the ds related repulsive forces are dynamically generated based on instantaneous state of flow field and are applied in a radial and anti symmetric and thus momentum conservative form 2 2 solid phase the motion of the individual gravel or plastic particle is simulated by the granular material model gotoh and sakai 1997 harada and gotoh 2008 based on the dem cundall and strack 1979 the translational and rotational equations are as follows 7 δ ρ l c m ρ s a 3 d 3 d u s d t ρ s δ ρ l a 3 d 3 g f c o l p i δ f d r

at contacting or colliding points between solid particles outline of the formulation of the spring and dashpot system is based on the granular material model gotoh and sakai 1997 harada and gotoh 2008 as below the relative displacement between contacting particles i and j in the numerical time marching step δts 2 0 10 5 s on the local coordinate o ξζ is written as follows 9 δ ξ i j δ ξ e ξ δ ζ e ς where the subscripts ξ and ζ indicate directions corresponding to the local coordinate ξ and ζ respectively as shown in fig 1 ξ axis extends from the gravity centers of ith particle to that of jth particle and ζ axis is in the perpendicular to the ξ axis e ξ and e ζ are the unit vector in each direction and δξ and δζ are the components of the vector of the relative displacement between particles i and j in each direction the inter particle forces in the directions ξ and ζ can be written as follows 10 f c o l p ξ f c o l p ξ e ξ s p r e ξ k ξ δ ξ c ξ δ ξ δ t s e ξ 11 f c o l p ζ f c

direction cξ and cζ are the dashpot constants in each direction these spring and dashpot constants are determined based on the hertzian contact theory harada and gotoh 2008 in which the value of the young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν pos are set at e 5 0 106 pa and ν pos 0 3 respectively the inter particle force f clopζ in eq 11 is modified with the frictional coefficient μ 0 577 for gravel 0 3 for plastic particle as follows 12 f c o l p ζ μ f c o l p ξ t h e n f c o l p ζ μ s i g n f c o l p ξ f c o l p ζ where sign l r means the absolute value of l with the sign of r the inter particle force acting on the ith particle from other jth particles on the global coordinate o xz is calculated with the transformation matrix as follows 13 f c o l p i j m t f c o l p f c o l p f c o l p ξ f c o l p ζ where m t is the matrix for the translational direction while the torque acting on the ith particle from other jth particles is described as follows 14 t c o l p i d 2 j e ξ f c o l p in addition there are many studies for numerical simulations of sediment transport using the dem based model where the effectiveness of applying the dem to investigate mechanism of the sediment transport has been demonstrated e g kidanemariam and uhlmann 2014 fukuoka et al 2014 harada et al 2015 2 3 interaction between solid and fluid phases the drag force acting between the solid and fluid phases is described with the voidage function f proposed by di felice 1994 as follows 15 f d r a g i 1 2 f ρ l c d a 2 d 2 u l u s u l u s 16 f ε ξ ξ 3 7 0 65 exp 1 5 log re p 2 2 17 c d 0 63 4 8 re p

in fig 5 the radius is a parameter and determined so as to yield a reasonable numerical sediment transport rate by comparison to the previous experimental results which will be described in the section 3 1 the drag force acting on the dem solid particle is distributed to the mps fluid particles so that the momentum balance of the interactions between solid and fluid phases is consistently conserved in the present numerical procedure the relation between f drag and f drag i is described as follows 18 f d r a g i 1 n s p f d r a g i w i j j w i j where nsp is the number of solid particles in the interaction area and the kernel function wij used in the present mps base fluid solver is as follows 19 w i j 1 r i j r e 4 4 r i j r e 1 f o r r i j r e 0 o t h e r w i s e where re is the radius of the kernel the conceptual diagram is illustrated in fig 2 3 validation of mps dem coupling model 3 1 dem solid particle motions under uniform flow condition the computational domain used in the model validation under uniform flow condition is the two dimensional 2 d water pipe the scale of which is 0 5 m in height and 5 0 m in length fixed wall boundary condition is set in both top and bottom of the computational domain and periodic boundary condition is imposed in the horizontal direction of the 2 d water pipe the movable bed is set at the bottom of the 2 d water pipe with 0 1 m in thickness and is composed of assembly of the uniform particle with 5 0 mm in diameter and with 2 65 in specific density the simulated sediment transport rate under periodically uniform flow conditions by the mps dem coupling model is validated by comparison with the empirical formula of meyer peter and müller 1948 described as follows 20 q 8 ψ u n i ψ u n i c 1 5 where q is the

müller in the wide range from the critical shear stress to the high bottom shear stress as shown in fig 3 in addition in this section 3 1 the distance between neighboring fluid particles used in the enhanced particle method based on the mps method is 5 mm that is the same size as the diameter of solid gravel particle 3 2 dem solid particle motions under oscillatory flow condition the computational domain used in the model validation under oscillatory flow condition is the 2 d water pipe the scale of which is 0 1 m in height and 0 3 m in length a fixed wall boundary condition is set in both top and bottom of the computational domain and a periodic boundary condition is imposed in the horizontal direction of the 2 d water pipe the movable bed is set at the bottom of the 2 d water pipe with 0 05 m in thickness and is composed of an assembly of uniform gravel particles with a diameter of d 5 0 mm and a specific density of gravel σg 2 65 in the simulation of the section 3 2 the distance between neighboring fluid particles used in the enhanced particle method based on the mps method is 5 0 mm that is the same size as the diameter of solid gravel particle present study simulates the swash beach processes therefore simulations of the sediment transport under unsteady flow conditions will be further required in validation of the mps dem coupling model the simulated sediment transport rate under symmetrical oscillatory flow conditions is compared with the previous experimental results the simulated normalized sediment transport rate over a half period φ to the mobility number θ shows reasonable agreement with the previous experimental results sawamoto and yamashita 1986 as shown in fig 4 which will validate the reproducibility of the mps dem coupling model in addition the comparisons are made by choosing the particle properties of the previous experiments which is similar to that of the present simulation here the normalized sediment transport rate φ is described as follows 22 φ q a v e w 0 d where qave is the averaged sediment transport rate over a half period and w 0 is the settling velocity which is estimated with rubey s equation rubey 1933 the mobility number θ is defined as follows 23 θ 0 5 u 2 σ g 1 g d where u is the amplitude of the velocity outside of the boundary layer 3 3 flows inside permeable bed to show the reproducibility of the mps dem coupling model to the swash beach process the flow field inside a permeable gravel bed is compared with the experimental results by ma et al 2004 the computational domain which is determined based on the experimental setup by ma et al 2004 is depicted in fig 5 the permeable bed comprising of spatially fixed gravel particles diameter d 5 0 mm specific density σg 2 65 with 0 15 m thickness is placed over the impermeable bed with a slope of 1 7 the flows inside the permeable bed under regular wave action with the wave period t 1 7 s and with the wave height of h 0 06 m are examined waves are generated at the end side of the 2 d numerical flume under a water depth of h 0 4 m in the simulation of the section 3 3 the distance between neighboring fluid particles is 5 0 mm that is the same size as the diameter of solid gravel particle the simulated averaged water surface profile on the cross shore direction is compared with the experimental results as well as vof results by ma et al 2004 as shown in fig 6 note that due to computational cost averaged water surface profile is calculated by averaging 10 waves from 9 7 s to 26 7 s although the number of waves is not enough to well reproduce the tendency of wave set up set down toward further rigorous investigation continuous efforts must be made to perform long time simulation by taking advantages of parallel computing the height of the water surface is higher than the experiment in the range from shoreline to x 0 5 m in this area so called swash and surf zones a splashing is observed by the incident plunging jet hence the definition of water surface is considerably difficult here averaged water profile is calculated by the phase averaging of the maximum height of mps fluid particles at the arbitrary x coordinate therefore the tendency of the surface profile with high level is expected to be found in the present simulation moreover the definition of the water surface around swash and surf zones is not sufficiently found in the research paper by ma et al 2004 hence sufficient comparisons of the averaged water surface profile between the previous experiments and the present simulations can not be carried out around swash and surf zones furthermore free surface in the permeable bed is composed of solid liquid gas three phases while the drag force term in this study considers merely solid liquid two phases which will result in the lower level of the simulated water table than that of the experimental one therefore although there will be such discrepancy in the swash surf zones as well as inside permeable bed the tendency of the simulated water surface profile reasonably coincides with that of experiment as well as vof fig 7 shows the simulated flows inside the permeable bed which are compared with the experiment performed by ma et al 2004 the wave breaking is occurred around x 0 45 m in the experiment by ma et al 2004 note that wave breaking is defined as the instant when the wave crest begins to deform similarly that in the present simulation is observed around x 0 45 m the flows are visualized with the injected dye into the permeable bed in the experiment on the other hand in the present simulation that is visualized with the lagrangian massless marker particles allocated as tracers which are moved with the flow velocity in addition the tracers are tracked by the numerical integration with respect to the numerical time marching step by specifically looking at the behavior of the dye in the experiment indicated with arrows in vicinity of the permeable bed surface the exfiltration of dye is found at the foot at x 0 25 m as shown in both snapshots and images which are labeled b c and d in fig 7 then the exuded ink is conveyed onshore although the simulated wave breaking profile shows slight difference with experimental result the exfiltration processes of the dye in the simulation have similar tendencies with those in the experiment 4 morphodynamics in swash zone 4 1 numerical conditions applying the light weight particle to erode a movable bed will be a rational approach to clearly simulate the swash morphodynamics with small number of incident waves in this chapter the numerical movable bed is formed by mixing light weight plastic particles into the gravel particles a schematic diagram of the computational domain is depicted in fig 5 that is the same as the domain used in the section 3 3 except for the properties of the movable bed the movable bed with 0 2 m thickness is composed of gravel specific density σg 2 65 diameter d 5 0 mm and plastic particles specific density σp 1 81 diameter d 5 0 mm whereas the volume ratio of gravel to plastic particles is 7 to 3 the swash beach process is simulated with sorting caused by the regular incident waves with a wave height of h 0 1 m and a wave period t 2 2 s generated from the offshore side of the computational 2 d numerical wave flume under a water depth of h 0 4 m these numerical conditions are determined based on the previous experimental setup by ma et al 2005 and some discussions are made in section 4 4 furthermore in chapter 4 the distance between neighboring fluid particles is 5 0 mm that is the same size as the diameter of solid gravel plastic particles it must be highlighted here that the coarse gravel particles as well as the plastic particles which do not correspond to the natural swash zone gravels are employed in the simulation accordingly the shields number in the simulation is different from that in the natural swash zone resulting in the smaller motions of gravels in addition according to previous studies e g butt et al 2001 the effect of infiltration exfiltration is of little importance when the particle size is larger than 0 5 mm although the particle size in this study is considered to be 5 mm however the influence of infiltration exfiltration is still portrayed in the difference of shields parameters in eqs 24 and 26 described in section 4 2 and furthermore the numerical results are considered to be still worth understanding the mechanism of swash sediment transport which is difficult to be considered by direct measurement 4 2 effect of infiltration and exfiltration fig 8 indicates the snapshot and the difference between the nielsen s modified shields number ψb and usual shields number ψ around the surface of the movable bed during the 1st to 2nd and 9th to 10th periods the shields number ψ for the gravel particle is defined as follows 24 ψ u 2 g d σ g 1 where u is the friction velocity the friction velocity u is estimated with the log law on the rough bed condition using the following equation 25 u u 0 4 in 30 z b 2 5 d where z b is the reference height corresponding to the height of the closest water particle just above the movable bed surface it must be noted that in this study roughness is set equal to 2 5d although the reliability and accuracy of the parameter have not been investigated rigorously this study aims at investigating the effect of infiltration exfiltration and therefore 2 5d is applied meanwhile continuous efforts must be made to perform comprehensive verifications on the sensitivity and reliance of the parameter the velocity component u in the x direction at the reference height and z b are used for the estimation of u the modified shields number ψb is defined as follows 26 ψ b u 2 g d σ g 1 b b β w k where w is the component of the seepage flows in the z direction around the surface of the movable bed β 0 4 is the correction factor for pore effect and k is the hydraulic conductivity here the pressure gradient force showing the effect of the seepage flows infiltration w 0 exfiltration w 0 around the surface of the movable bed is considered by the value of b that is in the denominator of eq 26 in addition the value of β is chosen by referring to the experiments by martin and aral 1971 furthermore since the experiment by martin and aral was carried out with sand the specific density σg 2 65 is applied for the calculation of shields parameter eqs 24 and 26 as for the saturated movable bed case the hydraulic conductivity k is given by the kozeny carman equation carman 1956 as follows 27 k k 0 g d 2 180 v v p v 3 v s v 2 where v is the control volume see fig 5 vp is the volume of the interstitial space fully filled with water in the control volume v and vs is the solid volume for gravel plastic particles in the control volume v while for the unsaturated case the hydraulic conductivity k is described by irmay equation bear et al 1968 as follows 28 k k 0 v w v 3 v s v 2 where vw is the volume of the interstitial space partially filled with water in the control volume v note that in this simulation the effect of the surface tension acting on the interstitial water is neglected the difference between the modified shields number ψb and the usual shields number ψ is normalized by the usual shields number ψ from fig 8 a spatial difference by ranging from 5 to 10 is found around the surface of the movable bed the tip of the uprush wave 0 2 m x 0 4 m in the phase φ 0 4 π 0 1 m x 0 2 m in the phase φ 1 4 π and 0 2 m x 0 4 m in the phase φ 8 4 π and the tip of the backwash wave 0 0 m x 0 1 m in the phase φ 5 4 π consequently the effect of the seepage flows on the swash sediment transport has been found and the significance of the seepage flows to the swash beach process is indicated 4 3 inner structure of movable bed fig 9 depicts the distributions of the particle velocity components up wp and the distribution of the seepage flow velocity components u w in the x and z directions respectively for the typical three moments of wave breaking uprush and backwash at the time t t 5 204 the impinging jet on the surface of the movable bed is observed at the tip of the collapsing wave as shown in the surrounded area by the dashed line the downward infiltration seems to be promoted by the impulsive pressure caused by the impinging jet on the other hand around the fringe of the infiltration area the upward interstitial water toward the surface of the movable bed exfiltration is observed moreover some bed load particles are transported in the onshore direction the snapshot at time t t 5 250 shows the uprushing bore the infiltration flows toward the onshore direction are found inside the surface layer of the movable bed beneath the tip of the uprushing bore and simultaneously there the particles are transported in the onshore direction at the time t t 5 682 although slight seepage flows in the vertical direction occur and remarkable infiltration and exfiltration is not found on the surface of the movable bed the seepage flow toward offshore direction is predominant beneath the tip of the backwash wave and there concurrently particles being transported to the offshore direction are found 4 4 discussions regarding the difference between the modified shields number ψb and the usual shields number ψ and the value of b showing the effect of the infiltration and exfiltration these spatial distributions are shown in fig 10 furthermore the spatial distribution for the magnitude of the bottom friction velocity u is shown in fig 11 at the time t t 5 204 around the area where impinging jet is observed 0 1 m x 0 0 m the modified shields number ψb has a small value as compared to the usual shields number ψ without taking the effect of the seepage flows into account this difference is just attributable to the seepage flows induced by the impinged jet therefore the contribution of the seepage flows to the stability of the surface of the movable bed has been understood in addition the local increase of the bottom friction velocity is confirmed in the same area as shown in fig 11 thus the transport of the particles in the onshore direction in the bed load regime as shown in fig 9 is mainly caused by the local bottom friction velocity resulting from the impinged jet on the surface of the movable bed likewise a decrease of the modified shields number ψb by approx 20 from the normal shields number ψ is observed at the time t t 5 250 and t t 5 682 around the tip of the uprush x 0 2 m and backwash x 0 0 m in fig 10 respectively in the area showing the high value for the bottom friction velocity a significant change is indicated by the difference between the modified shields number ψb and the usual shields number ψ even though the magnitude of the bottom friction velocity is slight the effect of the seepage flows causes the difference between the modified shields number ψb and the normal shields number ψ the discussions mentioned above suggest the possibility of an overestimation of the sediment transport rate when the usual shields number ψ is applied so as to assess it in the area where significant bottom friction velocity u and seepage flow is observed in the aforementioned discussion the friction velocity is derived from logarithmic law corresponding to eq 25 meanwhile in the view of particle based simulation of granular model bottom friction could also be directly obtained by calculating the particle stress 29 u σ z x ρ σ z x 1 n d e m a 2 d 2 j 1 n d e m f c o l p i z l x where a 2 is the two dimensional geometrical coefficient ndem is the number of contacting dem particles over the circle control volume with the radius of 2 4d as shown in fig 5 fcolp i z is vertical component of contact force and lx is horizontal component of distance between contact particles fig 12 presents the horizontal distributions of friction velocity calculated by eq 29 comparing figs 11 and 12 the friction velocity by eq 29 appears to be larger than that by eq 25 as discussed in section 4 2 due to inadequate reliability of the parameter of roughness eq 29 could be an alternative approach to obtain friction velocity on the other hand fig 12 also portrays a certain degree of fluctuation which would be caused from the present simulation using coarse dem particles continuous efforts should be conducted toward improvement as well as development of the appropriate evaluation for friction velocity in order to carry out rigorous investigations in the present simulation the bed morphology in the swash zone is mainly formed by the particles transported in the bed load regime fig 13 portrays two snapshots showing bed morphology and the occupancy of the plastic particles on the surface layer of the movable bed depicted with the color bar at the normalized times of t t 0 0 and t t 10 0 the local deposition with the locally sorted plastic particles is found around the bed surface of the swash zone 0 3 m x 0 1 m at the time t t 10 0 in comparison to that at the time t t 0 0 this kind of depositional tendency found in the swash bed morphology with the sorted particles have been observed in the previous experimental result by ma et al 2005 and a certain level of reproducibility to simulate the swash sediment transport by the mps dem coupling model will be qualitatively indicated 5 conclusions the effect of infiltration and exfiltration on the process of swash sediment transport corresponding to a gravel beach is computationally investigated an enhanced particle method based on the mps method is used for simulating the fluid dynamics whereas the dem is utilized for simulation of the sediment dynamics the newly developed lagrange lagrange coupling model allows simulations to be performed under complex moving boundaries such as the water surface of the breaking wave and the surface of the bottom movable bed these results shall ensure a substantial contribution to the estimation of bottom shear stress necessary for the estimation of the sediment transport rate the effect of seepage flow on the bottom shear stress is shown with referring to a modified shields number the results of the simulation reveal the importance of the seepage flows in the estimation of the sediment transport rate in the near future the hydrodynamic forces acting on each solid particle should be computationally solved using a numerical resolution higher than that in the present simulation in order to achieve more rigorous investigation for the effect of pore water and the effect of the seepage flows on the swash coastal process should be investigated in detail future works also include employment of turbulence models with proper boundary condition around uneven movable bed surface development of enhanced drag force term as well as careful investigations on the accurate evaluation of friction velocity the authors of this paper believe that the development of this kind of lagrange lagrange coupling model will be a powerful and promising tool to assess the swash coastal process acknowledgments we would like to

647,we phrase and solve boundary value problems for the segregation of spheres with either equal density and different sizes or the same size and different densities in flows of a clear fluid driven by gravity over an inclined erodible bed in a wide channel we assume that the flow is steady and uniform collisions between particles dissipate little energy and the sizes and masses of the particles are not too different for particles of the same material with diameters that differ by as little as ten per cent we find that the flow features such as velocity granular temperature and solid concentration profiles are significantly different from those for a flow of a single species with a diameter equal to the average of the two diameters in particular the total particle flux of the mixture is significantly larger keywords size segregation mass segregation kinetic theory particle fluid flow 1 introduction particle segregation has important implications both for industrial activities involving the production transportation and packing of granular media where it is often undesired muzzio et al 2002 and for its influence on the strength and extent of natural phenomena such as rock debris flows armanini et al 2005 berzi et al 2010 and pyroclastic density currents dellino et al 2008 sulpizio et al 2014 many experiments showed that in inclined flows of mixtures of particles of the same materials that differ in size the larger ones tend to rise e g drahun and bridgwater 1983 however despite the importance of particle segregation the theoretical framework developed for its description is still incomplete and mostly devoted to dry flows the majority of the approaches are based on continuum mixture theory e g atkin 1976 gray and ancey 2011 fan et al 2014 however we recently have proposed a more fundamental theory for dry bimodal granular mixtures in the context of kinetic theory in which all parameters depend on measured particles properties their size material density and coefficient of restitution larcher and jenkins 2013 larcher and jenkins 2015 this paper extends the approach to particle fluid flows and again relies only on measured particle properties without any adjustable parameters the granular phase is driven both by the effect of gravity and by a shear stress due to the presence of a layer of turbulent fluid on top in the model both effects can be controlled separately and thus describe both mature and immature debris flows and intense sediment transport dominated by particle collisions however in order to keep the physical mechanisms accessible we employ the simplest theory for segregation that results from the kinetic theory for binary mixtures arnarson and jenkins 2004 it applies to collisional flows in which little energy is dissipated in collisions between two types of spheres that do not differ much in size and mass we believe that it is important to obtain results for the simplest theory before introducing the additional complications associated with the greater dissipation due to the influence of viscosity on the particle interactions gondret et al 2002 the flow model is based on the balance of mass momentum and energy for the mixture of fluid and particles and the segregation is described by an equation related to the difference of the momentum balances of the individual species of particles arnarson and jenkins 2000 we focus on steady fully developed flows of a mixture of water and spherical particles of two different radii ra and rb made of the same material and spherical particles of the same radius made of different materials the hydrodynamic model is similar to that employed by pasini and jenkins pasini and jenkins 2005 and the segregation model is that introduced by arnarson and jenkins arnarson and jenkins 2004 we consider flows that are driven down inclined erodible beds by gravity and the shear stress of a clear turbulent fluid above the particles fig 1 we predict profiles of mixture volume fraction or concentration c particle velocity u fluid velocity u and species volume fractions ca and cb 2 balance equations the problem can be phrased in terms of six balance equations the momentum balances of the particle mixture and of the fluid in directions parallel and perpendicular to the main flow the balance of fluctuation energy of the particles and a weighted difference of the individual momentum balances of the two particle species perpendicular to the flow we denote the mass densities of the pure fluid and the material of the particles by ρ and ρ p respectively and introduce the relative density σ ρ p ρ then the buoyant gravitational acceleration g is defined in terms of the gravitational acceleration g and σ by g 1 1 σ the reynolds number r based on the fall velocity of a single particle is d g d 1 2 ν where ν is the ratio of the molecular viscosity of the fluid to its mass density also known as kinematic viscosity in what follows lengths have been made dimensionless by the average particle diameter d velocities by the square root of the product of the buoyant gravitational acceleration and d stresses by the product of ρp g and d and energy flux by ρ p g d 3 2 the restriction of the problem to particles that differ little in radii and masses permits a simplified description of the mixture in which all quantities can be expanded about the values of a single constituent with the average diameter and average mass of the two species and a concentration equal to that of the mixture the restriction to nearly elastic interactions while not necessarily realistic allows us to obtain the predictions for the simplest possible collisional flow theory these we expect will exhibit the qualitative features of more complicated and realistic collisional theories garzo and dufty 1999 2 1 dimensionless balance of particle momentum in normal direction the balance of normal particle momentum relates the gradients of

particles are immersed in a liquid the kinetic theory still applies however more dissipative collisions are expected e g joseph et al 2001 the coefficient of restitution is therefore expected to be smaller than in a dry flow with the same particles and to be a function of the local stokes number e g armanini et al 2009 in the present paper because experiments are not available to compare with we employ a constant coefficient of restitution 3 boundary value problem the dimensionless fluid shear stress sh the shields parameter at the top of the collisional flow the angle of inclination and the fraction fa of particles of the species a over the total number of particles of a and b contained in the mixture or in an approximation the value ix of the integral of na n at the top of the flow are

equivalent to the shear stress of a clear turbulent fluid with a depth of about eleven average particle diameters above the collisional flow the flow depth h is provided by the numerical solution profiles of the fluid particle and particle fluctuation velocity are shown in fig 2 the mixture properties are obtained through the linearization of the kinetic theory for flows of two types of spheres this results in transport coefficients that are the product of the properties for a homogeneous mixtures of spheres having the average size and mass multiplied by coefficients that are function of the local measure of segregation x and of the radii and mass difference through δr and δm this is shown in eq 2 for the particle pressure in eq 11 for the particle shear stress in eq 14 for the energy dissipation and in eq 15 for the flux of the particle fluctuating energy these coefficient determine the difference between the flow of a single species mixture and the flow of a bimodal mixture and the differences are enhanced when these coefficients are significantly different from unity in fig 3 we show profiles of the mixture concentration and the concentrations of the two species a and b according to the structure of eq 38 the larger particles tend to concentrate in the cooler regions where the granular temperature or equivalently the particle velocity fluctuations are smaller see fig 2 the segregation equation is derived from a weighted difference of the normal momentum balances of the two species consequently it offers the possibility to predict situations beyond the simple mechanism of kinetic sieving introduced by savage and lun 1988 and adopted in many subsequent phenomenological approaches kinetic theory bases the prediction on the effects of velocity fluctuations gravity and diffusion and can therefore predict cases in which the larger particles tend to move upwards e g larcher and jenkins 2013 and larcher and jenkins 2015 or downwards as in this case in fig 4 we show the volume flux of the particles defined as the integral through the flow depth of the product of the particle velocity u and of the mixture concentration c the presence of two particle species appears to significantly affect the particle flux and the flow depth which for these flow conditions are both larger than for a single species with the average size and mass the radii and masses of the particles of the mixture differ by ten and 33 per cent respectively the larger with respect to the smaller as a consequence the predicted depths of the flows of the mixture and the single species differ significantly and the total volume flux of particles per unit thickness of the flow for the mixture is about twice as large as that for the single species the differences are due to the influence of the two species size and mass in the transport coefficients this results in separate relatively small differences in the average velocities and average concentrations that accumulate when integrated through the depth of the flow in fig 5 we consider the flow of two types of spheres having the same size ra rb but made of different materials in order to obtain the same mass ratio ma mb 1 33 of the system presented above also all the other involved parameters are kept unmodified e 0 8 ρp ρ 1 54 d 0 37 mm sh 0 22 φ 0 03 fa 0 50 the profiles of particle velocity particle velocity fluctuations and fluid velocity are almost identical for the case of the mixture and for the flow of a single species made of spheres having the average mass m ma mb 2 the fluid velocity is systematically larger than the particle velocity so that the velocity difference between the two phases results in a drag force driving the particles to be added to the effect of gravity also the mixture concentration fig 6 and the volume flux fig 7 are very similar for the two systems leading to the conclusion that the size difference plays a significantly more important role in granular segregation than the mass difference this was already shown in the case of dense dry inclined flows larcher and jenkins 2015 in fig 6 it is also seen in accord with previous studies drahun and bridgwater 1983 that the heavier spheres are more concentrated in the lower regions of the flow in fact according to kinetic theory three mechanisms coexist and are responsible for granular segregation gravity that tends to move the heavier species of the same size downwards gradients in granular temperature that tend to move the larger particles of the same material towards the cooler regions and diffusion that opposes segregation the balance of these three mechanisms determines the concentration profiles of the two species accordingly to this picture fig 6 shows that the heavier particles actually tend to concentrate in the lower region of the flow finally we investigated the effects on the flow features of the concentration of one particle species in the other in fig 8 we considered the same types of spheres showed in fig 2 and produced the profiles of the average fluid u particle u and particle fluctuation w velocity when the large spheres are dilute fa 0 1 and when the small spheres are dilute fa 0 9 these are compared with the case of a single species with the average diameter r ra rb 2 and the average mass m ma mb 2 the flow depth and velocities are larger when the small spheres are dilute the case when the large spheres are dilute is similar to the one of a single species with average mass and diameter in terms of flow depth while the velocities result slightly smaller also the mixture concentration fig 9 is similar in the two cases while it is slightly larger when the smaller spheres are dilute as a consequence the volume flux is enhanced when the small particles are dilute while it is smaller and similar when the large spheres are dilute and for single species with the average size and mass fig 10 however comparing these results with fig 4 the particle flux is maximized for a bimodal mixture with similar volumes of spheres of the two types fa 0 5 the presented results can also suggest a way for interpreting the stratification of sediments identified in the sedimentological analysis of debris and pyroclastic flows in agreement with field and theoretical investigations obtained with other methods e g the sedimentological tools and statistical approaches to natural sediments proposed in dellino et al 2008 and sulpizio et al 2014 5 conclusion we have considered fully developed particle liquid flows on a slope driven by both gravity and by a fluid shear stress using kinetic theory we showed that segregation has a significant influence on the rheology of the flow and that the presence of different particle species with small differences in radii and masses can result in important differences in particle flux and flow depth we also showed that the size difference plays a more significant role on segregation than the mass difference and that at least in the conditions investigated the particle flux is enhanced when the volumes of the two types of spheres are similar this should be taken into account when modelling natural flows which usually contain a wide distribution of particle diameters and interpreting the stratification of sediments identified in the sedimentological analysis of debris and pyroclastic flows however a realistic model for such flows must also incorporate the significant dissipation in the interaction between particles associated with the presence of the fluid acknowledgement the

647,we phrase and solve boundary value problems for the segregation of spheres with either equal density and different sizes or the same size and different densities in flows of a clear fluid driven by gravity over an inclined erodible bed in a wide channel we assume that the flow is steady and uniform collisions between particles dissipate little energy and the sizes and masses of the particles are not too different for particles of the same material with diameters that differ by as little as ten per cent we find that the flow features such as velocity granular temperature and solid concentration profiles are significantly different from those for a flow of a single species with a diameter equal to the average of the two diameters in particular the total particle flux of the mixture is significantly larger keywords size segregation mass segregation kinetic theory particle fluid flow 1 introduction particle segregation has important implications both for industrial activities involving the production transportation and packing of granular media where it is often undesired muzzio et al 2002 and for its influence on the strength and extent of natural phenomena such as rock debris flows armanini et al 2005 berzi et al 2010 and pyroclastic density currents dellino et al 2008 sulpizio et al 2014 many experiments showed that in inclined flows of mixtures of particles of the same materials that differ in size the larger ones tend to rise e g drahun and bridgwater 1983 however despite the importance of particle segregation the theoretical framework developed for its description is still incomplete and mostly devoted to dry flows the majority of the approaches are based on continuum mixture theory e g atkin 1976 gray and ancey 2011 fan et al 2014 however we recently have proposed a more fundamental theory for dry bimodal granular mixtures in the context of kinetic theory in which all parameters depend on measured particles properties their size material density and coefficient of restitution larcher and jenkins 2013 larcher and jenkins 2015 this paper extends the approach to particle fluid flows and again relies only on measured particle properties without any adjustable parameters the granular phase is driven both by the effect of gravity and by a shear stress due to the presence of a layer of turbulent fluid on top in the model both effects can be controlled separately and thus describe both mature and immature debris flows and intense sediment transport dominated by particle collisions however in order to keep the physical mechanisms accessible we employ the simplest theory for segregation that results from the kinetic theory for binary mixtures arnarson and jenkins 2004 it applies to collisional flows in which little energy is dissipated in collisions between two types of spheres that do not differ much in size and mass we believe that it is important to obtain results for the simplest theory before introducing the additional complications associated with the greater dissipation due to the influence of viscosity on the particle interactions gondret et al 2002 the flow model is based on the balance of mass momentum and energy for the mixture of fluid and particles and the segregation is described by an equation related to the difference of the momentum balances of the individual species of particles arnarson and jenkins 2000 we focus on steady fully developed flows of a mixture of water and spherical particles of two different radii ra and rb made of the same material and spherical particles of the same radius made of different materials the hydrodynamic model is similar to that employed by pasini and jenkins pasini and jenkins 2005 and the segregation model is that introduced by arnarson and jenkins arnarson and jenkins 2004 we consider flows that are driven down inclined erodible beds by gravity and the shear stress of a clear turbulent fluid above the particles fig 1 we predict profiles of mixture volume fraction or concentration c particle velocity u fluid velocity u and species volume fractions ca and cb 2 balance equations the problem can be phrased in terms of six balance equations the momentum balances of the particle mixture and of the fluid in directions parallel and perpendicular to the main flow the balance of fluctuation energy of the particles and a weighted difference of the individual momentum balances of the two particle species perpendicular to the flow we denote the mass densities of the pure fluid and the material of the particles by ρ and ρ p respectively and introduce the relative density σ ρ p ρ then the buoyant gravitational acceleration g is defined in terms of the gravitational acceleration g and σ by g 1 1 σ the reynolds number r based on the fall velocity of a single particle is d g d 1 2 ν where ν is the ratio of the molecular viscosity of the fluid to its mass density also known as kinematic viscosity in what follows lengths have been made dimensionless by the average particle diameter d velocities by the square root of the product of the buoyant gravitational acceleration and d stresses by the product of ρp g and d and energy flux by ρ p g d 3 2 the restriction of the problem to particles that differ little in radii and masses permits a simplified description of the mixture in which all quantities can be expanded about the values of a single constituent with the average diameter and average mass of the two species and a concentration equal to that of the mixture the restriction to nearly elastic interactions while not necessarily realistic allows us to obtain the predictions for the simplest possible collisional flow theory these we expect will exhibit the qualitative features of more complicated and realistic collisional theories garzo and dufty 1999 2 1 dimensionless balance of particle momentum in normal direction the balance of normal particle momentum relates the gradients of

sediment transport rate to increase the increased sediment transport rate usually leads to scouring which can pose a threat to the stability of the structure sumer and fredsøe 2002 to better understand scouring process numerical models dedicated to modeling sediment laden flows and the resulting scour are necessary tools in addition to physical model tests at present most of numerical models have been developed for this purpose are single phase models treating the sediment as a passive scalar with a falling velocity but ignoring effects of particles on the flow and particle particle interactions brors 1999 jacobsen et al 2014 liang et al 2005 liu and garcia 2008 the sediment transport in these models is classified into two modes the suspended load mode and the bed load mode the bed load transport rate is computed using empirical or semi empirical formulas such as the formula proposed by engelund and fredsøe 1976 who obtained the mean sediment velocity by simply considering the average equilibrium of the drag and friction forces exerted on a single particle and assuming the flow velocity around the particle to be a simple linear function of shear velocity however the flow in the bed load layer is complex and the effects of fluid particle and particle particle interactions can be important and should be considered in the simulation capart and fraccarollo 2011 important fluid particle interactions include the turbulence modulation by sediment crowe et al 1996 and the momentum interchange between the sediment and the fluid white 2000 both of which can change the flow field and sediment transport the particle particle interaction is responsible for the rheological characteristics of the fluid sediment mixture the effects of enduring contact and mutual collision as well as fluid viscous effects campbell 2006 cassar et al 2005 all can affect the particle particle interaction the enduring contact effect leads to the coulomb relationship campbell 2006 the inertial effect has to do with the stresses that depend on the square of the strain rates bagnold 1954 and the viscous effects yield the stresses that are associated with the strain rates bagnold 1954 the enduring contact effect is important only for very high concentration flows the particle size and shear velocity determines the relative importance of inertial and fluid viscous effects in flows with high shear velocity and large particles the inertial effect dominates in flows with low shear velocity and small particles the fluid viscous effect dominates some models have been developed in the two phase framework amoudry and liu 2009 chiodi et al 2014 hsu et al 2004 lee et al 2016 li and sawamoto 1995 revil baudard and chauchat 2013 yeganeh bakhtiary et al 2011 to consider the coupled fluid particle and particle particle interactions in two phase flow models both the sediment and fluid phases have their own governing equations for mass and momentum the momentum equations take into account of the drag force between the two phases and the turbulent dispersion effect early two phase flow models considered the turbulence modulation by simply reducing the mixing length according to concentration li and sawamoto 1995 more sophisticated two phase models included additional terms describing the turbulence modulation in two equation turbulence models hsu et al 2004 which consider two effects 1 the dissipation of turbulence due to the correlation between the fluctuating velocities of sediment and fluid phases 2 the buoyancy production of turbulence due to the gradient in sediment concentration because solving the equations governing multi dimensional two phase flow problems in early days was not permitted by the computers at the time most of the numerical studies using two phase flow models were confined to 1d problems even though few studies amoudry and liu 2009 yeganeh bakhtiary et al 2011 did two dimensional two phase flow simulations the bed location the interface between the static sand layer and the mobile layer must be specified at each time step during the computation recently some authors cheng et al 2017 lee et al 2016 used the open source package openfoam opencfd 2014 to develop multi dimensional two phase flow models eliminating the needs for specifying bed location and some favorable preliminary results have been obtained using these two phase flow models flows passing through hydraulic structures may change the water air interface which in turn influences the flow field and sediment transport adduce and la rocca 2006 balachandar et al 2000 it is necessary to consider the water air interface when simulating scour bakhtyar et al 2010 developed a three phase air water and sediment model that can capture the water air interface in the presence of sediment however their model included only the viscous effects on sediment stresses and the effects of buoyancy production on turbulence modulation this study will develop a three phase model by introducing a third phase air into the liquid solid two phase model of lee et al 2016 which considered enduring contact mutual collision inertial fluid viscous effects in sediment stress and two mechanisms of turbulence modulation for model verification the three phase model is applied to simulate the local scour caused by a submerged wall jet with a water air surface a phenomenon commonly encountered in sluice gate problems and having applications in hydroelectric power plants and irrigation 2 mathematical formulation the governing equations for three phase flows air water and sediment and the related closures are presented in this section two models for particle response time τp which is used to compute the drag force are examined one is based on sedimentation richardson and zaki 1954 and the other is based on the pressure drop in steady flow through a porous media engelund and fredsøe 1976 2 1 governing equations a volume of fluid vof method hirt 1981 is used to track the water air interface in vof methods the air water interface is defined as a region occupied by a mixture of water and air liquid saturation s is defined as the ratio of the volume of water to the total volume of void air and water in a control volume liquid saturation is used as an indicator function for classifying whether a spatial point is occupied by air water or both for s 1 the region is occupied by water alone for s 0 the region is occupied by air alone for 0 s 1 the region is defined as the water air interface in the absence of the sediment phase the indicator function for three phase flows should reduce to that used for liquid gas flows rusche 2003 to determine the water air interface we consider the water and air phases as a single fluid phase of water air mixture with a variable density and a variable viscosity as in previous studies on liquid gas flows rusche 2003 the density ρf and viscosity νf of the fluid phase the water air mixture are determined by 1 ρ f s ρ w 1 s ρ a and 2 ν f s ν w 1 s ν a where ρw and ρa are the densities of the water and air phases respectively νw and νa are the kinematic viscosities of the water and air phases respectively the velocities of the water and air phases are assumed to be the same at the water air interface due to the no slip condition the mass balance equations for three phase flows can be obtained through averaging processes brennen 2005 and they can be written as brennen 2005 3 c t c u s 0 for the sediment phase 4 1 c s t 1 c s u f 0 for the liquid phase and 5 1 c 1 s t 1 c 1 s u f 0 for the gaseous phase since the flow beneath the water air interface is a solid liquid two phase flow the equations for momentum balance are the same as those used in the previous two phase models hsu et al 2004 lee et al 2016 6 ρ s c u s t ρ s c u s u s ρ s c g c p f c p s c t s c ρ s u f u s τ p ρ s τ p 1 c ν f t σ c c for

particle response time νft the eddy viscosity of the liquid phase σc the schmidt number the last two terms in eqs 6 and 7 are related to momentum interchanges between the solid and liquid phases the first term accounts for the drag force and the second term for turbulent dispersion a k ϵ model with a low reynolds number correction is applied to compute t f lee et al 2016 the turbulence kinetic

the same as those in k ϵ model for clear water at present we don t have a good understanding of the model parameter c ϵ3 the parameter α measures how well the particles follow the fluid fluctuation the two terms in in eqs 8 and 9 account for the turbulence modulation due to the presence of particles the first term is associated to buoyancy and the second term is due to the correlation between the fluctuating velocities of sediment and fluid for other details about the k ϵ model used here the reader is referred to lee et al 2016 2 2 sediment stresses lee et al 2016 suggested that ps and t s should consider 1 the elastic behavior for static compact granular material hsu et al 2004 2 the turbulent behavior of sediment motion hinze 1959 and 3 the rheological characteristics of the fluid particle mixture trulsson et al 2012 consequently the pressure of the sediment phase is a superposition of three components 10 p s p s r p s e p s t where psr reflects the rheological characteristics when the sediment is in motion pse accounts for the elastic effect when sediment is in its static state and pst accounts for the turbulent motion of sediment phase lee et al 2016 used a regularization technique that regards the static sediment layer as a very viscous fluid and wrote t s as 11 t s 2 3 ρ s ν s u s 2 ρ s ν s d s where d s is the strain rate νs is modeled by 12 ν s ν s v ν s t where νsv and νst account for the rheological characteristics visco plastic effect and turbulence effects respectively closures for psr pse pst νsv and νst are needed in the following we only present the models for psr and νsv for later discussion for other parameters the reader is referred to lee et al 2016 for dry granular materials the drag force between the solid phase and the air is not important due to the large difference between the densities therefore the rheological characteristics have only the inertial regime which can be described by kinetic theory lee et al 2015b however for submerged granular materials the liquid can also affect the rheological characteristics of granular material bagnold 1954 suggested that the rheological characteristics of granular materials should have two regimes inertial regime and viscous regime these two regimes can be distinguished by the so called bagnold number b a ρ s d d s ρ f ν f where d is the diameter of sediment particles and d s d s in the inertial regime the value of ba is large while in the viscous regimes the value of ba is small bagnold 1954 proposed two formulas to compute t s in these two regimes by assuming that t s ps is a function of constant η in the last decade some studies find that the constant η depends on the inertial number i i 2 d d s c p s ρ s for large values of ba jop et al 2006 the viscous number i v 2 ρ f ν f d s c p s for small values of ba cassar et al 2005 or the combination of the two i i v a i i 2 trulsson et al 2012 with a being a constant the inertial number is the ratio of inertial shear stress to friction shear stress associated with the weight resulting from enduring contact the viscous number is the ratio of the viscous shear stress to the friction shear stress and the value of a depends on the critical value of ba at which sediment dynamics transfer from one regime to the other many models for the relationship between η and i have been proposed and one example is 13 η η 1 η 2 η 1 1 i o i with η 1 η 2 and io being constants trulsson et al 2012 in eq 13 η 1 is associated with the angle of repose using the regularization technique lee et al 2016 computed νsv by 14 ν s v p s r p s e η 2 ρ s d s where η was given by eq 14 previous studies cassar et al 2005 jop et al 2006 trulsson et al 2012 found that c decreased monotonically from a constant cc around 0 6 when ii iv or i was increased based on these finding lee et al 2016 suggested that psr be computed by 15 p s r 2 b 2 c c c c 2 ρ f ν f 2 a ρ s d 2 d s d s where b is a constant 2 3 particle response time particle response time τp which is related to the drag coefficient has effects on the momentum interchange between the two phases at present there is no universal model available for computing τp two models for τp will be examined in this study one model is based on sedimentation richardson and zaki 1954 valid for c 0 4 yin and koch 2007 and the other is based on steady flow through porous media engelund and fredsøe 1976 see also pitman and le 2005 the first model examined in this study is based on sedimentation test the particle response time can be written as 16 τ p ρ s ρ f ρ s w 1 c 2 g where w is the hindered settling velocity the sedimentation velocity of sediment particles in a particle cloud richardson and zaki 1954 suggested that the hindered settling velocity should be smaller than the terminal settling velocity of a single particle ws and proposed the following relationship between w and ws 17 w w s 1 c n where c is the concentration and n is given by 18 n 4 65 r e s 0 2 4 4 r e s 0 33 0 2 r e s 1 4 4 r e s 0 1 1 r e s 500 2 4 500 r e s where r e s w s d ν f is the particle settling reynolds number the terminal velocity of a single particle can be computed by chien and wan 1999 19 w s 4 d g 3 c d ρ s ρ f ρ f where cd is the drag coefficient for steady flows passing a small object for spheres white 2000 suggested 20 c d 24 r e p 6 1 r e p 0 4 where rep is the particle reynolds number defined by r e p u f u s d ν f the model for τp based on eqs 16 20 is referred to as the rz model i e richard and zaki model hereafter the second model examined in this study is based on pressure drop when flow pass through porous media according to the study of engelund and fredsøe 1976 τp can be computed by 21 τ p ρ s d 2 ρ f ν f 1 a e c 2 b e r e p where ae and be are the model parameters it is found that ae varies from 780 to 1500 or more and be varies from 1 8 to 3 6 or more burcharth and andersen 1995 engelund and fredsøe 1976 eq 21 is referred as ef model i e engelund and fredsøe model hereafter 3 numerical scheme this study uses openfoam opencfd 2014 to solve the governing equations and closures presented in section 2 the main challenges of solving these equations include 1 how to compute pf 2 how to avoid the numerical instability caused by high sediment concentration and 3 how to capture the water air interface the first and second challenges also exist in other two phase flow simulations lee et al 2016 combined the pimple scheme to solve the equations for the fluid phase opencfd 2014 and the predicted corrected scheme to solve the sediment phase lee et al 2015b the pimple scheme is a combination of two famous schemes that adjust fluid pressure to keep mass balance the pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso scheme and the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple scheme ferziger and peric 2002 in the predicted corrected scheme for the sediment phase lee et al 2015b the discrete mass balance equation for the sediment phase eq 3 becomes an advection diffusion equation instead of an advection equation the diffusion behavior subdues the fluctuation in concentration and helps improve the numerical stability when the concentration is high combining eqs 3 5 gives 22 1 c u f c u s 0 therefore the governing equations for the solid fluid two phases eqs 3 6 7 and 22 are the same as those used in lee et al 2016 in the following we will show how to modify the numerical scheme in ref lee et al 2016 to capture the water air interface in the presence of the sediment phase we first derive the equation governing s from the mass balance equations eqs 3 4 and 22 we obtain 23 s t s u f s u f 0 if the sediment phase is absent eq 22 yields u f 0 and thus the third term in eq 23 disappears resulting in the classic equation for s used in the vof method for liquid gas two phase flows rusche 2003 solving eq 23 directly causes too much diffusion near the water air interface to avoid this an extra term is included in eq 23 to artificially compress the water air interface rusche 2003 with this extra term eq 23 becomes 24 s t s u f s u f s 1 s u r 0 where u r is the velocity field to compress the water air interface for details about u r the reader is referred to ref rusche 2003 openfoam provides a multi dimensional universal limiter with explicit solution mules opencfd 2014 for solving eq 24 with guaranteed boundedness of s 0 s 1 the numerical procedure to solve the equations in sections 2 and 3 is summarized below 1 solving eq 24 for s 2 calculating ρf and νf according to eqs 1 and 2 respectively 3 computing u f u s pf c k and ϵ using the scheme proposed by lee et al 2016 an inner loop and an outer loop are needed the inner loop repeats ni times to correct pf the outer loop repeats no times to compute u f u s pf c k and ϵ bakhtyar et al 2010 developed a three phase model with the capability of capturing the water air interface following the study of hirt 1981 on simulating free surface flows bakhtyar et al 2010 solved the following equation for s 25 s t u f s 0 in order to track the water air interface eq 25 is mathematically identical to eq 23 except that eq 23 is written in its conservation form required by mules their numerical scheme differs from ours in that their scheme requires the bed location to be specified during the computation preventing their model from simulating avalanche 4 application to sediment transport in open channel flow the present model is applied to simulate sediment transport in open channel using the rz and ef models for τp the purpose of this section was to compare the two models for τp and understand the sensitivity of our three phase model to uncertainties in two model parameters used in the ef model for τp in our simulations an uniform 1d vertical mesh was established within the domain with a height of 0 25 m and the initially static sediment layer was set to occupy the lower portion of the domain with c 0 6031 the initial thickness of the sand layer was set to 0 0525 m sand with a diameter of d 0 25 mm and a density of ρ s 2600 kg m 3 was used in the simulations the open channel flow driven by gravity is assumed to be uniform and thus a periodic boundary condition can be applied in the direction of the flow and the slip condition on the top boundary a grid size of 0 625d was used a convergence test performed with a smaller grid size of 0 31d showed that the discrepancies between the two meshes were within 3 ten key model parameters used in this study are presented in table 1 and other model parameters are the same as those used in the previous study of lee et al 2016 the main differences in the model parameters used here and in ref lee et al 2016 are the values of 1 σc and c ϵ3 the values of these two parameters used here are 1 σ c 0 6 and c ϵ 3 0 6 which were determined based on the simulation results in the next section for the local scour induced by a submerged wall jet issued from a sluice gate fig 1 shows the dimensionless sediment transport rate q versus the shields parameter θ q q d ρ s ρ f 1 g d with q being the dimensional sediment transport rate and θ τ b g ρ s ρ f d with τb being the bed shear stress the results computed using both the ef and rz models are presented in fig 1 as suggested by hsu et al 2004 the near bed region with c 0 08 is regarded as the bed load layer the formulas of meyer peter and müller mpm meyer peter and müller 1948 hanes and inman 1985 and ribberink 1998 are also included in fig 1 for comparison we remark that the formula of meyer peter and müller 1948 is based on the flume experiments for θ 0 2 the formula of ribberink 1998 is based on the laboratory experiments for 0 07 θ 7 and the formula of hanes and inman 1985 is based on bagnold s empirical relationship of strain rate and stress for granular flows bagnold 1954 generally speaking the total and bed load sediment transport rates given by both the ef and rz models are similar for larger values of θ the total load and bed load transport rates given by both models are generally over estimated compared with the formulas of mpm and hanes but close to the formula of ribberink for smaller values of θ the computed sediment transport rate results are closer to the formula of hanes but under estimated compared with the formulas of mpm and ribberink it is worth noticing that the bed load transport rate given by the rz model at θ 0 1 is less than 10 3 indicating the sediment transport is almost all due to the suspended load however we should expect a bed load dominated transport for low θ therefore the ef model will be adopted in the next section to simulate the scouring process downstream of a sluice gate a sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the sensitivity of the ef model for particle response time to possible uncertainties in the two model parameters ae and be changes in the total load transport rate q was examined in the sensitivity analysis by changing one parameter at a time within a given range with the other parameter being fixed three values of ae were examined 760 1000 and 1500 which correspond to spherical particles rounded sand grains and irregular angular grains respectively engelund and fredsøe 1976 the parameter be varied between 1 8 and 3 6 we use the total load transport rate obtained with a e 1000 and b e 3 6 are the reference values when 0 1 θ 0 4 the use of ae 760 reduced q by 4 but the use of ae 1500 increased q by 14 reducing b e from 3 6 to 1 8 introduced a change in q by about 10 in the next section we will use a e 1000 and b e 3 6 to simulate the local scour caused by a submerged wall jet issued from a sluice gate the error in the quantities related to sediment transport is expected to be about 10 due to the uncertainties in ae and be 5 application to the development of local scour downstream of a sluice gate we now apply the three phase model to study the local scour downstream of a rigid apron caused by a submerged horizontal wall jet issued from a sluice gate as shown in fig 2 local scour occurs when the shields parameter exceeds the critical shields parameter for sediment initiation a scour hole forms downstream of the apron and a sand dune forms downstream of the scour hole many studies have been devoted to this classical problem experimentally to understand the equilibrium scour depth the development of scour hole and the rate of sediment removal adduce and la rocca 2006 adduce and sciortino 2006 ali and lim 1986 balachandar et al 2000 chatterjee et al 1994 dey and sarkar 2006 dodaro et al 2016 hassan and narayanan 1985 hopfinger et al 2004 xie and lim 2015 the local scour has been found to be affected by following factors the particle densimetric froude number v g d ρ s ρ f 1 with v being the jet velocity the jet froude number v g b o with bo sluice gate opening apron length tailwater level and the startup conditions aamir and ahmad 2016 some theoretical and numerical studies have also been devoted to modeling the local scour downstream of a rigid apron under submerged wall jets for example hassan and narayanan 1985 proposed a simple semi empirical theory to predict the time rate of scouring process based on the velocity in the scour hole liu and garcia 2008 and hoffmans and booij 1993 solved the reynolds averaged naiver stokes equations for the fluid phase and the exner equation for bed evolution with empirical models for sediment transport rates however these existing numerical models did not take into consideration the turbulence modulation and the particle particle interactions three phase simulations of the local scour due to a submerged wall jet issued from a sluice gate have not been reported in the literature in this section we apply our three phase model to reproduce the experimental results of run 2 in the study of chatterjee et al 1994 which reached the equilibrium within 30 minutes the shortest of all available experiments 5 1 numerical setups fig 2 shows the numerical setup which is the same as the experimental setup used in ref chatterjee et al 1994 except for the reservoir a two dimensional computational domain without reservoir is used in the simulation in order to reduce the computational load referring to fig 2 the sluice gate opening bo is 2 cm the length of apron lap is 0 66 m the sediment reservoir length ls is 2 1 m the overflow weir has a height of 0 239 m the upstream inflow discharge rate at the sluice opening is 0 204 m2 s which translates into an average horizontal flow velocity v 1 02 m s under the sluice gate quartz sand with ρ s 2650 kg m3 and d 0 76 mm is placed in the sediment reservoir with its top surface being on the same level as the top surface of the apron we remark that chatterjee et al 1994 reported v 1 56 m s which was measured by a micropitot tube in the experiment and δh 11 8 cm δh is the difference between the water level in the reservoir and in the test section however the contraction coefficient obtained using the reported values of v and δh exceeds one which we believe is unreasonable therefore v 1 02 m s which is consistent with the discharge rate reported in chatterjee et al 1994 will be adopted in the simulations presented in the rest of this paper for the fluid phase including liquid and gas a wall function boundary condition for smooth wall is imposed on all rigid boundaries the mean velocity at the sluice gate opening is prescribed according to the given discharge rate the fluid pressure is set to zero at the upper and outlet boundaries but the fluid pressure is set to have a zero gradient on other boundaries for the sediment phase a no slip boundary condition is implemented on all rigid boundaries for both the fluid and sediment phases the velocity gradient is set to zero at the upper boundary and above the weir the gradients of saturation s and sediment concentration c are set to zero on all boundaries except at the inlet boundary where s 1 and c 0 are used since chatterjee et al 1994 did not report the detailed startup conditions used in their experiment we assume here that the initial water depth is 0 239 m and impose a ramping function on the mean velocity of the flow at the sluice gate opening we comment that the choice of the ramping function only affect the shape of the scour hole in the first one minute or so for details of this ramping function the reader is referred to appendix a for the sediment concentration in the sediment reservoir an initial value of c 0 6018 is used values for the key model parameters listed in table 1 were used in the simulations and the friction coefficient η 1 in eq 13 which is related to the angle of repose was 0 55 in the simulations a non uniform mesh was used in the simulation the interface between the sediment and fluid requires special treatment in terms of mesh size in order to accurately capture the interfacial momentum transfer therefore the finest mesh with a vertical mesh resolution of 2d was used in the vicinity of the sediment fluid interface this fine mesh covers the dynamic sediment fluid interface during the entire scour process at locations away from the sediment fluid interface or locations where the scouring is predicted to be negligible for example further downstream the sand dune the mesh sizes with a vertical resolution ranging from 3 mm to 5 mm were used the aspect ratio of the mesh outside the wall jet region was less than 3 0 since in the wall jet horizontal velocity is significantly larger than the vertical velocity the aspect ratio used in the wall jet region was less than 5 0 a snapshot of the mesh configuration near the downstream edge of the rigid apron and the upstream of sediment reservoir is shown in fig b 2 in appendix b where the reader can find more details about the mesh setup a grid dependence test has been carried out and the meshes with identical layout but a grid size 25 smaller finer mesh or 25 larger coarser mesh than the current mesh were used in the test compared to the current mesh at t 300 s the coarser mesh over predicted the height of the sand dune by 10 the peak location by 1 5 and under predicted the scour depth by about 2 6 the finer mesh under predicted the height of the sand dune by less than 8 and the scour depth by less than 0 3 the peak location is over predicted by 0 6 openfoam provides a set of built in numerical schemes to discretize respective fields which were used to discretize fields in this numerical work a crank nicolson scheme with an off centering coefficient of 0 5 was used for time discretization for most of the other operators gaussian or bounded gaussian with limiter was used as the discretization scheme during the initial stage of the simulation the concentration of the sediment phase changes slightly from the preset value to reach a stable packing status due to elastic effect during this initial stage a smaller time step was used to ensure the numerical stability the time step is controlled automatically by the courant friedrichs lewy condition with the courant number 0 1 during the initial sediment settling stage after t 30 s the time step is controlled by courant number 0 3 a 720 s of physical time takes 3 days on two computation nodes each with two central processing units intel xeon e5 2670 connected using a 40 gbps infiniband high speed network 5 2 results and discussion main results to be presented and discussed in this section include simulated flow field and bed profile evolution sediment avalanche and a sensitivity analysis 5 2 1 bed profile and its key characteristics detailed comparisons between the computed scour profiles and those measured chatterjee et al 1994 at t 60 180 300 480 720 1200 and 1800 s are shown in fig 3 where the distribution of sediment concentration is also included in these figures the bed profile was determined by the contour line of c 0 5 the water air interface is also shown in the figures and the water surface set down induced by the submerged wall jet can be noticed in the figures under the action of the jet flow a scour hole develops in the initially flat sand bed downstream of the rigid apron and a sand dune forms downstream of the scour hole the on set of sediment scouring is rapid during the initial period but gradually slows down as the scour hole develops its trough location shifts downstream and the depth and width of the scour hole and the height of the sand dune continue to increase further downstream of the sand dune the sand bed remains mostly unchanged the general agreement between the simulated and measured bed profiles is satisfactory except for some minor discrepancies between the simulated and measured sand dune profiles after t 1200 s the discrepancies are mainly in the dune height and the shape of the dune crest the simulated dune crests are slightly sharper than the measured ones at the later state of the scour process which might be due to the limitation of k ϵ model in simulating the flow separation around the dune crest we also remark that the simulation is 2d while the scour profile in the experiment may have 3d features which may have also contributed to the differences found in fig 3 during the entire process shown in fig 3 it can be observed that the extent to which the suspended sediment can reach is more or less the same which is around x 1 2 m this appears to be correlated to the final peak location of the sand dune with the downstream migration of the sand dune the size of the region where the suspended sand has a concentration larger than 0 0001 is reducing theoretically speaking the final equilibrium is reached when the net sediment transport rate is zero everywhere along the bed profile the simulated horizontal location of the sand dune peak xd the maximum accretion height hd and the depth of the scour hole zs are shown in fig 4 where the experimental data chatterjee et al 1994 are also included for comparison it can be seen that the equilibrium scour condition has not been reached at t 30 minutes the simulated maximum scour depths also agree well with the experimental measurements generally speaking the simulated peak locations of the sand dune xd agree well with experimental observations except for slight over estimations when t 1200 s the maximum accretion heights are slightly under predicted in general in addition to possible 3d effects in the experiment other possible factors that may have contributed to these discrepancies will be discussed later in section 5 2 5 5 2 2 flow fields of the fluid and sediment phases fig 5 shows the streamlines and velocity magnitude of the entire flow field taken at t 300 1200 and 1800 s including both the liquid phase and the gas phase three vortex flow patterns can be observers in the flow field the formation of these vortex flow patterns is due to flow separation which itself is caused by the negative pressure gradient near a curved boundary flow separation occurs at a point where the shear stress is zero therefore the presence of a vortex flow pattern in a region weakens the flow there a very large counter clockwise vortex can be observed above the jet flow downstream of the sluice gate and this vortex flow pattern resembles to the one generated by a submerged jet issued from a sluice gate reported in gumus et al 2016 while the jet flow passes underneath this large vortex the jet cross section gradually increases see also fig 5 a small clockwise vortex near the edge of the rigid apron can also be observed which is consistent with the recirculation pattern observed in the laboratory experiment of hoffmans and booij 1993 the small vortex also yields a small scour hole which grows and migrates downstream with time and finally merges into the main scour profile see also figs 5 and 6 as shown in fig 5 another medium sized but weak clockwise vortex in the lee side of the sand dune exists with the development of the sand dune this vortex reduces in both size and strength the presence of the vortex flow pattern in the lee side of the sand dune helps to deposit sand in the region as shown in fig 6 for the flow field of the sediment phase fig 6 shows the snapshots of sediment phase velocity fields taken at four time instants t 60 300 720 and 1800 s in the scour hole the sediment is mobilized by the jet flow and transported uphill before the point of maximum scour depth the sand is transported mainly within a narrow region adjacent to the movable bed between the point of maximum depth and the dune peak it appears that both the bed load and suspended load transport the sand after the mobilized sediment particles past the dune peak they are transported mainly by the sedimentation process because of the low velocity associated with the clockwise vortex behind the sand dune with the development of scour hole the size of the region in the lee side of the sand dune where sand moves in suspension reduces in size making the migration and growth of the sand dune slower 5 2 3 sediment avalanche in their experimental study of effect of grain size on the dynamics of local scour downstream of a sluice gate balachandar et al 2000 and kells et al 2001 observed sediment avalanche and concluded that reducing the discharge or increasing either the grain size or the tailwater depth reduces the tendency of sediment avalanche our simulation also clearly shows the occurrence of multiple sediment avalanching events as an example fig 7 shows a series of snapshots of back face profile of the sand dune capturing an avalanching event occurred between t 109 5 and 111 s a lump of sediment first moves down the slope against the flow from t 109 0 s to 111 0 s and then moves up the slope with the flow from t 111 0 s to 112 0 s the simulated avalanching event is in consistent with the collapse of sand mass in an erodible sand bed observed in the experiment of balachandar et al 2000 the slope of deposited sand on the back face of the sand dune may exceed the angle of repose if there is enough bed shear stress from the flow above to hold the sand slope in place however when the slope gets so steep that the bed shear stress can no longer balance out the excessive downward gravitational force avalanching collapse of sand mass may occur locally after the avalanche the local flow field is altered and the local bed shear stress is increased facilitating the forward transport of the sand on the back face until a new balance is reached between the shear stress and the gravitational force our simulation shows that the migration and growth of the sand dune are closely related to the sediment avalanching events even though our simulation also shows avalanching events on the slope close to the apron these events are not as significant as those on the back side of the sand dune we remark that avalenching events cannot be captured by traditional one phase models or two phase models with one way coupling between the fluid and sediment phases 5 2 4 sensitivity analysis lee et al 2016 suggested that σc and c ϵ3 should be the two most important parameters affecting the scour underneath a pipeline the parameter σc defines the ratio between the turbulent diffusion of the carrier phase and the diffusion of sediment particles the parameter c ϵ3 is related to the turbulence modulation due to the presence of particles in the k ϵ equations a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity of the location of the sand dune xd and the scour depth zs to these two parameters it is unlikely that the diffusion of sediment phase can be larger than the diffusion of the carrier phase therefore 1 σc would reasonably have a maximum value of 1 0 based on this rationale 1 σc in this sensitivity test varied from 0 4 to 1 0 the value of c ϵ3 varied from 0 5 to 1 2 previous studies hsu et al 2004 lee et al 2016 suggested that the typical value of c ϵ3 should be around 1 this sensitivity test used 1 σc 0 6 and c ϵ3 0 6 as the reference values figs 8 and fig 9 summarize the sensitivity test results the location of the sand dune and the scour depth at four representative time instants were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the three phase model to σc and c ϵ3 keeping c ϵ3 0 6 but varying 1 σc in the range of 0 4 and 1 0 only causes xd to have a change less than 11 compared to the reference scenario 1 σ c 0 6 keeping 1 σc 0 6 but varying c ϵ3 in the range of 0 4 and 1 2 only causes xd to have a change less than 8 compared to the reference scenario c ϵ3 0 6 it is concluded that xd is not very sensitive to both 1 σc and c ϵ3 within the tested ranges referring to fig 9 for the instantaneous scour depth zs the same conclusion can be drawn that the scour depth is not very sensitive to both 1 σc and c ϵ3 within the tested ranges 5 2 5 discussion the minor discrepancies between the simulated and measured key characteristics of the bed profile may be attributed to several factors including the use of constant σc and c ϵ3 obtained through model calibration as discussed below in the sensitivity analysis on 1 σc for dilute flows lee et al 2015a proposed an expression for 1 σc which depends on two stokes numbers s t τ p τ f with τ f 0 165 k ϵ and s t η τ p τ η with τη being the kolmogorov time scale based on their limited results obtained using a direct numerical simulation method squires and eaton 1994 concluded that the values of c ϵ2 and c ϵ3 should be affected by the presence of sediment particles in a particle laden flow for 0 6 c ϵ3 3 84 in particular they found that the value of c ϵ3 decreased with increasing either the concentration of particles or the stokes number st because stokes number st changes with θ which has both spatial and temporal variations in the present problem 1 σc and c ϵ3 should change in space and time as well there is a difficulty to use the model for 1 σc proposed by lee et al 2015a this is because the flow field in the present problem is much more complex than the open channel flow studied in ref lee et al 2015a and because the k ϵ model in the present three phase model does not include the sediment induced turbulence production because of numerical stability issues unless an extensive calibration is done a direct implementation of the expressions for 1 σc summarized in ref lee et al 2015a may not be appropriate therefore this study determined a representative value for 1 σc through model calibration and found that 1 σ c 0 6 could give acceptable results we remark that the ranges of the two stokes numbers in the present problem also suggest that 1 σc should be between 0 4 and 0 8 according to the conclusions in ref lee et al 2015a at the present there is a difficulty to model the temporal and spatial variations of c ϵ3 squires and eaton 1994 did not provide enough data to establish a model for c ϵ3 which can be implemented in our simulations again this study determined a representative value for c ϵ3 through model calibration and found that c ϵ3 0 6 could give acceptable results because the typical stokes number within the bed load layer was found to be around 0 5 in the present problem we should expect a typical value of c ϵ3 less than 1 0 according to ref squires and eaton 1994 it is anticipated that considering both the temporal and spatial variations in 1 σc and c ϵ3 when appropriate models for them are available in the future should reduce the discrepancy between the simulated and measured sand dune profiles 6 conclusions this study presented a rheology based three phase model for sediment transport problems with a water air interface a modified k ϵ turbulence model was employed to compute the fluid phase shear stresses a special modification was introduced so that the interface compression vof method can track the water air interface in the presence of the sediment phase the three phase model was used to study two problems sediment transport under 1d open channel flow condition and local scour induced by a 2d horizontal wall jet issued from a sluice gate two models for particle response time were examined in the numerical simulations of the first problem the engelund and fredsøe model for particle response time was found to give better prediction of sediment transport rate for small values of shields parameter and thus was used in the three phase flow simulations of the local scour downstream of a sluice gate the depth of the scour hole and the location of sand dune predicted by numerical model agreed well with the laboratory experimental results however the height of the sand dune at later stage of the scouring process was slightly under predicted by the present model which is due mainly to the difficulty in modeling the weak bed shear stress presently the three phase model was found to be able to capture sediment avalanche events on the back face of the sand dune acknowledgement this study is supported partially by the ministry of science and technology taiwan most 105 2218 e 032 001 this work was also supported in part by the national science foundation under grant no cbet 1706938 any opinions findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author s and do not necessarily reflect those of the national science foundation appendix a numerical implementation of the ramping function referring to fig a 1 the rate at which the water fills the reservoir is usually constant in the experiment until the steady state is reached the discharge rate qo at which the water is discharged through the sluice gate opening into the tank downstream gradually increases the purpose of using a ramping function is to provide a velocity inlet boundary condition at the sluice gate that can mimic the time varying behavior of qo considering a 2d flume setup with a unit width depicted in fig a 1 the continuity of mass requires that a 1 l r d h 1 d t q i q o 0 where lr is the length of the reservoir h 1 the depth of the water in the reservoir h 3 the depth of the water downstream we assume that the water level variation downstream of the sluice gate is negligible given the water level difference h 1 h 3 and the height of the sluice gate opening bo the sluice gate discharge rate qo can be calculated as rajaratnam and subramanya 1967 a 2 q o c o b o 2 g h 1 h 3 where co is the discharge coefficient and expressed as a 3 c o 0 0297 b o h 1 0 589 substituting eq a 2 into eq a 1 and rearranging yields a 4 l r d h 1 d t q i c o b o 2 g h 1 h 3 for given the constant inflow into the reservoir qi and the length of the reservoir l r 1 8 m in this case the above equation combined with eq a 3 can be solved numerically with initial condition of h 3 h 1 to obtain a time varying discharge rate qo initially qo is zero when the steady state is reached q o q i the time required for the discharge qo to reach the steady state is controlled by the reservoir length for given qi the discharge velocity of the sluice gate can then be obtained from the discharge rate and the geometry of the sluice gate opening in the numerical simulation this time varying boundary condition can be implemented using groovybc an open source utility for openfoam appendix b mesh layout and configuration fig b 1 shows a general mesh layout used in the simulation of scouring downstream a submerged horizontal wall jet discussed in section 5 the entire computational domain is divided into mesh blocks a h a non orthogonal mesh is used in blocks a and b to consider the diffusion of the jet flow in order to properly resolve the jet flow and the sediment scouring a fine vertical resolution is used at blocks a e and d with a vertical mesh size near the mobile sand bed being 2d in block e and block d a graded mesh in the vertical direction is used in block d so that the vertical mesh is finest near the sand bed interface and coarser at the bottom of the sand reservoir the horizontal resolution is finest in blocks d e f g with a maximum aspect ratio of less than 3 0 in block e the horizontal resolution in the rest of the blocks is designed so that the aspect ratio does not exceed 5 0 the length of block e is 0 84 m which is longer than the region with active sediment scouring and deposition fig b 2 shows a snapshot of the mesh configuration in the zoom box indicated in fig b 1 
648,interactions between fluid and hydraulic structures and the resulting bed scouring are complex phenomena that involve three phases water air and sediment this study presents a new rheology based three phase flow model that can i track the water air interface in the presence of suspended sediment and ii predict the local scour caused by submerged wall jet a modified volume of fluid vof method was used to track the water air interface and a modified k ϵ turbulence model was employed to capture important features of the turbulent flow including turbulence modulation due to fluid sediment interaction the three phase model was first used to study the sediment transport in open channel flows in order to evaluate the performance of two models for particle response time and then employed to simulate the scouring process downstream a submerged wall jet issued from a sluice gate the simulated bed profiles showed good agreement with the measured it was demonstrated that the three phase model could capture important dynamic features such as sediment avalanche keywords three phase modeling volume of fluid sediment transport scour process sediment avalanche 1 introduction the movement of sediment grains due to fluid flow surrounding them is a two phase phenomena in nature where the fluid is the carrier phase and the sediment is the dispersed phase understanding sediment transport is important in hydraulic and coastal engineering when a flow passes a hydraulic structure the flow pattern changes due to the obstruction of the flow and the formation of vortices causing the local sediment transport rate to increase the increased sediment transport rate usually leads to scouring which can pose a threat to the stability of the structure sumer and fredsøe 2002 to better understand scouring process numerical models dedicated to modeling sediment laden flows and the resulting scour are necessary tools in addition to physical model tests at present most of numerical models have been developed for this purpose are single phase models treating the sediment as a passive scalar with a falling velocity but ignoring effects of particles on the flow and particle particle interactions brors 1999 jacobsen et al 2014 liang et al 2005 liu and garcia 2008 the sediment transport in these models is classified into two modes the suspended load mode and the bed load mode the bed load transport rate is computed using empirical or semi empirical formulas such as the formula proposed by engelund and fredsøe 1976 who obtained the mean sediment velocity by simply considering the average equilibrium of the drag and friction forces exerted on a single particle and assuming the flow velocity around the particle to be a simple linear function of shear velocity however the flow in the bed load layer is complex and the effects of fluid particle and particle particle interactions can be important and should be considered in the simulation capart and fraccarollo 2011 important fluid particle interactions include the turbulence modulation by sediment crowe et al 1996 and the momentum interchange between the sediment and the fluid white 2000 both of which can change the flow field and sediment transport the particle particle interaction is responsible for the rheological characteristics of the fluid sediment mixture the effects of enduring contact and mutual collision as well as fluid viscous effects campbell 2006 cassar et al 2005 all can affect the particle particle interaction the enduring contact effect leads to the coulomb relationship campbell 2006 the inertial effect has to do with the stresses that depend on the square of the strain rates bagnold 1954 and the viscous effects yield the stresses that are associated with the strain rates bagnold 1954 the enduring contact effect is important only for very high concentration flows the particle size and shear velocity determines the relative importance of inertial and fluid viscous effects in flows with high shear velocity and large particles the inertial effect dominates in flows with low shear velocity and small particles the fluid viscous effect dominates some models have been developed in the two phase framework amoudry and liu 2009 chiodi et al 2014 hsu et al 2004 lee et al 2016 li and sawamoto 1995 revil baudard and chauchat 2013 yeganeh bakhtiary et al 2011 to consider the coupled fluid particle and particle particle interactions in two phase flow models both the sediment and fluid phases have their own governing equations for mass and momentum the momentum equations take into account of the drag force between the two phases and the turbulent dispersion effect early two phase flow models considered the turbulence modulation by simply reducing the mixing length according to concentration li and sawamoto 1995 more sophisticated two phase models included additional terms describing the turbulence modulation in two equation turbulence models hsu et al 2004 which consider two effects 1 the dissipation of turbulence due to the correlation between the fluctuating velocities of sediment and fluid phases 2 the buoyancy production of turbulence due to the gradient in sediment concentration because solving the equations governing multi dimensional two phase flow problems in early days was not permitted by the computers at the time most of the numerical studies using two phase flow models were confined to 1d problems even though few studies amoudry and liu 2009 yeganeh bakhtiary et al 2011 did two dimensional two phase flow simulations the bed location the interface between the static sand layer and the mobile layer must be specified at each time step during the computation recently some authors cheng et al 2017 lee et al 2016 used the open source package openfoam opencfd 2014 to develop multi dimensional two phase flow models eliminating the needs for specifying bed location and some favorable preliminary results have been obtained using these two phase flow models flows passing through hydraulic structures may change the water air interface which in turn influences the flow field and sediment transport adduce and la rocca 2006 balachandar et al 2000 it is necessary to consider the water air interface when simulating scour bakhtyar et al 2010 developed a three phase air water and sediment model that can capture the water air interface in the presence of sediment however their model included only the viscous effects on sediment stresses and the effects of buoyancy production on turbulence modulation this study will develop a three phase model by introducing a third phase air into the liquid solid two phase model of lee et al 2016 which considered enduring contact mutual collision inertial fluid viscous effects in sediment stress and two mechanisms of turbulence modulation for model verification the three phase model is applied to simulate the local scour caused by a submerged wall jet with a water air surface a phenomenon commonly encountered in sluice gate problems and having applications in hydroelectric power plants and irrigation 2 mathematical formulation the governing equations for three phase flows air water and sediment and the related closures are presented in this section two models for particle response time τp which is used to compute the drag force are examined one is based on sedimentation richardson and zaki 1954 and the other is based on the pressure drop in steady flow through a porous media engelund and fredsøe 1976 2 1 governing equations a volume of fluid vof method hirt 1981 is used to track the water air interface in vof methods the air water interface is defined as a region occupied by a mixture of water and air liquid saturation s is defined as the ratio of the volume of water to the total volume of void air and water in a control volume liquid saturation is used as an indicator function for classifying whether a spatial point is occupied by air water or both for s 1 the region is occupied by water alone for s 0 the region is occupied by air alone for 0 s 1 the region is defined as the water air interface in the absence of the sediment phase the indicator function for three phase flows should reduce to that used for liquid gas flows rusche 2003 to determine the water air interface we consider the water and air phases as a single fluid phase of water air mixture with a variable density and a variable viscosity as in previous studies on liquid gas flows rusche 2003 the density ρf and viscosity νf of the fluid phase the water air mixture are determined by 1 ρ f s ρ w 1 s ρ a and 2 ν f s ν w 1 s ν a where ρw and ρa are the densities of the water and air phases respectively νw and νa are the kinematic viscosities of the water and air phases respectively the velocities of the water and air phases are assumed to be the same at the water air interface due to the no slip condition the mass balance equations for three phase flows can be obtained through averaging processes brennen 2005 and they can be written as brennen 2005 3 c t c u s 0 for the sediment phase 4 1 c s t 1 c s u f 0 for the liquid phase and 5 1 c 1 s t 1 c 1 s u f 0 for the gaseous phase since the flow beneath the water air interface is a solid liquid two phase flow the equations for momentum balance are the same as those used in the previous two phase models hsu et al 2004 lee et al 2016 6 ρ s c u s t ρ s c u s u s ρ s c g c p f c p s c t s c ρ s u f u s τ p ρ s τ p 1 c ν f t σ c c for

particle response time νft the eddy viscosity of the liquid phase σc the schmidt number the last two terms in eqs 6 and 7 are related to momentum interchanges between the solid and liquid phases the first term accounts for the drag force and the second term for turbulent dispersion a k ϵ model with a low reynolds number correction is applied to compute t f lee et al 2016 the turbulence kinetic

the same as those in k ϵ model for clear water at present we don t have a good understanding of the model parameter c ϵ3 the parameter α measures how well the particles follow the fluid fluctuation the two terms in in eqs 8 and 9 account for the turbulence modulation due to the presence of particles the first term is associated to buoyancy and the second term is due to the correlation between the fluctuating velocities of sediment and fluid for other details about the k ϵ model used here the reader is referred to lee et al 2016 2 2 sediment stresses lee et al 2016 suggested that ps and t s should consider 1 the elastic behavior for static compact granular material hsu et al 2004 2 the turbulent behavior of sediment motion hinze 1959 and 3 the rheological characteristics of the fluid particle mixture trulsson et al 2012 consequently the pressure of the sediment phase is a superposition of three components 10 p s p s r p s e p s t where psr reflects the rheological characteristics when the sediment is in motion pse accounts for the elastic effect when sediment is in its static state and pst accounts for the turbulent motion of sediment phase lee et al 2016 used a regularization technique that regards the static sediment layer as a very viscous fluid and wrote t s as 11 t s 2 3 ρ s ν s u s 2 ρ s ν s d s where d s is the strain rate νs is modeled by 12 ν s ν s v ν s t where νsv and νst account for the rheological characteristics visco plastic effect and turbulence effects respectively closures for psr pse pst νsv and νst are needed in the following we only present the models for psr and νsv for later discussion for other parameters the reader is referred to lee et al 2016 for dry granular materials the drag force between the solid phase and the air is not important due to the large difference between the densities therefore the rheological characteristics have only the inertial regime which can be described by kinetic theory lee et al 2015b however for submerged granular materials the liquid can also affect the rheological characteristics of granular material bagnold 1954 suggested that the rheological characteristics of granular materials should have two regimes inertial regime and viscous regime these two regimes can be distinguished by the so called bagnold number b a ρ s d d s ρ f ν f where d is the diameter of sediment particles and d s d s in the inertial regime the value of ba is large while in the viscous regimes the value of ba is small bagnold 1954 proposed two formulas to compute t s in these two regimes by assuming that t s ps is a function of constant η in the last decade some studies find that the constant η depends on the inertial number i i 2 d d s c p s ρ s for large values of ba jop et al 2006 the viscous number i v 2 ρ f ν f d s c p s for small values of ba cassar et al 2005 or the combination of the two i i v a i i 2 trulsson et al 2012 with a being a constant the inertial number is the ratio of inertial shear stress to friction shear stress associated with the weight resulting from enduring contact the viscous number is the ratio of the viscous shear stress to the friction shear stress and the value of a depends on the critical value of ba at which sediment dynamics transfer from one regime to the other many models for the relationship between η and i have been proposed and one example is 13 η η 1 η 2 η 1 1 i o i with η 1 η 2 and io being constants trulsson et al 2012 in eq 13 η 1 is associated with the angle of repose using the regularization technique lee et al 2016 computed νsv by 14 ν s v p s r p s e η 2 ρ s d s where η was given by eq 14 previous studies cassar et al 2005 jop et al 2006 trulsson et al 2012 found that c decreased monotonically from a constant cc around 0 6 when ii iv or i was increased based on these finding lee et al 2016 suggested that psr be computed by 15 p s r 2 b 2 c c c c 2 ρ f ν f 2 a ρ s d 2 d s d s where b is a constant 2 3 particle response time particle response time τp which is related to the drag coefficient has effects on the momentum interchange between the two phases at present there is no universal model available for computing τp two models for τp will be examined in this study one model is based on sedimentation richardson and zaki 1954 valid for c 0 4 yin and koch 2007 and the other is based on steady flow through porous media engelund and fredsøe 1976 see also pitman and le 2005 the first model examined in this study is based on sedimentation test the particle response time can be written as 16 τ p ρ s ρ f ρ s w 1 c 2 g where w is the hindered settling velocity the sedimentation velocity of sediment particles in a particle cloud richardson and zaki 1954 suggested that the hindered settling velocity should be smaller than the terminal settling velocity of a single particle ws and proposed the following relationship between w and ws 17 w w s 1 c n where c is the concentration and n is given by 18 n 4 65 r e s 0 2 4 4 r e s 0 33 0 2 r e s 1 4 4 r e s 0 1 1 r e s 500 2 4 500 r e s where r e s w s d ν f is the particle settling reynolds number the terminal velocity of a single particle can be computed by chien and wan 1999 19 w s 4 d g 3 c d ρ s ρ f ρ f where cd is the drag coefficient for steady flows passing a small object for spheres white 2000 suggested 20 c d 24 r e p 6 1 r e p 0 4 where rep is the particle reynolds number defined by r e p u f u s d ν f the model for τp based on eqs 16 20 is referred to as the rz model i e richard and zaki model hereafter the second model examined in this study is based on pressure drop when flow pass through porous media according to the study of engelund and fredsøe 1976 τp can be computed by 21 τ p ρ s d 2 ρ f ν f 1 a e c 2 b e r e p where ae and be are the model parameters it is found that ae varies from 780 to 1500 or more and be varies from 1 8 to 3 6 or more burcharth and andersen 1995 engelund and fredsøe 1976 eq 21 is referred as ef model i e engelund and fredsøe model hereafter 3 numerical scheme this study uses openfoam opencfd 2014 to solve the governing equations and closures presented in section 2 the main challenges of solving these equations include 1 how to compute pf 2 how to avoid the numerical instability caused by high sediment concentration and 3 how to capture the water air interface the first and second challenges also exist in other two phase flow simulations lee et al 2016 combined the pimple scheme to solve the equations for the fluid phase opencfd 2014 and the predicted corrected scheme to solve the sediment phase lee et al 2015b the pimple scheme is a combination of two famous schemes that adjust fluid pressure to keep mass balance the pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso scheme and the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple scheme ferziger and peric 2002 in the predicted corrected scheme for the sediment phase lee et al 2015b the discrete mass balance equation for the sediment phase eq 3 becomes an advection diffusion equation instead of an advection equation the diffusion behavior subdues the fluctuation in concentration and helps improve the numerical stability when the concentration is high combining eqs 3 5 gives 22 1 c u f c u s 0 therefore the governing equations for the solid fluid two phases eqs 3 6 7 and 22 are the same as those used in lee et al 2016 in the following we will show how to modify the numerical scheme in ref lee et al 2016 to capture the water air interface in the presence of the sediment phase we first derive the equation governing s from the mass balance equations eqs 3 4 and 22 we obtain 23 s t s u f s u f 0 if the sediment phase is absent eq 22 yields u f 0 and thus the third term in eq 23 disappears resulting in the classic equation for s used in the vof method for liquid gas two phase flows rusche 2003 solving eq 23 directly causes too much diffusion near the water air interface to avoid this an extra term is included in eq 23 to artificially compress the water air interface rusche 2003 with this extra term eq 23 becomes 24 s t s u f s u f s 1 s u r 0 where u r is the velocity field to compress the water air interface for details about u r the reader is referred to ref rusche 2003 openfoam provides a multi dimensional universal limiter with explicit solution mules opencfd 2014 for solving eq 24 with guaranteed boundedness of s 0 s 1 the numerical procedure to solve the equations in sections 2 and 3 is summarized below 1 solving eq 24 for s 2 calculating ρf and νf according to eqs 1 and 2 respectively 3 computing u f u s pf c k and ϵ using the scheme proposed by lee et al 2016 an inner loop and an outer loop are needed the inner loop repeats ni times to correct pf the outer loop repeats no times to compute u f u s pf c k and ϵ bakhtyar et al 2010 developed a three phase model with the capability of capturing the water air interface following the study of hirt 1981 on simulating free surface flows bakhtyar et al 2010 solved the following equation for s 25 s t u f s 0 in order to track the water air interface eq 25 is mathematically identical to eq 23 except that eq 23 is written in its conservation form required by mules their numerical scheme differs from ours in that their scheme requires the bed location to be specified during the computation preventing their model from simulating avalanche 4 application to sediment transport in open channel flow the present model is applied to simulate sediment transport in open channel using the rz and ef models for τp the purpose of this section was to compare the two models for τp and understand the sensitivity of our three phase model to uncertainties in two model parameters used in the ef model for τp in our simulations an uniform 1d vertical mesh was established within the domain with a height of 0 25 m and the initially static sediment layer was set to occupy the lower portion of the domain with c 0 6031 the initial thickness of the sand layer was set to 0 0525 m sand with a diameter of d 0 25 mm and a density of ρ s 2600 kg m 3 was used in the simulations the open channel flow driven by gravity is assumed to be uniform and thus a periodic boundary condition can be applied in the direction of the flow and the slip condition on the top boundary a grid size of 0 625d was used a convergence test performed with a smaller grid size of 0 31d showed that the discrepancies between the two meshes were within 3 ten key model parameters used in this study are presented in table 1 and other model parameters are the same as those used in the previous study of lee et al 2016 the main differences in the model parameters used here and in ref lee et al 2016 are the values of 1 σc and c ϵ3 the values of these two parameters used here are 1 σ c 0 6 and c ϵ 3 0 6 which were determined based on the simulation results in the next section for the local scour induced by a submerged wall jet issued from a sluice gate fig 1 shows the dimensionless sediment transport rate q versus the shields parameter θ q q d ρ s ρ f 1 g d with q being the dimensional sediment transport rate and θ τ b g ρ s ρ f d with τb being the bed shear stress the results computed using both the ef and rz models are presented in fig 1 as suggested by hsu et al 2004 the near bed region with c 0 08 is regarded as the bed load layer the formulas of meyer peter and müller mpm meyer peter and müller 1948 hanes and inman 1985 and ribberink 1998 are also included in fig 1 for comparison we remark that the formula of meyer peter and müller 1948 is based on the flume experiments for θ 0 2 the formula of ribberink 1998 is based on the laboratory experiments for 0 07 θ 7 and the formula of hanes and inman 1985 is based on bagnold s empirical relationship of strain rate and stress for granular flows bagnold 1954 generally speaking the total and bed load sediment transport rates given by both the ef and rz models are similar for larger values of θ the total load and bed load transport rates given by both models are generally over estimated compared with the formulas of mpm and hanes but close to the formula of ribberink for smaller values of θ the computed sediment transport rate results are closer to the formula of hanes but under estimated compared with the formulas of mpm and ribberink it is worth noticing that the bed load transport rate given by the rz model at θ 0 1 is less than 10 3 indicating the sediment transport is almost all due to the suspended load however we should expect a bed load dominated transport for low θ therefore the ef model will be adopted in the next section to simulate the scouring process downstream of a sluice gate a sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the sensitivity of the ef model for particle response time to possible uncertainties in the two model parameters ae and be changes in the total load transport rate q was examined in the sensitivity analysis by changing one parameter at a time within a given range with the other parameter being fixed three values of ae were examined 760 1000 and 1500 which correspond to spherical particles rounded sand grains and irregular angular grains respectively engelund and fredsøe 1976 the parameter be varied between 1 8 and 3 6 we use the total load transport rate obtained with a e 1000 and b e 3 6 are the reference values when 0 1 θ 0 4 the use of ae 760 reduced q by 4 but the use of ae 1500 increased q by 14 reducing b e from 3 6 to 1 8 introduced a change in q by about 10 in the next section we will use a e 1000 and b e 3 6 to simulate the local scour caused by a submerged wall jet issued from a sluice gate the error in the quantities related to sediment transport is expected to be about 10 due to the uncertainties in ae and be 5 application to the development of local scour downstream of a sluice gate we now apply the three phase model to study the local scour downstream of a rigid apron caused by a submerged horizontal wall jet issued from a sluice gate as shown in fig 2 local scour occurs when the shields parameter exceeds the critical shields parameter for sediment initiation a scour hole forms downstream of the apron and a sand dune forms downstream of the scour hole many studies have been devoted to this classical problem experimentally to understand the equilibrium scour depth the development of scour hole and the rate of sediment removal adduce and la rocca 2006 adduce and sciortino 2006 ali and lim 1986 balachandar et al 2000 chatterjee et al 1994 dey and sarkar 2006 dodaro et al 2016 hassan and narayanan 1985 hopfinger et al 2004 xie and lim 2015 the local scour has been found to be affected by following factors the particle densimetric froude number v g d ρ s ρ f 1 with v being the jet velocity the jet froude number v g b o with bo sluice gate opening apron length tailwater level and the startup conditions aamir and ahmad 2016 some theoretical and numerical studies have also been devoted to modeling the local scour downstream of a rigid apron under submerged wall jets for example hassan and narayanan 1985 proposed a simple semi empirical theory to predict the time rate of scouring process based on the velocity in the scour hole liu and garcia 2008 and hoffmans and booij 1993 solved the reynolds averaged naiver stokes equations for the fluid phase and the exner equation for bed evolution with empirical models for sediment transport rates however these existing numerical models did not take into consideration the turbulence modulation and the particle particle interactions three phase simulations of the local scour due to a submerged wall jet issued from a sluice gate have not been reported in the literature in this section we apply our three phase model to reproduce the experimental results of run 2 in the study of chatterjee et al 1994 which reached the equilibrium within 30 minutes the shortest of all available experiments 5 1 numerical setups fig 2 shows the numerical setup which is the same as the experimental setup used in ref chatterjee et al 1994 except for the reservoir a two dimensional computational domain without reservoir is used in the simulation in order to reduce the computational load referring to fig 2 the sluice gate opening bo is 2 cm the length of apron lap is 0 66 m the sediment reservoir length ls is 2 1 m the overflow weir has a height of 0 239 m the upstream inflow discharge rate at the sluice opening is 0 204 m2 s which translates into an average horizontal flow velocity v 1 02 m s under the sluice gate quartz sand with ρ s 2650 kg m3 and d 0 76 mm is placed in the sediment reservoir with its top surface being on the same level as the top surface of the apron we remark that chatterjee et al 1994 reported v 1 56 m s which was measured by a micropitot tube in the experiment and δh 11 8 cm δh is the difference between the water level in the reservoir and in the test section however the contraction coefficient obtained using the reported values of v and δh exceeds one which we believe is unreasonable therefore v 1 02 m s which is consistent with the discharge rate reported in chatterjee et al 1994 will be adopted in the simulations presented in the rest of this paper for the fluid phase including liquid and gas a wall function boundary condition for smooth wall is imposed on all rigid boundaries the mean velocity at the sluice gate opening is prescribed according to the given discharge rate the fluid pressure is set to zero at the upper and outlet boundaries but the fluid pressure is set to have a zero gradient on other boundaries for the sediment phase a no slip boundary condition is implemented on all rigid boundaries for both the fluid and sediment phases the velocity gradient is set to zero at the upper boundary and above the weir the gradients of saturation s and sediment concentration c are set to zero on all boundaries except at the inlet boundary where s 1 and c 0 are used since chatterjee et al 1994 did not report the detailed startup conditions used in their experiment we assume here that the initial water depth is 0 239 m and impose a ramping function on the mean velocity of the flow at the sluice gate opening we comment that the choice of the ramping function only affect the shape of the scour hole in the first one minute or so for details of this ramping function the reader is referred to appendix a for the sediment concentration in the sediment reservoir an initial value of c 0 6018 is used values for the key model parameters listed in table 1 were used in the simulations and the friction coefficient η 1 in eq 13 which is related to the angle of repose was 0 55 in the simulations a non uniform mesh was used in the simulation the interface between the sediment and fluid requires special treatment in terms of mesh size in order to accurately capture the interfacial momentum transfer therefore the finest mesh with a vertical mesh resolution of 2d was used in the vicinity of the sediment fluid interface this fine mesh covers the dynamic sediment fluid interface during the entire scour process at locations away from the sediment fluid interface or locations where the scouring is predicted to be negligible for example further downstream the sand dune the mesh sizes with a vertical resolution ranging from 3 mm to 5 mm were used the aspect ratio of the mesh outside the wall jet region was less than 3 0 since in the wall jet horizontal velocity is significantly larger than the vertical velocity the aspect ratio used in the wall jet region was less than 5 0 a snapshot of the mesh configuration near the downstream edge of the rigid apron and the upstream of sediment reservoir is shown in fig b 2 in appendix b where the reader can find more details about the mesh setup a grid dependence test has been carried out and the meshes with identical layout but a grid size 25 smaller finer mesh or 25 larger coarser mesh than the current mesh were used in the test compared to the current mesh at t 300 s the coarser mesh over predicted the height of the sand dune by 10 the peak location by 1 5 and under predicted the scour depth by about 2 6 the finer mesh under predicted the height of the sand dune by less than 8 and the scour depth by less than 0 3 the peak location is over predicted by 0 6 openfoam provides a set of built in numerical schemes to discretize respective fields which were used to discretize fields in this numerical work a crank nicolson scheme with an off centering coefficient of 0 5 was used for time discretization for most of the other operators gaussian or bounded gaussian with limiter was used as the discretization scheme during the initial stage of the simulation the concentration of the sediment phase changes slightly from the preset value to reach a stable packing status due to elastic effect during this initial stage a smaller time step was used to ensure the numerical stability the time step is controlled automatically by the courant friedrichs lewy condition with the courant number 0 1 during the initial sediment settling stage after t 30 s the time step is controlled by courant number 0 3 a 720 s of physical time takes 3 days on two computation nodes each with two central processing units intel xeon e5 2670 connected using a 40 gbps infiniband high speed network 5 2 results and discussion main results to be presented and discussed in this section include simulated flow field and bed profile evolution sediment avalanche and a sensitivity analysis 5 2 1 bed profile and its key characteristics detailed comparisons between the computed scour profiles and those measured chatterjee et al 1994 at t 60 180 300 480 720 1200 and 1800 s are shown in fig 3 where the distribution of sediment concentration is also included in these figures the bed profile was determined by the contour line of c 0 5 the water air interface is also shown in the figures and the water surface set down induced by the submerged wall jet can be noticed in the figures under the action of the jet flow a scour hole develops in the initially flat sand bed downstream of the rigid apron and a sand dune forms downstream of the scour hole the on set of sediment scouring is rapid during the initial period but gradually slows down as the scour hole develops its trough location shifts downstream and the depth and width of the scour hole and the height of the sand dune continue to increase further downstream of the sand dune the sand bed remains mostly unchanged the general agreement between the simulated and measured bed profiles is satisfactory except for some minor discrepancies between the simulated and measured sand dune profiles after t 1200 s the discrepancies are mainly in the dune height and the shape of the dune crest the simulated dune crests are slightly sharper than the measured ones at the later state of the scour process which might be due to the limitation of k ϵ model in simulating the flow separation around the dune crest we also remark that the simulation is 2d while the scour profile in the experiment may have 3d features which may have also contributed to the differences found in fig 3 during the entire process shown in fig 3 it can be observed that the extent to which the suspended sediment can reach is more or less the same which is around x 1 2 m this appears to be correlated to the final peak location of the sand dune with the downstream migration of the sand dune the size of the region where the suspended sand has a concentration larger than 0 0001 is reducing theoretically speaking the final equilibrium is reached when the net sediment transport rate is zero everywhere along the bed profile the simulated horizontal location of the sand dune peak xd the maximum accretion height hd and the depth of the scour hole zs are shown in fig 4 where the experimental data chatterjee et al 1994 are also included for comparison it can be seen that the equilibrium scour condition has not been reached at t 30 minutes the simulated maximum scour depths also agree well with the experimental measurements generally speaking the simulated peak locations of the sand dune xd agree well with experimental observations except for slight over estimations when t 1200 s the maximum accretion heights are slightly under predicted in general in addition to possible 3d effects in the experiment other possible factors that may have contributed to these discrepancies will be discussed later in section 5 2 5 5 2 2 flow fields of the fluid and sediment phases fig 5 shows the streamlines and velocity magnitude of the entire flow field taken at t 300 1200 and 1800 s including both the liquid phase and the gas phase three vortex flow patterns can be observers in the flow field the formation of these vortex flow patterns is due to flow separation which itself is caused by the negative pressure gradient near a curved boundary flow separation occurs at a point where the shear stress is zero therefore the presence of a vortex flow pattern in a region weakens the flow there a very large counter clockwise vortex can be observed above the jet flow downstream of the sluice gate and this vortex flow pattern resembles to the one generated by a submerged jet issued from a sluice gate reported in gumus et al 2016 while the jet flow passes underneath this large vortex the jet cross section gradually increases see also fig 5 a small clockwise vortex near the edge of the rigid apron can also be observed which is consistent with the recirculation pattern observed in the laboratory experiment of hoffmans and booij 1993 the small vortex also yields a small scour hole which grows and migrates downstream with time and finally merges into the main scour profile see also figs 5 and 6 as shown in fig 5 another medium sized but weak clockwise vortex in the lee side of the sand dune exists with the development of the sand dune this vortex reduces in both size and strength the presence of the vortex flow pattern in the lee side of the sand dune helps to deposit sand in the region as shown in fig 6 for the flow field of the sediment phase fig 6 shows the snapshots of sediment phase velocity fields taken at four time instants t 60 300 720 and 1800 s in the scour hole the sediment is mobilized by the jet flow and transported uphill before the point of maximum scour depth the sand is transported mainly within a narrow region adjacent to the movable bed between the point of maximum depth and the dune peak it appears that both the bed load and suspended load transport the sand after the mobilized sediment particles past the dune peak they are transported mainly by the sedimentation process because of the low velocity associated with the clockwise vortex behind the sand dune with the development of scour hole the size of the region in the lee side of the sand dune where sand moves in suspension reduces in size making the migration and growth of the sand dune slower 5 2 3 sediment avalanche in their experimental study of effect of grain size on the dynamics of local scour downstream of a sluice gate balachandar et al 2000 and kells et al 2001 observed sediment avalanche and concluded that reducing the discharge or increasing either the grain size or the tailwater depth reduces the tendency of sediment avalanche our simulation also clearly shows the occurrence of multiple sediment avalanching events as an example fig 7 shows a series of snapshots of back face profile of the sand dune capturing an avalanching event occurred between t 109 5 and 111 s a lump of sediment first moves down the slope against the flow from t 109 0 s to 111 0 s and then moves up the slope with the flow from t 111 0 s to 112 0 s the simulated avalanching event is in consistent with the collapse of sand mass in an erodible sand bed observed in the experiment of balachandar et al 2000 the slope of deposited sand on the back face of the sand dune may exceed the angle of repose if there is enough bed shear stress from the flow above to hold the sand slope in place however when the slope gets so steep that the bed shear stress can no longer balance out the excessive downward gravitational force avalanching collapse of sand mass may occur locally after the avalanche the local flow field is altered and the local bed shear stress is increased facilitating the forward transport of the sand on the back face until a new balance is reached between the shear stress and the gravitational force our simulation shows that the migration and growth of the sand dune are closely related to the sediment avalanching events even though our simulation also shows avalanching events on the slope close to the apron these events are not as significant as those on the back side of the sand dune we remark that avalenching events cannot be captured by traditional one phase models or two phase models with one way coupling between the fluid and sediment phases 5 2 4 sensitivity analysis lee et al 2016 suggested that σc and c ϵ3 should be the two most important parameters affecting the scour underneath a pipeline the parameter σc defines the ratio between the turbulent diffusion of the carrier phase and the diffusion of sediment particles the parameter c ϵ3 is related to the turbulence modulation due to the presence of particles in the k ϵ equations a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity of the location of the sand dune xd and the scour depth zs to these two parameters it is unlikely that the diffusion of sediment phase can be larger than the diffusion of the carrier phase therefore 1 σc would reasonably have a maximum value of 1 0 based on this rationale 1 σc in this sensitivity test varied from 0 4 to 1 0 the value of c ϵ3 varied from 0 5 to 1 2 previous studies hsu et al 2004 lee et al 2016 suggested that the typical value of c ϵ3 should be around 1 this sensitivity test used 1 σc 0 6 and c ϵ3 0 6 as the reference values figs 8 and fig 9 summarize the sensitivity test results the location of the sand dune and the scour depth at four representative time instants were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the three phase model to σc and c ϵ3 keeping c ϵ3 0 6 but varying 1 σc in the range of 0 4 and 1 0 only causes xd to have a change less than 11 compared to the reference scenario 1 σ c 0 6 keeping 1 σc 0 6 but varying c ϵ3 in the range of 0 4 and 1 2 only causes xd to have a change less than 8 compared to the reference scenario c ϵ3 0 6 it is concluded that xd is not very sensitive to both 1 σc and c ϵ3 within the tested ranges referring to fig 9 for the instantaneous scour depth zs the same conclusion can be drawn that the scour depth is not very sensitive to both 1 σc and c ϵ3 within the tested ranges 5 2 5 discussion the minor discrepancies between the simulated and measured key characteristics of the bed profile may be attributed to several factors including the use of constant σc and c ϵ3 obtained through model calibration as discussed below in the sensitivity analysis on 1 σc for dilute flows lee et al 2015a proposed an expression for 1 σc which depends on two stokes numbers s t τ p τ f with τ f 0 165 k ϵ and s t η τ p τ η with τη being the kolmogorov time scale based on their limited results obtained using a direct numerical simulation method squires and eaton 1994 concluded that the values of c ϵ2 and c ϵ3 should be affected by the presence of sediment particles in a particle laden flow for 0 6 c ϵ3 3 84 in particular they found that the value of c ϵ3 decreased with increasing either the concentration of particles or the stokes number st because stokes number st changes with θ which has both spatial and temporal variations in the present problem 1 σc and c ϵ3 should change in space and time as well there is a difficulty to use the model for 1 σc proposed by lee et al 2015a this is because the flow field in the present problem is much more complex than the open channel flow studied in ref lee et al 2015a and because the k ϵ model in the present three phase model does not include the sediment induced turbulence production because of numerical stability issues unless an extensive calibration is done a direct implementation of the expressions for 1 σc summarized in ref lee et al 2015a may not be appropriate therefore this study determined a representative value for 1 σc through model calibration and found that 1 σ c 0 6 could give acceptable results we remark that the ranges of the two stokes numbers in the present problem also suggest that 1 σc should be between 0 4 and 0 8 according to the conclusions in ref lee et al 2015a at the present there is a difficulty to model the temporal and spatial variations of c ϵ3 squires and eaton 1994 did not provide enough data to establish a model for c ϵ3 which can be implemented in our simulations again this study determined a representative value for c ϵ3 through model calibration and found that c ϵ3 0 6 could give acceptable results because the typical stokes number within the bed load layer was found to be around 0 5 in the present problem we should expect a typical value of c ϵ3 less than 1 0 according to ref squires and eaton 1994 it is anticipated that considering both the temporal and spatial variations in 1 σc and c ϵ3 when appropriate models for them are available in the future should reduce the discrepancy between the simulated and measured sand dune profiles 6 conclusions this study presented a rheology based three phase model for sediment transport problems with a water air interface a modified k ϵ turbulence model was employed to compute the fluid phase shear stresses a special modification was introduced so that the interface compression vof method can track the water air interface in the presence of the sediment phase the three phase model was used to study two problems sediment transport under 1d open channel flow condition and local scour induced by a 2d horizontal wall jet issued from a sluice gate two models for particle response time were examined in the numerical simulations of the first problem the engelund and fredsøe model for particle response time was found to give better prediction of sediment transport rate for small values of shields parameter and thus was used in the three phase flow simulations of the local scour downstream of a sluice gate the depth of the scour hole and the location of sand dune predicted by numerical model agreed well with the laboratory experimental results however the height of the sand dune at later stage of the scouring process was slightly under predicted by the present model which is due mainly to the difficulty in modeling the weak bed shear stress presently the three phase model was found to be able to capture sediment avalanche events on the back face of the sand dune acknowledgement this study is supported partially by the ministry of science and technology taiwan most 105 2218 e 032 001 this work was also supported in part by the national science foundation under grant no cbet 1706938 any opinions findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author s and do not necessarily reflect those of the national science foundation appendix a numerical implementation of the ramping function referring to fig a 1 the rate at which the water fills the reservoir is usually constant in the experiment until the steady state is reached the discharge rate qo at which the water is discharged through the sluice gate opening into the tank downstream gradually increases the purpose of using a ramping function is to provide a velocity inlet boundary condition at the sluice gate that can mimic the time varying behavior of qo considering a 2d flume setup with a unit width depicted in fig a 1 the continuity of mass requires that a 1 l r d h 1 d t q i q o 0 where lr is the length of the reservoir h 1 the depth of the water in the reservoir h 3 the depth of the water downstream we assume that the water level variation downstream of the sluice gate is negligible given the water level difference h 1 h 3 and the height of the sluice gate opening bo the sluice gate discharge rate qo can be calculated as rajaratnam and subramanya 1967 a 2 q o c o b o 2 g h 1 h 3 where co is the discharge coefficient and expressed as a 3 c o 0 0297 b o h 1 0 589 substituting eq a 2 into eq a 1 and rearranging yields a 4 l r d h 1 d t q i c o b o 2 g h 1 h 3 for given the constant inflow into the reservoir qi and the length of the reservoir l r 1 8 m in this case the above equation combined with eq a 3 can be solved numerically with initial condition of h 3 h 1 to obtain a time varying discharge rate qo initially qo is zero when the steady state is reached q o q i the time required for the discharge qo to reach the steady state is controlled by the reservoir length for given qi the discharge velocity of the sluice gate can then be obtained from the discharge rate and the geometry of the sluice gate opening in the numerical simulation this time varying boundary condition can be implemented using groovybc an open source utility for openfoam appendix b mesh layout and configuration fig b 1 shows a general mesh layout used in the simulation of scouring downstream a submerged horizontal wall jet discussed in section 5 the entire computational domain is divided into mesh blocks a h a non orthogonal mesh is used in blocks a and b to consider the diffusion of the jet flow in order to properly resolve the jet flow and the sediment scouring a fine vertical resolution is used at blocks a e and d with a vertical mesh size near the mobile sand bed being 2d in block e and block d a graded mesh in the vertical direction is used in block d so that the vertical mesh is finest near the sand bed interface and coarser at the bottom of the sand reservoir the horizontal resolution is finest in blocks d e f g with a maximum aspect ratio of less than 3 0 in block e the horizontal resolution in the rest of the blocks is designed so that the aspect ratio does not exceed 5 0 the length of block e is 0 84 m which is longer than the region with active sediment scouring and deposition fig b 2 shows a snapshot of the mesh configuration in the zoom box indicated in fig b 1 
649,turbidity currents are buoyancy driven submarine flows where the source of buoyancy is typically a polydisperse sediment suspension sustained propagation of such flows depend on the ability of turbulence in the flow to keep the settling sediments in suspension recent studies by cantero et al 2012b and shringarpure et al 2012 have investigated the interaction of monodisperse sediment suspension and turbulence in turbidity currents on smooth sloping beds these studies showed that stable stratification of sediment suspension damps turbulence and in some cases can be fully suppress turbulence furthermore it was shown that the turbulence damping effect of a monodisperse sediment suspension can be quantified by the product of shear richardson number and the sediment settling velocity in this study we generalize this result for a polydisperse sediment suspension we compare the turbulence statistics of turbidity currents driven by different polydisperse suspensions and show that as long as the total amount of sediment and the product of shear richardson number and effective settling velocity a value representing the polydisperse suspension are the same the turbulent velocity statistics of the different polydisperse suspensions nearly collapse furthermore if the effective settling velocity is chosen to be depth dependent a function of height from the bed then the turbulence statistics involving sediment concentration also collapses between different polydisperse suspensions these results suggest the possibility of modeling polydisperse currents with an equivalent monodisperse suspension whose total sediment load and depth dependent settling velocity match those of the polydisperse suspension keywords turbidity currents polydisperse suspensions turbulence multiphase flows msc 00 01 99 00 1 introduction typically turbidity currents are characterized as highly turbulent flows driven by dilute concentration of suspended sediments allen 2001 kneller and buckee 2000 parsons et al 2009 these flows are extremely energetic krause et al 1970 prior et al 1987 travel long distances kneller and buckee 2000 and are an important sediment transport mechanism in the submarine world garcía 1992 parsons et al 2009 field scale turbidity currents are complex spatially and temporally evolving flows several factors like ambient conditions stratification salinity bed topography slope roughness and shape bed conditions particle size distribution cohesive effects compaction and description of the sediment suspension driving the flow particle size distribution total suspended load have varying influence on the flow a turbidity current can be divided into three regions head body and a tail allen 2001 simpson 1997 ungarish 2009 the head is the most energetic part characterized as highly turbulent with intense mixing cantero et al 2007a 2007b hartel et al 2000 necker et al 2005 patterson et al 2006 it can be extremely erosive and rework the bed cantero et al 2008b however from the perspective of a fixed point on the bed the head passes over it quickly and therefore its effect lasts only for a short duration the tail of a turbidity current is a weak and depositional flow kneller et al 1997 the body of a turbidity current is a region of transition from the highly turbulent head to a weak depositional tail it must be noted that the head and tail will always exist however the existence of a distinct body is determined by various factors like the bed conditions and sediment load at the time of flow inception nevertheless the body is considered to be the main manifestation of a turbidity current and a primary mechanism for sediment transport in the past several decades there has been an intensive effort to study various regions and aspects of turbidity currents these studies range from laboratory experiments bonnecaze et al 1995 1996 garcia and parker 1993 sequeiros et al 2010 to field observations talling et al 2007 xu et al 2004 great effort has also been devoted to numerical simulations of turbidity currents with emphasis on studying the flow dynamics cantero et al 2007a 2008a 2005 2007b das et al 2004 hartel et al 2000 imran et al 2004 turbulent structures cantero et al 2008b turbulence modulation cantero et al 2014 2009b and topographical effects of the sea bed cantero et al 2012a nasr azadani et al 2013 nasr azadani and meiburg 2014 theoretical analysis has given conditions for self accelerating and auto suspension turbidity currents bagnold 1962 fukushima et al 1985 pantin 1979 pantin and franklin 2009 parker et al 1986 and also proposed reduced or simplified box models for simulating and analyzing such flows see parker et al 1986 for shallow water equations and bonnecaze et al 1995 for box models experiments have been performed to validate some of these theoretical predictions sequeiros et al 2009 more recently cantero et al 2009a and shringarpure et al 2012 employed direct numerical simulations to study the dynamics of the flow in the body of turbidity currents in greater detail up to date the study of the dynamics of polydisperse turbidity currents has received limited attention recently nasr azadani et al 2013 and nasr azadani and meiburg 2014 investigated the effect of polydisperse lock exchange currents on bed topography by performing experiments and numerical simulations in turbidity currents the sediment suspension has two effects on the flow it drives the flow which generates turbulence due to the imposed excess density and the settling sediment particles preferentially segregates in the flow leading to a stable stratification of sediment concentration which damps turbulence the driving effect of suspended sediments is proportional to the total volumetric concentration of sediment on the other hand the damping effect on turbulence can be viewed as the total turbulent kinetic energy spent by the flow to keep the settling sediment particles in suspension cantero et al 2012b showed that the damping effect in a monodisperse turbidity current is controlled by the product of shear richardson number riτ and settling velocity of the sediment v c o s θ here v is the dimensionless settling velocity of a sediment particle in still fluid and θ is the bed angle with the horizontal direction this parametric grouping was extended to bi disperse suspensions shringarpure et al 2014 2015 where it takes the form r i τ γ 1 v 1 γ 2 v 2 cos θ here v i is the dimensionless settling velocity of the sediment size group i and γi is the fractional volume of this sediment group note that by definition γ 1 γ 2 1 in this study we focus on the underlying interaction ofa polydisperse suspension and turbulence in planar turbidity currents in particular we focus on turbidity currents through submarine canyons on the continental slopes in this scenario the flow is assumed to be planar and confined inside the canyon furthermore the submarine canyon is assumed to be straight with a constant width we further simplify some of the complex physics like resuspension bed load transport and couplingwith the bed topography by considering the turbidity currentto be in auto suspension mode bagnold 1962 sequeiros et al 2009 propagating on an inclined flat bed we restrict ourattention to the body of the current and examine the effect of polydispersity on flow turbulence under these assumptions the total sediment load is conserved and the flow will reach a statistically steady state and as a consequence direct comparison of turbulence statistics of turbidity currents that have the same sediment load but differ in composition of their suspension can be made in this study we characterize the polydisperse suspension with a probability distribution of sediment size where different sediment sizes are parameterized in terms of their settling velocity v furthermore the probability distribution is the fractional volume γ v occupied by the different sediment sizes in suspension and satisfies 0 γ v d v 1 with this mathematical definition we show that the parametric grouping that captures the damping of turbulent kinetic energy to be r i τ v e cos θ where v e is the effective settling velocity of the polydisperse suspension furthermore we demonstrate that the parametric grouping r i τ v e cos θ provides an accurate measure of the collective effect of a polydisperse suspension on flow turbulence in particular we observe the turbulent velocity statistics within a mono bi or polydisperse turbidity current to be nearly the same as long as the total amount of sediment and r i τ v e cos θ are the same the differences in the sediment size distribution between the different polydisperse currents only play a secondary role as a consequence a polydisperse suspension can be efficiently modeled as an equivalent monodisperse suspension whose sediment settling velocity is set equal to the effective settling velocity v e of the polydisperse suspension it should be pointed out that an equivalent monodisperse suspension with a constant effective settling velocity over the entire domain will not accurately reproduce the mean sediment concentration or higher order sediment concentration statistics this is because the vertical variation of sediment concentration and its associated higher order statistics in a polydisperse system strongly depends on the local sediment size distribution so it appears that turbulent velocity statistics is most influenced by depth averaged global sediment size distribution and the net amount of sediment in suspension and not so much by the detailed distribution of sediment sizes in the vertical direction interestingly by considering an equivalent monodisperse suspension with a depth dependent effective settling velocity we observe that it is possible to approximate both the velocity and sediment concentration statistics of the corresponding polydisperse suspension the equivalence between polydisperse and monodisperse currents to be established below is specific to turbulent turbidity currents these observations and conclusions would be useful to build improved mathematical models of turbidity currents and better turbulence closures by quantifying the details of interaction of polydisperse suspensions and turbulence in terms of global parametric quantities total sediment load and effective settling velocity will facilitate better interpretation and comparison of different experiments and field observations the problem of interaction of stratified scalar fields like temperature or concentration of passive species like salinity and turbulence is related to the interaction of stratified polydisperse suspension and turbulence in a turbidity current the important distinguishing factor between the two problems is that the suspension in turbidity currents behaves as an active scalar which will not advect with the local fluid velocity there has been a lot of work in the former field where turbulence damping and eventual relaminarization under varying extent of stratification has been investigated armenio and sarkar 2002 taylor et al 2005 zonta 2013 zonta et al 2012 zonta and soldati 2013 similarly cantero et al 2012b and shringarpure et al 2012 investigated the dynamics of turbulence suppression due to sediment stratification in turbidity currents it remains to be further studied if dynamics of turbulence suppression and the equivalence between different suspensions can be extended to other polydisperse multiphase flows in section 2 we will describe briefly a general mathematical formulation of polydisperse sediment suspensions section 3 discusses the underlying assumptions for a turbidity current and resulting simplified governing equations to be solved in this study section 4 presents the results from 14 different simulations that range from monodisperse to polydisperse cases followed by a discussion of the results in section 5 simulation of equivalent monodisperse suspension with depth dependent settling velocity is considered finally in section 6 conclusions are drawn 2 problem formulation a fully resolved simulation of a turbidity current with billions of particles in suspension is impractical if not impossible typically for the flow regimes of interest the response time of the sediment particles is smaller than the kolmogorov time scale which suggests that an eulerian description of dispersed phase is well suited balachandar and eaton 2010 however there are other complications associated with the eulerian description the main difficultly is that the suspended particles are characterized by multiple independent attributes like shape size and material property which control their interaction with the surrounding continuous medium furthermore in real suspensions these attributes can take wide range of values and as a result such suspensions need to be described by a multi variate distribution function in this section we will consider as an example a bivariate distribution where the two independent attributes are the sediment size d and the sediment density measured in terms of sediment to water density ratio r ρ s ρ w ρ w here ρs is the density of the sediment and ρw is the density of the ambient water to study the spatial and temporal evolution of a suspension a population balance equation pbe ramkrishna 2000 is typically solved the pbe evolves the distribution function in space and time based on prescribed interactions like particle aggregation and breakage here we consider the body of a turbidity current modeled as sediment laden inclined periodic open channel flow cantero et al 2009a see tcr model in fig 1 shows a schematic of the model geometry as in turbidity currents the flow in the proposed model is driven by the excess density imposed by the polydisperse suspension of sediment we assume that the suspension is dilute and as a consequence the flow rheology is taken to be newtonian and particle collisions are unimportant this also allows the use of boussinesq approximation the distribution representing the sediment suspension is the bivariate volumetric concentration c x t d r therefore the effect of polydisperse suspension leads to a mixture density 1 ρ m i x x t ρ w 1 r d r c x t d r d d d r the governing equations for this flow are 2 u

simplify notation in the above indices i 1 3 and j 1 3 represent the three co ordinate directions x y z note that we use 1 2 3 and x y z interchangeably here 4 is the pbe marchisio and fox 2005 ramkrishna 2000 ui is the fluid velocity p is the pressure ν is the kinematic viscosity gi the ith component of gravity d i j is the diffusivity tensor of sediment particles and s c is a source term accounting for accounting for coalescence flocculation and breakage of sediment particles it is typically an empirical closure that approximated the microscale physics of the polydisperse suspension in 4 vi d r is the velocity of the sediment particles conditioned on the properties d and r also the sediment volume fraction is small which means that fluid velocity can be considered to be solenoidal cantero et al 2008a ferry and balachandar 2001 for the fluid velocity a no slip boundary condition is enforced on the bottom boundary and a free slip is enforced for the top boundary for sediment concentration zero net concentration flux conditions are enforced at both boundaries mathematically it can be written as 5 v z d r c d i z c z periodic boundary conditions are enforced in the streamwise and spanwise directions for all variables 2 1 stationary state mean flow equations mean flow equations averaged over turbulence can be obtained by substituting reynolds decomposition u i u

directions and statistical stationarity the ensemble average can be represented by an average over time and over the streamwise x and spanwise y directions the ensemble averaged quantities are then only functions of the bed normal z direction the mean z momentum equation reduces to 6 0 d w w d z 1 ρ w d p d z g z r d r c z d r d d d r integrating this equation in z gives the mean pressure distribution 7 p x z ρ w w w ρ w g z 0 z r d c z d r d d d r d z p x p is the streamwise pressure function which turns out to be zero as the flow is driven purely by the excess density due to

constraint 14 r d γ d r d d d r 1 3 simplified multigroup formulation for turbidity currents the mathematical formulation presented in the previous section is a general framework applicable for a broad class of polydisperse flows for the modeling of the body of a turbidity current several simplifications can be made 1 sediment particles are assumed to have the same density thus reducing the distribution to a monovariate form furthermore we assume that there is no shape effects so that sediment size d has a one to one correspondence with the sediment settling velocity v the formula by dietrich garcia 2008 can be used to relate settling velocity with sediment size 15 v d g r d exp b 1 b 2 ln r e p b 3 ln r e p 2 b 4 ln r e p 3 b 5 ln r e p 4 where 16 r e p g r d d ν and b 1 2 891394 b 2 0 95296 b 3 0 056835 b 4 0 002892 b 5 0 000245 therefore we can switch to sediment settling velocity v as the internal co ordinate of the distribution function c x t v 2 particle coalescence flocculation and breakage are unimportant which means the source term s c 0 3 for this work we assume that the turbidity current in auto suspension mode meaning that there is zero net flux of sediments between the flow and the bed since deposition is exactly balanced by resuspension the total amount of sediment within the computational domain is conserved yielding 17 t v v c d v d v 0 where v is the volume of the current 4 d i j is the diffusivity tensor of the sediment based on its characteristic length scale d however it must be emphasized that the source of this diffusivity is not brownian motion which is negligible for the o 100 μm finite size sediment particles under consideration the diffusion process is due to fluctuations in number density of the sediment particles which leads to long range hydrodynamic interactions mediated by the carrier fluid mucha and brenner 2003 segre et al 2001 to simplify the analysis we will assume that the diffusion coefficient is isotropic i e d i j d δ i j i 1 3 j 1 3 and independent of sediment size 5 solution of the population balance eq 33 can be quite expensive some of the methods for solving pbes are monte carlo methods quadrature method of moments qmom direct quadrature method of moments dqmom marchisio and fox 2005 ramkrishna and singh 2014 here we simplify the problem by discretizing the continuous spectrum of sediment size into finite number of size bins thus we define 18 c m v m 1 2 v m 1 2 c d v to be the volumetric concentration in the mth bin of sediment particles whose settling velocity varies around vm thus the distribution function is approximated as c x t v m 1 n c m x t v m substituting this in the pbe equation along with the above assumptions results in a scalar transport equation for each discrete sediment size 6 an equilibrium eulerian approximation cantero et al 2008a ferry and balachandar 2001 can be employed for the conditioned advection velocity vi d in 4 such that 19 v i d u i v m i i 1 3 where ui is the fluid velocity vmi is the ith component of the settling velocity of the mth sediment bin which can be expressed in terms of the still fluid settling velocity vm as v m x v m y v m z v m sin θ 0 cos θ where θ is the angle of the bed with the horizontal direction with these simplifications the dimensional equations for the multigroup model with n discrete sediment sizes

concentration of sediment is c t m 1 n c m the boundary conditions for the governing equations 20 22 are periodicity along the x and y directions for all variables and for the z direction 25 u i 0 at z 0 26 u z 0 v z 0 and w 0 at z h 27 v m c m cos θ d c m z at z 0 and h the error associated with the multigroup approximation can be quantified by comparing the moments of actual and discrete representation of the sediment size distribution function we would like to choose the discrete sediment sizes to be such that the first few moments of the continuous sediment distribution are exactly matched note that the objective here is to match the global moments i e moments computed from global quantities defined over the entire spatial domain it can be easily shown that with n discrete sediment sizes one can approximate 2 n 1 moments exactly ramkrishna 2000 for our study the moment matching relations between the continuous and discrete distributions can be written as shown below 28 v e 0 v γ v d v m 1 n v m γ m 29 m 2 0 v 2 γ v d v m 1 n v m 2 γ m in the above ve is the first moment of the fractional volume distribution of the polydisperse suspension and represents an effective

γ m 1 the matching of the zeroth moment is replaced by matching the values of c v for both the continuous and multigroup problems 3 1 dimensionless multigroup equations and numerical model we employ the channel height h as the length scale friction velocity u as the velocity scale the total volumetric concentration c v as the concentration scale and t s h u as the time scale these choices lead to

bulk richardson number based on friction velocity which reduces to 1 tan θ for the choice of scaling variables and sc is the schmidt number the multigroup model eqs 31 33 are solved employing a dealiased pseduospectral code canuto et al 1988 for all the flow variables fourier expansions are employed in the horizontal directions tangential to the bed x and y directions and a chebyshev expansion is used in the bed normal direction z a time split method is used to solve the momentum equation and the incompressibility condition a low storage mixed third order runge kutta and crank nicolson scheme is used for temporal discretization of advection and diffusion terms this scheme is carried out in three stages with pressure correction at the end of each stage details on implementation of this scheme can be found in the work by cortese and balachandar 1995 the domain size is l x l y l z 4 π h 4 π h 3 1 and grid resolution is n x n y n z 96 96 97 4 results and discussion the list of simulations performed in this study are given in table 1 in all the simulations r e τ 180 r i τ 11 43 s c 1 are held fixed while the composition of sediment suspension is changed r i τ 11 43 corresponds to a slope of 5 which is a typical inclination of the ocean floor in the continental slope region pinet 2006 real turbidity currents have much higher reτ o 105 which are inaccessible for direct numerical simulations dns although our simulations are at lower reτ they exhibit mature turbulence and the results are of relevance to real turbidity currents cantero et al 2012a 2012b to study the effect of sediment size distribution on turbulence statistics in a systematic way we use moments of the polydisperse suspension to compare different suspensions here we have grouped all suspensions into set a and set b in both sets the total sediment load c v is the same this is a consequence of reτ being fixed at 180 see 10 and 34 but the first moment of the total sediment volumetric concentration v e see 28 is different v e is fixed at 0 01 and 0 02 for all cases in set a and set b respectively keeping v e fixed within each set assures that the total damping of turbulent kinetic energy by suspended sediments is held constant to see this clearly we can write the turbulent kinetic energy tke equation as 35 p ϵ t 1 r e τ d 2 k d z 2 s where 36 k 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 p u w d u d z ϵ 1 r e τ u i x j u i x j 37 t d d z w u 2 v 2 w 2 2 p s m 1 n u c m r i τ m 1 n w c m in the above k is tke p is tke production ϵ is tke dissipation t is tke transport due to fluctuations in velocity and pressure the last term on the left hand side of the equation is viscous transport of tke and s is tke damping due to suspended sediment s can also be interpreted as the rate of tke energy spent by the flow on suspended sediments we can integrate 35 in the bed normal direction to get the total tke budget as 38 p e 1 r e τ d k d z 0 1 1 s c m 1 n c m 0 1 β r i τ v e cos θ in the above 39 p 0 1 p d z e 0 1 ϵ d z and β m 1 n 0 1 u c m d z refer to appendix a for the derivation the two terms on the right hand side of 38 are the sediment induced damping terms previous dns of turbidity currents driven by monodisperse shringarpure et al 2012 and bidisperse suspension shringarpure et al 2014 indicate that β is proportional to the parametric grouping s w v r i τ v e cos θ where s w v is a measure of total resuspension work rate therefore the total tke damping by suspended sediments is then 1 α s w v where α β s w v this clearly shows that the overall tke damping is proportional to the effective settling velocity of a polydisperse suspension for a monodisperse suspension the parameter reduces to s w v r i τ v cos θ which is the same as that considered in cantero et al 2012b and shringarpure et al 2012 although this analysis shows that the total tke damping may depend only on s w v we can anticipate the detailed turbulence statistics to additionally depend on the vertical distribution of sediments of different sizes the simulations performed in this study explores this aspect in detail to address to what extent s w v is able to predict the collective effect of a polydisperse suspension on turbulence in both sets of simulations listed in table 1 case 1 is the monodisperse suspension case 1a with v 0 01 and case 1b with v 0 02 in each set we will refer to the monodisperse case case 1 as the reference and compare other cases against it cases 2 to 5 are bidisperse suspensions case 6 in both the sets corresponds to a suspension made up of three sediment sizes while case 7 corresponds to a suspension made up of four sediment sizes in case 7 the settling velocity of the largest sediment particles is about 8 times larger than the monodisperse case in all the multi sized suspensions the settling velocity of the largest sediment size is about 30 to 80 times the smallest sediment size refer to table 1 for complete details the maximum sediment size or the settling velocity can be chosen to be arbitrarily high however such choices would be incompatible on two fronts first sediment particles can be held in suspension only if their settling velocity is less than the rms vertical velocity fluctuations in the flow middleton 1976 recent work salinas et al 2017 shows that sediment particles whose v 0 1 typically get sequestered very close to the bottom of the current second the assumption that the turbidity current is in the auto suspension mode places an implicit restriction on the sediment size and choosing a large sediment size will violate this assumption in other words these sediments should be sufficiently small so that there is no net flux to the bed but they should be sufficiently large to stratify in the bed normal direction such sediment sizes are classified as coarse wash load garcia 2008 although the different cases in sets a and b have the same total volumetric concentration of sediment and same effective settling velocity their higher order moments are quite different to highlight this difference table 1 lists the second moment m 2 for all the cases all the simulations are initialized with uniform distribution of constituent sediment sizes and after an initial transient phase turbulence statistics associated with the stationary state are accumulated various turbulence statistics like the mean sediment concentration mean streamwise velocity rms velocity profiles reynolds stress reynolds flux and tke production dissipation and damping are gathered and compared 4 1 mean streamwise velocity and sediment concentration figs 2 a and 3 a show the mean streamwise velocity profiles for all cases in set a and set b respectively the profiles nearly fall on top of each other and on the reference profile of the monodisperse case 1 the extent of deviation of the velocity profiles of cases 2 to 7 from that of case 1 is quantified by the l2 norm of the difference and presented in tables 2 and 3 note that these l2 norms are normalized by the reference case 1 and computed as follows 40 2 0 1 r e f 2 d z 0 1 r e f 2 d z the l2 difference of mean streamwise velocity for the different cases is observed to be o 10 5 figs 2b and 3b show vertical variation of mean total sediment concentration c t for all the cases in set a and set b the mean total sediment concentration is the local excess density or the driving force imposed by suspended sediments unlike the mean streamwise velocity profiles the mean total concentration profiles do not completely collapse onto the reference profile of case 1 substantial differences are seen near the top and bottom boundaries away from the boundaries the concentration gradients are similar but the profiles are slightly shifted below the reference profile of case 1 a closer examination shows that these differences from the reference case increases with the increasing value of the second moment m 2 see table 1 for the reference case m 2 1 and with increasing m 2 we observe a slight but noticeable reduction in the mean total sediment concentration in the interior of the domain such deviations are to be expected when a polydisperse suspension is compared with an equivalent monodisperse suspension it is straightforward to see that some of the sediment sizes of the polydisperse suspension will settle faster than the effective settling velocity while some other sizes will settle slower and as a result there will be increased accumulation of finer sediments near the top and coarser sediments towards the bottom with a net reduction in concentration in the middle for a polydisperse case a simple measure of this spread in settling velocity can be written as 41 0 1 v v v e 2 c d v d z m 2 v e 2 and thus explaining the observed dependence on m 2 the interesting feature of this result is that even though the vertical distribution of local driving force represented by the mean total sediment concentration varies somewhat between the different cases the mean streamwise velocity which is the mean response to the driving force tends to collapse on to the reference profile this insensitivity to the vertical distribution of the driving force is only when the flow is turbulent in section 4 3 we will look at the laminar solution of the governing equations and highlight key difference caused by the existence of turbulence the l2 norm of the difference in the total concentration profiles of the different cases are given in tables 2 and 3 as expected the l2 norm of the differences although still small are 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for streamwise velocity profiles the total sediment settling flux is defined as the sum of the sediment fluxes of the n different sediment sizes i e m 1 n v m z c m and its vertical variation for all cases in set a and set b is shown in fig 4 unlike the mean velocity profiles noticeable differences between the different cases within a set can be observed mathematically the sediment settling flux is the first moment of local distribution of polydisperse sediment suspension in the flow when averaged over the vertical direction yields 42 0 1 m 1 n v m z c m d z m 1 n v m z γ m v e it can be seen from the figures that in all the cases the depth averaged sediment settling flux is equal to 0 01 and 0 02 in sets a and b respectively again a systematic increasing departure from the reference case with increasing second moment m 2 can also be observed therefore these profiles demonstrate that even though the effective settling velocity v e matches for all the cases the local behavior as a function of z can be quite different in turbidity currents sediment particles are held in suspension through a balance between the downward settling flux and an upward turbulent flux and this balance is established for everysediment group adding over all the sediment groups the netbalance at a given vertical location within the channel can bewritten as 43 m 1 n v m z c m w m 1 n c m 0 note that this relation is valid for a statistically stationary state and away from the top and bottom boundaries where the diffusive flux is negligible since we observed that the settling flux profiles differ greatly we expect that the reynolds flux profiles will also show noticeable differences between the different cases similar differences can be expected in other higher order statistics as well which will be explored below 4 2 higher order turbulence statistics here we will present the results for set a only as all the observations and associated conclusions from the results of set a extend to set b refer to appendix c for all the corresponding figures showing statistics obtained from cases in set b fig 5 show u r m s v r m s and w r m s profiles for all the cases in set a profiles of all three quantities for all the cases collapse onto the reference profile of case 1 the l2 norm of the difference in the rms profiles for different cases are listed in table 2 like the mean streamwise velocity profiles the l2 norm of the difference is quite low at o 10 4 of the reference monodisperse case fig 6 show the reynolds stress u w and reynolds flux m 1 n w c m profiles for all cases in set a while good collapse is observed for reynolds stress reynolds flux profiles differ substantially which is in agreement with the behavior observed in fig 4 profiles of tke production and dissipation for the different cases show a good collapse onto the corresponding reference profile of case 1 see fig 7 it is expected that tke damping due to sediment suspension will depend on sediment size distribution as it is a function of reynolds flux w c t which was shown to have substantial dependence from the figures it is clear that the turbulence statistics which are not associated with sediment concentration of all cases collapse onto a unique profile suggesting that the statistics are nearly independent of the sediment size distribution in other words the zeroth and first moments of fractional sediment volume distribution are the most important factors that control the turbulent velocity field as a consequence it is possible to approximate a complicated polydisperse suspension by a monodisperse suspension whose sediment size has a settling velocity of v e however it is important to emphasize that this simplification has the important limitation that the flow statistics associated with sediment concentration will not be captured appropriately by the monodisperse suspension we will address this in section 5 4 3 laminar solution is the equivalence between polydisperse suspensions and its equivalent monodisperse suspension inherently embedded in mathematical model will this equivalence manifest across the range of reτ here we demonstrate that the approximate equivalence is restricted to only turbulent flow conditions in other words such indifference of the velocity statistics to details of the driving potential requires strong turbulent mixing in the vertical direction it can be shown that the observed equivalence breaks down when we consider laminar solution of the governing equation given in 31 33 the laminar solution for velocity and sediment concentration are given below for derivation see appendix b 44 c m a m exp r e τ s c v m z z 45 u r e τ m 1 n a m r e τ s c v m z exp r e

also fig 8b show the total sediment concentration obtained from the laminar solution for each constituent sediment size present in the suspension of all the cases in set a comparing this figure with fig 2 for the turbulent simulations we can clearly see that the collapse of streamwise velocity is now absent and the deviation of total sediment concentration is much more pronounced in case of laminar solution the deviation from the laminar solution of the equivalent monodisperse suspension is computed as the l2 norm of the difference for cases 2 to 7 for each case in set a the l2 norm of the difference for the laminar solution is approximately 2 orders of magnitude larger than those of the corresponding turbulent flow these results are tabulated in table 4 this establishes that the laminar solution does not allow the same simplification of a polydisperse suspension observed in turbulent flows note that laminar velocity and total sediment concentration profiles of cases in set b are qualitatively similar to those of set a and all the above observations and conclusions presented here consistently extend to set b appendix c shows all the corresponding figures for set b 5 depth dependent effective settling velocity the moments of continuous and discrete sediment distributions defined in eqs 28 and 29 are global quantities as they are based on depth averaged fractional volumes γm equivalently we can define depth dependent moments of the local sediment distribution as 47 m 0 l z m 1 n c m 48 m 1 l z m 1 n v m z c m from the above definition we obtain the zeroth moment to be the same as the normalized total sediment concentration c t z in all the simulations initially all constituent sediment sizes are uniformly distributed in the vertical direction with superimposed random perturbation and consequently at t 0 we have m 0 l 1 and m 1 l v e which are the same as the global zeroth and firstmoments once the simulations begin the sediment particles settledown at their respective settling velocities and turbulence tends to mix them vertically at the bottom boundary we enforce a resuspension flux through an effective diffusive process which ensures that total sediment load of each constituent sediment size is conserved the overall effect of this evolution is that the depth dependent moments which are based on local sediment concentration start deviating from the global moments and become a function of z each sediment size reaches its stationary state when its downward settling flux is balanced by the upward reynolds flux see 43 we can define the effective local settling velocity v e l z as 49 v e l z m 1 n v m c m m 1 n c m this definition of effective local settling velocity along with local mean sediment concentration ensures perfect balance of net local sediment flux fig 9 shows the profiles of effective local settling velocity v e l for all cases in sets a and b in cases 1a and 1b v e l is constant and is equal to 0 01 and 0 02 respectively however for all other cases v e l varies with height close to the bottom v e l is closer to the settling velocity of the largest sediment while near the top boundary v e l is closer to the settling velocity of the smallest sediment in the suspension this captures the physical reality of the turbidity currents i e in a turbidity current driven by polydisperse suspension we expect to find large sediments near the bottom of the flow while the smaller sediments will be more common near the top from the perspective of an improved mathematical model an ideal approximation of a polydisperse suspension with an equivalent monodisperse suspension is when the settling velocity of the monodisperse suspension varies with channel height as given by v e l for a mondisperse suspension such a depth dependent settling velocity has no direct physical meaning however it can serve as a mathematical model and an approximation for a more complex polydisperse system with such a mathematical formulation we want to examine if all turbulence statistics of the polydisperse suspension including those involving sediment concentration will be well captured by the monodisperse suspension 5 1 equivalent monodisperse suspension with depth dependent settling velocity in this section we will consider simulation of a monodisperse suspension with a depth dependent settling velocity that will be referred to as v m o n o z this depth dependent settling velocity will be chosen to match the effective local settling velocity of a chosen polydisperse case given in 49 note that the effective local settling velocity is known only through a direct numerical simulation of the polydisperse system since the z dependence of the mean concentration c m of the different sediment sizes is not known a priori they are known only through an ensemble average of the simulation results in the statistically stationary state only after the transient effects have fully decayed thus the simulations with equivalent monodisperse to be described below is not of practical value since it requires input from the polydisperse system that it will approximate our purpose is to see if a monodisperse system with an ideal depth dependent settling velocity can approximate a polydisperse current here it must be pointed out that there are rigorously derived computational methods such as qmom and dqmom marchisio and fox 2005 ramkrishna and singh 2014 proposed in the literature to solve the population balance equation the present approach of an equivalent monodisperse suspension with depth dependent settling velocity can be related to these approaches in the monodisperse simulation the depth dependent settling velocity of the sediment will be held the same over time the initial starting condition for the equivalent monodisperse suspension is a depth independent uniform sediment concentration which is the same as in all other simulations considered the initial transient evolution of the monodisperse system is not expected to mimic the corresponding transient state of the polydisperse system very well this discrepancy is due to the fact that the depth dependent settling velocity used in the monodisperse system approximates only the stationary state of the polydisperse system thus all comparisons between the equivalent monodisperse and polydisperse systems will be in the stationary regime given these assumptions we evaluate the effect of variable settling velocity on the governing equations and other important relations presented in the previous sections the momentum equation will be unaffected as it does not directly depend on the sediment settling velocity see 2 31 20 the coupling between the flow and the sediment suspension is through the body force term which only depends on the sediment concentration on the other hand sediment settling velocity directly controls the evolution of sediment concentration through the advection term in the concentration equation see 33 the tke equation will also be modified and the modified form is as shown below 50 p e 1 r e τ d k d z 0 1 1 s c c 0 1 β r i τ 0 1 v m o n o z c m o n o d z cos θ all the terms on the left hand side are the same as before see 39 while the damping term on the right hand side now accounts for the depth dependent settling velocity here we consider the polydisperse suspension case 7b with 4 constituent sediment sizes accordingly we have assumed the depth dependent settling velocity of the monodisperse suspension to be from the stationary state of case 7b i e v m o n o v e l 7 b we refer to this monodisperse simulation with depth dependent settling velocity as case 8 fig 10 shows the mean streamwise velocity and mean sediment concentration of cases 1b 7b and 8 the enforced local settling velocity in case 8 dictates the evolution of sediment within the channel and the concentration profiles of case 7b and 8 are almost on top of each other similarly we expect better agreement between various higher order statistics of cases 7b and 8 than with the constant settling velocity monodisperse suspension case 1 fig 11 shows profiles of reynolds stress and reynolds flux for cases 1b 7b and 8 also fig 12 shows the profiles of tke production dissipation and damping all these figures clearly show that the statistics of case 7b and case 8 are in very good agreement similarly we also present the rms velocity profiles of these three cases in fig 13 although profiles for all the three cases are quite close to each other the agreement between cases 7b and 8 is remarkable table 5 lists l2 norms of the difference in various turbulence statistics of case 7b from the monodisperse case 8 we will compare these norms with the l2 norms presented in table 3 which correspond to the difference between cases 7b and 1b clearly the l2 norms in table 5 are at least an order of magnitude smaller the most important differences are observed in statistics pertaining to sediment concentration here the l2 norms in table 5 are at least 2 orders of magnitudesmaller from the above discussion it is evident that the reason for such a good agreement between the monodisperse and polydisperse cases is the choice of sediment settling velocity specified inside the channel for the monodisperse case here the monodisperse settling velocity profile was extracted from the statistically stationary state of the polydisperse case however such information is not available a priori and one would not know the precise form of v e despite this apparent limitation the simulation performed in this study demonstrates that turbulent statistics in turbidity current are primarily driven by the zeroth and first moments of a sediment suspension which can be matched with a depth dependent monodisperse suspension in other words a turbidity current with polydisperse suspension can be modeled by an effective monodisperse suspension which has a locally matching zeroth and firstmoment 6 conclusions in this study we have presented a general mathematical formulation of turbidity currents driven by polydisperse sediment suspension a simplification of the general framework was described where the population balance equation reduces to a set of scalar transport equations for discrete sediment sizes thisformulation was employed to perform simulations of turbidity currents in auto suspension mode in all the simulations r e τ 180 s c 1 and r i τ 11 42 were held fixed and the composition ofsediment suspension driving the flow was changed simulations were categorized into two sets a and b such that in each set the amount of sediment in suspension and the volume weighted average sediment settling velocity were maintained the same in other words in all the simulation cases within each set the zeroth and first moment of the sediment suspension based on fractional volume occupied by the different sediment sizes was held fixed in each set case 1 corresponds to the monodisperse suspension while the other cases contain more than one sediment size we compare the turbulence statistics of the reference monodisperse case with the other polydisperse cases it was observed that turbulence statistics such as mean streamwise velocity rms velocities reynolds stress tke production and tke dissipation of case 1 monodisperse suspension adequately represent the corresponding statistics of the polydisperse cases in the set however statistics associated with sediment concentration such as mean sediment concentration reynolds flux and tke damping showed noticeable differences it was also shown that these discrepancies arise because the monodisperse suspension with a constant sediment settling velocity cannot capture the local settling flux of polydisperse suspensions to overcome this limitation we require a monodisperse suspension where the sediment settling velocity is allowed to vary in z such that it represents the effective size of the local polydisperse suspension we performed a simulation of monodisperse suspension of sediment where the z dependent sediment settling velocity was obtained from the effective settling velocity of case 7b in the statistically stationary state in other words the settling velocity was a function of height from the bottom of the channel and its value was such that it captured the effective local sediment size in the flow it is observed that with the depth dependent settling velocity even the turbulence statistics associated with sediment concentration matched very well with the corresponding polydisperse case 7b these results support the possibility that by matching the net sediment concentration and a depth dependent first moment of a polydisperse sediment suspension it is possible to predict its behavior with an equivalent monodisperse current acknowledgments we wish to thank the national science foundation for partnership for international research and education pire grant nsf

649,turbidity currents are buoyancy driven submarine flows where the source of buoyancy is typically a polydisperse sediment suspension sustained propagation of such flows depend on the ability of turbulence in the flow to keep the settling sediments in suspension recent studies by cantero et al 2012b and shringarpure et al 2012 have investigated the interaction of monodisperse sediment suspension and turbulence in turbidity currents on smooth sloping beds these studies showed that stable stratification of sediment suspension damps turbulence and in some cases can be fully suppress turbulence furthermore it was shown that the turbulence damping effect of a monodisperse sediment suspension can be quantified by the product of shear richardson number and the sediment settling velocity in this study we generalize this result for a polydisperse sediment suspension we compare the turbulence statistics of turbidity currents driven by different polydisperse suspensions and show that as long as the total amount of sediment and the product of shear richardson number and effective settling velocity a value representing the polydisperse suspension are the same the turbulent velocity statistics of the different polydisperse suspensions nearly collapse furthermore if the effective settling velocity is chosen to be depth dependent a function of height from the bed then the turbulence statistics involving sediment concentration also collapses between different polydisperse suspensions these results suggest the possibility of modeling polydisperse currents with an equivalent monodisperse suspension whose total sediment load and depth dependent settling velocity match those of the polydisperse suspension keywords turbidity currents polydisperse suspensions turbulence multiphase flows msc 00 01 99 00 1 introduction typically turbidity currents are characterized as highly turbulent flows driven by dilute concentration of suspended sediments allen 2001 kneller and buckee 2000 parsons et al 2009 these flows are extremely energetic krause et al 1970 prior et al 1987 travel long distances kneller and buckee 2000 and are an important sediment transport mechanism in the submarine world garcía 1992 parsons et al 2009 field scale turbidity currents are complex spatially and temporally evolving flows several factors like ambient conditions stratification salinity bed topography slope roughness and shape bed conditions particle size distribution cohesive effects compaction and description of the sediment suspension driving the flow particle size distribution total suspended load have varying influence on the flow a turbidity current can be divided into three regions head body and a tail allen 2001 simpson 1997 ungarish 2009 the head is the most energetic part characterized as highly turbulent with intense mixing cantero et al 2007a 2007b hartel et al 2000 necker et al 2005 patterson et al 2006 it can be extremely erosive and rework the bed cantero et al 2008b however from the perspective of a fixed point on the bed the head passes over it quickly and therefore its effect lasts only for a short duration the tail of a turbidity current is a weak and depositional flow kneller et al 1997 the body of a turbidity current is a region of transition from the highly turbulent head to a weak depositional tail it must be noted that the head and tail will always exist however the existence of a distinct body is determined by various factors like the bed conditions and sediment load at the time of flow inception nevertheless the body is considered to be the main manifestation of a turbidity current and a primary mechanism for sediment transport in the past several decades there has been an intensive effort to study various regions and aspects of turbidity currents these studies range from laboratory experiments bonnecaze et al 1995 1996 garcia and parker 1993 sequeiros et al 2010 to field observations talling et al 2007 xu et al 2004 great effort has also been devoted to numerical simulations of turbidity currents with emphasis on studying the flow dynamics cantero et al 2007a 2008a 2005 2007b das et al 2004 hartel et al 2000 imran et al 2004 turbulent structures cantero et al 2008b turbulence modulation cantero et al 2014 2009b and topographical effects of the sea bed cantero et al 2012a nasr azadani et al 2013 nasr azadani and meiburg 2014 theoretical analysis has given conditions for self accelerating and auto suspension turbidity currents bagnold 1962 fukushima et al 1985 pantin 1979 pantin and franklin 2009 parker et al 1986 and also proposed reduced or simplified box models for simulating and analyzing such flows see parker et al 1986 for shallow water equations and bonnecaze et al 1995 for box models experiments have been performed to validate some of these theoretical predictions sequeiros et al 2009 more recently cantero et al 2009a and shringarpure et al 2012 employed direct numerical simulations to study the dynamics of the flow in the body of turbidity currents in greater detail up to date the study of the dynamics of polydisperse turbidity currents has received limited attention recently nasr azadani et al 2013 and nasr azadani and meiburg 2014 investigated the effect of polydisperse lock exchange currents on bed topography by performing experiments and numerical simulations in turbidity currents the sediment suspension has two effects on the flow it drives the flow which generates turbulence due to the imposed excess density and the settling sediment particles preferentially segregates in the flow leading to a stable stratification of sediment concentration which damps turbulence the driving effect of suspended sediments is proportional to the total volumetric concentration of sediment on the other hand the damping effect on turbulence can be viewed as the total turbulent kinetic energy spent by the flow to keep the settling sediment particles in suspension cantero et al 2012b showed that the damping effect in a monodisperse turbidity current is controlled by the product of shear richardson number riτ and settling velocity of the sediment v c o s θ here v is the dimensionless settling velocity of a sediment particle in still fluid and θ is the bed angle with the horizontal direction this parametric grouping was extended to bi disperse suspensions shringarpure et al 2014 2015 where it takes the form r i τ γ 1 v 1 γ 2 v 2 cos θ here v i is the dimensionless settling velocity of the sediment size group i and γi is the fractional volume of this sediment group note that by definition γ 1 γ 2 1 in this study we focus on the underlying interaction ofa polydisperse suspension and turbulence in planar turbidity currents in particular we focus on turbidity currents through submarine canyons on the continental slopes in this scenario the flow is assumed to be planar and confined inside the canyon furthermore the submarine canyon is assumed to be straight with a constant width we further simplify some of the complex physics like resuspension bed load transport and couplingwith the bed topography by considering the turbidity currentto be in auto suspension mode bagnold 1962 sequeiros et al 2009 propagating on an inclined flat bed we restrict ourattention to the body of the current and examine the effect of polydispersity on flow turbulence under these assumptions the total sediment load is conserved and the flow will reach a statistically steady state and as a consequence direct comparison of turbulence statistics of turbidity currents that have the same sediment load but differ in composition of their suspension can be made in this study we characterize the polydisperse suspension with a probability distribution of sediment size where different sediment sizes are parameterized in terms of their settling velocity v furthermore the probability distribution is the fractional volume γ v occupied by the different sediment sizes in suspension and satisfies 0 γ v d v 1 with this mathematical definition we show that the parametric grouping that captures the damping of turbulent kinetic energy to be r i τ v e cos θ where v e is the effective settling velocity of the polydisperse suspension furthermore we demonstrate that the parametric grouping r i τ v e cos θ provides an accurate measure of the collective effect of a polydisperse suspension on flow turbulence in particular we observe the turbulent velocity statistics within a mono bi or polydisperse turbidity current to be nearly the same as long as the total amount of sediment and r i τ v e cos θ are the same the differences in the sediment size distribution between the different polydisperse currents only play a secondary role as a consequence a polydisperse suspension can be efficiently modeled as an equivalent monodisperse suspension whose sediment settling velocity is set equal to the effective settling velocity v e of the polydisperse suspension it should be pointed out that an equivalent monodisperse suspension with a constant effective settling velocity over the entire domain will not accurately reproduce the mean sediment concentration or higher order sediment concentration statistics this is because the vertical variation of sediment concentration and its associated higher order statistics in a polydisperse system strongly depends on the local sediment size distribution so it appears that turbulent velocity statistics is most influenced by depth averaged global sediment size distribution and the net amount of sediment in suspension and not so much by the detailed distribution of sediment sizes in the vertical direction interestingly by considering an equivalent monodisperse suspension with a depth dependent effective settling velocity we observe that it is possible to approximate both the velocity and sediment concentration statistics of the corresponding polydisperse suspension the equivalence between polydisperse and monodisperse currents to be established below is specific to turbulent turbidity currents these observations and conclusions would be useful to build improved mathematical models of turbidity currents and better turbulence closures by quantifying the details of interaction of polydisperse suspensions and turbulence in terms of global parametric quantities total sediment load and effective settling velocity will facilitate better interpretation and comparison of different experiments and field observations the problem of interaction of stratified scalar fields like temperature or concentration of passive species like salinity and turbulence is related to the interaction of stratified polydisperse suspension and turbulence in a turbidity current the important distinguishing factor between the two problems is that the suspension in turbidity currents behaves as an active scalar which will not advect with the local fluid velocity there has been a lot of work in the former field where turbulence damping and eventual relaminarization under varying extent of stratification has been investigated armenio and sarkar 2002 taylor et al 2005 zonta 2013 zonta et al 2012 zonta and soldati 2013 similarly cantero et al 2012b and shringarpure et al 2012 investigated the dynamics of turbulence suppression due to sediment stratification in turbidity currents it remains to be further studied if dynamics of turbulence suppression and the equivalence between different suspensions can be extended to other polydisperse multiphase flows in section 2 we will describe briefly a general mathematical formulation of polydisperse sediment suspensions section 3 discusses the underlying assumptions for a turbidity current and resulting simplified governing equations to be solved in this study section 4 presents the results from 14 different simulations that range from monodisperse to polydisperse cases followed by a discussion of the results in section 5 simulation of equivalent monodisperse suspension with depth dependent settling velocity is considered finally in section 6 conclusions are drawn 2 problem formulation a fully resolved simulation of a turbidity current with billions of particles in suspension is impractical if not impossible typically for the flow regimes of interest the response time of the sediment particles is smaller than the kolmogorov time scale which suggests that an eulerian description of dispersed phase is well suited balachandar and eaton 2010 however there are other complications associated with the eulerian description the main difficultly is that the suspended particles are characterized by multiple independent attributes like shape size and material property which control their interaction with the surrounding continuous medium furthermore in real suspensions these attributes can take wide range of values and as a result such suspensions need to be described by a multi variate distribution function in this section we will consider as an example a bivariate distribution where the two independent attributes are the sediment size d and the sediment density measured in terms of sediment to water density ratio r ρ s ρ w ρ w here ρs is the density of the sediment and ρw is the density of the ambient water to study the spatial and temporal evolution of a suspension a population balance equation pbe ramkrishna 2000 is typically solved the pbe evolves the distribution function in space and time based on prescribed interactions like particle aggregation and breakage here we consider the body of a turbidity current modeled as sediment laden inclined periodic open channel flow cantero et al 2009a see tcr model in fig 1 shows a schematic of the model geometry as in turbidity currents the flow in the proposed model is driven by the excess density imposed by the polydisperse suspension of sediment we assume that the suspension is dilute and as a consequence the flow rheology is taken to be newtonian and particle collisions are unimportant this also allows the use of boussinesq approximation the distribution representing the sediment suspension is the bivariate volumetric concentration c x t d r therefore the effect of polydisperse suspension leads to a mixture density 1 ρ m i x x t ρ w 1 r d r c x t d r d d d r the governing equations for this flow are 2 u

ramkrishna 2000 ui is the fluid velocity p is the pressure ν is the kinematic viscosity gi the ith component of gravity d i j is the diffusivity tensor of sediment particles and s c is a source term accounting for accounting for coalescence flocculation and breakage of sediment particles it is typically an empirical closure that approximated the microscale physics of the polydisperse suspension in 4 vi d r is the velocity of the sediment particles conditioned on the properties d and r also the sediment volume fraction is small which means that fluid velocity can be considered to be solenoidal cantero et al 2008a ferry and balachandar 2001 for the fluid velocity a no slip boundary condition is enforced on the bottom boundary and a free slip is enforced for the top boundary for sediment concentration zero net concentration flux conditions are enforced at both boundaries mathematically it can be written as 5 v z d r c d i z c z periodic boundary conditions are enforced in the streamwise and spanwise directions for all variables 2 1 stationary state mean flow equations mean flow equations averaged over turbulence can be obtained by substituting reynolds decomposition u i u i u i and c x t d r c z d r c x t d r in 2 4 here means an ensemble average and is the corresponding fluctuation note that because of the periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise and spanwise directions and statistical stationarity the ensemble average can be represented by an average over time and over the streamwise x and spanwise y directions the ensemble averaged quantities are then only functions of the bed normal z direction the mean z momentum equation reduces to 6 0 d w w d z 1 ρ w d p d z g z r d r c z d r d d d r integrating this equation in z gives the mean pressure distribution 7 p x z ρ w w w ρ w g z 0 z r d c z d r d d d r d z p x p is the streamwise pressure function which turns out to be zero as the flow is driven purely by the excess density due to suspended sediments the mean x momentum equation is 8 0 d u w d z ν d 2 u d z 2 g x r d r c z d r d d d r we can integrate the above equation in the z direction from the bottom z b 0 to the top z t h boundary to obtain 9 ν d u d z z b g x 0 h r d r c z d r d d d r d z where a free slip boundary condition has been enforced on the top wall the friction velocity u is defined as 10 u 2 ν d u d z z b g

constraint 14 r d γ d r d d d r 1 3 simplified multigroup formulation for turbidity currents the mathematical formulation presented in the previous section is a general framework applicable for a broad class of polydisperse flows for the modeling of the body of a turbidity current several simplifications can be made 1 sediment particles are assumed to have the same density thus reducing the distribution to a monovariate form furthermore we assume that there is no shape effects so that sediment size d has a one to one correspondence with the sediment settling velocity v the formula by dietrich garcia 2008 can be used to relate settling velocity with sediment size 15 v d g r d exp b 1 b 2 ln r e p b 3 ln r e p 2 b 4 ln r e p 3 b 5 ln r e p 4 where 16 r e p g r d d ν and b 1 2 891394 b 2 0 95296 b 3 0 056835 b 4 0 002892 b 5 0 000245 therefore we can switch to sediment settling velocity v as the internal co ordinate of the distribution function c x t v 2 particle coalescence flocculation and breakage are unimportant which means the source term s c 0 3 for this work we assume that the turbidity current in auto suspension mode meaning that there is zero net flux of sediments between the flow and the bed since deposition is exactly balanced by resuspension the total amount of sediment within the computational domain is conserved yielding 17 t v v c d v d v 0 where v is the volume of the current 4 d i j is the diffusivity tensor of the sediment based on its characteristic length scale d however it must be emphasized that the source of this diffusivity is not brownian motion which is negligible for the o 100 μm finite size sediment particles under consideration the diffusion process is due to fluctuations in number density of the sediment particles which leads to long range hydrodynamic interactions mediated by the carrier fluid mucha and brenner 2003 segre et al 2001 to simplify the analysis we will assume that the diffusion coefficient is isotropic i e d i j d δ i j i 1 3 j 1 3 and independent of sediment size 5 solution of the population balance eq 33 can be quite expensive some of the methods for solving pbes are monte carlo methods quadrature method of moments qmom direct quadrature method of moments dqmom marchisio and fox 2005 ramkrishna and singh 2014 here we simplify the problem by discretizing the continuous spectrum of sediment size into finite number of size bins thus we define 18 c m v m 1 2 v m 1 2 c d v to be the volumetric concentration in the mth bin of sediment particles whose settling velocity varies around vm thus the distribution function is approximated as c x t v m 1 n c m x t v m substituting this in the pbe equation along with the above assumptions results in a scalar transport equation for each discrete sediment size 6 an equilibrium eulerian approximation cantero et al 2008a ferry and balachandar 2001 can be employed for the conditioned advection velocity vi d in 4 such that 19 v i d u i v m i i 1 3 where ui is the fluid velocity vmi is the ith component of the settling velocity of the mth sediment bin which can be expressed in terms of the still fluid settling velocity vm as v m x v m y v m z v m sin θ 0 cos θ where θ is the angle of the bed with the horizontal direction with these simplifications the dimensional equations for the multigroup model with n discrete sediment sizes

representation of the sediment size distribution function we would like to choose the discrete sediment sizes to be such that the first few moments of the continuous sediment distribution are exactly matched note that the objective here is to match the global moments i e moments computed from global quantities defined over the entire spatial domain it can be easily shown that with n discrete sediment sizes one can approximate 2 n 1 moments exactly ramkrishna 2000 for our study the moment matching relations between the continuous and discrete distributions can be written as shown below 28

γ m 1 the matching of the zeroth moment is replaced by matching the values of c v for both the continuous and multigroup problems 3 1 dimensionless multigroup equations and numerical model we employ the channel height h as the length scale friction velocity u as the velocity scale the total volumetric concentration c v as the concentration scale and t s h u as the time scale these choices lead to

dealiased pseduospectral code canuto et al 1988 for all the flow variables fourier expansions are employed in the horizontal directions tangential to the bed x and y directions and a chebyshev expansion is used in the bed normal direction z a time split method is used to solve the momentum equation and the incompressibility condition a low storage mixed third order runge kutta and crank nicolson scheme is used for temporal discretization of advection and diffusion terms this scheme is carried out in three stages with pressure correction at the end of each stage details on implementation of this scheme can be found in the work by cortese and balachandar 1995 the domain size is l x l y l z 4 π h 4 π h 3 1 and grid resolution is n x n y n z 96 96 97 4 results and discussion the list of simulations performed in this study are given in table 1 in all the simulations r e τ 180 r i τ 11 43 s c 1 are held fixed while the composition of sediment suspension is changed r i τ 11 43 corresponds to a slope of 5 which is a typical inclination of the ocean floor in the continental slope region pinet 2006 real turbidity currents have much higher reτ o 105 which are inaccessible for direct numerical simulations dns although our simulations are at lower reτ they exhibit mature turbulence and the results are of relevance to real turbidity currents cantero et al 2012a 2012b to study the effect of sediment size distribution on turbulence statistics in a systematic way we use moments of the polydisperse suspension to compare different suspensions here we have grouped all suspensions into set a and set b in both sets the total sediment load c v is the same this is a consequence of reτ being fixed at 180 see 10 and 34 but the first moment of the total sediment volumetric concentration v e see 28 is different v e is fixed at 0 01 and 0 02 for all cases in set a and set b respectively keeping v e fixed within each set assures that the total damping of turbulent kinetic energy by suspended sediments is held constant to see this clearly we can write the turbulent kinetic energy tke equation as 35 p ϵ t 1 r e τ d 2 k d z 2 s where 36 k 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 p u w d u d z ϵ 1 r e τ u i x j u i x j 37 t d d z w u 2 v 2 w 2 2 p s m 1 n u c m r i τ m 1 n w c m in the above k is tke p is tke production ϵ is tke dissipation t is tke transport due to fluctuations in velocity and pressure the last term on the left hand side of the equation is viscous transport of tke and s is tke damping due to suspended sediment s can also be interpreted as the rate of tke energy spent by the flow on suspended sediments we can integrate 35 in the bed normal direction to get the total tke budget as 38 p e 1 r e τ d k d z 0 1 1 s c m 1 n c m 0 1 β r i τ v e cos θ in the above 39 p 0 1 p d z e 0 1 ϵ d z and β m 1 n 0 1 u c m d z refer to appendix a for the derivation the two terms on the right hand side of 38 are the sediment induced damping terms previous dns of turbidity currents driven by monodisperse shringarpure et al 2012 and bidisperse suspension shringarpure et al 2014 indicate that β is proportional to the parametric grouping s w v r i τ v e cos θ where s w v is a measure of total resuspension work rate therefore the total tke damping by suspended sediments is then 1 α s w v where α β s w v this clearly shows that the overall tke damping is proportional to the effective settling velocity of a polydisperse suspension for a monodisperse suspension the parameter reduces to s w v r i τ v cos θ which is the same as that considered in cantero et al 2012b and shringarpure et al 2012 although this analysis shows that the total tke damping may depend only on s w v we can anticipate the detailed turbulence statistics to additionally depend on the vertical distribution of sediments of different sizes the simulations performed in this study explores this aspect in detail to address to what extent s w v is able to predict the collective effect of a polydisperse suspension on turbulence in both sets of simulations listed in table 1 case 1 is the monodisperse suspension case 1a with v 0 01 and case 1b with v 0 02 in each set we will refer to the monodisperse case case 1 as the reference and compare other cases against it cases 2 to 5 are bidisperse suspensions case 6 in both the sets corresponds to a suspension made up of three sediment sizes while case 7 corresponds to a suspension made up of four sediment sizes in case 7 the settling velocity of the largest sediment particles is about 8 times larger than the monodisperse case in all the multi sized suspensions the settling velocity of the largest sediment size is about 30 to 80 times the smallest sediment size refer to table 1 for complete details the maximum sediment size or the settling velocity can be chosen to be arbitrarily high however such choices would be incompatible on two fronts first sediment particles can be held in suspension only if their settling velocity is less than the rms vertical velocity fluctuations in the flow middleton 1976 recent work salinas et al 2017 shows that sediment particles whose v 0 1 typically get sequestered very close to the bottom of the current second the assumption that the turbidity current is in the auto suspension mode places an implicit restriction on the sediment size and choosing a large sediment size will violate this assumption in other words these sediments should be sufficiently small so that there is no net flux to the bed but they should be sufficiently large to stratify in the bed normal direction such sediment sizes are classified as coarse wash load garcia 2008 although the different cases in sets a and b have the same total volumetric concentration of sediment and same effective settling velocity their higher order moments are quite different to highlight this difference table 1 lists the second moment m 2 for all the cases all the simulations are initialized with uniform distribution of constituent sediment sizes and after an initial transient phase turbulence statistics associated with the stationary state are accumulated various turbulence statistics like the mean sediment concentration mean streamwise velocity rms velocity profiles reynolds stress reynolds flux and tke production dissipation and damping are gathered and compared 4 1 mean streamwise velocity and sediment concentration figs 2 a and 3 a show the mean streamwise velocity profiles for all cases in set a and set b respectively the profiles nearly fall on top of each other and on the reference profile of the monodisperse case 1 the extent of deviation of the velocity profiles of cases 2 to 7 from that of case 1 is quantified by the l2 norm of the difference and presented in tables 2 and 3 note that these l2 norms are normalized by the reference case 1 and computed as follows 40 2 0 1 r e f 2 d z 0 1 r e f 2 d z the l2 difference of mean streamwise velocity for the different cases is observed to be o 10 5 figs 2b and 3b show vertical variation of mean total sediment concentration c t for all the cases in set a and set b the mean total sediment concentration is the local excess density or the driving force imposed by suspended sediments unlike the mean streamwise velocity profiles the mean total concentration profiles do not completely collapse onto the reference profile of case 1 substantial differences are seen near the top and bottom boundaries away from the boundaries the concentration gradients are similar but the profiles are slightly shifted below the reference profile of case 1 a closer examination shows that these differences from the reference case increases with the increasing value of the second moment m 2 see table 1 for the reference case m 2 1 and with increasing m 2 we observe a slight but noticeable reduction in the mean total sediment concentration in the interior of the domain such deviations are to be expected when a polydisperse suspension is compared with an equivalent monodisperse suspension it is straightforward to see that some of the sediment sizes of the polydisperse suspension will settle faster than the effective settling velocity while some other sizes will settle slower and as a result there will be increased accumulation of finer sediments near the top and coarser sediments towards the bottom with a net reduction in concentration in the middle for a polydisperse case a simple measure of this spread in settling velocity can be written as 41 0 1 v v v e 2 c d v d z m 2 v e 2 and thus explaining the observed dependence on m 2 the interesting feature of this result is that even though the vertical distribution of local driving force represented by the mean total sediment concentration varies somewhat between the different cases the mean streamwise velocity which is the mean response to the driving force tends to collapse on to the reference profile this insensitivity to the vertical distribution of the driving force is only when the flow is turbulent in section 4 3 we will look at the laminar solution of the governing equations and highlight key difference caused by the existence of turbulence the l2 norm of the difference in the total concentration profiles of the different cases are given in tables 2 and 3 as expected the l2 norm of the differences although still small are 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for streamwise velocity profiles the total sediment settling flux is defined as the sum of the sediment fluxes of the n different sediment sizes i e m 1 n v m z c m and its vertical variation for all cases in set a and set b is shown in fig 4 unlike the mean velocity profiles noticeable differences between the different cases within a set can be observed mathematically the sediment settling flux is the first moment of local distribution of polydisperse sediment suspension in the flow when averaged over the vertical direction yields 42 0 1 m 1 n v m z c m d z m 1 n v m z γ m v e it can be seen from the figures that in all the cases the depth averaged sediment settling flux is equal to 0 01 and 0 02 in sets a and b respectively again a systematic increasing departure from the reference case with increasing second moment m 2 can also be observed therefore these profiles demonstrate that even though the effective settling velocity v e matches for all the cases the local behavior as a function of z can be quite different in turbidity currents sediment particles are held in suspension through a balance between the downward settling flux and an upward turbulent flux and this balance is established for everysediment group adding over all the sediment groups the netbalance at a given vertical location within the channel can bewritten as 43 m 1 n v m z c m w m 1 n c m 0 note that this relation is valid for a statistically stationary state and away from the top and bottom boundaries where the diffusive flux is negligible since we observed that the settling flux profiles differ greatly we expect that the reynolds flux profiles will also show noticeable differences between the different cases similar differences can be expected in other higher order statistics as well which will be explored below 4 2 higher order turbulence statistics here we will present the results for set a only as all the observations and associated conclusions from the results of set a extend to set b refer to appendix c for all the corresponding figures showing statistics obtained from cases in set b fig 5 show u r m s v r m s and w r m s profiles for all the cases in set a profiles of all three quantities for all the cases collapse onto the reference profile of case 1 the l2 norm of the difference in the rms profiles for different cases are listed in table 2 like the mean streamwise velocity profiles the l2 norm of the difference is quite low at o 10 4 of the reference monodisperse case fig 6 show the reynolds stress u w and reynolds flux m 1 n w c m profiles for all cases in set a while good collapse is observed for reynolds stress reynolds flux profiles differ substantially which is in agreement with the behavior observed in fig 4 profiles of tke production and dissipation for the different cases show a good collapse onto the corresponding reference profile of case 1 see fig 7 it is expected that tke damping due to sediment suspension will depend on sediment size distribution as it is a function of reynolds flux w c t which was shown to have substantial dependence from the figures it is clear that the turbulence statistics which are not associated with sediment concentration of all cases collapse onto a unique profile suggesting that the statistics are nearly independent of the sediment size distribution in other words the zeroth and first moments of fractional sediment volume distribution are the most important factors that control the turbulent velocity field as a consequence it is possible to approximate a complicated polydisperse suspension by a monodisperse suspension whose sediment size has a settling velocity of v e however it is important to emphasize that this simplification has the important limitation that the flow statistics associated with sediment concentration will not be captured appropriately by the monodisperse suspension we will address this in section 5 4 3 laminar solution is the equivalence between polydisperse suspensions and its equivalent monodisperse suspension inherently embedded in mathematical model will this equivalence manifest across the range of reτ here we demonstrate that the approximate equivalence is restricted to only turbulent flow conditions in other words such indifference of the velocity statistics to details of the driving potential requires strong turbulent mixing in the vertical direction it can be shown that the observed equivalence breaks down when we consider laminar solution of the governing equation given in 31 33 the laminar solution for velocity and sediment concentration are given below for derivation see appendix b 44 c m a m exp r e τ s c v m z z 45 u r e τ m 1 n a m r e τ s c v m z exp r e

also fig 8b show the total sediment concentration obtained from the laminar solution for each constituent sediment size present in the suspension of all the cases in set a comparing this figure with fig 2 for the turbulent simulations we can clearly see that the collapse of streamwise velocity is now absent and the deviation of total sediment concentration is much more pronounced in case of laminar solution the deviation from the laminar solution of the equivalent monodisperse suspension is computed as the l2 norm of the difference for cases 2 to 7 for each case in set a the l2 norm of the difference for the laminar solution is approximately 2 orders of magnitude larger than those of the corresponding turbulent flow these results are tabulated in table 4 this establishes that the laminar solution does not allow the same simplification of a polydisperse suspension observed in turbulent flows note that laminar velocity and total sediment concentration profiles of cases in set b are qualitatively similar to those of set a and all the above observations and conclusions presented here consistently extend to set b appendix c shows all the corresponding figures for set b 5 depth dependent effective settling velocity the moments of continuous and discrete sediment distributions defined in eqs 28 and 29 are global quantities as they are based on depth averaged fractional volumes γm equivalently we can define depth dependent moments of the local sediment distribution as 47 m 0 l z m 1 n c m 48 m 1 l z m 1 n v m z c m from the above definition we obtain the zeroth moment to be the same as the normalized total sediment concentration c t z in all the simulations initially all constituent sediment sizes are uniformly distributed in the vertical direction with superimposed random perturbation and consequently at t 0 we have m 0 l 1 and m 1 l v e which are the same as the global zeroth and firstmoments once the simulations begin the sediment particles settledown at their respective settling velocities and turbulence tends to mix them vertically at the bottom boundary we enforce a resuspension flux through an effective diffusive process which ensures that total sediment load of each constituent sediment size is conserved the overall effect of this evolution is that the depth dependent moments which are based on local sediment concentration start deviating from the global moments and become a function of z each sediment size reaches its stationary state when its downward settling flux is balanced by the upward reynolds flux see 43 we can define the effective local settling velocity v e l z as 49 v e l z m 1 n v m c m m 1 n c m this definition of effective local settling velocity along with local mean sediment concentration ensures perfect balance of net local sediment flux fig 9 shows the profiles of effective local settling velocity v e l for all cases in sets a and b in cases 1a and 1b v e l is constant and is equal to 0 01 and 0 02 respectively however for all other cases v e l varies with height close to the bottom v e l is closer to the settling velocity of the largest sediment while near the top boundary v e l is closer to the settling velocity of the smallest sediment in the suspension this captures the physical reality of the turbidity currents i e in a turbidity current driven by polydisperse suspension we expect to find large sediments near the bottom of the flow while the smaller sediments will be more common near the top from the perspective of an improved mathematical model an ideal approximation of a polydisperse suspension with an equivalent monodisperse suspension is when the settling velocity of the monodisperse suspension varies with channel height as given by v e l for a mondisperse suspension such a depth dependent settling velocity has no direct physical meaning however it can serve as a mathematical model and an approximation for a more complex polydisperse system with such a mathematical formulation we want to examine if all turbulence statistics of the polydisperse suspension including those involving sediment concentration will be well captured by the monodisperse suspension 5 1 equivalent monodisperse suspension with depth dependent settling velocity in this section we will consider simulation of a monodisperse suspension with a depth dependent settling velocity that will be referred to as v m o n o z this depth dependent settling velocity will be chosen to match the effective local settling velocity of a chosen polydisperse case given in 49 note that the effective local settling velocity is known only through a direct numerical simulation of the polydisperse system since the z dependence of the mean concentration c m of the different sediment sizes is not known a priori they are known only through an ensemble average of the simulation results in the statistically stationary state only after the transient effects have fully decayed thus the simulations with equivalent monodisperse to be described below is not of practical value since it requires input from the polydisperse system that it will approximate our purpose is to see if a monodisperse system with an ideal depth dependent settling velocity can approximate a polydisperse current here it must be pointed out that there are rigorously derived computational methods such as qmom and dqmom marchisio and fox 2005 ramkrishna and singh 2014 proposed in the literature to solve the population balance equation the present approach of an equivalent monodisperse suspension with depth dependent settling velocity can be related to these approaches in the monodisperse simulation the depth dependent settling velocity of the sediment will be held the same over time the initial starting condition for the equivalent monodisperse suspension is a depth independent uniform sediment concentration which is the same as in all other simulations considered the initial transient evolution of the monodisperse system is not expected to mimic the corresponding transient state of the polydisperse system very well this discrepancy is due to the fact that the depth dependent settling velocity used in the monodisperse system approximates only the stationary state of the polydisperse system thus all comparisons between the equivalent monodisperse and polydisperse systems will be in the stationary regime given these assumptions we evaluate the effect of variable settling velocity on the governing equations and other important relations presented in the previous sections the momentum equation will be unaffected as it does not directly depend on the sediment settling velocity see 2 31 20 the coupling between the flow and the sediment suspension is through the body force term which only depends on the sediment concentration on the other hand sediment settling velocity directly controls the evolution of sediment concentration through the advection term in the concentration equation see 33 the tke equation will also be modified and the modified form is as shown below 50 p e 1 r e τ d k d z 0 1 1 s c c 0 1 β r i τ 0 1 v m o n o z c m o n o d z cos θ all the terms on the left hand side are the same as before see 39 while the damping term on the right hand side now accounts for the depth dependent settling velocity here we consider the polydisperse suspension case 7b with 4 constituent sediment sizes accordingly we have assumed the depth dependent settling velocity of the monodisperse suspension to be from the stationary state of case 7b i e v m o n o v e l 7 b we refer to this monodisperse simulation with depth dependent settling velocity as case 8 fig 10 shows the mean streamwise velocity and mean sediment concentration of cases 1b 7b and 8 the enforced local settling velocity in case 8 dictates the evolution of sediment within the channel and the concentration profiles of case 7b and 8 are almost on top of each other similarly we expect better agreement between various higher order statistics of cases 7b and 8 than with the constant settling velocity monodisperse suspension case 1 fig 11 shows profiles of reynolds stress and reynolds flux for cases 1b 7b and 8 also fig 12 shows the profiles of tke production dissipation and damping all these figures clearly show that the statistics of case 7b and case 8 are in very good agreement similarly we also present the rms velocity profiles of these three cases in fig 13 although profiles for all the three cases are quite close to each other the agreement between cases 7b and 8 is remarkable table 5 lists l2 norms of the difference in various turbulence statistics of case 7b from the monodisperse case 8 we will compare these norms with the l2 norms presented in table 3 which correspond to the difference between cases 7b and 1b clearly the l2 norms in table 5 are at least an order of magnitude smaller the most important differences are observed in statistics pertaining to sediment concentration here the l2 norms in table 5 are at least 2 orders of magnitudesmaller from the above discussion it is evident that the reason for such a good agreement between the monodisperse and polydisperse cases is the choice of sediment settling velocity specified inside the channel for the monodisperse case here the monodisperse settling velocity profile was extracted from the statistically stationary state of the polydisperse case however such information is not available a priori and one would not know the precise form of v e despite this apparent limitation the simulation performed in this study demonstrates that turbulent statistics in turbidity current are primarily driven by the zeroth and first moments of a sediment suspension which can be matched with a depth dependent monodisperse suspension in other words a turbidity current with polydisperse suspension can be modeled by an effective monodisperse suspension which has a locally matching zeroth and firstmoment 6 conclusions in this study we have presented a general mathematical formulation of turbidity currents driven by polydisperse sediment suspension a simplification of the general framework was described where the population balance equation reduces to a set of scalar transport equations for discrete sediment sizes thisformulation was employed to perform simulations of turbidity currents in auto suspension mode in all the simulations r e τ 180 s c 1 and r i τ 11 42 were held fixed and the composition ofsediment suspension driving the flow was changed simulations were categorized into two sets a and b such that in each set the amount of sediment in suspension and the volume weighted average sediment settling velocity were maintained the same in other words in all the simulation cases within each set the zeroth and first moment of the sediment suspension based on fractional volume occupied by the different sediment sizes was held fixed in each set case 1 corresponds to the monodisperse suspension while the other cases contain more than one sediment size we compare the turbulence statistics of the reference monodisperse case with the other polydisperse cases it was observed that turbulence statistics such as mean streamwise velocity rms velocities reynolds stress tke production and tke dissipation of case 1 monodisperse suspension adequately represent the corresponding statistics of the polydisperse cases in the set however statistics associated with sediment concentration such as mean sediment concentration reynolds flux and tke damping showed noticeable differences it was also shown that these discrepancies arise because the monodisperse suspension with a constant sediment settling velocity cannot capture the local settling flux of polydisperse suspensions to overcome this limitation we require a monodisperse suspension where the sediment settling velocity is allowed to vary in z such that it represents the effective size of the local polydisperse suspension we performed a simulation of monodisperse suspension of sediment where the z dependent sediment settling velocity was obtained from the effective settling velocity of case 7b in the statistically stationary state in other words the settling velocity was a function of height from the bottom of the channel and its value was such that it captured the effective local sediment size in the flow it is observed that with the depth dependent settling velocity even the turbulence statistics associated with sediment concentration matched very well with the corresponding polydisperse case 7b these results support the possibility that by matching the net sediment concentration and a depth dependent first moment of a polydisperse sediment suspension it is possible to predict its behavior with an equivalent monodisperse current acknowledgments we wish to thank the national science foundation for partnership for international research and education pire grant nsf
