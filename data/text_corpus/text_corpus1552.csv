7760,study region beetaloo sub basin northern territory and cooper basin queensland and south australia australia study focus a chemical screening approach was upscaled to regional scale to assess impacts of chemical spills on unconfined aquifers chemical dilution factors dfs were developed from hydrogeochemical modelling to predict the impact of hypothetical chemical spills as part of a hazard identification process from the potential development of shale tight and deep gas in the beetaloo sub basin and cooper basin advection and dispersion modelling non reactive hydrus 1 d was used as a conservative screening approach to estimate dfs vertically through the unsaturated zone and laterally through the unconfined aquifers the results were upscaled to basin scale based on spatially distributed soil groundwater and aquifer information including the presence of karsts the spatial approach successfully defined areas that required additional assessment prior to any future development new hydrological insights for the region for chemical concentrations from surface spills to not exceed ecotoxicological thresholds at the water table a df of 1000 was required screening areas with a df of 1000 constrained the area of concern for aquifer contamination from spills to 0 3 and 14 of the beetaloo and cooper regions respectively the likelihood for long term impacts from potential undetected chemical leaks on groundwater dependent ecosystems was assessed to 0 1 of the cooper region due to dilution in lateral groundwater flow but 18 of the beetaloo region graphical abstract ga1 keywords chemical screening impact assessment unconventional gas water quality chemical transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction investigations into the potential for shale and tight gas development in australia are in their early stages geoscience australia 2021 but exploration is advancing in some basins such as the cooper basin in central australia a significant growth in shale gas production has already occurred in the usa since the early 2000s wang and krupnick 2015 rogers 2011 due diligence in investigations into the potential for shale and tight gas includes quantifying the potential for contamination of soil surface water and groundwater through the accidental release of chemicals and ensuring that appropriate prevention and mitigation measures are undertaken pepper et al 2018 investigations into the potential impacts from gas developments include the risks of spills from chemical handling and injection brantley et al 2014 and leakage between production zones and beneficial aquifers warner et al 2012 gas developments are associated with transport and handling of chemicals for drilling and hydraulic fracturing and storage treatment and disposal of flowback water which also contains drilling hydraulic fracturing and geogenic chemicals huddlestone holmes et al 2021 holland et al 2021 butkovskyi et al 2017 vidic et al 2013 reviews conducted in australia mallants et al 2018 the us epa 2016 and europe mair et al 2012 identified that the predominant risks associated with unconventional gas development involve the accidental release of chemicals associated with drilling and hydraulic fracturing during transport and surface handling leading to soil groundwater and surface water contamination the potential for accidental release of chemicals associated with these activities can be avoided and or mitigated through physical barriers best practice and spill management procedures epa sa 2016 epa nt 2019 however despite adherence to regulations and management plans literature huddlestone holmes et al 2017 pepper et al 2018 and regulatory compliance reports department for energy and mining sa 2010 2020 indicate that spills do occur impact assessment is a means of determining the relative impacts of different types of chemical spills or leaks and the relative impacts of spills occurring in various parts of the basins it potentially informs the prioritisation of additional data collection prior to approval and development previous work to predict the large scale assessment of the fate and transport of chemicals released at the soil surface include either stochastic and non spatially distributed for example consim environment agency 2006 and epacmtp us epa 1996 or gis based models with simplified approximations for the unsaturated zone groundwater flow and solute transport examples of which include those developed and applied in central new york state sinkevich jr et al 2005 and texas strassberg et al 2003 these approaches are limited to using parameters that only vary laterally and often do not account for chemical transport across a variably saturated and heterogeneous unsaturated zone that provides significant potential for chemical attenuation mallants et al 2020 kanno and mccray 2021 used contaminant fate and transport modelling to simulate the impacts of surface spills of produced water in the south platte aquifer colorado usa hydrus 1 d was used to model vertical chemical transport but only two depths to groundwater were considered 0 6 m and 3 m and one soil type sandy loam and one chemical benzene which did not account for unsaturated zones up to 100 m which were found in the case studies described in this paper and therefore ignores potential attenuation which may be orders of magnitude higher it did not consider the effects of other spills such as the chemicals used in drilling and hydraulic fracturing fluids nor dilution from lateral flow within a saturated aquifer the research indicated that ponding depth volume per surface area 0 12 m was the dominant factor in determining whether benzene contamination reached the water table above the epa maximum contamination level in this study a spatially applied causal network impact analysis was developed to assess and visualise the pathways between actions in unconventional gas development and operation processes such as drawdown chemical contamination and habitat disturbance and endpoints such as aquifer and wetland condition peeters et al 2022 the potential impacts of accidental chemical release on soils waterbodies and aquifers were quantified using a non reactive chemical screening approach mallants et al 2022a which was applied spatially across the two assessment regions this conservative non reactive approach identified where transport of chemicals through soils and aquifers was unlikely to have a material effect due to dilution doble et al 2021 and where more site specific investigations were recommended as most chemical spills associated with unconventional gas development and operations are associated with surface operations such as transport or storage us epa 2016 mallants et al 2018 the research focused on modelling surface chemical spills and did not consider subterranean accidental release of chemicals from hydraulic fracturing or compromised well integrity the aim of this study was to develop a method for quantitatively and spatially assessing the impacts of unconventional gas developments on aquifers and groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes using existing chemical transport approaches two questions were posed i if a large accidental chemical release occurred such a truck rollover based on results of a literature review for what landscape characteristics defined by soil type and depth to groundwater would the contaminants reach the water table within 10 years in sufficient concentrations to cause harm if they were not remediated within this time ii if a slower undetected chemical release occurred such as leaks from pipelines or storage tanks for what landscape characteristics defined by soil type and depth to groundwater would the ultimate chemical concentration at groundwater dependent assets such as bores and gdes wetlands springs water bodies be high enough to cause harm spatial maps were produced to indicate the attenuation of contamination in each of these cases 2 site descriptions 2 1 beetaloo sub basin the mesoproterozoic aged beetaloo sub basin orr et al 2020 is located in the northern territory between mataranka springs and elliot fig 1 the study region covers an area of 28 000 km2 is sparsely populated and consists predominantly of tropical savannah with climate ranging from tropical in the north of the region to semi arid in the south landscape classes are described mostly as loamy and sandy plains 70 and clay plains 17 with some floodplain and alluvium 6 and undulating country on fine grained sedimentary rocks 5 table 1 the beetaloo sub basin does not outcrop but is deeply buried by a cover that includes the georgina wiso and daly basins the carpentaria basin and cenozoic sediments orr et al 2020 evans et al 2020b the predominant aquifer system across the beetaloo region is the cambrian limestone aquifer cla which encompasses limestone aquifers in georgina wiso and daly basins and provides a good quality groundwater resource for the pastoral industry and communities in the region shallow perched aquifers may occur above the cla in carpentaria basin or cenozoic sediments the antrim plateau volcanics is primarily a regional leaky aquitard and localised fractured rock aquifer and where present separates the cla from underlying sequences the bukulara sandstone and the jamison sandstone aquifers evans et al 2020b huddlestone holmes et al 2020 the water table predominantly sits within the cla and to a much lesser extent in the carpentaria or antrim plateau volcanics evans et al 2020b across much of the depth to water table ranges from 14 m to over 115 m evans et al 2020b which minimises interactions with surface water features and vegetation the inferred regional groundwater flow direction from potentiometric contours is generally to the north west local scale deviations may occur as a result of geological structures and karst systems karst and sinkholes associated with the cla as well as pseudo karst in the overlying carpentaria basin have been identified particularly in the north west of the region geological and bioregional assessment program 2021d 2021c groundwater dependent assets include water bores that supply communities and the pastoral industry and springs to the north of the study area surface water within the beetaloo region is ephemeral however the cla supports perennial flow in the roper river to the north of the region fig 1 by spring discharge and baseflow to streams evans et al 2020b prospective plays in the beetaloo sub basin that are most likely to be developed include shale plays at depths between 600 m and 3000 m below surface in the kyalla and velkerri formations and a tight sandstone play in the hayfield mudstone fig 2a hall et al 2020 2 2 cooper basin the cooper basin covers an area of 130 000 km2 95 740 km2 in queensland 34 310 km2 in south australia in central australia holland et al 2020 the region has an arid climate with low rainfall and surface water predominantly flowing into the region from the north it predominantly consists of floodplain and alluvium channel country associated with braided rivers and streams across the generally flat landscape knighton and nanson 1994 between inland dunes maroulis et al 2007 water courses are highly ephemeral with boom bust water pulses shaping the ecological dynamics bunn and davies 2001 the main landscape classes are described as floodplain and alluvium 32 inland dunefields 30 and undulating country on fine grained sedimentary rocks 20 table 2 fig 3 more than 60 of the region is covered by indigenous land use agreements and the sparse population is boosted by the fly in fly out population associated with the conventional oil and gas industries in the region the cooper basin is completely buried by the eromanga and lake eyre basins lech et al 2020 the hydrogeology of the cooper region includes the cenozoic aquifer which is found in the lake eyre basin which is underlain by the winton mackunda partial aquifer in the eromanga basin fig 2b the regional rolling downs aquitard confines the underlying artesian aquifers of the great artesian basin gab including the cadna owie hooray and hutton sandstone aquifers within the in the eromanga basin evans et al 2020a holland et al 2020 whilst the majority of bores in the cooper region source groundwater from the cenozioc and winton mackunda aquifers due to the relatively shallow drill depth required the deeper cadna owie hooray and hutton sandstone aquifers often provide better and more consistent quality groundwater with artesian pressures however the depth to artesian aquifers is generally greater than 500 m the majority of water extracted from the winton mackunda aquifer is used for stock watering the depth to water table in the cooper region ranges from 7 m to over 97 m the water table is generally between 10 and 20 m below the surface in the consolidated rocks that lie under the cooper creek floodplain evans et al 2020a and the gradient is generally to the south west from queensland qld into south australia sa connectivity between the surface water and groundwater in the cooper gba region is generally limited to recharge of small freshwater lenses near waterholes during floods holland et al 2021 geological and bioregional assessment program 2021 8201 f crosbie et al 2022 cendón et al 2010 groundwater dependent assets include water bores that supply communities and the pastoral industry and groundwater dependent ecosystems such as floodplain and dryland vegetation or vegetation surrounding waterholes which can use groundwater as a water source during dry periods the cooper basin has been producing hydrocarbons since 1969 and in more recent times petroleum companies have been pursuing a range of emerging shale tight and deep coal gas plays found between 800 m and 4000 m below the surface below the nappamerri group lech et al 2020 3 methods 3 1 related work in the geological and bioregional assessments program the research presented represents one component of a broader risk assessment of the impacts of shale tight and deep gas developments in the beetaloo sub basin northern territory and cooper basin south australia and queensland through the geological and bioregional assessments gba program huddlestone holmes et al 2021 holland et al 2021 peeters et al 2022 in the beetaloo region the gba program also included baseline characterisation of surface water groundwater and ecosystems pinpointing the source aquifers for springs lamontagne et al 2021 improved estimates of diffuse and local groundwater recharge rates crosbie and rachakonda 2021 deslandes et al 2019 characterisation of cover sequences over cambrian limestone aquifer cla geological and bioregional assessment program 2021b and an initial appraisal of distribution of karst and pseudo karst in cover and the cla geological and bioregional assessment program 2021d 2021c additional studies in the cooper gba region included investigations of potential connections between shallow and deep aquifers geological and bioregional assessment program 2021e connection between groundwater and waterholes geological and bioregional assessment program 2021 8201 f and evapotranspiration and river transmission losses from riparian vegetation crosbie et al 2022 outputs from many of these investigations were used as input to this study previous work in the beetaloo sub basin involved a tier 1 qualitative screening environmental risk assessments for the 116 chemicals identified as being associated with drilling and hydraulic fracturing of unconventional gas developments in the cooper basin and beetaloo sub basin were also used to derive safe dilutions of chemicals associated with shale tight and deep coal gas operations and chemicals that required further assessment kirby et al 2020a 2020b direct toxicity assessments on freshwater biota using samples of flowback wastewater from two gas wells in the beetaloo sub basin were undertaken to support the tier 1 qualitative screening golding et al 2022 a spatial causal network analysis undertaken in consultation with industry regulators gas and environmental stakeholders was used to identify relevant pathways for impact and prioritise pathways for assessment peeters et al 2022 finally a quantitative assessment took into account the previous work to quantify dilution rates through advection and dispersion through the unsaturated zone and groundwater from potential spills and leaks of chemicals involved in construction and production mallants et al 2022a and in flowback wastewater mallants et al 2022b this paper amalgamates the knowledge and data from these previous studies to spatially quantify the impacts of unconventional gas developments on aquifers and groundwater dependent ecosystems to facilitate assessment of the spatial causal network peeters et al 2022 3 2 chemical screening framework a framework was derived here to screen areas of the cooper and beetaloo regions where impact was either unlikely or where i it was possible that a chemical spill at the soil surface would reach the water table and impact the unconfined aquifer and ii the spill would migrate to and impact nearby groundwater dependent assets such as bores or groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes the framework was based on the calculation of chemical dilution factors dfs i e the ratio of the predicted chemical concentration after transport through the unsaturated zone to the source chemical concentration at the location of the spill the framework was also used to inform a spatial causal network used for multi stressor risk analysis and mapping peeters et al 2022 of the likelihood in any area of the region that accidental release could have an impact on unconfined aquifers or groundwater dependent assets chemical degradation and adsorption were not accounted for in this regional analysis the lowest possible value of df is therefore 1 i e there is no dilution at all while high df values correspond to a high degree of dilution in the current calculations the source concentration is given an arbitrary value of 1 unit concentration site specific analysis where such attenuation processes were included for the beetaloo sub basin are reported by mallants et al 2022a critical dilution factors based on a qualitative assessment of chemicals used in unconventional gas production kirby et al 2020a 2020b were selected to define the conditions under which chemical spills at the surface were likely to have a material impact on contamination of aquifers and groundwater dependent assets for the beetaloo and cooper regions a dilution factor of 1000 was chosen as it ensures that solute concentrations are reduced to below their ecotoxicity thresholds or thresholds for human health toxicity a df of 1000 corresponded with 43 45 chemicals that were part of the assessment being diluted to a risk quotient rq of less than one kirby et al 2020a 2020b mallants et al 2022a 2022b the two chemicals with a rq 1 after being diluted by a factor of 1000 were hydrochloric acid rq 1 37 and tributyl tetradecylphosphonium chloride rq 6 0 hydrochloric acid is expected to dissociate in waters to hydrogen h and chloride cl ions natural attenuation processes will further reduce exposure concentration and organism effects e g buffering capability organism effects will also depend on ability to resist and or adapt to changes in salinity tributyl tetradecylphosphonium chloride is a biocide expected to be readily biodegradable 60 in 28 days and natural attenuation processes will further reduce exposure concentrations and organism effects e g adsorption complexation transformations dilution the transport of contaminants through a soil groundwater system was conceptualised into two flow components a vertical flow component through the unsaturated zone and a lateral flow component through the saturated part of the aquifer as per marín and andreo 2015 as a conservative approximation of the attenuation of chemicals from transport through soils and aquifers advection dispersion modelling without chemical degradation or adsorption was used to quantify the potential dfs between the soil surface and the groundwater and the soil surface and groundwater dependent assets the three step screening framework consisted of estimating dfs through chemical attenuation using hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2016 2013 development of empirical equations to estimate dfs based on soil and aquifer characteristics and groundwater depth and application of these equations into a 500 m x 500 m gridded landscape map based on the characteristics of each grid cell the hydrus 1d modelling was used to i estimate chemical attenuation vertically through the unsaturated zone from a spill at the surface based on unsaturated zone dilution factors dfuz ii estimate attenuation for a contaminant that has reached the water table laterally through the saturated zone due to groundwater flow dfgw and iii these dilution factors were combined into a total dilution factor dft where dft dfuz x dfgw to represent attenuation from a spill at the surface to the resulting concentration at a groundwater dependent asset up to 500 m from the spill fig 4 mallants et al 2022a using one dimensional flow modelling was justified based on the relatively flat terrain and deep water tables in these regions making lateral sub surface flows negligible mallants et al 2022a the following sections describe the development of the chemical transport models and application of the models to the screening framework 3 3 chemical modelling methods chemical modelling methods were derived to address two scenarios i an accidental release of a large volume of chemicals such as a truck rollover and a ii slow and undetected chemical release of the same volume such as leaks from pipelines or storage tanks from previous assessments a truck roll over was considered to have the highest likelihood of any incident in which fluids could be released into the environment nicnas 2017 and the volume of a three trailer road train was used as a conservative volume for analysis considering a maximum tank volume of approximately 22 000 l for each tanker total of 66 000 l the maximum volume of fluid that could be released in either scenario was conservatively set at 100 000 l 100 m3 spills over 100 m3 are the largest volume class of spill reported in south australian regulatory compliance reports department for energy and mining sa 2010 2020 dilution factors were developed for the predominant landscape types in each region assuming a 100 m3 spill volume table 3 the rate of infiltration was determined by the soil type associated with the landscape class and the depth of ponding for the beetaloo region the ponding area was set at 360 m2 based on the size of the sumps described in the beetaloo basin kyalla 117 n2 civil construction environmental management plan origin energy 2019 giving a maximum ponding depth of 28 cm the sumps are constructed with the base located three metres below the ground surface therefore chemicals in the onsite leak scenario will travel through three metres less than the thickness of the unsaturated zone the maximum infiltration depth for an offsite spill for example from a truck rollover was assumed to also be 28 cm for the cooper region the ponding area was set at 1500 m2 based on the size of the pond areas described in the santos eir santos 2015 giving a ponding depth of 6 7 cm as the ponds are above ground infiltration will occur from the land surface for both off site rapid leakage and on site sump leak cases percentiles for clay silt and sand components for each grid cell were obtained from the australian soil resource information system asris atlas of australian soils johnston et al 2003 to provide soil characteristics for each landscape class table 1 and table 2 soil hydraulic parameters were derived from usda class transfer functions from carsel and parrish 1988 and the non hysteretic form of the van genuchten 1980 water retention curve and mualem 1976 equation based on the range of soil characteristics for each landscape class mallants et al 2022a a depth to water table surface was generated for the beetaloo region using inverse distance weighted interpolation of the piezometric surface at 1040 sampled bores based on the most recent observations between 1919 and 2018 this piezometric surface was subtracted from the digital elevation model to derive an estimated depth to water table surface that captured the variations in land surface elevation interpolation of the piezometric surface was attempted for the cooper region but due to the smaller depth to groundwater and very few observation bores near any waterbodies the interpolated surface erroneously exceeded the ground surface in many areas therefore the depth to water table for the cooper region was generated by interpolating values of depth to water at 1056 water bores using the most recent observation between 1911 and 2017 inverse distance weighting was used for the interpolation and included values of depth to water at 293 waterhole centroids where groundwater was estimated to be approximately 10 m below the base of the waterhole geological and bioregional assessment program 2021 8201 f 1349 points in total a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 1 m was assumed for vertical travel distances greater than 5 m and for travel distances between 0 m and 5 m a linear increase in dispersivity from 0 to 0 1 m was assumed mallants et al 2022a although a dispersivity of 0 1 m is consistent with those used in other studies oostrom et al 2016 this low values provides a conservative estimation for regions with very limited data on dispersivity chemical attenuation through dilution and dispersion in saturated groundwater flow was based on the analytical solutions of leij et al 1991 to the three dimensional advection dispersion solute transport differential equation using the stanmod 3dade package leij and bradford 1994 the key input for this equation is the porewater velocity ν based on the darcy flux q and the effective porosity η e 1 ν q η e ki η e where k is hydraulic conductivity and i is hydraulic gradient these two parameters were estimated from spatial information as described in section 3 6 3 3 1 chemical dilution in the unsaturated zone advection dispersion modelling using hydrus 1d was used to develop solute depth profiles 10 years after a potential chemical spill occurred based on the soil profiles described in mallants et al 2022a for offsite and onsite spills for the beetaloo region fig 5 and cooper region fig 6 respectively the depth to water table required to achieve a dilution factor of 1000 was derived from these solute depth profiles for off site spill and on site leak scenarios 3 3 2 chemical dilution in groundwater flow equations to estimate dilution factors at a time where the peak concentration of a potential chemical spill reached the water table were developed as an input to overall dilution from the soil surface to a groundwater dependent asset 500 m from the location of the spill first two power functions were used to represent the soil dilution factors for each landscape class across the full depth of the unsaturated zone as derived from the solute depth profiles in mallants et al 2022a for offsite and onsite spills for the beetaloo and cooper regions these simplified models are shown in table 4 and table 5 respectively and graphically in fig 7 for the loamy and sandy plains landscape class graphs for other landscape classes can be found in the supplementary material these models were developed by tracking the movement of the peak concentration of chemical through the soil profile and relating the minimum dilution rate maximum chemical concentration to the depth below the surface for example fig 4f in mallants et al 2022a within one and the same landscape class attenuation varies with depth to the groundwater table it is also affected by sudden changes in hydraulic properties at interfaces between sediment layers for instance at approximately 20 m depth in the loamy and sandy plains class in the beetaloo region a change in soil hydraulic properties occurs transition from claystone to siltstone with a 13 fold decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity mallants et al 2022b this causes a sharp decrease in pore water velocity a compression of the solute plume and therefore a local and stepwise increase in solute concentration this in turn results in a discontinuity in the calculated dilution factor depth relationship with two separate curves extending across two different depth intervals fig 7 second empirical equations to estimate dilution factors from lateral flow through the groundwater were derived to represent the results from 3d advection dispersion modelling for a distance of 500 m from the location at which the contaminant reaches the saturated aquifer as described in mallants et al 2022a table 6 these equations were applied to the study areas based on the landscape class to estimate dilution factors spatially across the landscape the total dilution from surface spill to a groundwater dependent asset 500 m away from the spill was the product of the long term unsaturated dilution factors in table 4 and table 5 and the groundwater dilution factors in table 6 3 4 changes to chemical dilution potential from karsts and sinkholes karst features such as caverns and sinkholes or dolines affect groundwater recharge in limestone sediments in different ways where karst features are absent fig 8a diffuse recharge is the dominant mechanism of replenishing the groundwater with matrix flow responsible for the slow movement of water and solutes when karst features are expressed in the form of underground voids and caverns cavern recharge occurs where water enters the caverns via matrix flow and preferential flow fig 8b within the cavern dripping occurs causing water to travers large distances without interacting with the rock matrix bradley et al 2010 another expression of karst features in the landscape is the presence of sinkholes fig 8c sinkholes are depressions in the landscape formed from the collapse of caverns that over time fill up with regolith debris and erosion material resulting in a more permeable zone within the surrounding limestone rock delle rose et al 2004 galloway et al 1999 or may be plugged by subsequent ingression of fine silts and clays which limit infiltration deslandes et al 2019 together with accumulation of surface runoff in the depression these features can cause enhanced groundwater recharge and accelerated transport of solutes deslandes et al 2019 increasing the rate of transport or reducing the thickness of the unsaturated zone will both reduce the residence time in which dispersion and advection can occur and increase the likelihood that a chemical is not diluted to below a critical ecotoxicologically defined threshold before it reaches the groundwater where groundwater is deep relative to the depth of a karst the presence of karsts may not have a significant effect on the overall dilution karsts can also increase the groundwater velocity through bypass flow allshorn et al 2007 therefore increasing the distance required for dilution and dispersion to occur although there are numerous studies of contaminant transport through karstic aquifers ravbar and goldscheider 2007 vesper et al 2001 there are very few assessments of the potential effects of karsts and sinkholes on vertical contaminant transport through the unsaturated zone as part of the greater research project recharge in areas close to sinkholes in the northern part of the beetaloo region within the tindall limestone was estimated using the environmental tracer tritium presence of tritium was used to estimate the mass balance while detection of the tritium bomb peak was interpreted using the distance velocity method deslandes et al 2019 this was compared with the regional estimate of groundwater recharge using the chloride mass balance method crosbie and rachakonda 2021 recharge rates that reflected both conditions were used in the chemical transport modelling any available data on known karsts and sinkholes in the beetaloo region from previous research and nt government databases twidale 1987 department of environment parks and water security 2019 department of environment parks and water security 2021 was collated and assessed for size and depth of sinkholes and thickness and distance from the surface for detected karsts subterranean caverns were classified into three types where the water table was i above the top of the cavern or dissolved limestone ii within the cavern or dissolved limestone and iii below the cavern or dissolved limestone the presence of caverns is likely to alter chemical transport processes through the reduction of the thickness of unsaturated zone through which chemicals are transported dispersed and degraded where the water table is above the ceiling of a cavern no impact on the chemical transport process is likely as any chemicals will reach the water table before they reach the cavern where the water table was within the cavern the unsaturated thickness was reduced by the distance from the ceiling of the cavern to the water table where the water table was below the cavern the thickness of the unsaturated zone was reduced by the total vertical dimension of the cavern the effect of the cavern recharge conceptualisation on the solute transport and dilution factor where the cavern was above the water table fig 8b was evaluated by assuming the height of the cavern causes the effective transport distance between the soil surface and the groundwater table to decrease as a result there will be less opportunity for solutes to mix with the unsaturated zone pore waters causing a lower attenuation relative to the diffuse recharge conceptualisation fig 8a here two cases were considered a cavern height of 5 and 10 m based on the range of cavern heights from observed caverns within the beetaloo region mean 6 25 m range 1 21 m based on the derived relationships between dilution factor and depth to groundwater table 4 dilution factors for cavern recharge were calculated for the four most important landscape classes table 9 to capture the spatial variability in depth to groundwater within each of these landscape classes dilution factors were derived for the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of the depth to groundwater 3 5 spatial application based on landscape classes 3 5 1 unsaturated zone dilution factor criteria in the unsaturated zone aquifer contamination from surface chemical spills is defined as possible where the dilution factor is less than 1000 10 years after occurrence of the spill the selection of a period of 10 years is rather arbitrary although it is reasonable to assume that spills will be detected and remediated within a period of 10 years whether or not soil contamination results in aquifer contamination was defined by the depth to groundwater relative to the depth at which infiltrating chemicals are diluted 1000 times where the groundwater is deeper than the depth at which df 1000 after 10 years contamination is considered not to reach the unconfined aquifer in other words the chemical may still reach the aquifer but its concentration will be diluted to levels that are of no concern the solute transport modelling indicated that for all spill scenarios the df of 1000 after 10 years is reached at shallower depths than 10 m for all soil types included in the simulation remediation can be done by removal of soil or by in situ treatment both are feasible within the first 10 m of the soil profile us epa 2006 although there is high confidence in the calculated depth dependent dilution factor there is uncertainty in estimation of the depth to groundwater map which was derived by interpolating point scale estimates of water table depth to define the criteria for possible and potentially material impacts to aquifers that require further detailed investigation fig 9 it was assumed that the uncertainty in the spatial estimate of depth to groundwater is five metres therefore conservatively material impacts are potential represented by a numerical code of 2 where 2 dwt ddf1000 duc where dwt is depth to water table ddf1000 is depth to achieve a df of 1000 and duc is the uncertainty in water table depth contamination of aquifers from soil contamination was assumed to be possible but not requiring detailed investigation code 1 where 3 ddf1000 2duc dwt ddf1000 duc and not possible code 0 where 4 dwt ddf1000 2duc as shown in fig 9 the pathway analysis thresholds for potential possible and not possible impacts on aquifers from hypothetical spills in each of the landscape classes in the beetaloo and cooper regions are shown in table 7 and table 8 respectively this includes thresholds for offsite spills and onsite leaks from sumps 3 5 2 saturated zone dilution factor criteria to estimate lateral transport within aquifers it was assumed that the full contaminant plume reaches the groundwater after a travel time of several hundred years and that the combined dilution factor is a product of the unsaturated zone and groundwater df components the criterion for contamination was a dilution factor of less than 1000 using the combined soil and groundwater df over a lateral distance of 500 m 3 6 input data input data for the models to derive dilution factors for the study areas consisted of spatial layers of depth to water table dtwt and porewater velocity fig 10 given the dependence of chemical dilution on dtwt indicated in table 7 and table 8 it was important to select the most accurate representation of dtwt two options to estimate dtwt were explored i interpolation of the depth to water table for a topographically controlled water table or ii interpolate the piezometric surface and subtract from the land surface for a recharge controlled water table for a similar magnitude of depth to water table regional scale groundwater flow lengths and aquifer thicknesses in the cooper and beetaloo regions the main factor controlling water table distribution is the ratio of recharge r to hydraulic conductivity k haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 systems with a higher r k are more likely to have a topography controlled water table where the water table is a subdued reflection of topography systems with lower r k are more likely to have a flatter water table which is controlled by recharge the beetaloo region has higher recharge crosbie and rachakonda 2021 but the very high k of the cla and karstic nature in many areas suggests that it falls into the category of recharge controlled groundwater recharge in the cooper region is low and is mostly driven by episodic river and floodplain infiltration crosbie et al 2022 therefore this system is also likely to be controlled by recharge rather than topography this suggests that the spatialisation of the depth to water table should be generated by subtracting the interpolated piezometric surface from the topography for both regions interpolating the piezometric surface was attempted for the cooper region but the shallow water table and lack of observation wells in the riparian zones and floodplains resulted in an erroneous dtwt surface of less than zero piezometric surface above the land surface in low lying areas field observations confirmed that the water table was at least 10 m below the land surface in the lowest areas of the catchment around permanent waterholes geological and bioregional assessment program 2021 8201 f therefore the dtwt data for the cooper region was generated by directly interpolating point scale dtwt measurements from observation bores and for the beetaloo region by subtracting the interpolated piezometric surface from topography this prioritised the accuracy in the areas of the cooper region with shallower groundwater where risk to aquifers from chemical spills are more of a concern this difference can be observed in fig 10 where the beetaloo dtwt shows evidence of topographic highs and lows while the dtwt in the cooper is smoother porewater velocity was estimated for each of the regions using eq 1 fig 10 and data for hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradient and effective porosity with insufficient field estimates of porosity to derive a range for effective porosity a value of 0 1 was used based on results from a recent environmental tracer study in the beetaloo region deslandes et al 2019 hydraulic conductivity was estimated from transmissivity and saturated aquifer thickness determined from bore records and pump tests then interpolated spatially across the regions using the inverse distance weighted method hydraulic gradient was estimated from the slope of the piezometric surface for each region the lines in the porewater velocity map of the cooper region are a result of the piezometric gradient being a function of the more detailed topographic map where drainage lines have influenced the derivation of the hydraulic gradient 4 results 4 1 potential effects of karst features caverns and sinkholes information on karsts in the beetaloo region consisted of mapped collapsed sinkholes and depressions which are evident from the land surface and mapped caverns which are present below ground and detected through drilling and underground investigation department of environment parks and water security 2021a geological and bioregional assessment program 2021a geological and bioregional assessment program 2021g 2021c fig 11 dilution factors estimated for the two karst scenarios 5 m deep and 10 m deep described in section 3 4 showed that overall the reduction in the effective depth of the unsaturated zone by 5 uzd 5 m and 10 m uzd 10 m was relatively small for the landscape classes with deep unsaturated zones i e loamy and sandy plains and clay plains even for the 5th percentile values table 9 however for the floodplain and alluvium and undulating country landscape classes which both have shallower unsaturated zones especially at the 5th percentile the impact was considerable for floodplain and alluvium the uzd 5 m and uzd 10 cases resulted in only 72 and 44 of the original unsaturated zone depth remaining respectively for undulating country uzd 5 m and uzd 10 m resulted in 64 and 28 of the original depth of the unsaturated zone remaining respectively the resulting dilution factors represented 70 and 35 of the original values for floodplain and alluvium and 66 and 47 for undulating country for the 50th and 95th percentiles of the depth to groundwater the effects were much smaller therefore only a small percentage of the landscape where shallow unsaturated zones exist was likely to experience a considerably smaller dilution these areas are well known and where they overlap with the karst features additional management and mitigation measures are recommended in the beetaloo region the smallest depth to the top of the known subterranean cavern was 18 3 m two out of the 125 identified caverns had a depth to ceiling of less than 19 3 m and none of the caverns were within the critical 9 3 m df1000 depth therefore in this assessment area any chemical being transported through the unsaturated zone is likely to be diluted more than 1000 times before reaching a cavern there is a much lower uncertainty in estimating depth to groundwater measured at point scale where caverns have been detected through drilling compared with an interpolated water table therefore the 9 3 m df1000 criterion was used for this assessment it is possible that caverns with smaller depths to ceiling do exist but have not yet been detected therefore there is a need for caution and additional assessment for the presence of undetected caverns through drilling or geophysics prior to any civil construction work localised recharge via sinkholes was estimated by deslandes et al 2019 to be between 66 mm yr and 140 mm yr using the integration of tritium signals mass balance method and 190 mm y using the tritium bomb peak distance velocity method in comparison regional diffuse groundwater recharge was estimated to be between 1 and 25 mm y using chloride mass balances crosbie and rachakonda 2021 contaminant transport through sinkholes was modelled with an increased recharge of 190 mm yr with no significant effect on the resulting df1000 given the relatively deep water table in the study area section 4 the reduction in thickness of unsaturated zone due to the presence of a sinkhole did not affect the df1000 outcomes one of the distinct differences between a cavern and sinkhole is the relatively poor detectability of the former compared to the latter indeed sinkholes in the sturt plateau northern part of the beetaloo sub basin are readily spotted in the landscape with most of them having an elliptical geometry of 40 50 m in diameter one west of mataranka springs approaches 100 m diameter but this is exceptional and 15 m deep and partially infilled twidale 1987 as a result sinkholes can be easily avoided when selecting sites for developing gas wells and the enabling infrastructure caverns on the other hand are not visible from the surface and require geophysical investigation tools for their detection hussain et al 2020 further analysis of the potential impact of caverns on solute transport is therefore more useful than an analysis of sinkholes 4 2 impacts of potential chemical spills on aquifers using the criteria for possible and potentially material risk to aquifers from accidental chemical release at the land surface in fig 9 where the depth to groundwater is greater than ddf1000 plus an uncertainty factor to account for errors in water table measurement and interpolation areas where aquifer contamination was possible or where more detailed investigation was required could be mapped across the study areas in the beetaloo region the susceptibility to aquifer contamination up to 10 years after a potential spill was limited to two small areas in the north of the region due to the smaller estimated depth to groundwater in those locations fig 12a where 0 3 of the basin was assessed as being possibly susceptible to groundwater contamination and 0 15 of the basin requiring detailed investigation in the cooper basin the areas of possible and potentially material aquifer contamination were more widespread predominantly occurring in the south western parts of the study area and a low lying central region fig 12a here 14 of the basin was assessed as having possible susceptibility to groundwater contamination based on eq 3 figs 9 and 2 5 of the basin requiring detailed investigation based on eq 2 fig 9 4 3 impacts of potential chemical spills on groundwater dependent assets dilution factors due to vertical flow through the unsaturated zone fig 13a and lateral flow through the aquifer fig 14 were estimated for the beetaloo and cooper regions using the equations in tables 2 3 and 4 these results describe the potential long term impacts on groundwater dependent assets due to the peak concentration of a chemical from a slow leak that reaches the water table and is transported laterally through groundwater flow the unsaturated zone dilution factor was found to be controlled by the thickness of the unsaturated zone depth to water table soil properties clay silt and sand percentages and in the longer term recharge rates discrete areas towards the south of the beetaloo region had dilution factors greater than 1000 from unsaturated flow processes alone mostly associated with the heavier soil types clay plains and floodplains and alluvium fig 13a the cooper region also had higher dilution factors associated with heavier clay plains and floodplain and alluvium soils but in no area was the unsaturated zone dilution factor greater than 1000 due to the shallower groundwater in this region fig 13b the groundwater dilution factor from lateral flow was governed by the porewater velocity in the aquifer the groundwater hydraulic gradient and the effective porosity while the regional water table gradient in the beetaloo was low the high aquifer transmissivity resulted in a higher porewater velocity and therefore low dilution of chemicals over a distance of 500 m from the point at which the chemical spill reached the water table fig 14a in comparison the relatively low water table gradient and lower hydraulic conductivity in the cooper region produced lower porewater velocity and higher groundwater dilution factors due to the longer residence time over a distance of 500 m fig 14b multiplying the dilution factors for vertical flow and horizontal flow the combined dilution factor for offsite spills was shown spatially across the two study areas fig 15a and b the long term dilution factor was estimated to be less than 1000 in much of the north western areas of the beetaloo region fig 15a a total of 18 of the sub basin area due to the lower depth to water table and higher porewater velocity in that area combined with the higher density of known karsts and sinkholes in this area fig 11 these results highlight that this is a priority area for further investigation for additional baseline data in the northern territory s strategic regional environmental and baseline assessment sreba northern territory government 2020 and in requirements for site scale testing of hydrogeological characteristics to inform the location of civil works such as chemical storage facilities wastewater storage tanks and pipelines there were also several areas in the north of the region where the input data used to estimate porewater velocity was outside of a reasonably expected range due to pinching of aquifers at the edge of the region or lack of data in the interpolation process further assessment is also required in these areas to assess the potential impacts from chemical spills and leaks in contrast there were only two very small isolated locations within the cooper basin 0 1 of the total basin area where the combined dilution was estimated to be less than 1000 fig 15b although the shallow groundwater in the cooper region resulted in none of the region with an unsaturated dilution factor dfuz of 1000 or more indicating the potential for impacts from chemical leaks on the cenozoic and winton mackunda aquifers the lower porewater velocity and greater period of time for advection and diffusion during lateral flow over 500 m meant that it was unlikely that groundwater assets would be impacted by chemical leaks if infrastructure such as storage tanks or pipelines were restricted to more than 500 m from any known groundwater dependent assets 5 discussion the current analysis was part of a larger project that evaluated the potential impacts of australian shale tight and deep gas developments on water and the environment through multiple pathways holland et al 2021 huddlestone holmes et al 2021 this component of the project considered the chemical impacts from potential surface spills of stored and transported chemicals drilling fluids and flowback water a screening process was developed applying existing conservative realistic chemical transport approaches in the unsaturated zone and groundwater and spatial data sets to identify areas of the regions that are unlikely to have any impact and those that require more detailed assessment prior to development or should be avoided during civil construction this screening process relied on best available information and assumptions it is an extension of the work by mallants et al 2022a by spatially applying the work based on regional data sets and explicitly considering clean up of contaminated sites within a 10 year period and a dilution threshold i e df 1000 reached within that period beyond which chemicals are no longer of concern or conversely if the df 1000 has not been reached two outcomes were defined where contamination is likely and exclusion prevention or mitigation works may be required and where there is a need for further site investigations to better estimate the potential for contamination chemical transport from spills involves several interacting complex processes that are highly dependent on study site characteristics and fine scale heterogeneities that are not identified in regional scale data sets for this reason we have maintained a conservative approach the spill scenarios are realistic conservative and based on information from environmental impact statements and industry plans the solute transport modelling assumes no chemical degradation or radioactive decay in case of naturally occurring radionuclides retardation by adsorption reactive transport modelling has been shown to produce considerably larger attenuation dilution factors for site specific studies in the beetaloo sub basin mallants et al 2022b similarly transport through fissures in fractured rock and faults were not analysed in this framework mallants et al 2018 provides a more detailed analysis of the role of faults and fractures in transport of chemicals found in coal seam gas operations including from surface spills and additional information is found in underschultz et al 2018 and turnadge et al 2018 while were no known areas within the beetaloo or cooper regions that were characterised by fractured rock near the surface faults do occur within the regions any areas known to have higher occurrences of karsts and sinkholes are likely to also contain dissolution conduits and should be prioritised for more detailed assessment it was assumed that a dilution factor of 1000 is sufficient to reduce concentrations of chemicals of concern below their threshold toxicity values or detection limits based on kirby et al 2020a kirby et al 2020b and that the dilution factor of 1000 provides sufficient margins of safety to account for daughter compounds that may be more toxic than the solute itself the analysis was based on a ten year period being sufficient to detect and commence remediation of a spill the scenario for solute transport within groundwater was conservatively based on the assumption that for a slow leak soil and unsaturated zone would not be remediated until the peak concentration had reached the water table assumptions about hydraulic properties included that the interpolated water table and derived hydraulic parameters hydraulic gradient k and effective porosity were an adequate regional representation of reality and the soil hydraulic properties derived from the asris database are suitable for regional scale solute transport modelling it was assumed that the cenozoic and winton mackunda aquifers are hydraulically connected a conservative estimate of dispersivity was used for the analysis the screening process demonstrated different chemical transport behaviours in each region for off site chemical spills that are assumed to have been detected and remediated within 10 years the beetaloo region had a lower risk of chemicals reaching the water table through the unsaturated zone fig 12a as the depth to water table was greater than 19 m across most of the catchment more than the required depth for the spilled chemical to be diluted to less than 1 1000 of its original concentration ddf1000 mallants et al 2022a in contrast the cooper had larger areas within the region that were susceptible to potential off site chemical spills related to the water table being less than 14 m deep in many areas of the region potential errors in estimating depth to water table include errors in the measurement of the standing height of water in a bore and converting this to a depth to water these may result from issues with the well construction density contrasts in the groundwater human induced errors in reading and recording measurements or equipment failure for example post and von asmuth 2013 rau et al 2019 further uncertainty exists in the interpolation of this data whereby challenges exist in incorporating water level data from bores with other conceptual information known to inform depth to water e g peeters et al 2010 uncertainty in estimating the water table depth duc was included in the assessment of potential impacts of spills on aquifers but further quantification of the magnitude of error associated with water table estimation especially in data poor areas is required the regional maps of porewater velocity and hydraulic gradient were another source of uncertainty and potential error for the modelling the relative importance of the spatial accuracy of the various hydraulic parameters used in this assessment transmissivity aquifer thickness effective porosity hydraulic gradient and depth to water table is a knowledge gap assessment of their data worth would help with prioritisation of future acquisition of point scale data or improving methods of spatialising these into regional maps through other data sources such as geophysical techniques the long term impact of on site spills that are not detected and remediated before the peak concentration has reached the water table and is transported laterally towards groundwater assets also had different outcomes for each region the beetaloo region again showed higher rates of chemical dilution in the unsaturated zone due to the deeper water table however higher transmissivity in the cla meant that even with low local piezometric gradients lateral chemical dilution rates were low and large areas of the north western part of the region had an estimated dilution factor of less than 1000 indicating that more detailed investigation is required prior to development the potential presence of karsts or dissolution conduits in the cla are likely to lead to bypass flow medici and west 2021 allshorn et al 2007 and therefore any dilution laterally through the aquifer may be overestimated the conservative overarching assessment of this study was therefore that impact on groundwater dependent assets from contamination due to long term on site leaks is possible in all areas of the beetaloo region it highlighted the importance of efforts to improve estimates of hydrogeologic parameters e g through pump tests and detect karsts and caverns e g through geophysics or test drilling before any construction occurs conversely the cooper region was found to have a higher susceptibility to aquifer contamination from long term on site leaks due to the smaller depth to groundwater but where the peak concentration of chemicals reached the water table it is likely to be diluted through advection and dispersion through lateral groundwater flow as the chemical modelling used a 500 m flow distance for lateral contaminant transport it is assumed that a 500 m buffer around any groundwater dependent assets that excludes any civil construction is likely to prevent impacts on the assets the independent scientific inquiry into hydraulic fracturing in the northern territory pepper et al 2018 recommends that no onshore shale gas water extraction bore field should be located within 1 km of groundwater users unless additional information indicates that a different buffer zone is appropriate or make good arrangements can be negotiated with groundwater users to ensure maintenance of water supply the difference in outcomes for the beetaloo region for off site spills and on site leaks is dependent on the assumption that chemical spills are detected and remediated within 10 years the dilution factors estimated for the arrival of the peak concentration fig 13 were smaller than those derived for a time of 10 years after the spill occurs fig 12 as the longer time period in which advection and dilution could occur was offset by the higher mass of chemical that had reached the water table in this time mitigation measures to detect spills and leaks in the beetaloo region are therefore critical in the cooper region the most likely potential impact is contamination of aquifers due to off site chemical spills data acquisition to improve estimates and interpolation of the water table particularly in low lying areas such as river floodplains and near the western edge of the region will improve the confidence in estimates of risk of impact avoidance of any civil construction roads well pads pipelines in areas where the water table is less than 14 m deep will also minimise the risk of aquifer contamination the strength of the chemical screening approach described in this study lies in its ability to combine both stochastic chemical modelling of more complex soil profiles and groundwater depths with a spatially distributed framework the approach was spatially distributed unlike those described by the environment agency 2006 and us epa 1996 and used more complex soil and saturation profiles than the gis based approaches described by strassberg et al 2003 and sinkevich jr et al 2005 while kanno and mccray 2021 used chemical transport modelling in a spatially distributed framework only two relatively shallow depths to groundwater were considered one soil type and one chemical the framework described in this paper can account for large ranges in depth to groundwater 4 or 5 different heterogeneous soil profiles per catchment and 45 different chemicals and could be used for other potential csg developments within australia with relatively small updates in soil and groundwater information 6 conclusion the screening process provided a systematic method for spatially and quantitatively applying ecotoxicology and chemical modelling knowledge across multiple regions transparency and repeatability were emphasised so that new data and knowledge could be used to update the impact assessment as it became available to reduce output uncertainty the screening process was dependent on a number of assumptions as discussed in detail above it was based on knowledge of the chemicals currently used in production and hydrocarbons found in flowback water in the cooper and beetaloo basins metrics for the level of chemical dilution required to produce no impact will need to be adjusted for other regions depending on local hydrogeological production and construction conditions the screening process is being used to inform impact assessments in gas basins in australia holland et al 2021 huddlestone holmes et al 2021 and knowledge gaps identified have been used in the development of the strategic regional environmental and baseline assessment sreba in the northern territory northern territory government 2020 the screening process also provided insights about the two regions and their corresponding vulnerabilities the deeper water table in the beetaloo region is likely to delay the arrival of any chemical spills to the groundwater and reduce the concentration of contaminant during vertical transport within the first 10 years of a spill of more concern in this region is whether undetected leaks that reach the water table in high enough concentrations will be rapidly transported laterally through the high conductivity aquifer and or associated karst system leading to long term impacts on groundwater dependent assets such as water bores and springs better characterisation of the cambrian limestone aquifer hydraulic parameters at both local and regional scales including the preferential flow effects of caverns sinkholes and dissolution conduits is required to improve confidence in the impact assessment the shallower water table in the cooper region makes the unconfined cenozoic and winton mackunda aquifers more vulnerable in the short term to potential chemical spills that are not detected and remediated within 10 years the low porewater velocity related to relatively low hydraulic gradient and aquifer transmissivity infers that groundwater dependent assets in the cooper region are more resilient to long term impacts from undetected chemical leaks confidence in the assessment could be improved and the uncertainty in the assessment reduced by better local scale mapping of the water table in low lying parts of the region this may require additional depth measurements from new observation bores inferred water tables from geophysics or other data sources and improvements in the methods for interpolation between the relatively scarce data points in the region in both regions the assessment highlighted the ongoing need for stringent spill avoidance and management practices in the development and processing of gas resources in australia and robust mitigation and remediation plans that can be quickly activated if a spill should occur credit authorship

identification process from the potential development of shale tight and deep gas in the beetaloo sub basin and cooper basin advection and dispersion modelling non reactive hydrus 1 d was used as a

abstract ga1 keywords chemical screening impact assessment unconventional gas water quality chemical transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction investigations into the potential for shale and tight gas development in australia are in their early stages geoscience australia 2021 but exploration is advancing in some basins such as the cooper basin in central australia a significant growth in shale gas production has already occurred in the usa since the early 2000s wang and krupnick 2015 rogers 2011 due diligence in investigations into the potential for shale and tight gas includes quantifying the potential for contamination of soil surface water and groundwater through the accidental release of chemicals and ensuring that appropriate prevention and mitigation measures are undertaken pepper et al 2018 investigations into the potential impacts from gas developments include the risks of spills from chemical handling and injection brantley et al 2014 and leakage between production zones and beneficial aquifers warner et al 2012 gas developments are associated with transport and handling of chemicals for drilling and hydraulic fracturing and storage treatment and disposal of flowback water which also contains drilling hydraulic fracturing and geogenic chemicals huddlestone holmes et al 2021 holland et al 2021 butkovskyi et al 2017 vidic et al 2013 reviews conducted in australia mallants et al 2018 the us epa 2016 and europe mair et al 2012 identified that the predominant risks associated with unconventional gas development involve the accidental release of chemicals associated with drilling and hydraulic fracturing during transport and surface handling leading to soil groundwater and surface water contamination the potential for accidental release of chemicals associated with these activities can be avoided and or mitigated through physical barriers best practice and spill management procedures epa sa 2016 epa nt 2019 however despite adherence to regulations and management plans literature huddlestone holmes et al 2017 pepper et al 2018 and regulatory compliance reports department for energy and mining sa 2010 2020 indicate that spills do occur impact assessment is a means of determining the relative impacts of different types of chemical spills or leaks and the relative impacts of spills occurring in various parts of the basins it potentially informs the prioritisation of additional data collection prior to approval and development previous work to predict the large scale assessment of the fate and transport of chemicals released at the soil surface include either stochastic and non spatially distributed for example consim environment agency 2006 and epacmtp us epa 1996 or gis based models with simplified approximations for the unsaturated zone groundwater flow and solute transport examples of which include those developed and applied in central new york state sinkevich jr et al 2005 and texas strassberg et al 2003 these approaches are limited to using parameters that only vary laterally and often do not account for chemical transport across a variably saturated and heterogeneous unsaturated zone that provides significant potential for chemical attenuation mallants et al 2020 kanno and mccray 2021 used contaminant fate and transport modelling to simulate the impacts of surface spills of produced water in the south platte aquifer colorado usa hydrus 1 d was used to model vertical chemical transport but only two depths to groundwater were considered 0 6 m and 3 m and one soil type sandy loam and one chemical benzene which did not account for unsaturated zones up to 100 m which were found in the case studies described in this paper and therefore ignores potential attenuation which may be orders of magnitude higher it did not consider the effects of other spills such as the chemicals used in drilling and hydraulic fracturing fluids nor dilution from lateral flow within a saturated aquifer the research indicated that ponding depth volume per surface area 0 12 m was the dominant factor in determining whether benzene contamination reached the water table above the epa maximum contamination level in this study a spatially applied causal network impact analysis was developed to assess and visualise the pathways between actions in unconventional gas development and operation processes such as drawdown chemical contamination and habitat disturbance and endpoints such as aquifer and wetland condition peeters et al 2022 the potential impacts of accidental chemical release on soils waterbodies and aquifers were quantified using a non reactive chemical screening approach mallants et al 2022a which was applied spatially across the two assessment regions this conservative non reactive approach identified where transport of chemicals through soils and aquifers was unlikely to have a material effect due to dilution doble et al 2021 and where more site specific investigations were recommended as most chemical spills associated with unconventional gas development and operations are associated with surface operations such as transport or storage us epa 2016 mallants et al 2018 the research focused on modelling surface chemical spills and did not consider subterranean accidental release of chemicals from hydraulic fracturing or compromised well integrity the aim of this study was to develop a method for quantitatively and spatially assessing the impacts of unconventional gas developments on aquifers and groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes using existing chemical transport approaches two questions were posed i if a large accidental chemical release occurred such a truck rollover based on results of a literature review for what landscape characteristics defined by soil type and depth to groundwater would the contaminants reach the water table within 10 years in sufficient concentrations to cause harm if they were not remediated within this time ii if a slower undetected chemical release occurred such as leaks from pipelines or storage tanks for what landscape characteristics defined by soil type and depth to groundwater would the ultimate chemical concentration at groundwater dependent assets such as bores and gdes wetlands springs water bodies be high enough to cause harm spatial maps were produced to indicate the attenuation of contamination in each of these cases 2 site descriptions 2 1 beetaloo sub basin the mesoproterozoic aged beetaloo sub basin orr et al 2020 is located in the northern territory between mataranka springs and elliot fig 1 the study region covers an area of 28 000 km2 is sparsely populated and consists predominantly of tropical savannah with climate ranging from tropical in the north of the region to semi arid in the south landscape classes are described mostly as loamy and sandy plains 70 and clay plains 17 with some floodplain and alluvium 6 and undulating country on fine grained sedimentary rocks 5 table 1 the beetaloo sub basin does not outcrop but is deeply buried by a cover that includes the georgina wiso and daly basins the carpentaria basin and cenozoic sediments orr et al 2020 evans et al 2020b the predominant aquifer system across the beetaloo region is the cambrian limestone aquifer cla which encompasses limestone aquifers in georgina wiso and daly basins and provides a good quality groundwater resource for the pastoral industry and communities in the region shallow perched aquifers may occur above the cla in carpentaria basin or cenozoic sediments the antrim plateau volcanics is primarily a regional leaky aquitard and localised fractured rock aquifer and where present separates the cla from underlying sequences the bukulara sandstone and the jamison sandstone aquifers evans et al 2020b huddlestone holmes et al 2020 the water table predominantly sits within the cla and to a much lesser extent in the carpentaria or antrim plateau volcanics evans et al 2020b across much of the depth to water table ranges from 14 m to over 115 m evans et al 2020b which minimises interactions with surface water features and vegetation the inferred regional groundwater flow direction from potentiometric contours is generally to the north west local scale deviations may occur as a result of geological structures and karst systems karst and sinkholes associated with the cla as well as pseudo karst in the overlying carpentaria basin have been identified particularly in the north west of the region geological and bioregional assessment program 2021d 2021c groundwater dependent assets include water bores that supply communities and the pastoral industry and springs to the north of the study area surface water within the beetaloo region is ephemeral however the cla supports perennial flow in the roper river to the north of the region fig 1 by spring discharge and baseflow to streams evans et al 2020b prospective plays in the beetaloo sub basin that are most likely to be developed include shale plays at depths between 600 m and 3000 m below surface in the kyalla and velkerri formations and a tight sandstone play in the hayfield mudstone fig 2a hall et al 2020 2 2 cooper basin the cooper basin covers an area of 130 000 km2 95 740 km2 in queensland 34 310 km2 in south australia in central australia holland et al 2020 the region has an arid climate with low rainfall and surface water predominantly flowing into the region from the north it predominantly consists of floodplain and alluvium channel country associated with braided rivers and streams across the generally flat landscape knighton and nanson 1994 between inland dunes maroulis et al 2007 water courses are highly ephemeral with boom bust water pulses shaping the ecological dynamics bunn and davies 2001 the main landscape classes are described as floodplain and alluvium 32 inland dunefields 30 and undulating country on fine grained sedimentary rocks 20 table 2 fig 3 more than 60 of the region is covered by indigenous land use agreements and the sparse population is boosted by the fly in fly out population associated with the conventional oil and gas industries in the region the cooper basin is completely buried by the eromanga and lake eyre basins lech et al 2020 the hydrogeology of the cooper region includes the cenozoic aquifer which is found in the lake eyre basin which is underlain by the winton mackunda partial aquifer in the eromanga basin fig 2b the regional rolling downs aquitard confines the underlying artesian aquifers of the great artesian basin gab including the cadna owie hooray and hutton sandstone aquifers within the in the eromanga basin evans et al 2020a holland et al 2020 whilst the majority of bores in the cooper region source groundwater from the cenozioc and winton mackunda aquifers due to the relatively shallow drill depth required the deeper cadna owie hooray and hutton sandstone aquifers often provide better and more consistent quality groundwater with artesian pressures however the depth to artesian aquifers is generally greater than 500 m the majority of water extracted from the winton mackunda aquifer is used for stock watering the depth to water table in the cooper region ranges from 7 m to over 97 m the water table is generally between 10 and 20 m below the surface in the consolidated rocks that lie under the cooper creek floodplain evans et al 2020a and the gradient is generally to the south west from queensland qld into south australia sa

and bioregional assessment program 2021 8201 f crosbie et al 2022 cendón et al 2010 groundwater dependent assets include water bores that supply communities and the pastoral industry and groundwater dependent ecosystems such as floodplain and dryland vegetation or vegetation surrounding waterholes which can use groundwater as a water source during dry periods the cooper basin has been producing

geological and bioregional assessment program 2021d 2021c additional studies in the cooper gba region included investigations of potential connections between shallow and deep aquifers geological and bioregional assessment program 2021e connection between groundwater and waterholes geological and bioregional assessment program 2021 8201 f and evapotranspiration and river transmission losses from riparian vegetation crosbie et al 2022 outputs from many of these investigations were used as input to this study previous work in the beetaloo sub basin involved a tier 1 qualitative screening environmental risk assessments for the 116 chemicals identified as being associated with drilling and hydraulic fracturing of unconventional gas developments in the cooper basin and beetaloo sub basin were also used to derive safe dilutions of chemicals associated with shale tight and deep coal gas operations and chemicals that required further assessment kirby et al 2020a 2020b direct toxicity assessments on freshwater biota using samples of flowback wastewater from two gas wells in the beetaloo sub basin were undertaken to support the tier 1 qualitative screening golding et al 2022 a spatial causal network analysis undertaken in consultation with industry regulators gas and environmental stakeholders was used to identify relevant pathways for impact and prioritise pathways for assessment peeters et al 2022 finally a quantitative assessment took into account the previous work to quantify dilution rates through advection and dispersion through the unsaturated zone and groundwater from potential spills and leaks of chemicals involved in construction and production mallants et al 2022a and in flowback wastewater mallants et al 2022b this paper amalgamates the knowledge and data from these previous studies to spatially quantify the impacts of unconventional gas developments on aquifers and groundwater dependent ecosystems to facilitate assessment of the spatial causal network peeters et al 2022 3 2 chemical screening framework a framework was derived here to screen areas of the cooper and beetaloo regions where impact was either unlikely or where i it was possible that a chemical spill at the soil surface would reach the water table and impact the unconfined aquifer and ii the spill would migrate to and impact nearby groundwater dependent assets such as bores or groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes the framework was based on the calculation of chemical dilution factors dfs i e the ratio of the predicted chemical concentration after transport through the unsaturated zone to the source chemical concentration at the location of the spill the framework was also used to inform a spatial causal network used for multi stressor risk analysis and mapping peeters et al 2022 of the likelihood in any area of the region that accidental release could have an impact on unconfined aquifers or groundwater dependent assets chemical degradation and adsorption were not accounted for in this regional analysis the lowest possible value of df is therefore 1 i e there is no dilution at all while high df values correspond to a high degree of dilution in the current calculations the source concentration is given an arbitrary value of 1 unit concentration site specific analysis where such attenuation processes were included for the beetaloo sub basin are reported by mallants et al 2022a critical dilution factors based on a qualitative assessment of chemicals used in unconventional gas production kirby et al 2020a 2020b were selected to define the conditions under which chemical spills at the surface were likely to have a material impact on contamination of aquifers and groundwater dependent assets for the beetaloo and cooper regions a dilution factor of 1000 was chosen as it ensures that solute concentrations are reduced to below their ecotoxicity thresholds or thresholds for human health toxicity a df of 1000 corresponded with 43 45 chemicals that were part of the assessment being diluted to a risk quotient rq of less than one kirby et al 2020a 2020b mallants et al 2022a 2022b the two chemicals with a rq 1 after being diluted by a factor of 1000 were hydrochloric acid rq 1 37 and tributyl tetradecylphosphonium chloride rq 6 0 hydrochloric acid is expected to dissociate in waters to hydrogen h and chloride cl ions natural attenuation processes will further reduce exposure concentration and organism effects e g buffering capability organism effects will also depend on ability to resist and or adapt to changes in salinity tributyl tetradecylphosphonium chloride is a biocide expected to be readily biodegradable 60 in 28 days and natural attenuation processes will further reduce exposure concentrations and organism effects e g adsorption complexation transformations dilution the transport of contaminants through a soil groundwater system was conceptualised into two flow components a vertical flow component through the unsaturated zone and a lateral flow component through the saturated part of the aquifer as per marín and andreo 2015 as a conservative approximation of the attenuation of chemicals from transport through soils and aquifers advection dispersion modelling without chemical degradation or adsorption was used to quantify the potential dfs between the soil surface and the groundwater and the soil surface and groundwater dependent assets the three step screening framework consisted of estimating dfs through chemical attenuation using hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2016 2013 development of empirical equations to estimate dfs based on soil and aquifer characteristics and groundwater depth and application of these equations into a 500 m x 500 m gridded landscape map based on the characteristics of each grid cell the hydrus 1d modelling was used to i estimate chemical attenuation vertically through the unsaturated zone from a spill at the surface based on unsaturated zone dilution factors dfuz ii estimate attenuation for a contaminant that has reached the water table laterally through the saturated zone due to groundwater flow dfgw and iii these dilution factors were combined into a total dilution factor dft where dft dfuz x dfgw to represent attenuation from a spill at the surface to the resulting concentration at a groundwater dependent asset up to 500 m from the spill fig 4 mallants et al 2022a using one dimensional flow modelling was justified based on the relatively flat terrain and deep water tables in these regions making lateral sub surface flows negligible mallants et al 2022a the following sections describe the development of the chemical transport models and application of the models to the screening framework 3 3 chemical modelling methods chemical modelling methods were derived to address two scenarios i an accidental release of a large volume of chemicals such as a truck rollover and a ii slow and undetected chemical release of the same volume such as leaks from pipelines or storage tanks from previous assessments a truck roll over was considered to have the highest likelihood of any incident in which fluids could be released into the environment nicnas 2017 and the volume of a three trailer road train was used as a conservative volume for analysis considering a maximum tank volume of approximately 22 000 l for each tanker total of 66 000 l the maximum volume of fluid that could be released in either scenario was conservatively set at 100 000 l 100 m3 spills over 100 m3 are the largest volume class of spill reported in south australian regulatory compliance reports department for energy and mining sa 2010 2020 dilution factors were developed for the predominant landscape types in each region assuming a 100 m3 spill volume table 3 the rate of infiltration was determined by the soil type associated with the landscape class and the depth of ponding for the beetaloo region the ponding area was set at 360 m2 based on the size of the sumps described in the beetaloo basin kyalla 117 n2 civil construction environmental management plan origin energy 2019 giving a maximum ponding depth of 28 cm the sumps are constructed with the base located three metres below the ground surface therefore chemicals in the onsite leak scenario will travel through three metres less than the thickness of the unsaturated zone the maximum infiltration depth for an offsite spill for example from a truck rollover was assumed to also be 28 cm for the cooper region the ponding area was set at 1500 m2 based on the size of the pond areas described in the santos eir santos 2015 giving a ponding depth of 6 7 cm as the ponds are above ground infiltration will occur from the land surface for both off site rapid leakage and on site sump leak cases percentiles for clay silt and sand components for each grid cell were obtained from the australian soil resource information system asris atlas of australian soils johnston et al 2003 to provide soil characteristics for each landscape class table 1 and table 2 soil hydraulic parameters were derived from usda class transfer functions from carsel and parrish 1988 and the non hysteretic form of the van genuchten 1980 water retention curve and mualem 1976 equation based on the range of soil characteristics for each landscape class mallants et al 2022a a depth to water table surface was generated for the beetaloo region using inverse distance weighted interpolation of the piezometric surface at 1040 sampled bores based on the most recent observations between 1919 and 2018 this piezometric surface was subtracted from the digital elevation model to derive an estimated depth to water table surface that captured the variations in land surface elevation interpolation of the piezometric surface was attempted for the cooper region but due to the smaller depth to groundwater and very few observation bores near any waterbodies the interpolated surface erroneously exceeded the ground surface in many areas therefore the depth to water table for the cooper region was generated by interpolating values of depth to water at 1056 water bores using the most recent observation between 1911 and 2017 inverse distance weighting was used for the interpolation and included values of depth to water at 293 waterhole centroids where groundwater was estimated to be approximately 10 m below the base of the waterhole geological and bioregional assessment program 2021 8201 f 1349 points in total a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 1 m was assumed for vertical travel distances greater than 5 m and for travel distances between 0 m and 5 m a linear increase in dispersivity from 0 to 0 1 m was assumed mallants et al 2022a although a dispersivity of 0 1 m is consistent with those used in other studies oostrom et al 2016 this low values provides a conservative estimation for regions with very limited data on dispersivity chemical attenuation through dilution and dispersion in saturated groundwater flow was based on the analytical solutions of leij et al 1991 to the three dimensional advection dispersion solute transport differential equation using the stanmod 3dade package leij and bradford 1994 the key input for this equation is the porewater velocity ν based on the darcy flux q and the effective porosity η e 1 ν q η e ki η e where k is hydraulic conductivity and i is hydraulic gradient these two parameters were estimated from spatial information as described in section 3 6 3 3 1 chemical dilution in the unsaturated zone advection dispersion modelling using hydrus 1d was used to develop solute depth profiles 10 years after a potential chemical spill occurred based on the soil profiles described in mallants et al 2022a for offsite and onsite spills for the beetaloo region fig 5 and cooper region fig 6 respectively the depth to water table required to achieve a dilution factor of 1000 was derived from these solute depth profiles for off site spill and on site leak scenarios 3 3 2 chemical dilution in groundwater flow equations to estimate dilution factors at a time where the peak concentration of a potential chemical spill reached the water table were developed as an input to overall dilution from the soil surface to a groundwater dependent asset 500 m from the location of the spill first two power functions were used to represent the soil dilution factors for each landscape class across the full depth of the unsaturated zone as derived from the solute depth profiles in mallants et al 2022a for offsite and onsite spills for the beetaloo and cooper regions these simplified models are shown in table 4 and table 5 respectively and graphically in fig 7 for the loamy and sandy plains landscape class graphs for other landscape classes can be found in the supplementary material these models were developed by tracking the movement of the peak concentration of chemical through the soil profile and relating the minimum dilution rate maximum chemical concentration to the depth below the surface for example fig 4f in mallants et al 2022a within one and the same landscape class attenuation varies with depth to the groundwater table it is also affected by sudden changes in hydraulic properties at interfaces between sediment layers for instance at approximately 20 m depth in the loamy and sandy plains class in the beetaloo region a change in soil hydraulic properties occurs transition from claystone to siltstone with a 13 fold decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity mallants et al 2022b this causes a sharp decrease in pore water velocity a compression of the solute plume and therefore a local and stepwise increase in solute concentration this in turn results in a discontinuity in the calculated dilution factor depth relationship with two separate curves extending across two different depth intervals fig 7 second empirical equations to estimate dilution factors from lateral flow through the groundwater were derived to represent the results from 3d advection dispersion modelling for a distance of 500 m from the location at which the contaminant reaches the saturated aquifer as described in mallants et al 2022a table 6 these equations were applied to the study areas based on the landscape class to estimate dilution factors spatially across the landscape the total dilution from surface spill to a groundwater dependent asset 500 m away from the spill was the product of the long term unsaturated dilution factors in table 4 and table 5 and the groundwater dilution factors in table 6 3 4 changes to chemical dilution potential from karsts and sinkholes karst features such as caverns and sinkholes or dolines affect groundwater recharge in limestone sediments in different ways where karst features are absent fig 8a diffuse recharge is the dominant mechanism of replenishing the groundwater with matrix flow responsible for the slow movement of water and solutes when karst features are expressed in the form of underground voids and caverns cavern recharge occurs where water enters the caverns via matrix flow and preferential flow fig 8b within the cavern dripping occurs causing water to travers large distances without interacting with the rock matrix bradley et al 2010 another expression of karst features in the landscape is the presence of sinkholes fig 8c sinkholes are depressions in the landscape formed from the collapse of caverns that over time fill up with regolith debris and erosion material resulting in a more permeable zone within the surrounding limestone rock delle rose et al 2004 galloway et al 1999 or may be plugged by subsequent ingression of fine silts and clays which limit infiltration deslandes et al 2019 together with accumulation of surface runoff in the depression these features can cause enhanced groundwater recharge and accelerated transport of solutes deslandes et al 2019 increasing the rate of transport or reducing the thickness of the unsaturated zone will both reduce the residence time in which dispersion and advection can occur and increase the likelihood that a chemical is not diluted to below a critical ecotoxicologically defined threshold before it reaches the groundwater where groundwater is deep relative to the depth of a karst the presence of karsts may not have a significant effect on the overall dilution karsts can also increase the groundwater velocity through bypass flow allshorn et al 2007 therefore increasing the distance required for dilution and dispersion to occur although there are numerous studies of contaminant transport through karstic aquifers ravbar and goldscheider 2007 vesper et al 2001 there are very few assessments of the potential effects of karsts and sinkholes on vertical contaminant transport through the unsaturated zone as part of the greater research project recharge in areas close to sinkholes in the northern part of the beetaloo region within the tindall limestone was estimated using the environmental tracer tritium presence of tritium was used to estimate the mass balance while detection of the tritium bomb peak was interpreted using the distance velocity method deslandes et al 2019 this was compared with the regional estimate of groundwater recharge using the chloride mass balance method crosbie and rachakonda 2021 recharge rates that reflected both conditions were used in the chemical transport modelling any available data on known karsts and sinkholes in the beetaloo region from previous research and nt government databases twidale 1987 department of environment parks and water security 2019 department of environment parks and water security 2021 was collated and assessed for size and depth of sinkholes and thickness and distance from the surface for detected karsts subterranean caverns were classified into three types where the water table was i above the top of the cavern or dissolved limestone ii within the cavern or dissolved limestone and iii below the cavern or dissolved limestone the presence of caverns is likely to alter chemical transport processes through the reduction of the thickness of unsaturated zone through which chemicals are transported dispersed and degraded where the water table is above the ceiling of a cavern no impact on the chemical transport process is likely as any chemicals will reach the water table before they reach the cavern where the water table was within the cavern the unsaturated thickness was reduced by the distance from the ceiling of the cavern to the water table where the water table was below the cavern the thickness of the unsaturated zone was reduced by the total vertical dimension of the cavern the effect of the cavern recharge conceptualisation on the solute transport and dilution factor where the cavern was above the water table fig 8b was evaluated by assuming the height of the cavern causes the effective transport distance between the soil surface and the groundwater table to decrease as a result there will be less opportunity for solutes to mix with the unsaturated zone pore waters causing a lower attenuation relative to the diffuse recharge conceptualisation fig 8a here two cases were considered a cavern height of 5 and 10 m based on the range of cavern heights from observed caverns within the beetaloo region mean 6 25 m range 1 21 m based on the derived relationships between dilution factor and depth to groundwater table 4 dilution factors for cavern recharge were calculated for the four most important landscape classes table 9 to capture the spatial variability in depth to groundwater within each of these landscape classes dilution factors were derived for the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of the depth to groundwater 3 5 spatial application based on landscape classes 3 5 1 unsaturated zone dilution factor criteria in the unsaturated zone aquifer contamination from surface chemical spills is defined as possible where the dilution factor is less than 1000 10 years after occurrence of the spill the selection of a period of 10 years is rather arbitrary although it is reasonable to assume that spills will be detected and remediated within a period of 10 years whether or not soil contamination results in aquifer contamination was defined by the depth to groundwater relative to the depth at which infiltrating chemicals are diluted 1000 times where the groundwater is deeper than the depth at which df 1000 after 10 years contamination is considered not to reach the unconfined aquifer in other words the chemical may still reach the aquifer but its concentration will be diluted to levels that are of no concern the solute transport modelling indicated that for all spill scenarios the df of 1000 after 10 years is reached at shallower depths than 10 m for all soil types included in the simulation remediation can be done by removal of soil or by in situ treatment both are feasible within the first 10 m of the soil profile us epa 2006 although there is high confidence in the calculated depth dependent dilution factor there is uncertainty in estimation of the depth to groundwater map which was derived by interpolating point scale estimates of water table depth to define the criteria for possible and potentially material impacts to aquifers that require further detailed investigation fig 9 it was assumed that the uncertainty in the spatial estimate of depth to groundwater is five metres therefore conservatively material impacts are potential represented by a numerical code of 2 where 2 dwt ddf1000 duc where dwt is depth to water table ddf1000 is depth to achieve a df of 1000 and duc is the uncertainty in water table depth contamination of aquifers from soil contamination was assumed to be possible but not requiring detailed investigation code 1 where 3 ddf1000 2duc dwt ddf1000 duc and not possible code 0 where 4 dwt ddf1000 2duc as shown in fig 9 the pathway analysis thresholds for potential possible and not possible impacts on aquifers from hypothetical spills in each of the landscape classes in the beetaloo and cooper regions are shown in table 7 and table 8 respectively this includes thresholds for offsite spills and onsite leaks from sumps 3 5 2 saturated zone dilution factor criteria to estimate lateral transport within aquifers it was assumed that the full contaminant plume reaches the groundwater after a travel time of several hundred years and that the combined dilution factor is a product of the unsaturated zone and groundwater df components the criterion for contamination was a dilution factor of less than 1000 using the combined soil and groundwater df over a lateral distance of 500 m 3 6 input data input data for the models to derive dilution factors for the study areas consisted of spatial layers of depth to water table dtwt and porewater velocity fig 10 given the dependence of chemical dilution on dtwt indicated in table 7 and table 8 it was important to select the most accurate representation of dtwt two options to estimate dtwt were explored i interpolation of the depth to water table for a topographically controlled water table or ii interpolate the piezometric surface and subtract from the land surface for a recharge controlled water table for a similar magnitude of depth to water table regional scale groundwater flow lengths and aquifer thicknesses in the cooper and beetaloo regions the main factor controlling water table distribution is the ratio of recharge r to hydraulic conductivity k haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 systems with a higher r k are more likely to have a topography controlled water table where the water table is a subdued reflection of topography systems with lower r k are more likely to have a flatter water table which is controlled by recharge the beetaloo region has higher recharge crosbie and rachakonda 2021 but the very high k of the cla and karstic nature in many areas suggests that it falls into the category of recharge controlled groundwater recharge in the cooper region is low and is mostly driven by episodic river and floodplain infiltration crosbie et al 2022 therefore this system is also likely to be controlled by recharge rather than topography this suggests that the spatialisation of the depth to water table should be generated by subtracting the interpolated piezometric surface from the topography for both regions interpolating the piezometric surface was attempted for the cooper region but the shallow water table and lack of observation wells in the riparian zones and floodplains resulted in an erroneous dtwt surface of less than zero piezometric surface above the land surface in low lying areas field observations confirmed that the water table was at least 10 m below the land surface in the lowest areas of the catchment around permanent waterholes geological and bioregional assessment program 2021 8201 f therefore the dtwt data for the cooper region was generated by directly interpolating point scale dtwt measurements from observation bores and for the beetaloo region by subtracting the interpolated piezometric surface from topography this prioritised the accuracy in the areas of the cooper region with shallower groundwater where risk to aquifers from chemical spills are more of a concern this difference can be observed in fig 10 where the beetaloo dtwt shows evidence of topographic highs and lows while the dtwt in the cooper is smoother porewater velocity was estimated for each of the regions using eq 1 fig 10 and data for hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradient and effective porosity with insufficient field estimates of porosity to derive a range for effective porosity a value of 0 1 was used based on results from a recent environmental tracer study in the beetaloo region deslandes et al 2019 hydraulic conductivity was estimated from transmissivity and saturated aquifer thickness determined from bore records and pump tests then interpolated spatially across the regions using the inverse distance weighted method hydraulic gradient was estimated from the slope of the piezometric surface for each region the lines in the porewater velocity map of the cooper region are a result of the piezometric gradient being a function of the more detailed topographic map where drainage lines have influenced the derivation of the hydraulic gradient 4 results 4 1 potential effects of karst features caverns and sinkholes information on karsts in the beetaloo region consisted of mapped collapsed sinkholes and depressions which are evident from the land surface and mapped caverns which are present below ground and detected through drilling and underground investigation department of environment parks and water security 2021a geological and bioregional assessment program 2021a geological and bioregional assessment program 2021g 2021c fig 11 dilution factors estimated for the two karst scenarios 5 m deep and 10 m deep described in section 3 4 showed that overall the reduction in the effective depth of the unsaturated zone by 5 uzd 5 m and 10 m uzd 10 m was relatively small for the landscape classes with deep unsaturated zones i e loamy and sandy plains and clay plains even for the 5th percentile values table 9 however for the floodplain and alluvium and undulating country landscape classes which both have shallower unsaturated zones especially at the 5th percentile the impact was considerable for floodplain and alluvium the uzd 5 m and uzd 10 cases resulted in only 72 and 44 of the original unsaturated zone depth remaining respectively for undulating country uzd 5 m and uzd 10 m resulted in 64 and 28 of the original depth of the unsaturated zone remaining respectively the resulting dilution factors represented 70 and 35 of the original values for floodplain and alluvium and 66 and 47 for undulating country for the 50th and 95th percentiles of the depth to groundwater the effects were much smaller therefore only a small percentage of the landscape where shallow unsaturated zones exist was likely to experience a considerably smaller dilution these areas are well known and where they overlap with the karst features additional management and mitigation measures are recommended in the beetaloo region the smallest depth to the top of the known subterranean cavern was 18 3 m two out of the 125 identified caverns had a depth to ceiling of less than 19 3 m and none of the caverns were within the critical 9 3 m df1000 depth therefore in this assessment area any chemical being transported through the unsaturated zone is likely to be diluted more than 1000 times before reaching a cavern there is a much lower uncertainty in estimating depth to groundwater measured at point scale where caverns have been detected through drilling compared with an interpolated water table therefore the 9 3 m df1000 criterion was used for this assessment it is possible that caverns with smaller depths to ceiling do exist but have not yet been detected therefore there is a need for caution and additional assessment for the presence of undetected caverns through drilling or geophysics prior to any civil construction work localised recharge via sinkholes was estimated by deslandes et al 2019 to be between 66 mm yr and 140 mm yr using the integration of tritium signals mass balance method and 190 mm y using the tritium bomb peak distance velocity method in comparison regional diffuse groundwater recharge was estimated to be between 1 and 25 mm y using chloride mass balances crosbie and rachakonda 2021 contaminant transport through sinkholes was modelled with an increased recharge of 190 mm yr with no significant effect on the resulting df1000 given the relatively deep water table in the study area section 4 the reduction in thickness of unsaturated zone due to the presence of a sinkhole did not affect the df1000 outcomes one of the distinct differences between a cavern and sinkhole is the relatively poor detectability of the former compared to the latter indeed sinkholes in the sturt plateau northern part of the beetaloo sub basin are readily spotted in the landscape with most of them having an elliptical geometry of 40 50 m in diameter one west of mataranka springs approaches 100 m diameter but this is exceptional and 15 m deep and partially infilled twidale 1987 as a result sinkholes can be easily avoided when selecting sites for developing gas wells and the enabling infrastructure caverns on the other hand are not visible from the surface and require geophysical investigation tools for their detection hussain et al 2020 further analysis of the potential impact of caverns on solute transport is therefore more useful than an analysis of sinkholes 4 2 impacts of potential chemical spills on aquifers using the criteria for possible and potentially material risk to aquifers from accidental chemical release at the land surface in fig 9 where the depth to groundwater is greater than ddf1000 plus an uncertainty factor to account for errors in water table measurement and interpolation areas where aquifer contamination was possible or where more detailed investigation was required could be mapped across the study areas in the beetaloo region the susceptibility to aquifer contamination up to 10 years after a potential spill was limited to two small areas in the north of the region due to the smaller estimated depth to groundwater in those locations fig 12a where 0 3 of the basin was assessed as being possibly susceptible to groundwater contamination and 0 15 of the basin requiring detailed investigation in the cooper basin the areas of possible and potentially material aquifer contamination were more widespread predominantly occurring in the south western parts of the study area and a low lying central region fig 12a here 14 of the basin was assessed as having possible susceptibility to groundwater contamination based on eq 3 figs 9 and 2 5 of the basin requiring detailed investigation based on eq 2 fig 9 4 3 impacts of potential chemical spills on groundwater dependent assets dilution factors due to vertical flow through the unsaturated zone fig 13a and lateral flow through the aquifer fig 14 were estimated for the beetaloo and cooper regions using the equations in tables 2 3 and 4 these results describe the potential long term impacts on groundwater dependent assets due to the peak concentration of a chemical from a slow leak that reaches the water table and is transported laterally through groundwater flow the unsaturated zone dilution factor was found to be controlled by the thickness of the unsaturated zone depth to water table soil properties clay silt and sand percentages and in the longer term recharge rates discrete areas towards the south of the beetaloo region had dilution factors greater than 1000 from unsaturated flow processes alone mostly associated with the heavier soil types clay plains and floodplains and alluvium fig 13a the cooper region also had higher dilution factors associated with heavier clay plains and floodplain and alluvium soils but in no area was the unsaturated zone dilution factor greater than 1000 due to the shallower groundwater in this region fig 13b the groundwater dilution factor from lateral flow was governed by the porewater velocity in the aquifer the groundwater hydraulic gradient and the effective porosity while the regional water table gradient in the beetaloo was low the high aquifer transmissivity resulted in a higher porewater velocity and therefore low dilution of chemicals over a distance of 500 m from the point at which the chemical spill reached the water table fig 14a in comparison the relatively low water table gradient and lower hydraulic conductivity in the cooper region produced lower porewater velocity and higher groundwater dilution factors due to the longer residence time over a distance of 500 m fig 14b multiplying the dilution factors for vertical flow and horizontal flow the combined dilution factor for offsite spills was shown spatially across the two study areas fig 15a and b the long term dilution factor was estimated to be less than 1000 in much of the north western areas of the beetaloo region fig 15a a total of 18 of the sub basin area due to the lower depth to water table and higher porewater velocity in that area combined with the higher density of known karsts and sinkholes in this area fig 11 these results highlight that this is a priority area for further investigation for additional baseline data in the northern territory s strategic regional environmental and baseline assessment sreba northern territory government 2020 and in requirements for site scale testing of hydrogeological characteristics to inform the location of civil works such as chemical storage facilities wastewater storage tanks and pipelines there were also several areas in the north of the region where the input data used to estimate porewater velocity was outside of a reasonably expected range due to pinching of aquifers at the edge of the region or lack of data in the interpolation process further assessment is also required in these areas to assess the potential impacts from chemical spills and leaks in contrast there were only two very small isolated locations within the cooper basin 0 1 of the total basin area where the combined dilution was estimated to be less than 1000 fig 15b although the shallow groundwater in the cooper region resulted in none of the region with an unsaturated dilution factor dfuz of 1000 or more indicating the potential for impacts from chemical leaks on the cenozoic and winton mackunda aquifers the lower porewater velocity and greater period of time for advection and diffusion during lateral flow over 500 m meant that it was unlikely that groundwater assets would be impacted by chemical leaks if infrastructure such as storage tanks or pipelines were restricted to more than 500 m from any known groundwater dependent assets 5 discussion the current analysis was part of a larger project that evaluated the potential impacts of australian shale tight and deep gas developments on water and the environment through multiple pathways holland et al 2021 huddlestone holmes et al 2021 this component of the project considered the chemical impacts from potential surface spills of stored and transported chemicals drilling fluids and flowback water a screening process was developed applying existing conservative realistic chemical transport approaches in the unsaturated zone and groundwater and spatial data sets to identify areas of the regions that are unlikely to have any impact and those that require more detailed assessment prior to development or should be avoided during civil construction this screening process relied on best available information and assumptions it is an extension of the work by mallants et al 2022a by spatially applying the work based on regional data sets and explicitly considering clean up of contaminated sites within a 10 year period and a dilution threshold i e df 1000 reached within that period beyond which chemicals are no longer of concern or conversely if the df 1000 has not been reached two outcomes were defined where contamination is likely and exclusion prevention or mitigation works may be required and where there is a need for further site investigations to better estimate the potential for contamination chemical transport from spills involves several interacting complex processes that are highly dependent on study site characteristics and fine scale heterogeneities that are not identified in regional scale data sets for this reason we have maintained a conservative approach the spill scenarios are realistic conservative and based on information from environmental impact statements and industry plans the solute transport modelling assumes no chemical degradation or radioactive decay in case of naturally occurring radionuclides retardation by adsorption reactive transport modelling has been shown to produce considerably larger attenuation dilution factors for site specific studies in the beetaloo sub basin mallants et al 2022b similarly transport through fissures in fractured rock and faults were not analysed in this framework mallants et al 2018 provides a more detailed analysis of the role of faults and fractures in transport of chemicals found in coal seam gas operations including from surface spills and additional information is found in underschultz et al 2018 and turnadge et al 2018 while were no known areas within the beetaloo or cooper regions that were characterised by fractured rock near the surface faults do occur within the regions any areas known to have higher occurrences of karsts and sinkholes are likely to also contain dissolution conduits and should be prioritised for more detailed assessment it was assumed that a dilution factor of 1000 is sufficient to reduce concentrations of chemicals of concern below their threshold toxicity values or detection limits based on kirby et al 2020a kirby et al 2020b and that the dilution factor of 1000 provides sufficient margins of safety to account for daughter compounds that may be more toxic than the solute itself the analysis was based on a ten year period being sufficient to detect and commence remediation of a spill the scenario for solute transport within groundwater was conservatively based on the assumption that for a slow leak soil and unsaturated zone would not be remediated until the peak concentration had reached the water table assumptions about hydraulic properties included that the interpolated water table and derived hydraulic parameters hydraulic gradient k and effective porosity were an adequate regional representation of reality and the soil hydraulic properties derived from the asris database are suitable for regional scale solute transport modelling it was assumed that the cenozoic and winton mackunda aquifers are hydraulically connected a conservative estimate of dispersivity was used for the analysis the screening process demonstrated different chemical transport behaviours in each region for off site chemical spills that are assumed to have been detected and remediated within 10 years the beetaloo region had a lower risk of chemicals reaching the water table through the unsaturated zone fig 12a as the depth to water table was greater than 19 m across most of the catchment more than the required depth for the spilled chemical to be diluted to less than 1 1000 of its original concentration ddf1000 mallants et al 2022a in contrast the cooper had larger areas within the region that were susceptible to potential off site chemical spills related to the water table being less than 14 m deep in many areas of the region potential errors in estimating depth to water table include errors in the measurement of the standing height of water in a bore and converting this to a depth to water these may result from issues with the well construction density contrasts in the groundwater human induced errors in reading and recording measurements or equipment failure for example post and von asmuth 2013 rau et al 2019 further uncertainty exists in the interpolation of this data whereby challenges exist in incorporating water level data from bores with other conceptual information known to inform depth to water e g peeters et al 2010 uncertainty in estimating the water table depth duc was included in the assessment of potential impacts of spills on aquifers but further quantification of the magnitude of error associated with water table estimation especially in data poor areas is required the regional maps of porewater velocity and hydraulic gradient were another source of uncertainty and potential error for the modelling the relative importance of the spatial accuracy of the various hydraulic parameters used in this assessment transmissivity aquifer thickness effective porosity hydraulic gradient and depth to water table is a knowledge gap assessment of their data worth would help with prioritisation of future acquisition of point scale data or improving methods of spatialising these into regional maps through other data sources such as geophysical techniques the long term impact of on site spills that are not detected and remediated before the peak concentration has reached the water table and is transported laterally towards groundwater assets also had different outcomes for each region the beetaloo region again showed higher rates of chemical dilution in the unsaturated zone due to the deeper water table however higher transmissivity in the cla meant that even with low local piezometric gradients lateral chemical dilution rates were low and large areas of the north western part of the region had an estimated dilution factor of less than 1000 indicating that more detailed investigation is required prior to development the potential presence of karsts or dissolution conduits in the cla are likely to lead to bypass flow medici and west 2021 allshorn et al 2007 and therefore any dilution laterally through the aquifer may be overestimated the conservative overarching assessment of this study was therefore that impact on groundwater dependent assets from contamination due to long term on site leaks is possible in all areas of the beetaloo region it highlighted the importance of efforts to improve estimates of hydrogeologic parameters e g through pump tests and detect karsts and caverns e g through geophysics or test drilling before any construction occurs conversely the cooper region was found to have a higher susceptibility to aquifer contamination from long term on site leaks due to the smaller depth to groundwater but where the peak concentration of chemicals reached the water table it is likely to be diluted through advection and dispersion through lateral groundwater flow as the chemical modelling used a 500 m flow distance for lateral contaminant transport it is assumed that a 500 m buffer around any groundwater dependent assets that excludes any civil construction is likely to prevent impacts on the assets the independent scientific inquiry into hydraulic fracturing in the northern territory pepper et al 2018 recommends that no onshore shale gas water extraction bore field should be located within 1 km of groundwater users unless additional information indicates that a different buffer zone is appropriate or make good arrangements can be negotiated with groundwater users to ensure maintenance of water supply the difference in outcomes for the beetaloo region for off site spills and on site leaks is dependent on the assumption that chemical spills are detected and remediated within 10 years the dilution factors estimated for the arrival of the peak concentration fig 13 were smaller than those derived for a time of 10 years after the spill occurs fig 12 as the longer time period in which advection and dilution could occur was offset by the higher mass of chemical that had reached the water table in this time mitigation measures to detect spills and leaks in the beetaloo region are therefore critical in the cooper region the most likely potential impact is contamination of aquifers due to off site chemical spills data acquisition to improve estimates and interpolation of the water table particularly in low lying areas such as river floodplains and near the western edge of the region will improve the confidence in estimates of risk of impact avoidance of any civil construction roads well pads pipelines in areas where the water table is less than 14 m deep will also minimise the risk of aquifer contamination the strength of the chemical screening approach described in this study lies in its ability to combine both stochastic chemical modelling of more complex soil profiles and groundwater depths with a spatially distributed framework the approach was spatially distributed unlike those described by the environment agency 2006 and us epa 1996 and used more complex soil and saturation profiles than the gis based approaches described by strassberg et al 2003 and sinkevich jr et al 2005 while kanno and mccray 2021 used chemical transport modelling in a spatially distributed framework only two relatively shallow depths to groundwater were considered one soil type and one chemical the framework described in this paper can account for large ranges in depth to groundwater 4 or 5 different heterogeneous soil profiles per catchment and 45 different chemicals and could be used for other potential csg developments within australia with relatively small updates in soil and groundwater information 6 conclusion the screening process provided a systematic method for spatially and quantitatively applying ecotoxicology and chemical modelling knowledge across multiple regions transparency and repeatability were emphasised so that new data and knowledge could be used to update the impact assessment as it became available to reduce output uncertainty the screening process was dependent on a number of assumptions as discussed in detail above it was based on knowledge of the chemicals currently used in production and hydrocarbons found in flowback water in the cooper and beetaloo basins metrics for the level of chemical dilution required to produce no impact will need to be adjusted for other regions depending on local hydrogeological production and construction conditions the screening process is being used to inform impact assessments in gas basins in australia holland et al 2021 huddlestone holmes et al 2021 and knowledge gaps identified have been used in the development of the strategic regional environmental and baseline assessment sreba in the northern territory northern territory government 2020 the screening process also provided insights about the two regions and their corresponding vulnerabilities the deeper water table in the beetaloo region is likely to delay the arrival of any chemical spills to the groundwater and reduce the concentration of contaminant during vertical transport within the first 10 years of a spill of more concern in this region is whether undetected leaks that reach the water table in high enough concentrations will be rapidly transported laterally through the high conductivity aquifer and or associated karst system leading to long term impacts on groundwater dependent assets such as water bores and springs better characterisation of the cambrian limestone aquifer hydraulic parameters at both local and regional scales including the preferential flow effects of caverns sinkholes and dissolution conduits is required to improve confidence in the impact assessment the shallower water table in the cooper region makes the unconfined cenozoic and winton mackunda aquifers more vulnerable in the short term to potential chemical spills that are not detected and remediated within 10 years the low porewater velocity related to relatively low hydraulic gradient and aquifer transmissivity infers that groundwater dependent assets in the cooper region are more resilient to long term impacts from undetected chemical leaks confidence in the assessment could be improved and the uncertainty in the assessment reduced by better local scale mapping of the water table in low lying parts of the region this may require additional depth measurements from new observation bores inferred water tables from geophysics or other data sources and improvements in the methods for interpolation between the relatively scarce data points in the region in both regions the assessment highlighted the ongoing need for stringent spill avoidance and management practices in the development and processing of gas resources in australia and robust mitigation and remediation plans that can be quickly activated if a spill should occur credit authorship

7761,study region uruguay south america study focus riparian ecosystems accumulate the impacts of land use change from extensively used grasslands to industrial cash crops in their watersheds and transport a proportion of pollution downstream we modelled and assessed land use changes within different zones along uruguayan freshwater ecosystems and estimated the potential risks of phosphorus and glyphosate runoff based on different land use scenarios new hydrological insights for the region under study we found that ongoing intensification of grasslands as well as the conversion to cropland and timber plantations exerted high pressure on aquatic ecosystems phosphorus runoff is expected to increase by more than 40 and glyphosate runoff by 500 excluding intensified land use within the first 100 m of streams can reduce pollutant discharge by 20 we propose an expansion of pollution monitoring from large to small streams results from modelling can contribute to decision making and to raising awareness among stakeholders involved in land management and planning graphical abstract ga1 keywords campos eutrophication ecotoxicology fertilizer land cover landscape ecology non point source pollution nutrient delivery ratio retention pesticides temperate grassland uruguay data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pristine riparian ecosystems along many rivers around the world are being converted to crops silviculture or rangeland variation of watercourses by channelization and urban development with corresponding degradation of the remaining habitat functions flow regulation and flood plain clearing opperman et al 2017 thus today s riparia naiman et al 2005 are open co constructed socio ecological systems at the crossroads of the biosphere hydrosphere lithosphere atmosphere and anthroposphere dufour et al 2019 to sum up a highly contested part of our rural landscapes due to its conservation value for biodiversity and because it is an area that provides freshwater for productive activities at rural sites the pressure of land use change on aquatic ecosystems is related to non point source pollution by agrochemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides and by organic waste from livestock and overall sediment erosion stafford et al 1996 ongley et al 2010 chalar et al 2017 doehring et al 2020 in addition to the well researched and challenging macro pollutants nitrogen or phosphorus there are also thousands of synthetic trace contaminants in aquatic ecosystems schwarzenbach et al 2010 mateo sagasta et al 2017 while the multibillion dollar agrochemical industry produces more than five million tons of pesticides per year and continues to develop new commercial products with different active chemical ingredients schwarzenbach et al 2006 a standardized monitoring of the effects on local ecosystems and human health using in situ studies is lacking schwarzenbach et al 2006 schreinemachers and tipraqsa 2012 mateo sagasta et al 2017 the temperate grasslands of the southern cone along with their rivers and streams are experiencing dramatic land use change from traditionally extensive uses to intensive livestock cash crops timber or pulp production predominately for the global market alvarez et al 2015 the productive sector of uruguay often discusses the low productivity of uruguayan grasslands as a driver of land conversion modernel et al 2016 and proposes new strategies to intensify production to conserve grasslands jaurena et al 2021 whereas others call for the recognition of the values of old growth grasslands veldman et al 2015 however the resulting impacts of this land use change and further intensification of local ecosystems remain largely unknown while some studies have explored the effects on terrestrial ecosystems such as riparian forests ramírez and säumel 2022 or grasslands e g jaurena et al 2016 pañella et al 2020 only a few have been published in uruguay on water balance reichert et al 2017 water pollution and eutrophication chalar et al 2017 eguren et al 2018 gonçalves et al 2020 gorgoglione et al 2020 beretta blanco and carrasco letelier 2021 these topics hotly debated in the uruguayan press and across different sectors e g alonso et al 2019 are attracting increasing awareness among local stakeholders as are the constitutional right to water moshman 2005 taks 2008 and the antagonistically functioning new irrigation law santos 2020 here for the first time we examine the dimensions of land use change in the surroundings of aquatic ecosystems at a distance of up to 1 km from uruguay s fresh waters as uruguay is among the upper middle income countries that has experienced double digit growth in the intensity of pesticide use during the last decade mateo sagasta et al 2017 and because it has limited infrastructure to track the effects of pesticides a precautionary approach is necessary schwarzenbach et al 2006 in addition the state of the art of monitoring and regulations has led to a compartmentalization of risks which ultimately underestimates the transversal actual hazards that chemicals catalyze in waterways for humans and other organisms see discussion in hendlin et al 2020 to narrow this gap we focus on glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine and its derivates which comprise the most widely used herbicide group in the world duke and powles 2008 benbrook 2016 sabzevari and hofman 2022 and has multiple consequences for soils and aquatic ecosystems gomes de carvalho marques et al 2021 and on phosphorus a fertilizer that is an important contributor to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems elser et al 2007 in addition to a wide variety of measures to reduce erosion and the use of potential pollutants in agriculture and forestry mcdowell et al 2018 the implementation and management of buffer zones is a common low cost approach to trap eliminate or transform pollutants flowing from terrestrial into aquatic ecosystems reddy et al 1999 viaud et al 2004 collins et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 stutter et al 2012 beyond this buffer zones can provide multiple benefits for riparian restoration such as enhancing hydro morphological and thermal conditions and overall functioning and are no regret management options mander et al 2017 feld et al 2018 however the provision of habitat services is powerfully shaped by buffer management hille et al 2018 zak et al 2019 and human activities in the adjacent zones luke et al 2019 furthermore cost calculations in rural europe have demonstrated that the implementation of buffer zones on a larger scale is mainly a question of setting policy priorities rather than a financial impossibility jabłońska et al 2020 however for uruguay the legislation law no 14 859 of the water code does not explicitly indicate buffer zones for biodiversity conservation and to amortize the effects of economic activities near watercourses we aim to answer the following research questions i to what extent are different surrounding zones along aquatic ecosystems affected by land use changes ii what are the potential phosphorus and glyphosate run offs assuming different land use scenarios and iii what trade offs are typically possible between economic exploitation and the environmental impacts when establishing riparian buffer zones to our knowledge this is the first study to estimate glyphosate and phosphorus runoffs related to land use change along uruguayan fresh waters we assess different land use scenarios i e status quo or business as usual assuming continuation of the current management strategies management of grassland intensification based on application of agrochemicals jaurena et al 2021 and the grassland conservation strategy with extensive use veldman et al 2015 2 methods 2 1 study area delimitation we focus on areas around uruguayan watercourses up to a distance of 1 km from their aquatic ecosystems to identify the areas of aquatic ecosystems we used geospatial information from the uruguayan government mvotma 2015 to delimit the study area referred to henceforth as surrounding areas we combined geospatial information on the hydrological network and surface water we created two types of surrounding area i from the border of the aquatic ecosystems to the surroundings using four different distances 0 0 1 0 0 25 0 0 5 and 0 1 km and ii by contour or section 0 0 1 0 0 25 0 25 0 5 and 0 5 1 km the different distances of the sections were selected because we are interested in exploring whether the change processes are unique to any one section or whether there is a general pattern of land use change thus in total we covered 120 800 km2 which represents 68 of the terrestrial area of uruguay and 12 of the temperate grasslands of south america 2 2 study area context uruguay is located in south america between latitudes 30 and 35 south and longitudes 53 and 58 west it has a temperate climate without dry seasons or hot summers peel et al 2007 the average annual temperature is 17 6 c and annual total precipitation is 1221 mm fick and hijmans 2017 uruguayan aquatic ecosystems have been largely modified by anthropogenic activities such as regulation by the building of numerous large dams and have an eutrophic to hypereutrophic water status see status report by alonso et al 2019 fig 1a d for land use changes currently 791 plant protection products have been approved and over 1500 have been registered for use in uruguay 264 of which are classified as prioritized pesticide products ma 2020 between 2015 and 2020 more than 85 kilotons of pesticides were imported into uruguay oan 2020 the top three were glyphosate 54 kilotons 2 4 d 8 kilotons and metalochlor 2 kilotons nearly 5 megatons of fertilizer were imported 1 3 megatons of which were phosphorus based i e mono or diammonium phosphate or triple superphosphate oan 2020 in 2019 phosphorus containing fertilizer valued at u s81 million was imported into uruguay as systematic monitoring of use is lacking no insights into the fate of these agrochemicals are available beyond these general data 2 3 reclassification of land use cover as the original classification was based on landsat images with a resolution of 30 30 m the land use maps in vector format for the years 2000 alvarez et al 2015 and 2015 mvotma 2015 were converted to raster with a resolution of 30 30 m pixels we assessed land use change for both types of surrounding area for the years 2000 and 2015 we aggregated and reclassified original land use cover maps from 17 to 10 land use cover types i native forests ii shrublands iii semi natural grasslands including those with dispersed palm stands iv highly modified grasslands including artificial and improved grasslands v bare soils including quarries stand pits and open pit mines vi urban areas vii timber plantations viii orchards ix crops and x aquatic ecosystems including artificial waters natural waters and flooded natural areas appendix 1 table s1 modified grassland cover was extracted from the work of petraglia et al 2019 and incorporated into the land use cover maps of 2000 and 2015 this incorporation consisted of the reclassification of pixels belonging to original land use cover maps to the pixels from the work of petraglia et al 2019 classified as i highly modified natural pastures introduced pastures and old stubbles and ii areas including forage crops sown grasslands field and stubble with a high temporal variation and generally associated with raising dairy cattle we only reclassified original pixels as modified grassland when the intersection occurred with cropland and timber plantation land uses appendix 1 fig s1 as the raster from the work of petraglia et al 2019 has a resolution of 10 m the reclassification allowed identification of so called improved pastures i e fertilized and or with a high proportion of legumes introduced to increase farm productivity berretta et al 2000 originally classified as crops in the 2000 and 2015 land use cover maps we were also able to identify grassland patches inside cropland and timber plantations which have been highly modified due to the pressure of anthropic activities in their surroundings appendix 1 fig s1 additionally because there is no reported determination of the accuracy of the classification for land use cover maps 2000 and 2015 from uruguayan institutions we created a confusion matrix from 569 points over the land use map for the year 2015 thus we estimated an overall accuracy of 66 appendix 1 table s2 the processing of geospatial information was carried out in qgis v3 10 11 a qgis development team 2020 2 4 transport of phosphorus and glyphosate we used the nutrient delivery ratio ndr model sharp et al 2020 to calculate the surface transport of phosphorus and glyphosate from different terrestrial land use types to the watercourses using integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs invest software sharp et al 2020 we modelled phosphorus and glyphosate discharge using the land use maps of the surrounding areas for the years 2000 and 2015 with a width of 1 km from the aquatic ecosystem fig 1a d and fig 2 the ndr model requires data for agrochemical load per hectare and the efficiency of retention expected from a given land use type sharp et al 2020 these calibration parameters were based on a literature review which is listed in the appendices see table 1 and appendices s1 s3 the ndr model estimates the movement of chemical compounds across land based on mass balance sharp et al 2020 the model considers that the movement and retention efficiency of chemicals across the landscape depend on land use topography and runoff sharp et al 2020 appendix 2 table s1 the topographic data were based on the digital elevation model dem of uruguay and the runoff data were based on quickflow calculated from the seasonal water yield swy model of the invest model sharp et al 2020 see appendix 2 quickflow represents the potential runoff considering soil types and land cover properties that influence the balance between infiltration of rain and the runoff across the surface landscape sharp et al 2020 we used quickflow from swy because it considers the hydrological characteristics of the soils land use cover precipitation rain events evapotranspiration topography and the crop vegetation coefficient for the calculation sharp et al 2020 all values geospatial information and specific references are listed in appendices s1 s2 and s3 in this study we evaluated the transport of chemicals across land surfaces and omitted subsurface transport the surface nutrient delivery ratio ndrsurf per pixel is given by ndr surf ndr 0 i 1 exp ic 0 ic i k 1 where ic0 and k are calibration parameters ici is a topographic index calculated from the dem ndr0 i is the proportion of the agrochemical that is not retained by downslope pixels thus the total export for all study areas is given by x expi load surf i ndr surf i x exp tot i x expi where xexpi is the nutrient export from each pixel to the aquatic ecosystem and xexp tot is the total nutrient exported for all study areas the ndr makes the following four assumptions i application of an agrochemical is uniform depending on land use only the amount applied varies ii the method of application is directly proportional to groundcover iii the model does not consider the effects of spray drift or subsurface movement of agrochemicals and iv the point sources are not considered 2 5 model validation the absence of independent in situ data that would allow us to link the load of agrochemicals at a certain land use with the respective surface runoff makes the validation of a classical operational model i e measured versus modelled data impossible however our results are of heuristic value oreskes et al 1994 eker et al 2018 we know comparatively little about the quantities and frequencies of agrochemical application on the different land uses and their fate in the landscape thus we explored and tested the model using visualization techniques evaluating the extreme condition test rykiel 1996 and sensitivity of the model in five randomly selected sub watersheds appendix 3 fig s1 that represent different gradients of quickflow topographic features appendix 3 fig s2 and land use dominances that have been identified for uruguay ramírez and säumel 2022 appendix 3 table s1 i e dominance of grassland dominance of timber plantations with grassland dominance of crops with modified and natural grasslands a mixture of crops and modified and natural grasslands or a mixture of grassland and timber plantations we ran the models for each sub watershed with different loads of phosphorus and glyphosate ranging from no agrochemical load 0 to doubling the input 200 compared with current use thus we evaluated the performance of the model based on our knowledge oreskes et al 1994 rykiel 1996 eker et al 2018 the results and visualization are given in appendix 3 fig s3 s13 we observed that the ndr model was sensitive to loads of agrochemicals and geophysical features of each sub watershed appendix 3 fig s3 s13 in general the model was sensitive to modification of parameters geophysical context climate and topography and variations of land use the visualization of the output maps revealed that the model follows the generalizations of the transport of pollutants and fits the process we want to evaluate i e the modification of agrochemical loads and export due to land use change based on different scenarios additionally to evaluate the model we only found four water monitoring stations that meet the conditions to compare with our model appendix 3 table s2 and s3 the observed data from the water monitoring stations report values in u l the data simulated by the ndr model report values in kg and also report the areas of the sub watershed then we could calculate values in kg ha therefore we transformed the observed data using the average annual flow of the reported gauged catchments in l s km2 dinagua 2012 thus we calculated kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and root mean square error rmse we evaluated the above by standardizing between 0 and 1 and unstandardized the data we found that for glyphosate and phosphorous the unstandardized kge and nse data were negative appendix 3 table s3 in contrast for the standardized data kge and nse were positive for glyphosate kge 0 47 and nse 0 03 and negative for phosphorus kge 0 86 and nse 2 96 appendix 3 table s3 for standardized data of rmse we found that glyphosate was close to zero rmse 0 01 and for phosphorus it was greater than 1 rmse 1 22 so for the standardized data the rmse for glyphosate rmse 0 38 and phosphorus rmse 0 72 were between 0 and 1 appendix 3 table s3 2 6 different management and land use scenarios we analysed six different scenarios of phosphorus and glyphosate run off from terrestrial surface to aquatic ecosystems depending on the land use allocation and management of application of agrochemicals in the surrounding areas along the uruguayan freshwater ecosystems table 2 the scenarios comprise i the status quo sq scenario where agrochemicals are applied to modified grasslands timber plantations and crops as currently established ii the status quo with buffer sqb scenario where agrochemicals are applied to modified grasslands timber plantations and crops as currently established but within a 100 m buffer around fresh waters productive land uses were transformed to natural grassland without application of agrochemicals iii the grassland intensification gi scenario in which agrochemicals are applied on all natural and modified grasslands jaurena et al 2021 timber plantations and crops iv the grassland intensification with buffer gib scenario in which agrochemicals are applied on all grasslands timber plantations and crops but within a 100 m buffer around aquatic ecosystems productive land uses were transformed to natural grassland without application of agrochemicals v the grasslands conservation gc scenario in which all grasslands are managed without application of agrochemicals veldman et al 2015 and agrochemicals are only applied on timber plantations and crops as currently established and vi the grasslands conservation with buffer gcb scenario in which all grasslands are managed without application of agrochemicals which are used only on timber plantations and crops as currently established but within a 100 m buffer around aquatic ecosystems productive land uses were transformed to natural grassland without application of agrochemicals e g in appendix s4 fig s1 2 7 data analysis considering the totality of the patches we characterized land use change pattern by calculating area mean area standard deviation of the mean and number of patches per land use cover for the different buffer zones using fragstat v 4 2 mcgarigal et al 2012 we calculated the net change of land use for both buffer types between 2000 and 2015 in square kilometres and percentages for area mean area and number of patches for the percentage of net change we considered land use in the year 2000 as being equal to 100 we also ran an intensity analysis using the openland package exavier and zeilhofer 2021 in r r core team 2016 to evaluate the change from a pixel belonging to specific land use cover to other land use cover as well as to detect situations of no change between 2000 and 2015 in order to explore the net change of the discharge of phosphorus and glyphosate from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems we focused on relative rather than absolute values we calculated the temporal net change between 2000 and 2015 exploring what the trajectory of change would have been if the different scenarios had begun in the year 2000 as the sq scenario most closely reflects the current land use mode we used it as a baseline to calculate the net change between scenarios we therefore averaged the export of each agrochemical between 2000 and 2015 according to each scenario finally to identify geographic risk areas we visually explored the raster maps generated in the analysis of land use change and the outputs of phosphorus and glyphosate the visualization was generated by calculating the export of agrochemical per hectare and by sub watershed to compare between scenarios we created a legend with five ranges of agrochemical export using the method of natural break jenks in quantum geographic information system v 3 16 3 hannover qgis development team 2020 the sq map legend was taken as a reference and extrapolated to the remaining scenarios we also estimated costs of indemnification for the land owner if buffer areas were taken out of use by using costs per hectare based on the coneat index mgap 2022 cutiño 2015 lanzilotta and rosas 2019 which remains an important source for today s land taxation and management plans under the legal conservation regulations lanfranco and sapriza 2011 based on a detailed classification which considers soil type texture natural vegetation altitude and geology 3 results 3 1 land use change adjacent to fresh waters across all land uses the mean

covered by timber plantations increased by over 80 in the first 100 m of the surrounding areas and for all other areas the increase ranged between 36 and 61 compared with 2000 appendix s5 tables s1 s2 the number of patches of orchard aquatic ecosystems native forests and bare soils increased slightly appendix s5 tables s1 s2 the number of patches covered by shrublands decreased slightly 2 in most of the surroundings of freshwater ecosystems appendix s5 tables s1 s2 3 2 phosphorus and glyphosate runoff to watercourses the calculated runoff of phosphorus to the aquatic ecosystems in the currently established land use and management mode increased between 2000 and 2015 by 30 and that for glyphosate by 80 sq scenario in table 4 runoff of phosphorus and glyphosate changed according to different land use scenarios tables 4 5 figs 4 and 5 ranging between 406 tons of phosphorus and 78 tons of glyphosate per year gcb scenario to 805 tons of phosphorus and 922 tons of glyphosate per year gi scenario table 5 setting the sq scenario as baseline our scenarios showed that the exclusion of highly productive land uses from a buffer zone of 100 m around rivers and streams can reduce the runoff of phosphorus and glyphosate into fresh waters by 25 and 19 respectively table 5 sqb versus sq scenario considering only crops and timber plantations but not modified grasslands as fertilized and treated with glyphosate gc scenario export of phosphorus to aquatic ecosystems is reduced by 4 and glyphosate runoff to aquatic ecosystems is reduced to a third of that with the sq scenario table 5 finally excluding any application of fertilizer or glyphosate within 100 m of rivers and streams can reduce the export of phosphorus into aquatic ecosystems by 29 and export of glyphosate by 46 table 5 gcb versus sq scenario following the gi scenario would increase the input of phosphorus by over 40 and the runoff of glyphosate into the aquatic ecosystem by more than 500 table 5 gi versus sq scenario the establishment of a strict buffer zone of 100 m along aquatic ecosystems reduces the export of phosphorus by a third compared with the gi scenario and would result in an increase of 18 compared with the current land use mode gib versus sq scenario in table 5 the runoff of glyphosate would not change if the buffer zone were implemented gib versus gi scenario in table 5 3 3 costs of exclusion of high load uses from buffer zones the 100 m buffer zone from the aquatic ecosystems covers an area of 2167 km2 which is currently covered by 1510 km2 of modified grasslands 26 km2 of crops and 632 km2 of timber plantations appendix s5 table s1 we calculated the mean and median land prices per department table 6 according to figures from the uruguayan planning and tax office lanzilotta and rosas 2019 and the maximal prices assuming best land quality depending on the main productive categories i e agricultural livestock field with coneat index 100 u s2700 ha good agricultural field with coneat index 150 u s4050 ha and a forestry area with coneat index 50 u s1350 ha see e g cutiño 2015 thus the nationalization of these areas would cost u s775 million equivalent to less than 1 4 of the uruguayan bip for the year 2020 renting the buffer zones for 10 years would cost us 34 million less than 0 06 of the uruguayan bip for the year 2020 the establishment of buffer zones could also be a stepwise process starting with highly polluted parts of the uruguayan watercourses such as the santa lucía catchment which provides drinking water for more than 60 of the uruguayan population alonso et al 2021 the nationalization of these areas of the canelones san josé and florida departments would cost u s227 million or u s9 million for 10 years rent equivalent to less than 0 4 or 0 02 of the uruguayan bip for the year 2020 4 discussion the use of modelling results as a basis for political decisions must be weighed carefully as they can suggest a certain truth that is not implicit oreskes et al 1994 rykiel 1996 eker et al 2018 nevertheless we provide heuristic evidence and shed light on a complex system of agrochemical loads retention and impacts in an intensively used agricultural landscape our models estimated a runoff of over 560 tons of phosphorus and of over 140 tons of glyphosate per year into the fresh waters of uruguay sq scenario in table 5 the grassland intensification strategy gi scenario jaurena et al 2021 is expected to increase the discharge of phosphorus into the fresh waters of uruguay by 40 and of glyphosate by 500 table 5 4 1 major land use changes along freshwater ecosystems the freshwater bodies of the west and southwest of uruguay are strongly influenced by intensified crops which also increased in the central and eastern parts of the country between 2000 and 2015 the timber plantations in the northwest and west central parts are expanding in area and new plantation hotspots increasingly influence watercourses in the south eastern parts of uruguay fig 1 maps in 2015 while natural grasslands still dominated the upper catchments of the rivers cuarem arapey grande and queguay grande the natural grasslands along the watercourses of the catchments of the rivers yi cebollati and olimar were replaced by intensive land uses fig 1a b appendix s6 fig s1 for decision making the legacies and dynamics of past land use change are crucial to an understanding of long term ecosystem behaviour davis et al 2015 we demonstrate that land use intensifications which represent a common threat to almost all freshwater ecosystems worldwide brondízio et al 2019 davis et al 2015 occurred directly beside the aquatic ecosystems of rural uruguay table 3 fig 3 a third of the land within a distance of 1 km of the aquatic ecosystems experienced changes of use table 3 with natural grasslands being particularly increasingly fragmented and disappearing due to their replacement by timber plantations crops and modified pastures fig 3 new discussions about intensification of the grasslands of the campos region have recently begun these state that native grassland is at the core jaurena et al 2021 and involve related socio ecological trade offs between productivity diversity and ecosystem integrity tittonell 2021 the intensification of grassland embraces a diverse portfolio ranging from process to input based measures and system technologies jaurena et al 2021 in addition the increasing number of patches of highly intensified land use i e livestock on modified grasslands crops timber fig 3 along rivers and streams also affects the more natural riparian forests ramírez and säumel 2022 4 2 land use topography and rainfall pattern determine input of pollutants although the intensified grassland modules may appear to more closely resemble native grasslands than crop or timber plantations trade offs with regard to biodiversity have been identified jaurena et al 2021 widespread inappropriate management practices concerning stocking rates dairy effluents timing and amount of fertilizer and application of pesticides have led to water pollution originating from the runoff of modified grasslands and crops chalar et al 2017 and of timber plantations little et al 2015 glyphosate and or phosphorus concentrations in streams correlate with intensified land uses kolpin et al 2006 mahler et al 2017 chalar et al 2017 medalie et al 2020 the uruguayan topography and the increase in the intensity of rainfall that occurs on travelling from south west to north east determine areas with particularly high quickflow values from the respective hills to the local catchments in the north e g cuchilla de belen and east e g cuchilla de heado cuchilla grande or cuchilla de las averías fig 1 these regions are among the areas with the highest loads of phosphorus discharge into the local aquatic ecosystems independent of scenario figs 4 and 5 in these highly sensitive areas the influence of rainfall pattern crop stages and different forms of management on pesticide and nutrient runoff should be especially monitored both frequently and at a local scale andrade et al 2021 as a result of the changing climate in uruguay heavy rainfall events barreiro 2017 and induced peaks in pesticide concentrations are expected to increase andrade et al 2021 as those events are not covered by missing or low frequency sampling maximum pesticide concentrations and fluxes may therefore be largely underestimated lefrancq et al 2017 and see appendix s6 fig s1 4 3 many scattered non point pollution sources drive edge effects the ongoing intensification of land use by silvi and agriculture in rural uruguay results in increasing patchiness of landscapes along watercourses half of the areas covered by natural grasslands disappeared over a 15 year period leaving many fragmented small grassland patches table 3 the numbers of patches covered by timber plantations and crops increased the high number of scattered crop and timber patches consistently reduces those parts of the natural habitats that are unaffected by agrochemicals in chinese studies fertilizer driven trace metal pollution was positively correlated with land fragmentation possibly as a result of higher application of fertilizer to compensate for lower use efficiency in smaller crop areas ren et al 2018 in the surroundings of aquatic ecosystems native vegetation has the potential to reduce and stop the transport of agrochemicals towards aquatic ecosystems by biotic and abiotic mechanisms syversen and bechmann 2004 weigelhofer et al 2012 lerch et al 2017 firstly plants can capture and store agrochemicals that depend on the growing season type of vegetation and coverage percentage reddy et al 1999 lerch et al 2017 stutter et al 2021 secondly plant cover reduces runoff velocity and increases the potential for infiltration and adsorption lerch et al 2017 specifically there is evidence from experimental evaluation that grassland cover could diminish glyphosate runoff by 60 lerch et al 2017 depending on the plant cover width which acts as a buffer syversen and bechmann 2004 4 4 low cost high impact of buffer zones in our model exclusion of highly productive land uses crops timber and highly managed grasslands such as improved or artificial grasslands from a distance of only 100 m from aquatic ecosystems reduced the input of phosphorus and glyphosate by a third table 5 nationalization of these zones with an area of 2167 km2 would cost u s755 million equivalent to less than 1 4 of the uruguayan bip for the year 2020 table 6 alternatively implementation of a system of subsidies comprising ecological compensation measures dworak et al 2009 direct payments to farmers for ecosystem services provided by buffer zones veldman et al 2015 or the introduction of managed buffer zones could be integrated into voluntary certification procedures tröster and hiete 2018 but see also kill 2016 buffer zones integrated within agricultural landscapes have been tested as a novel edge of field approach within riparian zones luke et al 2019 zak et al 2019 similarly integration of buffer zones into grassland management approaches could reduce trade offs of grassland intensification jaurena et al 2021 or an increase in cropland baeza and paruelo 2020 in our scenarios a considerable reduction of agrochemical runoff to aquatic ecosystems requires interventions at the scale of 100 m buffers around aquatic ecosystems if phosphorus and glyphosate are not applied within these zones the runoff of both can be reduced from the status quo by a third for phosphorus and by almost a half for glyphosate livestock should be excluded from all fluvial channels e g by fencing the littoral buffer riparian zone chalar et al 2017 our models also provide evidence that the expected inputs of glyphosate resulting from grassland intensification jaurena et al 2021 cannot be compensated for by the implementation of buffers table 5 although the area of riparian forest has slightly increased and formerly isolated patches have merged with others ramírez and säumel 2022 riparian forest fragmentation continues within a corridor from the aquatic ecosystems table 3 in general these riparian forests are the native vegetated buffer stripes along watercourses of the predominantly forestless temperate grasslands of south america chebataroff 1942 there is no need to plant buffer stripes it is necessary only to restore the original riparian forests which will shape the pesticide concentrations detected in runoff water andrade et al 2021 the riparian forests will also provide multiple other benefits and ecosystem services sutherland et al 2016 in our modelling study we created a 100 m buffer zone mainly due to the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery used to create the land use maps see methods section although we observed a considerable reduction in agrochemical transport other strategies are essential to describe field evaluations for example the evidence and the broad literature have documented differences in the effectiveness of reducing water pollution due to nutrient and agrochemical runoffs collins et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 haddaway et al 2018 luke et al 2019 there is evidence that there are no differences between c3 and c4 grass species if the buffer is monospecific or diverse but the buffer width is more critical than vegetation type syversen and bechmann 2004 lerch et al 2017 furthermore a significant reduction in pesticides in buffer zones containing grasses has been documented compared with that containing trees e g giaccio et al 2016 therefore in the context of our study a strategy for natural grassland conservation bordering aquatic ecosystems would not require any significant investment other than economic compensation to landowners in our modelling study we created a buffer zone of 100 m mainly due to the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery used to create the land use maps see methods section although we observed a considerable reduction in agrochemical transport other strategies are essential to describe from field evaluations for example the evidence and broad literature have documented differences in the effectiveness of reducing water pollution due to nutrient and agrochemical runoff collins et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 haddaway et al 2018 luke et al 2019 there is evidence that there are no differences between c3 and c4 grasses species if the buffer is monospecific or diverse but the buffer width is more critical than vegetation type syversen and bechmann 2004 lerch et al 2017 furthermore a significant reduction of pesticides in buffers with grasses has been documented over trees e g giaccio et al 2016 therefore in the context of our study a strategy for natural grassland conservation bordering aquatic ecosystems would not require any significant investment other than economic compensation to landowners 4 5 there is glory in prevention the rivers of the anthropocene have become depositories with forms and processes drastically shaped by human impacts within their catchment areas hein et al 2021 in terms of input mitigation should begin at the farm scale with implementation of best management strategies with regard to the use of agrochemicals chalar et al 2017 complemented at the landscape scale by riparian buffers encouraged by territorial planning luke et al 2019 jabłońska et al 2020 clearly to test and prove and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation and restoration measures in the long term the modelled impact of land use change on uruguayan aquatic ecosystems needs to be calibrated with a country wide monitoring system that expands the existing monitoring stations along larger rivers beretta blanco and carrasco letelier 2021 detecting pollutants beyond phosphorus and glyphosate however as tracing the fate and impacts of yearly newly emerging agrochemicals in riparian zones is complex and there will be time lags between the implementation of mitigation measures and measurable impacts doehring et al 2020 prevention is better than cure despite knowledge about the negative consequences of the use of agrochemicals nogueira et al 2021 and local communities bearing the costs of monitoring and compensation for potential damage schwarzenbach et al 2006 schreinemachers and tipraqsa 2012 mateo sagasta et al 2017 large corporations are generating profits for global shareholders political action by local governments is needed to implement prevention and mitigation measures coordinated at a regional scale nogueira et al 2021 and as both consumers and shareholders do not come from the local communities pressure from the global citizenship is also required 4 6 model utility and uncertainties while environmental modelling supports analyses assessments and policy decisions concerning land use change and its impacts its dependence on data quality and availability is critical because monitoring networks for validating models are either lacking or are too coarsely meshed e g redhead et al 2018 benez secanho and dwivedi 2019 han et al 2021 there has also been controversy in the local scientific community about water pollution modelling and its origins beretta blanco and carrasco letelier 2021 and replies although there is consensus regarding the applicability and good performance of the ndr model redhead et al 2018 yang et al 2019 some limitations need to be considered for example the ndr model is sensitive to the input of some parameters relating to retention and the flow accumulation threshold which modifies the outputs redhead et al 2018 han et al 2021 in addition the spatial resolution of the geospatial information used could influence the results benez secanho and dwivedi 2019 and as the calibration parameters were obtained from literature they may differ from the local context sharp et al 2020 we have however drawn on the best available data to estimate glyphosate and phosphorus discharge and to identify areas with a higher likelihood of increased export of agrochemicals this leads to the findings that north west uruguay should be a priority area for new water quality monitoring stations and that monitoring should be extended towards minor watercourses particularly because only 19 of the 121 monitoring stations we were able to locate in uruguay s publicly available data contain data associated with glyphosate appendix s6 fig s1 some considerations should be highlighted when evaluating the modeling performance using the kge nse and rmse coefficients firstly negative kge and nse results could be considered unsatisfactory knoben et al 2019 therefore for non standardized data the model fell however for standardized data the modeling for glyphosate showed a good performance these results are mainly due to technical reasons and biophysical attributes not captured by the tool for assessing agrochemical runoff into aquatic ecosystems firstly we only found four water monitoring stations to intersect with hydric flow data to evaluate the model performance in the same unit of measure appendix 3 table s2 thus our access to reliable data was a critical limit to mathematical validation other studies have raised the same limitation where the scarcity and access to data make the performance evaluation less satisfactory than expected e g redhead et al 2018 anjinho et al 2022 secondly the tool used invest software does not consider other biophysical processes acting inside and around aquatic ecosystems sharp et al 2020 such as degradation of agrochemicals by microorganisms fixation by aquatics organisms e g algae plant plankton or organic matter hoffmann et al 2009 therefore our model should be considered as a guide to know visually the current state the spatio temporal change and possible comparative impacts between intensification and conservation of areas around aquatic ecosystems although the ndr model is a discrete model and the export of agrochemicals represents the potential discharge after a rain event prior to the application of agrochemicals exploration of relative values of the outputs is suitable for exploring potential risks at a national level a regional approach is crucial for addressing water quality and management redhead et al 2018 nogueira et al 2021 ouchi melo et al 2021 these regional models help to sensitize local actors and policymakers and to highlight the need for detailed spatially linked and publicly available pesticide and fertilizer use data see example from the canadian prairies malaj et al 2020 5 conclusions the dramatic extent of land use intensification leads to significant discharges of pollutants into local freshwater streams our model provides evidence that a strategy to transform intensively used areas within the first 100 m of fresh waters to extensively used ones can considerably reduce the pollution of aquatic ecosystems however the model and its results could be improved by the availability of more precise and higher resolution data on phosphorus and glyphosate inputs at the local level e g with evaluations that consider local landscape heterogeneity such as soil properties crop types and related data on the amount and temporal pattern of agrochemical use than were available for our study at the same time our models and results provide a basis for participatory evaluation among different stakeholders from local communities farmers the silvi and agricultural industries governmental institutions and ngos we suggest that the water quality monitoring network should be expanded to small freshwater streams as well as to evaluating government investment in the creation of buffer zones to both dampen and decrease pollutant runoff at the regional level our results show the relevance of collecting and accessing databases our study area immersed in the temperate grasslands of south america also shares this biome with argentina and brazil where the processes of land use change have similarities in terms of intensification by monocultures therefore there is a need to increase collaboration and methodological standardization and information flow so that social actors interested in agrochemical runoff modeling can overcome

7761,study region uruguay south america study focus riparian ecosystems accumulate the impacts of land use change from extensively used grasslands to industrial cash crops in their watersheds and transport a proportion of pollution downstream we modelled and assessed land use changes within different zones along uruguayan freshwater ecosystems and estimated the potential risks of phosphorus and glyphosate runoff based on different land use scenarios new hydrological insights for the region under study we found that ongoing intensification of grasslands as well as the conversion to cropland and timber plantations exerted high pressure on aquatic ecosystems phosphorus runoff is expected to increase by more than 40 and glyphosate runoff by 500 excluding intensified land use within the first 100 m of streams can reduce pollutant discharge by 20 we propose an expansion of pollution monitoring from large to small streams results from modelling can contribute to decision making and to raising awareness among stakeholders involved in land management and planning graphical abstract ga1 keywords campos eutrophication ecotoxicology fertilizer land cover landscape ecology non point

biosphere hydrosphere lithosphere atmosphere and anthroposphere dufour et al 2019 to sum up a highly contested part of our rural landscapes due to its conservation value for biodiversity and because it is an area that provides freshwater for productive activities at rural sites the pressure of land use change on aquatic ecosystems is related to non point source pollution by agrochemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides and by organic waste from livestock and overall sediment erosion stafford et al 1996 ongley et al 2010 chalar et al 2017 doehring et al 2020 in addition to the well researched and challenging macro pollutants nitrogen or phosphorus there are also thousands of synthetic trace contaminants in aquatic ecosystems schwarzenbach et al 2010 mateo sagasta et al 2017 while the multibillion dollar agrochemical industry produces more than five million tons of pesticides per year and continues to develop new commercial products with different active chemical ingredients schwarzenbach et al 2006 a standardized monitoring of the effects on local ecosystems and human health using in situ studies is lacking schwarzenbach et al 2006 schreinemachers and tipraqsa 2012 mateo sagasta et al 2017 the temperate grasslands of the southern cone along with their rivers and streams are experiencing dramatic land use change from traditionally extensive uses to intensive livestock cash crops timber or pulp production predominately for the global market alvarez et al 2015 the productive sector of uruguay often discusses the low productivity of uruguayan grasslands as a driver of land conversion modernel et al 2016 and proposes new strategies to intensify production to conserve grasslands jaurena et al 2021 whereas others call for the recognition of the values of old growth grasslands veldman et al 2015 however the resulting impacts of this land use change and further intensification of local ecosystems remain largely unknown while some studies have explored the effects on terrestrial ecosystems such as riparian forests ramírez and säumel 2022 or grasslands e g jaurena et al 2016 pañella et al 2020 only a few have been published in uruguay on water balance reichert et al 2017 water pollution and eutrophication chalar et al 2017 eguren et al 2018 gonçalves et al 2020 gorgoglione et al 2020 beretta blanco and carrasco letelier 2021 these topics hotly debated in the uruguayan press and across different sectors e g alonso et al 2019 are attracting increasing awareness among local stakeholders as are the constitutional right to water moshman 2005 taks 2008 and the antagonistically functioning new irrigation law santos 2020 here for the first time we examine the dimensions of land use change in the surroundings of aquatic ecosystems at a distance of up to 1 km from uruguay s fresh waters as uruguay is among the upper middle income countries that has experienced double digit growth in the intensity of pesticide use during the last decade mateo sagasta et al 2017 and because it has limited infrastructure to track the effects of pesticides a precautionary approach is necessary schwarzenbach et al 2006 in addition the state of the art of monitoring and regulations has led to a compartmentalization of risks which ultimately underestimates the transversal actual hazards that chemicals catalyze in waterways for humans and other organisms see discussion in hendlin et al 2020 to narrow this gap we focus on glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine and its derivates which comprise the most widely used herbicide group in the world duke and powles 2008 benbrook 2016 sabzevari and hofman 2022 and has multiple consequences for soils and aquatic ecosystems gomes de carvalho marques et al 2021 and on phosphorus a fertilizer that is an important contributor to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems elser et al 2007 in addition to a wide variety of measures to reduce erosion and the use of potential pollutants in agriculture and forestry mcdowell et al 2018 the implementation and management of buffer zones is a common low cost approach to trap eliminate or transform pollutants flowing from terrestrial into aquatic ecosystems reddy et al 1999 viaud et al 2004 collins et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 stutter et al 2012 beyond this buffer zones can provide multiple benefits for riparian restoration such as enhancing hydro morphological and thermal conditions and overall functioning and are no regret management options mander et al 2017 feld et al 2018 however the provision of habitat services is powerfully shaped by buffer management hille et al 2018 zak et al 2019 and human activities in the adjacent zones luke et al 2019 furthermore cost calculations in rural europe have demonstrated that the implementation of buffer zones on a larger scale is mainly a question of setting policy priorities rather than a financial impossibility jabłońska et al 2020 however for uruguay the legislation law no 14 859 of the water code does not explicitly indicate buffer zones for biodiversity conservation and to amortize the effects of economic activities near watercourses we aim to answer the following research questions i to what extent are different surrounding zones along aquatic ecosystems affected by land use changes ii what are the potential phosphorus and glyphosate run offs assuming different land use scenarios and iii what trade offs are typically possible between economic exploitation and the environmental impacts when establishing riparian buffer zones to our knowledge this is the first study to estimate glyphosate and phosphorus runoffs related to land use change along uruguayan fresh waters we assess different land use scenarios i e status quo or business as usual assuming continuation of the current management strategies management of grassland intensification based on application of agrochemicals jaurena et al 2021 and the grassland conservation strategy with extensive use veldman et al 2015 2 methods 2 1 study area delimitation we focus on areas around uruguayan watercourses up to a distance of 1 km from their aquatic ecosystems to identify the areas of aquatic ecosystems we used geospatial information from the uruguayan government mvotma 2015 to delimit the study area referred to henceforth as surrounding areas we combined geospatial information on the hydrological network and surface water we created two types of surrounding area i from the border of the aquatic ecosystems to the surroundings using four different distances 0 0 1 0 0 25 0 0 5 and 0 1 km and ii by contour or section 0 0 1 0 0 25 0 25 0 5 and 0 5 1 km the different distances of the sections were selected because we are interested in exploring whether the change processes are unique to any one section or whether there is a general pattern of land use change thus in total we covered 120 800 km2 which represents 68 of the terrestrial area of uruguay and 12 of the temperate grasslands of south america 2 2 study area context uruguay is located in south america between latitudes 30 and 35 south and longitudes 53 and 58 west it has a temperate climate without dry seasons or hot summers peel et al 2007 the average annual temperature is 17 6 c and annual total precipitation is 1221 mm fick and hijmans 2017 uruguayan aquatic ecosystems have been largely modified by anthropogenic activities such as regulation by the building of numerous large dams and have an eutrophic to hypereutrophic water status see status report by alonso et al 2019 fig 1a d for land use changes currently 791 plant protection products have been approved and over 1500 have been registered for use in uruguay 264 of which are classified as prioritized pesticide products ma 2020 between 2015 and 2020 more than 85 kilotons of pesticides were imported into uruguay oan 2020 the top three were glyphosate 54 kilotons 2 4 d 8 kilotons and metalochlor 2 kilotons nearly 5 megatons of fertilizer were imported 1 3 megatons of which were phosphorus based i e mono or diammonium phosphate or triple superphosphate oan 2020 in 2019 phosphorus containing fertilizer valued at u s81 million was imported into uruguay as systematic monitoring of use is lacking no insights into the fate of these agrochemicals are available beyond these general data 2 3 reclassification of land use cover as the original classification was based on landsat images with a resolution of 30 30 m the land use maps in vector format for the years 2000 alvarez et al 2015 and 2015 mvotma 2015 were converted to raster with a resolution of 30 30 m pixels we assessed land use change for both types of surrounding area for the years 2000 and 2015 we aggregated and reclassified original land use cover maps from 17 to 10 land use cover types i native forests ii shrublands iii semi natural grasslands including those with dispersed palm stands iv highly modified grasslands including artificial and improved grasslands v bare soils including quarries stand pits and open pit mines vi urban areas vii timber plantations viii orchards ix crops and x aquatic ecosystems including artificial waters natural waters and flooded natural areas appendix 1 table s1 modified grassland cover was extracted from the work of petraglia et al 2019 and incorporated into the land use cover maps of 2000 and 2015 this incorporation consisted of the reclassification of pixels belonging to original land use cover maps to the pixels from the work of petraglia et al 2019 classified as i highly modified natural pastures introduced pastures and old stubbles and ii areas including forage crops sown grasslands field and stubble with a high temporal variation and generally associated with raising dairy cattle we only reclassified original pixels as modified grassland when the intersection occurred with cropland and timber plantation land uses appendix 1 fig s1 as the raster from the work of petraglia et al 2019 has a resolution of 10 m the reclassification allowed identification of so called improved pastures i e fertilized and or with a high proportion of legumes introduced to increase farm productivity berretta et al 2000 originally classified as crops in the 2000 and 2015 land use cover maps we were also able to identify grassland patches inside cropland and timber plantations which have been highly modified due to the pressure of anthropic activities in their surroundings appendix 1 fig s1 additionally because there is no reported determination of the accuracy of the classification for land use cover maps 2000 and 2015 from uruguayan institutions we created a confusion matrix from 569 points over the land use map for the year 2015 thus we estimated an overall accuracy of 66 appendix 1 table s2 the processing of geospatial information was carried out in qgis v3 10 11 a qgis development team 2020 2 4 transport of phosphorus and glyphosate we used the nutrient delivery ratio ndr model sharp et al 2020 to calculate the surface transport of phosphorus and glyphosate from different terrestrial land use types to the watercourses using integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs invest software sharp et al 2020 we modelled phosphorus and glyphosate discharge using the land use maps of the surrounding areas for the years 2000 and 2015 with a width of 1 km from the aquatic ecosystem fig 1a d and fig 2 the ndr model requires data for agrochemical load per hectare and the efficiency of retention expected from a given land use type sharp et al 2020 these calibration parameters were based on a literature review which is listed in the appendices see table 1 and appendices s1 s3 the ndr model estimates the movement of chemical compounds across land based on mass balance sharp et al 2020 the model considers that the movement and retention efficiency of chemicals across the landscape depend on land use topography and runoff sharp et al 2020 appendix 2 table s1 the topographic data were based on the digital elevation model dem of uruguay and the runoff data were based on quickflow calculated from the seasonal water yield swy model of the invest model sharp et al 2020 see appendix 2 quickflow represents the potential runoff considering soil types and land cover properties that influence the balance between infiltration of rain and the runoff across the surface landscape sharp et al 2020 we used quickflow from swy because it considers the hydrological characteristics of the soils land use cover precipitation rain events evapotranspiration topography and the crop vegetation coefficient for the calculation sharp et al 2020 all values geospatial information and specific references are listed in appendices s1 s2 and s3 in this study we evaluated the transport of chemicals across land surfaces and omitted subsurface transport the surface nutrient delivery ratio ndrsurf per pixel is given by ndr surf ndr 0 i 1 exp ic 0 ic i k 1 where ic0 and k are calibration parameters ici is a topographic index calculated from the dem ndr0 i is the proportion of the agrochemical that is not retained by downslope pixels thus the total export for all study areas is given by x expi load surf i ndr surf i x exp tot i x expi where xexpi is the nutrient export from each pixel to the aquatic ecosystem and xexp tot is the total nutrient exported for all study areas the ndr makes the following four assumptions i application of an agrochemical is uniform depending on land use only the amount applied varies ii the method of application is directly proportional to groundcover iii the model does not consider the effects of spray drift or subsurface movement of agrochemicals and iv the point sources are not considered 2 5 model validation the absence of independent in situ data that would allow us to link the load of agrochemicals at a certain land use with the respective surface runoff makes the validation of a classical operational model i e measured versus modelled data impossible however our results are of heuristic value oreskes et al 1994 eker et al 2018 we know comparatively little about the quantities and frequencies of agrochemical application on the different land uses and their fate in the landscape thus we explored and tested the model using visualization techniques evaluating the extreme condition test rykiel 1996 and sensitivity of the model in five randomly selected sub watersheds appendix 3 fig s1 that represent different gradients of quickflow topographic features appendix 3 fig s2 and land use dominances that have been identified for uruguay ramírez and säumel 2022 appendix 3 table s1 i e dominance of grassland dominance of timber plantations with grassland dominance of crops with modified and natural grasslands a mixture of crops and modified and natural grasslands or a mixture of grassland and timber plantations we ran the models for each sub watershed with different loads of phosphorus and glyphosate ranging from no agrochemical load 0 to doubling the input 200 compared with current use thus we evaluated the performance of the model based on our knowledge oreskes et al 1994 rykiel 1996 eker et al 2018 the results and visualization are given in appendix 3 fig s3 s13 we observed that the ndr model was sensitive to loads of agrochemicals and geophysical features of each sub watershed appendix 3 fig s3 s13 in general the model was sensitive to modification of parameters geophysical context climate and topography and variations of land use the visualization of the output maps revealed that the model follows the generalizations of the transport of pollutants and fits the process we want to evaluate i e the modification of agrochemical loads and export due to land use change based on different scenarios additionally to evaluate the model we only found four water monitoring stations that meet the conditions to compare with our model appendix 3 table s2 and s3 the observed data from the water monitoring stations report values in u l the data simulated by the ndr model report values in kg and also report the areas of the sub watershed then we could calculate values in kg ha therefore we transformed the observed data using the average annual flow of the reported gauged catchments in l s km2 dinagua 2012 thus we calculated kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and root mean square error rmse we evaluated the above by standardizing between 0 and 1 and unstandardized the data we found that for glyphosate and phosphorous the unstandardized kge and nse data were negative appendix 3 table s3 in contrast for the standardized data kge and nse were positive for glyphosate kge 0 47 and nse 0 03 and negative for phosphorus kge 0 86 and nse 2 96 appendix 3 table s3 for standardized data of rmse we found that glyphosate was close to zero rmse 0 01 and for phosphorus it was greater than 1 rmse 1 22 so for the standardized data the rmse for glyphosate rmse 0 38 and phosphorus rmse 0 72 were between 0 and 1 appendix 3 table s3 2 6 different management and land use scenarios we analysed six different scenarios of phosphorus and glyphosate run off from terrestrial surface to aquatic ecosystems depending on the land use allocation and management of application of agrochemicals in the surrounding areas along the uruguayan freshwater ecosystems table 2 the scenarios comprise i the status quo sq scenario where agrochemicals are applied to modified grasslands timber plantations and crops as currently established ii the status quo with buffer sqb scenario where agrochemicals are applied to modified grasslands timber plantations and crops as currently established but within a 100 m buffer around fresh waters productive land uses were transformed to natural grassland without application of agrochemicals iii the grassland intensification gi scenario in which agrochemicals are applied on all natural and modified grasslands jaurena et al 2021 timber plantations and crops iv the grassland intensification with buffer gib scenario in which agrochemicals are applied on all grasslands timber plantations and crops but within a 100 m buffer around aquatic ecosystems productive land uses were transformed to natural grassland without application of agrochemicals v the grasslands conservation gc scenario in which all grasslands are managed without application of agrochemicals veldman et al 2015 and agrochemicals are only applied on timber plantations and crops as currently established and vi the grasslands conservation with buffer gcb scenario in which all grasslands are managed without application of agrochemicals which are used only on timber plantations and crops as currently established but within a 100 m buffer around aquatic ecosystems productive land uses were transformed to natural grassland without application of agrochemicals e g in appendix s4 fig s1 2 7 data analysis considering the totality of the patches we characterized land use change pattern by calculating area mean area standard deviation of the mean and number of patches per land use cover for the different buffer zones using fragstat v 4 2 mcgarigal et al 2012 we calculated the net change of land use for both buffer types between 2000 and 2015 in square kilometres and percentages for area mean area and number of patches for the percentage of net change we considered land use in the year 2000 as being equal to 100 we also ran an intensity analysis using the openland package exavier and zeilhofer 2021 in r r core team 2016 to evaluate the change from a pixel belonging to specific land use cover to other land use cover as well as to detect situations of no change between 2000 and 2015 in order to explore the net change of the discharge of phosphorus and glyphosate from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems we focused on relative rather than absolute values we calculated the temporal net change between 2000 and 2015 exploring what the trajectory of change would have been if the different scenarios had begun in the year 2000 as the sq scenario most closely reflects the current land use mode we used it as a baseline to calculate the net change between scenarios we therefore averaged the export of each agrochemical between 2000 and 2015 according to each scenario finally to identify geographic risk areas we visually explored the raster maps generated in the analysis of land use change and the outputs of phosphorus and glyphosate the visualization was generated by calculating the export of agrochemical per hectare and by sub watershed to compare between scenarios we created a legend with five ranges of agrochemical export using the method of natural break jenks in quantum geographic information system v 3 16 3 hannover qgis development team 2020 the sq map legend was taken as a reference and extrapolated to the remaining scenarios we also estimated costs of indemnification for the land owner if buffer areas were taken out of use by using costs per hectare based on the coneat index mgap 2022 cutiño 2015 lanzilotta and rosas 2019 which remains an important source for today s land taxation and management plans under the legal conservation regulations lanfranco and sapriza 2011 based on a detailed classification which considers soil type texture natural vegetation altitude and geology 3 results 3 1 land use change adjacent to fresh waters across all land uses the mean patch size decreased by a third from 2000 to 2015 while the patch number increased by 40 table 3 in 2015 natural grasslands were the dominant land use 62 314 km2 52 followed by crops 21 017 km2 17 modified pastures 11 542 km2 10 timber plantations 7993 km2 7 native forests 7322 km2 6 and aquatic ecosystems 7169 km2 6 appendix s5 table s1 between 2000 and 2015 17 of natural grasslands within 1 km of the freshwater ecosystems were transformed to crops timber plantations or highly modified grasslands fig 3a d appendix s5 table s1 the net change of land use by different contour areas showed similar patterns fig 3a e g appendix s5 table s2 in 2015 the first 100 m of the surrounding areas were mostly covered by natural grasslands 43 followed by aquatic ecosystems 19 riparian forests 18 crops 9 modified pastures 5 and timber plantations 4 the area covered by riparian forests remained constant while shrubland decreased by 7 fig 3a appendix s5 table s2 grassland also dominated in all contours of the study in 2000 and 2015 and was the land use with the highest total area loss 14 19 and the highest mean area loss for most contours fig 3a g appendix s5 tables s1 s2 crops were the land use with the second largest area in the contour over 100 m increasing by 40 compared with 2000 fig 3e g appendix s5 table s2 however the net change in mean area decreased in all surrounding areas table 3 appendix s5 tables s1 s2 timber plantations increased by over 100 of total area for all surrounding areas compared with 2000 and there was also an increase in net change of the mean area table

shrublands decreased by 6 as did the mean area table 3 fig 3 appendix s5 tables s1 s2 although the areas of orchards native forest and bare soils remained constant the mean areas of these three land use types also decreased table 3 fig 3a g appendix s5 tables s1 s2 there was also an increase in urban area with a decrease in mean area within most of the surrounding areas evaluated table 3 fig 3a g appendix s5 tables s1 s2 the number of patches of crops and grassland increased by over 50 for the total study area compared with 2000 followed by modified grassland 40 timber plantations 27 orchards

covered by timber plantations increased by over 80 in the first 100 m of the surrounding areas and for all other areas the increase ranged between 36 and 61 compared with 2000 appendix s5 tables s1 s2 the number of patches of orchard aquatic ecosystems native forests and bare soils increased slightly appendix s5 tables s1 s2 the number of patches covered by shrublands decreased slightly 2 in most of the surroundings of freshwater ecosystems appendix s5 tables s1 s2 3 2 phosphorus and glyphosate runoff to watercourses the calculated runoff of phosphorus to the aquatic ecosystems in the currently established land use and management mode increased between 2000 and 2015 by 30 and that for glyphosate by 80 sq scenario in table 4 runoff of phosphorus and glyphosate changed according to different land use scenarios tables 4 5 figs 4 and 5 ranging between 406 tons of phosphorus and 78 tons of glyphosate per year gcb scenario to 805 tons of phosphorus and 922 tons of glyphosate per year gi scenario table 5 setting the sq scenario as baseline our scenarios showed that the exclusion of highly productive land uses from a buffer zone of 100 m around rivers and streams can reduce the runoff of phosphorus and glyphosate into fresh waters by 25 and 19 respectively table 5 sqb versus sq scenario considering only crops and timber plantations but not modified grasslands as fertilized and treated with glyphosate gc scenario export of phosphorus to aquatic ecosystems is reduced by 4 and glyphosate runoff to aquatic ecosystems is reduced to a third of that with the sq scenario table 5 finally excluding any application of fertilizer or glyphosate within 100 m of rivers and streams can reduce the export of phosphorus into aquatic ecosystems by 29 and export of glyphosate by 46 table 5 gcb versus sq scenario following the gi scenario would increase the input of phosphorus by over 40 and the runoff of glyphosate into the aquatic ecosystem by more than 500 table 5 gi versus sq scenario the establishment of a strict buffer zone of 100 m along aquatic ecosystems reduces the export of phosphorus by a third compared with the gi scenario and would result in an increase of 18 compared with the current land use mode gib versus sq scenario in table 5 the runoff of glyphosate would not change if the buffer zone were implemented gib versus gi scenario in table 5 3 3 costs of exclusion of high load uses from buffer zones the 100 m buffer zone from the aquatic ecosystems covers an area of 2167 km2 which is currently covered by 1510 km2 of modified grasslands 26 km2 of crops and 632 km2 of timber plantations appendix s5 table s1 we calculated the mean and median land prices per department table 6 according to figures from the uruguayan planning and tax office lanzilotta and rosas 2019 and the maximal prices assuming best land quality depending on the main productive categories i e agricultural livestock field with coneat index 100 u s2700 ha good agricultural field with coneat index 150 u s4050 ha and a forestry area with coneat index 50 u s1350 ha see e g cutiño 2015 thus the nationalization of these areas would cost u s775 million equivalent to less than 1 4 of the uruguayan bip for the year 2020 renting the buffer zones for 10 years would cost us 34 million less than 0 06 of the uruguayan bip for the year 2020 the establishment of buffer zones could also be a stepwise process starting with highly polluted parts of the uruguayan watercourses such as the santa lucía catchment which provides drinking water for more than 60 of the uruguayan population alonso et al 2021 the nationalization of these areas of the canelones san josé and florida departments would cost u s227 million or u s9 million for 10 years rent equivalent to less than 0 4 or 0 02 of the uruguayan bip for the year 2020 4 discussion the use of modelling results as a basis for political decisions must be weighed carefully as they can suggest a certain truth that is not implicit oreskes et al 1994 rykiel 1996 eker et al 2018 nevertheless we provide heuristic evidence and shed light on a complex system of agrochemical loads retention and impacts in an intensively used agricultural landscape our models estimated a runoff of over 560 tons of phosphorus and of over 140 tons of glyphosate per year into the fresh waters of uruguay sq scenario in table 5 the grassland intensification strategy gi scenario jaurena et al 2021 is expected to increase the discharge of phosphorus into the fresh waters of uruguay by 40 and of glyphosate by 500 table 5 4 1 major land use changes along freshwater ecosystems the freshwater bodies of the west and southwest of uruguay are strongly influenced by intensified crops which also increased in the central and eastern parts of the country between 2000 and 2015 the timber plantations in the northwest and west central parts are expanding in area and new plantation hotspots increasingly influence watercourses in the south eastern parts of uruguay fig 1 maps in 2015 while natural grasslands still dominated the upper catchments of the rivers cuarem arapey grande and queguay grande the natural grasslands along the watercourses of the catchments of the rivers yi cebollati and olimar were replaced by intensive land uses fig 1a b appendix s6 fig s1 for decision making the legacies and dynamics of past land use change are crucial to an understanding of long term ecosystem behaviour davis et al 2015 we demonstrate that land use intensifications which represent a common threat to almost all freshwater ecosystems worldwide brondízio et al 2019 davis et al 2015 occurred directly beside the aquatic ecosystems of rural uruguay table 3 fig 3 a third of the land within a distance of 1 km of the aquatic ecosystems experienced changes of use table 3 with natural grasslands being particularly increasingly fragmented and disappearing due to their replacement by timber plantations crops and modified pastures fig 3 new discussions about intensification of the grasslands of the campos region have recently begun these state that native grassland is at the core jaurena et al 2021 and involve related socio ecological trade offs between productivity diversity and ecosystem integrity tittonell 2021 the intensification of grassland embraces a diverse portfolio ranging from process to input based measures and system technologies jaurena et al 2021 in addition the increasing number of patches of highly intensified land use i e livestock on modified grasslands crops timber fig 3 along rivers and streams also affects the more natural riparian forests ramírez and säumel 2022 4 2 land use topography and rainfall pattern determine input of pollutants although the intensified grassland modules may appear to more closely resemble native grasslands than crop or timber plantations trade offs with regard to biodiversity have been identified jaurena et al 2021 widespread inappropriate management practices concerning stocking rates dairy effluents timing and amount of fertilizer and application of pesticides have led to water pollution originating from the runoff of modified grasslands and crops chalar et al 2017 and of timber plantations little et al 2015 glyphosate and or phosphorus concentrations in streams correlate with intensified land uses kolpin et al 2006 mahler et al 2017 chalar et al 2017 medalie et al 2020 the uruguayan topography and the increase in the intensity of rainfall that occurs on travelling from south west to north east determine areas with particularly high quickflow values from the respective hills to the local catchments in the north e g cuchilla de belen and east e g cuchilla de heado cuchilla grande or cuchilla de las averías fig 1 these regions are among the areas with the highest loads of phosphorus discharge into the local aquatic ecosystems independent of scenario figs 4 and 5 in these highly sensitive areas the influence of rainfall pattern crop stages and different forms of management on pesticide and nutrient runoff should be especially monitored both frequently and at a local scale andrade et al 2021 as a result of the changing climate in uruguay heavy rainfall events barreiro 2017 and induced peaks in pesticide concentrations are expected to increase andrade et al 2021 as those events are not covered by missing or low frequency sampling maximum pesticide concentrations and fluxes may therefore be largely underestimated lefrancq et al 2017 and see appendix s6 fig s1 4 3 many scattered non point pollution sources drive edge effects the ongoing intensification of land use by silvi and agriculture in rural uruguay results in increasing patchiness of landscapes along watercourses half of the areas covered by natural grasslands disappeared over a 15 year period leaving many fragmented small grassland patches table 3 the numbers of patches covered by timber plantations and crops increased the high number of scattered crop and timber patches consistently reduces those parts of the natural habitats that are unaffected by agrochemicals in chinese studies fertilizer driven trace metal pollution was positively correlated with land fragmentation possibly as a result of higher application of fertilizer to compensate for lower use efficiency in smaller crop areas ren et al 2018 in the surroundings of aquatic ecosystems native vegetation has the potential to reduce and stop the transport of agrochemicals towards aquatic ecosystems by biotic and abiotic mechanisms syversen and bechmann 2004 weigelhofer et al 2012 lerch et al 2017 firstly plants can capture and store agrochemicals that depend on the growing season type of vegetation and coverage percentage reddy et al 1999 lerch et al 2017 stutter et al 2021 secondly plant cover reduces runoff velocity and increases the potential for infiltration and adsorption lerch et al 2017 specifically there is evidence from experimental evaluation that grassland cover could diminish glyphosate runoff by 60 lerch et al 2017 depending on the plant cover width which acts as a buffer syversen and bechmann 2004 4 4 low cost high impact of buffer zones in our model exclusion of highly productive land uses crops timber and highly managed grasslands such as improved or artificial grasslands from a distance of only 100 m from aquatic ecosystems reduced the input of phosphorus and glyphosate by a third table 5 nationalization of these zones with an area of 2167 km2 would cost u s755 million equivalent to less than 1 4 of the uruguayan bip for the year 2020 table 6 alternatively implementation of a system of subsidies comprising ecological compensation measures dworak et al 2009 direct payments to farmers for ecosystem services provided by buffer zones veldman et al 2015 or the introduction of managed buffer zones could be integrated into voluntary certification procedures tröster and hiete 2018 but see also kill 2016 buffer zones integrated within agricultural landscapes have been tested as a novel edge of field approach within riparian zones luke et al 2019 zak et al 2019 similarly integration of buffer zones into grassland management approaches could reduce trade offs of grassland intensification jaurena et al 2021 or an increase in cropland baeza and paruelo 2020 in our scenarios a considerable reduction of agrochemical runoff to aquatic ecosystems requires interventions at the scale of 100 m buffers around aquatic ecosystems if phosphorus and glyphosate are not applied within these zones the runoff of both can be reduced from the status quo by a third for phosphorus and by almost a half for glyphosate livestock should be excluded from all fluvial channels e g by fencing the littoral buffer riparian zone chalar et al 2017 our models also provide evidence that the expected inputs of glyphosate resulting from grassland intensification jaurena et al 2021 cannot be compensated for by the implementation of buffers table 5 although the area of riparian forest has slightly increased and formerly isolated patches have merged with others ramírez and säumel 2022 riparian forest fragmentation continues within a corridor from the aquatic ecosystems table 3 in general these riparian forests are the native vegetated buffer stripes along watercourses of the predominantly forestless temperate grasslands of south america chebataroff 1942 there is no need to plant buffer stripes it is necessary only to restore the original riparian forests which will shape the pesticide concentrations detected in runoff water andrade et al 2021 the riparian forests will also provide multiple other benefits and ecosystem services sutherland et al 2016 in our modelling study we created a 100 m buffer zone mainly due to the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery used to create the land use maps see methods section although we observed a considerable reduction in agrochemical transport other strategies are essential to describe field evaluations for example the evidence and the broad literature have documented differences in the effectiveness of reducing water pollution due to nutrient and agrochemical runoffs collins et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 haddaway et al 2018 luke et al 2019 there is evidence that there are no differences between c3 and c4 grass species if the buffer is monospecific or diverse but the buffer width is more critical than vegetation type syversen and bechmann 2004 lerch et al 2017 furthermore a significant reduction in pesticides in buffer zones containing grasses has been documented compared with that containing trees e g giaccio et al 2016 therefore in the context of our study a strategy for natural grassland conservation bordering aquatic ecosystems would not require any significant investment other than economic compensation to landowners in our modelling study we created a buffer zone of 100 m mainly due to the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery used to create the land use maps see methods section although we observed a considerable reduction in agrochemical transport other strategies are essential to describe from field evaluations for example the evidence and broad literature have documented differences in the effectiveness of reducing water pollution due to nutrient and agrochemical runoff

the buffer width is more critical than vegetation type syversen and bechmann 2004 lerch et al 2017 furthermore a significant reduction of pesticides in buffers with grasses has been documented over trees e g giaccio et al 2016 therefore in the context of our study a strategy for natural grassland conservation bordering aquatic ecosystems would not require any significant investment other than economic compensation to landowners 4 5 there is glory in prevention the rivers of the anthropocene have become depositories with forms and processes drastically shaped by human impacts within their catchment areas hein et al 2021 in terms of input mitigation should begin at the farm scale with implementation of best management strategies with regard to the use of agrochemicals chalar et al 2017 complemented at the landscape scale by riparian buffers encouraged by territorial planning luke et al 2019 jabłońska et al 2020 clearly to test and prove and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation and restoration measures in the long term the modelled impact of land use change on uruguayan aquatic ecosystems needs to be calibrated with a country wide monitoring system that expands the existing monitoring stations along larger rivers beretta blanco and carrasco letelier 2021 detecting pollutants beyond phosphorus and glyphosate however as tracing the fate and impacts of yearly newly emerging agrochemicals in riparian zones is complex and there will be time lags between the implementation of mitigation measures and measurable impacts doehring et al 2020 prevention is better than cure despite knowledge about the negative consequences of the use of agrochemicals nogueira et al 2021 and local communities bearing the costs of monitoring and compensation for potential damage schwarzenbach et al 2006 schreinemachers and tipraqsa 2012 mateo sagasta et al 2017 large corporations are generating profits for global shareholders political action by local governments is needed to implement prevention and mitigation measures coordinated at a regional scale nogueira et al 2021 and as both consumers and shareholders do not come from the local communities pressure from the global citizenship is also required 4 6 model utility and uncertainties while environmental modelling supports analyses assessments and policy decisions concerning land use change and its impacts its dependence on data quality and availability is critical because monitoring networks for validating models are either lacking or are too coarsely meshed e g redhead et al 2018 benez secanho and dwivedi 2019 han et al 2021 there has also been controversy in the local scientific community about water pollution modelling and its origins beretta blanco and carrasco letelier 2021 and replies although there is consensus regarding the applicability and good performance of the ndr model redhead et al 2018 yang et al 2019 some limitations need to be considered for example the ndr model is sensitive to the input of some parameters relating to retention and the flow accumulation threshold which modifies the outputs redhead et al 2018 han et al 2021 in addition the spatial resolution of the geospatial information used could influence the results benez secanho and dwivedi 2019 and as the calibration parameters were obtained from literature they may differ from the local context sharp et al 2020 we have however drawn on the best available data to estimate glyphosate and phosphorus discharge and to identify areas with a higher likelihood of increased export of agrochemicals this leads to the findings that north west uruguay should be a priority area for new water quality monitoring stations and that monitoring should be extended towards minor watercourses particularly because only 19 of the 121 monitoring stations we were able to locate in uruguay s publicly available data contain data associated with glyphosate appendix s6 fig s1 some considerations should be highlighted when evaluating the modeling performance using the kge nse and rmse coefficients firstly negative kge and nse results could be considered unsatisfactory knoben et al 2019 therefore for non standardized data the model fell however for standardized data the modeling for glyphosate showed a good performance these results are mainly due to technical reasons and biophysical attributes not captured by the tool for assessing agrochemical runoff into aquatic ecosystems firstly we only found four water monitoring stations to intersect with hydric flow data to evaluate the model performance in the same unit of measure appendix 3 table s2 thus our access to reliable data was a critical limit to mathematical validation other studies have raised the same limitation where the scarcity and access to data make the performance evaluation less satisfactory than expected e g redhead et al 2018 anjinho et al 2022 secondly the tool used invest software does not consider other biophysical processes acting inside and around aquatic ecosystems sharp et al 2020 such as degradation of agrochemicals by microorganisms fixation by aquatics organisms e g algae plant plankton or organic matter hoffmann et al 2009 therefore our model should be considered as a guide to know visually the current state the spatio temporal change and possible comparative impacts between intensification and conservation of areas around aquatic ecosystems although the ndr model is a discrete model and the export of agrochemicals represents the potential discharge after a rain event prior to the application of agrochemicals exploration of relative values of the outputs is suitable for exploring potential risks at a national level a regional approach is crucial for addressing water quality and management redhead et al 2018 nogueira et al 2021 ouchi melo et al 2021 these regional models help to sensitize local actors and policymakers and to highlight the need for detailed spatially linked and publicly available pesticide and fertilizer use data see example from the canadian prairies malaj et al 2020 5 conclusions the dramatic extent of land use intensification leads to significant discharges of pollutants into local freshwater streams our model provides evidence that a strategy to transform intensively used areas within the first 100 m of fresh waters to extensively used ones can considerably reduce the pollution of aquatic ecosystems however the model and its results could be improved by the availability of more precise and higher resolution data on phosphorus and glyphosate inputs at the local level e g with evaluations that consider local landscape heterogeneity such as soil properties crop types and related data on the amount and temporal pattern of agrochemical use than were available for our study at the same time our models and results provide a basis for participatory evaluation among different stakeholders from local communities farmers the silvi and agricultural industries governmental institutions and ngos we suggest that the water quality monitoring network should be expanded to small freshwater streams as well as to evaluating government investment in the creation of buffer zones to both dampen and decrease pollutant runoff at the regional level our results show the relevance of collecting and accessing databases our study area immersed in the temperate grasslands of south america also shares this biome with argentina and brazil where the processes of land use change have similarities in terms of intensification by monocultures therefore there is a need to increase collaboration and methodological standardization and information flow so that social actors interested in agrochemical runoff modeling can overcome

7762,study area upper white volta river study focus hydro meteorological inundation models were applied to simulate an extreme river flood that occurred in the upper white volta river in september of 2020 the predicted inundation area was in good agreement with the flood area estimated by sentinel 1a sar in addition pseudo global warming pgw simulations using the ssp5 8 5 shared socio economic pathway 5 8 5 scenario according to ipcc ar6 were conducted to evaluate the extreme rainfall and associated inundation area under warmer environmental conditions new hydrological insights for the region as a result of simulations the average future rainfall intensity is likely to increase mainly due to higher relative humidity in the regional atmosphere associated with these changes it is likely that the extent of the ensemble average future expected flooded area in the upper white volta river could slightly increase by 1 04 times under the pgw conditions compared with present climate

oguntunde et al 2006 who reported a significant increase in runoff from 1970 to 1998 at a 95 confidence level although giesen et al 2010 argued that the impact of climate change is unclear in this area li et al 2022 found an increasing trend in flood inundation risk in the white volta river basin through a multi satellite data analysis indeed in early september 2020 the white volta river experienced intensive rainfall and river flooding which damaged 1596 homes in several districts killing at least 5 people in the northern part of the river floodlist 2020 in addition the urban areas of accra experienced severe floods from the white volta river in 2015 and 2016 these events show that the upper and middle sections of the white volta river basin can be exposed to floods highlighting the necessity to evaluate the historical and future characteristics of extreme river floods in the white volta river basin the combination of hydrological and hydrodynamic flood models can simulate flooding in a given area with high accuracy and low computational resources huang and hattermann 2018 nguyen et al 2016 komi et al 2017 rajib et al 2020 for instance such an approach has been shown to be sufficient to capture real life flood events with high accuracy in the mississippi river system in the state of ohio us rajib et al 2020 and in the mulde and elde rivers in germany huang and hattermann 2018 while in these studies the river discharge was calibrated and validated with gauge data similar applications have been made in data sparse areas such as the oti river basin in west africa komi et al 2017 essentially while validations with gauge data are the most reliable method to verify the accuracy of historical flood simulations it is difficult to obtain observational flood measurements in data sparse areas such as the african continent komi et al 2017 for areas where little data is available satellite estimations of flood extent are valuable and komi et al 2017 compared the simulated inundation extent with optical satellite observations to verify the accuracy of their simulations finding a fit of 64 which was larger than previous studies such as amarnath et al 2015 sayama et al 2012 among available satellite detection techniques synthetic aperture radar sar can emit and acquire microwave pulses penetrating clouds even at night time due to the merits of sar the detection of historical flood extent by differentiating between water and land surfaces has been mostly carried out by using the threshold method e g otsu 1979 liang and liu 2020 this threshold method simply categorizes the area based on the sar backscatter intensity by considering the local threshold of backscatter intensity between the land and water surfaces liang and liu 2020 the pseudo global warming pgw method first proposed by schär et al 1996 and later improved by sato et al 2007 is a dynamic downscaling method to simulate historical meteorological extremes under future atmospheric warming conditions it has been applied to meteorological extremes such as intense rainfalls kimura and kitoh 2007 taniguchi 2015 tropical cyclones takayabu et al 2015 nakamura et al 2016 2020 takemi et al 2016 patricola and wehner 2018 and extra tropical cyclones mäll et al 2017 2020 the pgw method allows to construct future warming meteorological fields in regional climate models by considering the difference in variables between present and future climates it can also be employed for the projections of cyclones under different warming scenarios nakamura et al 2016 patricola and wehner 2018 studies focusing on seasonal past and future precipitation changes e g kimura and kitoh 2007 have found that the pgw method reduces large scale model biases associated with the direct precipitation outputs from gcms and provides a computationally more efficient way to make such estimates in the present study an integrated framework consisting of a combination of hydro meteorological inundation models was applied to simulate the extreme flood event on september 2020 in the white volta river in ghana the historical simulation of the flood extent was validated by using sentinel 1a sar images further the pgw method was applied to simulate potential extreme flood events under the ssp5 8 5 scenario by the end of the 21st century the paper is organized as follows section 2 shows the framework of the simulation models and the validation methodology then the results are presented in section 3 finally the discussions and conclusions are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 materials and method 2 1 framework of simulation models an overview of the framework of numerical models used is shown in fig 1 the hydrological model wrf hydro ver 5 1 1 weather research and forecasting model hydrological modelling system gochis et al 2020 was used to calculate the river discharge the obtained time series data of discharge were used as inflow boundary conditions for the nays 2d flood model iric 2021 the inundation area simulated by the nays 2d flood model was validated through satellite imagery from sentinel 1a sar attema et al 2010 finally pgw simulations were conducted using the ssp5 8 5 scenario to evaluate future possible characteristics of extreme flood events in the area 2 2 wrf hydro wrf hydro an open source community model developed by the national center for atmospheric research was used to calculate river runoff the model is typically used for various applications and projects related to regional hydrological and hydro meteorological studies with the rainfall results from wrf being used to calculate river runoff a two way mode considering the interaction between the atmosphere and land surface was employed fnl ncep final analysis atmospheric data was used to create the initial and boundary conditions for the meteorological simulations dem data lehner et al 2008 at 3 arc seconds resolution obtained from the hydrosheds data seamless hydrographic data sampson et al 2021 was used to generate river channel data within domain 2 see fig 2 the target area for the simulations the northeastern part of the white volta river basin in ghana is shown in fig 2 meteorological conditions including precipitation were calculated for domains 1 2 in wrf horizontal resolutions of 18 km and 6 km respectively where domains 1 and 2 covered the entire white volta river basin wagner et al 2009 the discharge in domains 2 was calculated by employing wrf hydro fig 3 table 1 shows a summary of the settings used in wrf the calculation period was set from the beginning to the middle of september spanning the period when the flooding took place eight ensemble cases in domain 2 m6c5b6d2 m6c5b1d2 m6c1b1d2 m5c1b1d2 m4c93b7d2 m4c14b5d2 m4c5b1d2 and m4c2b5d2 were set by considering different combinations of physical schemes as shown in table 1 the selection of combination of physical schemes in wrf were based on the previous studies naabil et al 2017 gdobe et al 2019 table 2 summarizes the parameters employed in the wrf hydro chanparm tbl indicates river characteristics and genparm tbl the surface characteristics refkdt data is a parameter that determines the degree of infiltration of rainfall into the soil which has been highlighted as being important in other studies e g naabil et al 2017 and was set to 1 5 according to naabil et al 2017 who also investigated the tono basin inside volta river basin the bottom width bw initial depth of water surface hlink side slope chsslp and manning s roughness coefficient mannn were derived from hydrosheds data see table 2 the topography grid spacing for wrf hydro depends on input data and locality for instance kim et al 2021 tested 250 m 125 m and 50 m spacings and found the 125 m resolution to perform the best for river discharge likewise in this study various spacings were tested and a 250 m grid spacing in domain 2 was used in wrf hydro for the simulations of wrf hydro the subsurface routing option and overland flow routing option were activated in addition the channel routing option was activated with diffusive wave gridded the bucket model was not employed in this study 2 3 nays 2d flood nays 2d flood iric 2021 is a flood flow solver developed by iric international river interface cooperative for unsteady two dimensional inundation flow analysis using general curvilinear and boundary fit coordinates this solver has been applied to the analysis of inundation flows in small and medium sized river basins as it is easy to set up the inflow conditions and the computational domain the model setup is as follows firstly an approximately 70 m curvilinear computational grid was created by interpolating the srtm 90 m resolution topographic data through the iric software fig 4 finally the time series data of the inflow volume was inputted at the edge of the grid as the inflow boundary condition and detailed conditions such as size of computational grids and manning s roughness coefficient were set see table 3 the computational domain of nays 2d flood is shown in fig 4 and the settings for the model are provided in table 3 this study area has several small villages and many farmlands that were affected by the flood see fig 5 between the upper eastern region and northern eastern region state boundaries close to arigu and pwalugu villages sentinel 1a satellite imagery showed that indeed flooding took place in this area the computational domain dimensions were set as 3 95 km wide and 16 km long in the flow direction to cover the maximum inundation area in the nays 2d flood model table 3 the numerical simulation of inundation flow was conducted by inputting the results of wrf hydro s discharge as the inflow boundary condition at the upstream end of the grid fig 4 the calculation period was the same as in wrf hydro 2 4 pseudo global warming experiments in this study the mean differences in atmospheric temperature at skin temperature st relative humidity rh and geopotential height ght for the month of september between 2015 and 2024 and 2081 2100 were obtained from 26 gcms listed in appendix a these were based on the ssp5 8 5 scenario and were used to construct the warmer environments over the domains employed for the simulations in wrf details of the pgw method follow that of nakamura et al 2016 2020 mäll et al 2017 2020 and nakamura and mäll 2021 the differences between four physical variables on the gcm grid coordinate systems were interpolated into the computational grids of the domains in wrf using inverse distance weighting the difference of the average value of the variables between present and future climate from 26 gcms was added to the meteorological initial and boundary conditions of wrf simulations it should be noted that the ssp5 8 5 scenario is the worst case business as usual scenario among the ssp scenarios ipcc 2021 the calculation was performed by changing the initial and boundary conditions in wrf and evaluating the changes of each parameter after the warming fig 6 shows the outline of the pgw experiment and the obtained differences the overall ensemble mean tends to increase in the stratosphere while the atmospheric temperature and geopotential height increase and decrease from the troposphere to a certain point in the stratosphere an average increase of 3 25 c is observed for the sea and land surface temperature for the month of september between 2015 and 2024 and 2081 2100 within the parent domain of wrf the difference in mean surface temperature between the global average and the study area can be attributed to seasonality region and selected gcms nevertheless the overall tendency of the atmospheric vertical profiles is consistent with previous studies nakamura et al 2020 mäll et al 2020 nakamura and mäll 2021 2 5 validation data for precipitation and extent of the inundation areas validation of the simulated area averaged cumulative precipitation and the extent of the inundation area was conducted as detailed below 2 5 1 precipitation validation using gsmap gsmap global satellite mapping of precipitation is a global rainfall map with a spatial distribution of 0 1 arc degrees which combines multiple precipitation observation and geostationary meteorological satellites with the dual frequency precipitation radar onboard the main satellite under the global precipitation measurement gpm project okamoto et al 2005 it is used not only for research purposes but also in a wide range of fields such as meteorology and disaster prevention ushio et al 2009 in this study the area averaged cumulative rainfall between nearly 4 33 w 1 27 e and 8 85 14 32 n in domain 2 provided by gsmap nrt a quasi real time version of gsmap was compared with the area averaged rainfall simulation results from wrf hydro the grids in wrf hydro s domains 2 were interpolated into a 0 1 arc degree spatial resolution to match the satellite data resolution for validation 2 5 2 sentinel 1a sar data sentinel 1a sar attema et al 2010 is a synthetic aperture radar image in which microwaves are emitted from a satellite and then the reflected waves are observed in this study sar data showing the observed extent of inundation by the sentinel 1a was acquired and processed by removing speckle noise and determining the threshold between inundated and non inundated areas see fig 5 the output images were intersected with the inundation area output from the nays 2d flood simulation using the arcgis intersect tool horrit et al 2007 ezzine et al 2020 the following indices 1 2 were used to validate the calculated inundation area compared with the sentinel 1a observations 1 f 1 a a b c 2 f 2 a b a b c where a denotes the area consisting of cells correctly predicted by the model b denotes the area consisting of cells predicted as wet but observed as dry overprediction and c the cells predicted as dry but observed as wet underprediction f 2 was used to evaluate the overprediction of the inundation area f 1 can take a value between 0 and 1 and f 2 between 1 and 1 in both f 1 and f 2 a value of 1 would indicate a perfect agreement between simulations and observations ezzine et al 2020 mentioned values of f 1 and f 2 over 0 5 as being satisfactory 3 results 3 1 total precipitation and river discharge the results of the cumulative precipitation simulated under present and future climate conditions are shown in fig 7 compared with the gsmap the calculated total precipitation and hourly precipitation in the present climate were well reproduced before 18 00 on 13th september the time when inundation was observed by the sar images overall the total cumulative simulated rainfall was 1 22 times larger in the domain 2 at 18 00 on 13th september respectively relative to gsmap this indicates a slight overestimation by the model although this is similar to that of other studies of extreme rainfalls in east africa e g nooni et al 2022 the cumulative rainfall increases under pgw conditions are also shown in fig 7 the ensemble mean cumulative rainfall in the pgw cases increased by 28 for domains 2 compared to the present climate until the end of simulations particularly the amount of precipitation simulated around 10th september sharply increased under future cases relative to the present climate this tendency that future extreme precipitation is likely to be intensified under a future climate is consistent with the ipcc ar6 report section b 3 1 spm ipcc 2021 the physical background for the increase can be attributed to an increase in the humidity contained in the atmosphere according to the clausius clapeyron equation held and soden 2006 which indeed increases under the pgw environments see fig 8 the increase in relative humidity in turn results in the development of cumulus clouds in the troposphere also it should be noted that there is a shift in the spatial distribution of the total amount of precipitation between future and present climate cases fig 9 fig 10 and tables 4 and 5 show the results of the discharge calculations for the historical and future cases there are no in situ observations regarding the river discharge rate in this area making it difficult to assess the accuracy of the river discharge simulations nevertheless the mean discharge rate was 1380 22 m3 s for domain 2 cases which is under the annual maximum discharge rate from 2003 to 2005 in the white volta river ndehedehe et al 2017 the ratio between total mean river discharge and cumulative mean precipitation i e runoff ratio among eight ensemble cases was roughly calculated to be 6 3 the value in domain 2 covering the entire volta river basin was close to the runoff ratio of 6 1 for the nearby sissili river catchment calculated at the gauge wiasi arnault et al 2016 although the runoff ratio in arnault et al 2016 was evaluated for all seasons and this ratio might differ for a single event in different locations based on these results it can be said that the soil moisture infiltration setup of wrf hydro in the present study can be considered realistic for the ensemble simulations the peak discharge rate was highly dependent on the spatial distribution of intense rainfall in cases where the intense rainfall was calculated in the upper area of the volta river basin e g m6c1b1d2 and m5c1b1d2 fig 9 the river discharge significantly increased in the historical cases i e present climate condition regarding the differences in peak discharge rates between the present climate and future climate even though a significantly large peak discharge reached nearly 5000 m3 s in the m5c1b1d2 case which contributed to an increase in the mean peak discharge in the present climate case the ensemble mean peak discharge in the pgw cases was larger than that in the present climate conditions see fig 10 interestingly regarding the relationship between peak discharge rate and accuracy of estimated inundation area the average value of peak discharge rate under pgw cases was larger compared to present cases where relatively robust four cases had f 2 value over 0 5 in the present climate m4c93b7d2 m4c14b5d2 m4c5b1d2 and m4c2b5d2 as described in detail in the next section table 5 on the contrary for the relatively not robust simulations i e f 2 value below 0 5 in the present climate conditions m6c5b6d2 m6c1b1d2 and m5c1b1d2 the ratio of peak discharge was lower under the pgw conditions than in the present conditions mainly because the simulated peak discharge rate was significantly larger under the present climate conditions 3 2 inundation simulations in historical cases the inundation simulation results for all the eight cases were compared with the sar estimations see fig 11 and table 5 the time interval for comparison was 18 00 19 00 utc on 13th september 2020 essentially using a one hour output interval of the simulation results given that the satellite acquired data on 18 19 utc 13th september the validation result of inundation simulation shows that the value of f 1 was around 0 7 which was in good agreement with the satellite data indeed the values of f 1 showed a slightly better accuracy than in previous studies where the f 1 was around 0 6 amarnath et al 2015 komi et al 2017 however the value of f 2 varied among the cases for example the f2 value was over 0 5 in cases where the peak discharge was between 500 1600 m3 s e g m4c93b7d2 m4c14b5d2 m4c5b1d2 and m4c2b5d2 however in the cases where the peak discharge rate was over 2000 m3 s m6c5b6d2 m6c1b1d2 and m5c1b1d2 the f 2 value was considerably lower and did not satisfy the requirement mentioned by ezzine et al 2020 these results imply that discharge of 500 1600 m3 s in the four cases could provide more accurate inundation extent therefore simulation cases with peak discharge rates between 500 1600 m3 s could be considered as relatively robust cases among the ensemble simulations 3 3 inundation simulations in pgw cases the results of the inundation simulations under the pgw experiments showed that the inundation area slightly increased in the domain 2 ensemble mean case fig 12 and table 6 as the river discharge rate would likely increase in association with increased amount of rainfall and shift in the intense rainfall area a comparison between the change rate of river discharge and the inundation area shows a clear connection where the former affects the latter as could be expected for example in the case of m4c93b7d2 and m4c5b1d2 the rate of increase in the inundation area was 1 31 and 1 20 table 6 corresponding to a change rate of river discharge of 3 26 and 2 66 in the peak respectively table 4 contrary for cases m5c1b1d2 and m4c14b5d2 the rate of increase in the inundation area was 0 75 and 0 93 table 6 and the ratio in the rate of river discharge was 0 11 and 0 40 in the peak respectively table 4 the rate of increase in the inundation area was 1 04 under the pgw ensemble mean case relative to the historical mean case as the river discharge increased by 1 05 in the peak in addition the increased discharge cases such as m4c93b7d2 m4c5b1d2 and m4c2b5d2 provide a more accurate estimation of the inundation extent in the present climate condition it may be said that the inundation extent is likely to increase under future climate change 4 discussion a framework composed of hydrometeorological inundation models has the potential to provide reasonable estimates of flooding inundation areas that are close to the satellite sar estimates in data sparse areas this methodology can provide inundation estimates all over the planet under a range of possible future climate conditions in this case ssp5 8 5 was explored komi et al 2017 already constructed a similar methodology composed of a hydrology inundation model which provided an accurate estimation of inundation areas that had a good agreement with satellite observations in the present study the authors added a meteorological model to the hydrology inundation simulation so that future climate projections can be simulated from rainfall to inundation by using the pgw method the amount of extreme rainfall can increase under the warmer environments constructed by the pgw method which is comparable with similar studies applying the pgw to tropical cyclones patricola and wehner 2018 and rainfall in the dry summer period in the kanto region in japan taniguchi 2015 taniguchi 2015 mentioned that lower humidity expected in the dry summer period under warmer environments can lead to a lower amount of extreme precipitation this correlates with the finding of the present research which also indicate that higher humidity in the pgw cases yields higher rainfalls elsewhere on the planet rainfall associated with tropical cyclones could also increase under warmer environments mainly due to the increase in water vapour holding capacity patricola and wehner 2018 the present results show that river discharge and inundation for the pgw conditions were larger than those in the present climate conditions for domain 2 this result can be consistent with li et al 2022 who showed an increasing trend of flooding from 2000 to 2020 in the white volta river from satellite analysis our result also implies that a local shift of rainfall can greatly affect simulated river discharge over a particular domain regarding future work the applicability of the methodology to other areas should be further examined in order to verify the accuracy of the inundation simulation calculated by the proposed model the inundation depth and river discharge rate predicted by the numerical models should be validated with actual field surveys of inundation extent gauge and current meter data however due to data sparsity in the case study region the amount of river discharge could not be validated as an alternative the authors carried out a validation of the inundation area using satellite data though it would be preferable that in the future measuring instrumentation be installed in the region 5 conclusions historical and future meteorological and river discharge simulations were performed to simulate the extreme river flood that occurred in september of 2020 in the upper reaches of the white volta river ghana the historical simulation of the cumulative precipitation and inundation area using the result of domain 2 of wrf hydro showed good agreement with satellite observations from gsmap and sar in numerical experiments using pgw fields ssp5 8 5 scenario the peak of the averaged river discharge for the ensemble four cases in the target area domain 2 increased by 1 05 and the inundation area on average increased by 1 04 1 0 km2 with respect to the historical event although there are still many uncertainties about how river discharge and its corresponding inundation might change in the future the results of the present case study suggest that these might increase at least under the most extreme ssp5 8 5 scenario by the end of the 21st century it is also important to note that regional shifts in precipitation changes are not only influenced by the bounded dynamics of regional modelling but rather global dynamics can have a significant impact on any given region the river discharge rate and inundation area simulation for the present climate condition in some cases were larger than those in the pgw conditions which was opposite from the mean results among the ensemble cases however there is low confidence in the results of the inundation area calculated in the case where the significantly high discharge rate was calculated which might imply that local shifts in the patterns of heavy rainfall could cause large variations in river discharge in some areas nevertheless based on the methodology and assumptions made under the pgw framework it would appear the future extreme precipitation and subsequent flooding events in the white volta river region have the potential of becoming more severe under warmer future climate conditions credit authorship contribution statement takayama r contributed to the conceptualization writing the original draft the

7762,study area upper white volta river study focus hydro meteorological inundation models were applied to simulate an extreme river flood that occurred in the upper white volta river in september of 2020 the predicted inundation area was in good agreement with the flood area estimated by sentinel 1a sar in addition pseudo global warming pgw simulations using the ssp5 8 5 shared socio economic pathway 5 8 5 scenario according to ipcc ar6 were conducted to evaluate the extreme rainfall and associated inundation area under warmer environmental conditions new hydrological insights for the region as a result of simulations the average future rainfall intensity is likely to increase mainly due to higher relative humidity in the regional atmosphere associated with these changes it is likely that the extent of the ensemble average future expected flooded area in the upper white volta river could slightly increase by 1 04 times under the pgw conditions compared with present climate conditions the result of this study implies that floods in the upper white volta river have the potential of becoming more severe under the most extreme future global warming scenarios graphical

warmer future atmosphere could hold a larger amount of water vapor according to the clausius clapeyron equation and thus potentially generate more precipitation held and soden 2006 while the physical

to create the initial and boundary conditions for the meteorological simulations dem data lehner et al 2008 at 3 arc seconds resolution obtained from the hydrosheds data seamless hydrographic data sampson et al 2021 was used to generate river channel data within domain 2 see fig 2 the target area for the simulations the northeastern part of the white volta river basin in ghana is shown in fig 2 meteorological conditions including precipitation were calculated for domains 1 2 in wrf horizontal resolutions of 18 km and 6 km respectively where domains 1 and 2 covered the entire white volta river basin wagner et al 2009 the discharge in domains 2 was calculated by employing wrf hydro fig 3 table 1 shows a summary of the settings used in wrf the calculation period was set from the beginning to the middle of september spanning the period when the flooding took place eight ensemble cases in domain 2 m6c5b6d2 m6c5b1d2 m6c1b1d2 m5c1b1d2 m4c93b7d2 m4c14b5d2 m4c5b1d2 and m4c2b5d2 were set by considering different combinations of physical schemes as shown in table 1 the selection of combination of physical schemes in wrf were based on the previous studies naabil et al 2017 gdobe et al 2019 table 2 summarizes the parameters employed in the wrf hydro chanparm tbl indicates river characteristics and genparm tbl the surface characteristics refkdt data is a parameter that determines the degree of infiltration of rainfall into the soil which has been highlighted as being important in other studies e g naabil et al 2017 and was set to 1 5 according to naabil et al 2017 who also investigated the tono basin inside volta river basin the bottom width bw initial depth of water surface hlink side slope chsslp and manning s roughness coefficient mannn were derived from hydrosheds data see table 2 the topography grid spacing for wrf hydro depends on input data and locality for instance kim et al 2021 tested 250 m 125 m and 50 m spacings and found the 125 m resolution to perform the best for river discharge likewise in this study various spacings were tested and a 250 m grid spacing in domain 2 was used in wrf hydro for the simulations of wrf hydro the subsurface routing option and overland flow routing option were activated in addition the channel routing option was activated with diffusive wave gridded the bucket model was not employed in this study 2 3 nays 2d flood nays 2d flood iric 2021 is a flood flow solver developed by iric international river interface cooperative for unsteady two dimensional inundation flow analysis using general curvilinear and boundary fit coordinates this solver has been applied to the analysis of inundation flows in small and medium sized river basins as it is easy to set up the inflow conditions and the computational domain the model setup is as follows firstly an approximately 70 m curvilinear computational grid was created by interpolating the srtm 90 m resolution topographic data through the iric software fig 4 finally the time series data of the inflow volume was inputted at the edge of the grid as the inflow boundary condition and detailed conditions such as size of computational grids and manning s roughness coefficient were set see table 3 the computational domain of nays 2d flood is shown in fig 4 and the settings for the model are provided in table 3 this study area has several small villages and many farmlands that were affected by the flood see fig 5 between the upper eastern region and northern eastern region state boundaries close to arigu and pwalugu villages sentinel 1a satellite imagery showed that indeed flooding took place in this area the computational domain dimensions were set as 3 95 km wide and 16 km long in the flow direction to cover the maximum inundation area in the nays 2d flood model table 3 the numerical simulation of inundation flow was conducted by inputting the results of wrf hydro s discharge as the inflow boundary condition at the upstream end of the grid fig 4 the calculation period was the same as in wrf hydro 2 4 pseudo global warming experiments in this study the mean differences in atmospheric temperature at skin temperature st relative humidity rh and geopotential height ght for the month of september between 2015 and 2024 and 2081 2100 were obtained from 26 gcms listed in appendix a these were based on the ssp5 8 5 scenario and were used to construct the warmer environments over the domains employed for the simulations in wrf details of the pgw method follow that of nakamura et al 2016 2020 mäll et al 2017 2020 and nakamura and mäll 2021 the differences between four physical variables on the gcm grid coordinate systems were interpolated into the computational grids of the domains in wrf using inverse distance weighting the difference of the average value of the variables between present and future climate from 26 gcms was added to the meteorological initial and boundary conditions of wrf simulations it should be noted that the ssp5 8 5 scenario is the worst case business as usual scenario among the ssp scenarios ipcc 2021 the calculation was performed by changing the initial and boundary conditions in wrf and evaluating the changes of each parameter after the warming fig 6 shows the outline of the pgw experiment and the obtained differences the overall ensemble mean tends to increase in the stratosphere while the atmospheric temperature and geopotential height increase and decrease from the troposphere to a certain point in the stratosphere an average increase of 3 25 c is observed for the sea and land surface temperature for the month of september between 2015 and 2024 and 2081 2100 within the parent domain of wrf the difference in mean surface temperature between the global average and the study area can be attributed to seasonality region and selected gcms nevertheless the overall tendency of the atmospheric vertical profiles is consistent with previous studies nakamura et al 2020 mäll et al 2020 nakamura and mäll 2021 2 5 validation data for precipitation and extent of the inundation areas validation of the simulated area averaged cumulative precipitation and the extent of the inundation area was conducted as detailed below 2 5 1 precipitation validation using gsmap gsmap global satellite mapping of precipitation is a global rainfall map with a spatial distribution of 0 1 arc degrees which combines multiple precipitation observation and geostationary meteorological satellites with the dual frequency precipitation radar onboard the main satellite under the global precipitation measurement gpm project okamoto et al 2005 it is used not only for research purposes but also in a wide range of fields such as meteorology and disaster prevention ushio et al 2009 in this study the area averaged cumulative rainfall between nearly 4 33 w 1 27 e and 8 85 14 32 n in domain 2 provided by gsmap nrt a quasi real time version of gsmap was compared with the area averaged rainfall simulation results from wrf hydro the grids in wrf hydro s domains 2 were interpolated into a 0 1 arc degree spatial resolution to match the satellite data resolution for validation 2 5 2 sentinel 1a sar data sentinel 1a sar attema et al 2010 is a synthetic aperture radar image in which microwaves are emitted from a satellite and then the reflected waves are observed in this study sar data showing the observed extent of inundation by the sentinel 1a was acquired and processed by removing speckle noise and determining the threshold between inundated and non inundated areas see fig 5 the output images were intersected with the inundation area output from the nays 2d flood simulation using the arcgis intersect tool horrit et al 2007 ezzine et al 2020 the following indices 1 2 were used to validate the calculated inundation area compared with the sentinel 1a observations 1 f 1 a a b c 2 f 2 a b a b c where a denotes the area consisting of cells correctly predicted by the model b denotes the area consisting of cells predicted as wet but observed as dry overprediction and c the cells predicted as dry but observed as wet underprediction f 2 was used to evaluate the overprediction of the inundation area f 1 can take a value between 0 and 1 and f 2 between 1 and 1 in both f 1 and f 2 a value of 1 would indicate a perfect agreement between simulations and observations ezzine et al 2020 mentioned values of f 1 and f 2 over 0 5 as being satisfactory 3 results 3 1 total precipitation and river discharge the results of the cumulative precipitation simulated under present and future climate conditions are shown in fig 7 compared with the gsmap the calculated total precipitation and hourly precipitation in the present climate were well reproduced before 18 00 on 13th september the time when inundation was observed by the sar images overall the total cumulative simulated rainfall was 1 22 times larger in the domain 2 at 18 00 on 13th september respectively relative to gsmap this indicates a slight overestimation by the model although this is similar to that of other studies of extreme rainfalls in east africa e g nooni et al 2022 the cumulative rainfall increases under pgw conditions are also shown in fig 7 the ensemble mean cumulative rainfall in the pgw cases increased by 28 for domains 2 compared to the present climate until the end of simulations particularly the amount of precipitation simulated around 10th september sharply increased under future cases relative to the present climate this tendency that future extreme precipitation is likely to be intensified under a future climate is consistent with the ipcc ar6 report section b 3 1 spm ipcc 2021 the physical background for the increase can be attributed to an increase in the humidity contained in the atmosphere according to the clausius clapeyron equation held and soden 2006 which indeed increases under the pgw environments see fig 8 the increase in relative humidity in turn results in the development of cumulus clouds in the troposphere also it should be noted that there is a shift in the spatial distribution of the total amount of precipitation between future and present climate cases fig 9 fig 10 and tables 4 and 5 show the results of the discharge calculations for the historical and future cases there are no in situ observations regarding the river discharge rate in this area making it difficult to assess the accuracy of the river discharge simulations nevertheless the mean discharge rate was 1380 22 m3 s for domain 2 cases which is under the annual maximum discharge rate from 2003 to 2005 in the white volta river ndehedehe et al 2017 the ratio between total mean river discharge and cumulative mean precipitation i e runoff ratio among eight ensemble cases was roughly calculated to be 6 3 the value in domain 2 covering the entire volta river basin was close to the runoff ratio of 6 1 for the nearby sissili river catchment calculated at the gauge wiasi arnault et al 2016 although the runoff ratio in arnault et al 2016 was evaluated for all seasons and this ratio might differ for a single event in different locations based on these results it can be said that the soil moisture infiltration setup of wrf hydro in the present study can be considered realistic for the ensemble simulations the peak discharge rate was highly dependent on the spatial distribution of intense rainfall in cases where the intense rainfall was calculated in the upper area of the volta river basin e g m6c1b1d2 and m5c1b1d2 fig 9 the river discharge significantly increased in the historical cases i e present climate condition regarding the differences in peak discharge rates between the present climate and future climate even though a significantly large peak discharge reached nearly 5000 m3 s in the m5c1b1d2 case which contributed to an increase in the mean peak discharge in the present climate case the ensemble mean peak discharge in the pgw cases was larger than that in the present climate conditions see fig 10 interestingly regarding the relationship between peak discharge rate and accuracy of estimated inundation area the average value of peak discharge rate under pgw cases was larger compared to present cases where relatively robust four cases had f 2 value over 0 5 in the present climate m4c93b7d2 m4c14b5d2 m4c5b1d2 and m4c2b5d2 as described in detail in the next section table 5 on the contrary for the relatively not robust simulations i e f 2 value below 0 5 in the present climate conditions m6c5b6d2 m6c1b1d2 and m5c1b1d2 the ratio of peak discharge was lower under the pgw conditions than in the present conditions mainly because the simulated peak discharge rate was significantly larger under the present climate conditions 3 2 inundation simulations in historical cases the inundation simulation results for all the eight cases were compared with the sar estimations see fig 11 and table 5 the time interval for comparison was 18 00 19 00 utc on 13th september 2020 essentially using a one hour output interval of the simulation results given that the satellite acquired data on 18 19 utc 13th september the validation result of inundation simulation shows that the value of f 1 was around 0 7 which was in good agreement with the satellite data indeed the values of f 1 showed a slightly better accuracy than in previous studies where the f 1 was around 0 6 amarnath et al 2015 komi et al 2017 however the value of f 2 varied among the cases for example the f2 value was over 0 5 in cases where the peak discharge was between 500 1600 m3 s e g m4c93b7d2 m4c14b5d2 m4c5b1d2 and m4c2b5d2 however in the cases where the peak discharge rate was over 2000 m3 s m6c5b6d2 m6c1b1d2 and m5c1b1d2 the f 2 value was considerably lower and did not satisfy the requirement mentioned by ezzine et al 2020 these results imply that discharge of 500 1600 m3 s in the four cases could provide more accurate inundation extent therefore simulation cases with peak discharge rates between 500 1600 m3 s could be considered as relatively robust cases among the ensemble simulations 3 3 inundation simulations in pgw cases the results of the inundation simulations under the pgw experiments showed that the inundation area slightly increased in the domain 2 ensemble mean case fig 12 and table 6 as the river discharge rate would likely increase in association with increased amount of rainfall and shift in the intense rainfall area a comparison between the change rate of river discharge and the inundation area shows a clear connection where the former affects the latter as could be expected for example in the case of m4c93b7d2 and m4c5b1d2 the rate of increase in the inundation area was 1 31 and 1 20 table 6 corresponding to a change rate of river discharge of 3 26 and 2 66 in the peak respectively table 4 contrary for cases m5c1b1d2 and m4c14b5d2 the rate of increase in the inundation area was 0 75 and 0 93 table 6 and the ratio in the rate of river discharge was 0 11 and 0 40 in the peak respectively table 4 the rate of increase in the inundation area was 1 04 under the pgw ensemble mean case relative to the historical mean case as the river discharge increased by 1 05 in the peak in addition the increased discharge cases such as m4c93b7d2 m4c5b1d2 and m4c2b5d2 provide a more accurate estimation of the inundation extent in the present climate condition it may be said that the inundation extent is likely to increase under future climate change 4 discussion a framework composed of hydrometeorological inundation models has the potential to provide reasonable estimates of flooding inundation areas that are close to the satellite sar estimates in data sparse areas this methodology can provide inundation estimates all over the planet under a range of possible future climate conditions in this case ssp5 8 5 was explored komi et al 2017 already constructed a similar methodology composed of a hydrology inundation model which provided an accurate estimation of inundation areas that had a good agreement with satellite observations in the present study the authors added a meteorological model to the hydrology inundation simulation so that future climate projections can be simulated from rainfall to inundation by using the pgw method the amount of extreme rainfall can increase under the warmer environments constructed by the pgw method which is comparable with similar studies applying the pgw to tropical cyclones patricola and wehner 2018 and rainfall in the dry summer period in the kanto region in japan taniguchi 2015 taniguchi 2015 mentioned that lower humidity expected in the dry summer period under warmer environments can lead to a lower amount of extreme precipitation this correlates with the finding of the present research which also indicate that higher humidity in the pgw cases yields higher rainfalls elsewhere on the planet rainfall associated with tropical cyclones could also increase under warmer environments mainly due to the increase in water vapour holding capacity patricola and wehner 2018 the present results show that river discharge and inundation for the pgw conditions were larger than those in the present climate conditions for domain 2 this result can be consistent with li et al 2022 who showed an increasing trend of flooding from 2000 to 2020 in the white volta river from satellite analysis our result also implies that a local shift of rainfall can greatly affect simulated river discharge over a particular domain regarding future work the applicability of the methodology to other areas should be further examined in order to verify the accuracy of the inundation simulation calculated by the proposed model the inundation depth and river discharge rate predicted by the numerical models should be validated with actual field surveys of inundation extent gauge and current meter data however due to data sparsity in the case study region the amount of river discharge could not be validated as an alternative the authors carried out a validation of the inundation area using satellite data though it would be preferable that in the future measuring instrumentation be installed in the region 5 conclusions historical and future meteorological and river discharge simulations were performed to simulate the extreme river flood that occurred in september of 2020 in the upper reaches of the white volta river ghana the historical simulation of the cumulative precipitation and inundation area using the result of domain 2 of wrf hydro showed good agreement with satellite observations from gsmap and sar in numerical experiments using pgw fields ssp5 8 5 scenario the peak of the averaged river discharge for the ensemble four cases in the target area domain 2 increased by 1 05 and the inundation area on average increased by 1 04 1 0 km2 with respect to the historical event although there are still many uncertainties about how river discharge and its corresponding inundation might change in the future the results of the present case study suggest that these might increase at least under the most extreme ssp5 8 5 scenario by the end of the 21st century it is also important to note that regional shifts in precipitation changes are not only influenced by the bounded dynamics of regional modelling but rather global dynamics can have a significant impact on any given region the river discharge rate and inundation area simulation for the present climate condition in some cases were larger than those in the pgw conditions which was opposite from the mean results among the ensemble cases however there is low confidence in the results of the inundation area calculated in the case where the significantly high discharge rate was calculated which might imply that local shifts in the patterns of heavy rainfall could cause large variations in river discharge in some areas nevertheless based on the methodology and assumptions made under the pgw framework it would appear the future extreme precipitation and subsequent flooding events in the white volta river region have the potential of becoming more severe under warmer future climate conditions credit authorship contribution statement takayama r contributed to the conceptualization writing the original draft the

7763,study region the sanjiang plain sjp located at the confluence reaches of the heilong songhua and wusuli rivers in northeast china study focus this study aimed to quantify the effects of varying climate and land use land cover lulc dynamics on green water gw over the sjp during two distinctive periods i e pre 2000 and post 2000 when synergetic effects of increased precipitation and temperature and rapid development of agriculture occurred this assessment used the distributed eco hydrological model essi 3 multivariable and multi objective calibration approaches i e discharge evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage anomaly were used to ensure the high accuracies of the model outputs new hydrological insights for the region this research concluded that gw flow and gw storage in the sjp evidently increased after 2000 compared with before across the sjp gw flow and gw storage responded differently to climate changes and lulc dynamics during pre 2000 and post 2000 period our results demonstrated that gw storage changes were predominately affected by climatic changes especially variations in precipitation whose contribution accounted for more than 56 after 2000 however gw flow changes were mainly governed by lulc changes especially the influence of cropland transformation whose contribution increased over 20 in the post 2000 period this study posed a deep insight regarding impacts of regional climatic and lulc changes on gw dynamics which may benefit decision making for planting structure optimization and adjustment over the region graphical abstract ga1 keywords green water climatic and lulc changes essi 3 model hydrological simulation remotely sensed information sanjiang plain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is the most valuable resource on our earth degano et al 2021 water resources can be divided into blue water bw and green water gw quinteiro et al 2018 gw refers to the water infiltrated by precipitation and stored in unsaturated soil layers green water storage and also refers to the actual evapotranspiration et released into the atmosphere by the combination of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration green water flow fisher et al 2017 ma et al 2021 bw is freely flowing liquid water at the surface and in the subsurface layers i e water in rivers streams and groundwater falkenmark and rockström 2006 pioneer studies have reported that gw contributes significantly more to the human water consumption than bw at a global scale especially for agricultural products 87 xie et al 2020 furthermore comparisons of different models such as hydrological model agricultural model and vegetation growth model reveal that gw utilization rate of global agricultural production is approximately four or five times higher than the bw utilization rate hoff et al 2010 thereby gw is a vital water resource to support vegetation growth especially in the rain fed crop regions qiao et al 2014 velpuri et al 2017 it is an indisputable fact that the global warming has brought great pressure on agriculture water resources worldwide luan et al 2018 based on climate and socioeconomic changes mid and high latitude regions will face greater agriculture water stresses in the 21st century including greater regional disparities in the distribution of agriculture water availability and increased agricultural water requirements fabre et al 2015 both the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change and the fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations have ranked agriculture as one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change especially for developing countries veettil et al 2022 the increase of temperature with the increase of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions as well as the frequent occurrence of extreme climate events under climate change pose a direct impact on the growth of crops which will reduce the amount of agriculture water resources available and intensify the contradiction between crop water supply and demand azzam et al 2022 additionally the transformation of lulc types the adjustment of planting area and structure will also have a significant impact on agricultural water supply and water demand sivakumar 2011 mehrotra et al 2013 li et al 2021 thus information regarding the quantity and spatial temporal variations of regional and global gw and identification of its driving forces are fundamental needs for better understanding and managing regional ecosystem to ensure the safety of agricultural production which have become emerging issues in the field of environmental studies jeyrani et al 2021 hydrological models are helpful to quantitatively understand dynamics of gw variations and using them in conjunction with analyses of climate and lulc changes can provide essential information about the impacts of these factors on gw dynamics krysanova and white 2015 the choice of model depends on the availability of data the size of the problem the characteristics of the study region the desired spatial and temporal resolution the degree of error allowed the uncertainty of the simulation and the robustness of the model faramarzi et al 2017 ma and szilagyi 2019 ma and zhang 2022 hydrological models such as swat soil and water assessment tool and vic variable infiltration capacity are usually used for such purposes however for the semi distributed hydrological model swat the hydrologic response unit hru input approach of basic geographic data limits the comprehensive utilization of spatial distribution information of the driving data such as the gridded meteorological data and the gridded remotely sensed lulc and vegetation products liang et al 1994 chen et al 2019b guiamel and lee 2020 as a fully distributed macroscale hydrological model vic predicts various temporal spatial variations of surface processes at coarse resolutions in regional and continental scales but cannot simulate hydrological processes at high resolution zhang et al 2021 in addition the leaf area index lai remains constant within one month and is kept stable for each month of a year this oversimplification of crop growth constrains the vic model in accurate simulations of vegetation transpiration and soil moisture estimations siad et al 2019 therefore these hydrological models are not suitable for simulating the spatial distribution of hydrological components related to gw and thus the simulated results can t be used to estimate the temporal and spatial difference of gw under climate and underlying surface changes as a physically based distributed hydrological model that exploits spatially and temporally varying climate forcing and model driven parameters on maximum essi 3 the third version of the infiltration excess and saturation excess soil water integration model for hydrology has demonstrated excellent performances in hydrological simulations of various watersheds with different catchment sizes under various climatic conditions zhang and zhang 2006 xu et al 2009 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2015 chen and zhang 2019 wang et al 2022 it is worth emphasizing that preparation of reliable input model parameters is the essential step toward a dependable estimation of regional hydrology the soil and vegetation parameterization methods commonly used in hydrological models are normally based on parameter lookup table however these static parameter values e g lai soil hydraulic and thermal properties determined by soil and lulc type data cannot adequately reflect the spatiotemporal heterogeneity thus leading to additional uncertainties ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2021 an advancement of the essi 3 model is that the soil and vegetation related parameters are typically based on globally or regionally oriented spatiotemporal soil characteristics and vegetation parameters products derived from several types of remotely sensed dataset based on the soil parameters e g soil texture and bulk density and pedotransfer functions dai et al 2013 the grid based soil hydraulic properties e g saturated hydraulic conductivity saturated water content and permanent wilting point can be obtained to ensure that the model simulation of evapotranspiration and soil moisture meets the accuracy requirements wang et al 2022 in addition considering the continuity of the vegetation growth process a time dimensional approach is usually used to interpolate the long term dynamic vegetation parameters like lai to a daily scale zhang and zhang 2006 chen et al 2018 therefore essi 3 model was adopted in this research to simulate the regional hydrological processes for better understanding the gw water resource partitioning and its dynamic changes due to the unique natural conditions e g flat terrain fertile soil suitable climate and abundant water sources the sanjiang plain sjp is suitable for the development of agriculture jin et al 2016 after years of development and construction the sjp has become the most important commercial grain production base and the key edible oil production base ensuring country s food security of china fu et al 2020 however rapid population growth and enhanced industrialization over the sjp in recent decades have led to enormous pressure in water resource partitioning for the key croplands and wetlands of the region hao et al 2016 owing to the excessive pursuit of economic benefits the planting area of crops in the sjp has increased sharply which makes the water resource shortage for agricultural purposes become severe day by day moreover climate change has increased the occurrence frequency of extreme climate events which pose serious impact on crop growth and alter the hydrological processes in the sjp region wang et al 2011 thus it is essential to understand the current hydrological regime by evaluating the impacts of climate and underlying surface changes on hydrological processes of the region for water resource management and regional sustainable development as a microcosm of a water scarce region the water resource partitioning of the sjp is strongly influenced by climate and lulc changes and the gw variations in response to these changes have drawn extensive attention due to the importance of gw in regional sustainability sun et al 2022 nevertheless few knowledge about this issue is available from literature especially regarding its insufficient and fragmented temporal and spatial information furthermore some researches have addressed the influences of lulc changes on hydrology with focus mainly on the transition of land use from cropland to grassland due to its ecological function while the influences of other lulc changes i e wetland degradation was ignored therefore to quantitatively explore water resource partitioning for sustainable management policymaking across the sjp a comprehensive study was conducted under the context of significant climatic change characterized by the increased precipitation and temperature as well as the enhanced anthropogenic activities represented by rapid development of agriculture the study period 1985 2018 was divided into two periods 1985 1999 and 2000 2018 before and after 2000 this research mainly addressed the issues of the spatial temporal variations of the gw dynamics at the whole region and pixel scale in the two distinctive periods the isolated and combined impacts of climate and lulc changes on gw dynamics throughout the sjp and relative contributions of each lulc type and climate factor on gw variations were also systematically investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located in mid and high latitude region the sanjiang plain sjp 43 49 55 48 27 40 n 129 11 20 135 05 26 e

water content and water storage tension thus the soil water storage of the essi 3 model is partitioned into three layers individual stores the vertical root distribution information and oxygen stress of roots are also considered when the soil water content approaches saturation chen and zhang 2019 mainly from the perspective of water balance the groundwater component is integrated in the essi 3 model the groundwater storage is considered based on a first order linear reservoir approach and a simple groundwater model with recharge from the third soil layer capillary rise and discharge into streams wang et al 2022 the groundwater consumption module e g the groundwater withdrawal is not considered in the model as such the groundwater component of essi 3 model is likely unsatisfactory due

processes with time by inhibiting uncertainties in model structure and physical parameterizations gw flow defined in this study is the sum of actual evapotranspiration and gw storage is defined as the

simulations were conducted during the period 1982 2018 with the first three years serving as a warm up period the simulation results for the period of 1982 1984 is not considered in the following analysis for balancing main hydrological component conditions such as soil and groundwater aquifers and the remaining years being used for calibration and validation since the driving data input to the model had multiple spatial resolutions the bilinear interpolation approach was used to generate grid datasets with a consistent spatial resolution 1 km gao et al 2018 wang et al 2022 2 3 2 model validation the water yield of the sjp only accounts for a small part of the discharge through the mainstream of heilong songhua and wusuli rivers therefore using the measured discharge from the mainstream is not appropriate for calibrating and validating the model wen et al 2020 essi 3 model was calibrated and verified by using the measured discharge from four hydrologic stations on the representative tributaries of the songhua river and wusuli river in the study area the geolocation of these river basins and the corresponding hydrological stations were presented in fig 1 since daily observed discharge data were not available the model calibration was performed at monthly scale the main characteristics of these hydrometric stations and time periods of available streamflow data for model evaluation were shown in table 2 to evaluate model performance in evapotranspiration simulations the etmod16 product sequence was used as reference data of actual evapotranspiration in this study the modis terrestrial et product uses the penman monteith equation to estimate the sum of the evaporation from wet and dry soil layers the evaporation from canopy water retention and the transpiration from plant leaves and stems mu et al 2011 kisi 2016 therefore the mod16a2 et product was adopted to evaluate the actual evapotranspiration simulated by the essi 3 model sms is a key state variable of the regional hydrological cycle however it is difficult to assess the accuracy of simulated sms based on in situ measurements owing to the scarcity of gauged stations gao et al 2018 thus the terrestrial water storage tws simulated in essi 3 model was evaluated as an alternative solution for sms assessment the grace based tws data were utilized to evaluate the performance of the essi 3 model in tws simulations tws is defined as all phases of water stored above and below the earth s surface including soil moisture snow ice surface water groundwater and water contained in biomass chen et al 2019b in general a change in tws can be computed as 3 δ t w s δ s m s δ g w s δ c w s δ s w e where sms is the soil moisture storage swe is the snow water equivalent cws is the total canopy water storage gws is the groundwater storage tws simulated by essi 3 model can be computed as 4 δ t w s e s s i 3 δ s w c 1 δ s w c 2 δ s w c 3 δ g w s δ c w s δ s w e where swc1 swc2 swc3 swe cws and gws represent the first second and third layer of soil moisture storage snow water equivalent plant canopy water and groundwater storage from essi 3 model respectively tws of the study region was estimated with the grace based tws monthly changes of the grace based tws dataset was made available since april 2002 tapley et al 2004 soni and syed 2015 currently different processing centers offer various tws series however no data series of tws was confirmed as the best in quality landerer et al 2015 in the present study jpl csr and gsfc mascon solutions within the study region were extracted and compared to investigate tws from 2003 to 2016 in addition the scaling factors were used to modify their corresponding mascon grids for better comparisons between the grace based tws and the essi 3 simulated ones grace based tws were specifically computed relative to a timely mean baseline from jan 2004 to dec 2009 including every month of a year for comparisons essi 3 simulated outputs against grace based tws the baseline value over the 2004 2009 period of each simulated components was computed and subtracted from all time steps three common evaluation indicators i e the correlation coefficient r the nash sutcliff efficiency nse and the determination coefficient r 2 equations can be found in the study of chen et al 2019b were calculated for model evaluation 2 3 3 establishment of climate and lulc scenarios in order to quantitatively assess the green water response to climate and lulc changes three scenarios were established by combining different climate periods and lulc conditions based on the changing tendency of climate and lulc as shown in section 3 2 the meteorological data were divided into two periods the period of 1982 1999 and the period of 2000 2018 and the lulc map of 1980 and 2018 were selected to represent the lulc conditions during two periods as shown in fig 2 by comparing the simulation results under different scenarios the isolated and combined influences of climate change and lulc change on gw were quantitatively analyzed as shown in table 3 based on the simulated results under these scenarios the contributions of climate change and lulc change was estimated as follows 5 contribution c lim ate s 2 s 1 s 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 100 6 contribution l u l c s 3 s 2 s 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 100 2 3 4 relative contributions of single climatic factor and lulc type to explore the relative contribution of different lulc types the contribution index proposed by ahlström et al 2015 was used to partition the contribution of each lulc class to the gw musavi et al 2017 the contribution index fj was expressed as 7 f j t x j t x t x t t x t 8 x t j x j t where xjt is the anomaly value for gw of grid j at time t in years and xt is the anomaly value of gw in the whole region the value of fj ranges from 1 1 grid with higher and positive score means a greater contribution in governing gw to estimate the relative importance of different climatic factors i e wind speed pressure relative humidity precipitation temperature and solar radiation to gw changes the lmg method was used the lmg method identifies the direct contributions of a variable and its combined contributions with all other predictors fernández martínez et al 2014 this measure has the important advantage that the results do not depend on the order of predictors in the model as it clearly identifies nonlinear relationships between dependent and explanatory variables lee and biggs 2015 for details see groemping 2006 and the r package relaimpo 2 2 3 was us to calculate the lmg indicator groemping 2006 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of model performance model calibration and verification for essi 3 model at four hydrological stations were shown in table 4 the model performances for every selected subbasin were evaluated by nse and r 2 the observed and simulated discharge at representative caizuizi station on the naoli river a tributary of the wusuli river and baoquanling hydrological station on the wutong river a tributary of the songhua river are plotted in fig 3 for comparisons for calibration and validation periods model performance with r 2 of 0 82 0 92 and 0 81 0 83 and nse of 0 77 0 89 and 0 74 0 83 respectively suggested excellence of the essi 3 model in hydrological simulations in sjp fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of the correlation between et essi3 and et mod16 from 2000 to 2018 it can be observed that correlation coefficients over larger than 96 of the study region were greater than 0 8 for those with relatively low correlation coefficients 0 9 r 0 8 cropland took the predominant land use type mod16 did not distinguish and parameterize c3 and c4 crops which may result in a relatively low correlation between et essi3 and et mod16 for those regions in contrast the different parameterization schemes for evapotranspiration estimation from c3 and c4 crops in the essi 3 model were specifically designed therefore the evapotranspiration simulated by the essi 3 model was more refined and close to the actual conditions for these grids shown in blue with low correlation coefficients r 0 5 the underlying surface type is mainly rivers there is no doubt that water surface evaporation based on remote sensing estimation and model simulation will have large errors the blank grids are due to the special treatment of some special areas e g cities ice and snow and water bodies in the mod16 dataset fig 5 shows the monthly twsa derived from the three mascon solutions the essi 3 model and two lsm models vic model and noah model the simulated result of essi 3 model exhibited a high consistency over the period of 2003 2016 with those grace based solutions as shown in table 5 for the twsa simulated by the essi 3 and grace derived the results indicated a high agreement with r ranging from 0 65 to 0 69 p 0 01 for the period of 2003 2016 grace derived twsa and monthly scale vic and noah model simulation also showed a similar trends in terrestrial water storage with the correlation coefficients of 0 65 0 70 and from 0 71 to 0 75 p 0 01 respectively although the long term trend agreement between grace derived twsa and essi 3 noah and vic model simulations was at a high level the differences appeared mostly in amplitude it can be observed that the essi 3 model presented the better fit with grace observations with the smaller variation difference amplitude of twsa the performance of vic noah and essi 3 model was measured by nse ranging 0 96 0 05 2 64 to 0 49 and 0 33 0 47 respectively the primary reason for this phenomenon was that anthropogenic activities were not considered in the vic noah and essi 3 model and the intensive agriculture irrigation and groundwater extraction in sjp put enormous pressure on tws especially the groundwater additionally water storage components provided by noah and vic just included swe cws and sms noah and vic models belong to lsms thus the groundwater storage component is not included chen et al 2019b however the groundwater storage component is included in essi 3 model to better characterize the water balance with respect to the monthly amplitude this difference highlighted that the noah and vic model was obviously underestimated or overestimated of twsa relative to essi 3 model owing to the lack of groundwater storage component thus variations in various hydrological states e g soil moisture storage component obtained from essi 3 model can better describe the dynamic characteristics of water storage components although the essi 3 model doesn t take terrestrial water storage changes caused by anthropogenic factors such as groundwater extraction into account in summary despite some uncertainties existed in hydrological simulations for specific seasons the et sms tws and runoff were all simulated with satisfactory precision this demonstrated the superiority of model simulations in producing various hydrological fluxes and states and laid the foundation for further estimating hydrological processes and investigating their variations and potential influencing factors 3 2 climate and lulc changes analysis to detect the temporal variations of climate factors in the sjp the mann kendall test was employed to examine the trends and abrupt changes of the temperature and precipitation from 1985 to 2018 at the confidence level of 95 fig 6a d presented the area averaged annual climate factors and mann kendall z value over the study region the mean annual temperature and precipitation over the sjp varied with an increased rate during the study period the sequential mann kendall tests for the annual precipitation as illustrated in fig 6c indicated an apparent abrupt change in 2005 meanwhile several abrupt changes occurred from 2000 to 2005 in temperature which suggested a significant abrupt change of climate factors took place around 2000 2005 over the sjp fig 7 exhibits the areas and ratios of seven primary land use cover types from 1980 to 2018 over the sjp in the year 1980 cropland forest and wetland took the predominant land use cover types accounting for approximately 36 05 34 93 and 14 32 of the total area of the sjp respectively to the year 2018 land use cover types changed dramatically with approximately 50 76 of the sjp changed to cropland 31 98 forest and 6 68 the wetland the agricultural land increased rapidly from 1980 to 2018 primarily due to the conversion of wetland and grassland to quantitatively investigate the change trend and lulc transformation among preliminary lulc types in the sjp the lulc transformations during 5 specific periods i e the period of 1980 1990 1990 2000 2000 2010 2010 2018 and 1980 2018 were calculated and the results are shown in fig 8 for the period from 1980 to 2018 the most significant area changes in the positive direction increasing trend were cropland while the opposite cases were grassland and wetland in the period of 1980 1990 the fastest area decreasing rate occurred in wetland followed by grassland with a decreasing rate of 28 10 and 13 51 respectively from 1990 2000 the fastest area decreasing took place in grassland followed by wetland with a decreasing rate of 44 06 and 21 69 respectively the area increasing rate for cropland in these two periods was approximately15 80 and 16 05 respectively for the two periods of 2000 2010 and 2010 2018 less area changes were found for all lulc types except for wetlands these results also suggested that the 2000 can be taken as a turning year subject to the abrupt changes in lulc over the sjp in summary to reasonably explain the dynamic influences of the climate change and lulc change across the sjp scenarios studies between pre and post 2000 were conducted for the purpose 3 3 the spatial temporal variations of the gw flow and storage in the sjp fig 9 plots the area averaged annual gw flow and gw storage estimated from the simulated hydrological processes with essi 3 model over the sjp from 1985 to 2018 generally relative higher gw flow and gw storage can be observed for the post 2000 period compared with the pre 2000 period the averaged gw flow and gw storage were 319 8 mm and 479 3 mm in pre 2000 period but slightly increased to 323 9 mm and 485 9 mm in post 2000 period respectively fig 10 shows the spatial patterns of the trend significance computed at the 95 significance level for time series gw flow and gw storage images under the influence of climate change and lulc change as exhibited in fig 10 a b apparent spatial heterogeneity for the changes of gw flow and gw storage from 1985 to 2018 over the sjp was carefully investigated the results indicated that about 50 84 of the study region showed an increasing tendency in terms of gw flow in which approximately 23 13 tended to increase significantly p 0 05 where the most obvious increasing trend occurred in the southeast and northeast region of the sjp on the contrary a decreasing trend in gw flow was significant over about 10 16 of the sjp area where the most significant reductions in gw flow were mainly distributed in the southwestern sjp area over past 34 years in the sjp 91 25 of the total study area had exhibited an increasing trend in gw storage and pixels with a significant increasing trend accounted for about 55 21 3 4 impacts of climate and lulc changes on gw flow and gw storage 3 4 1 across the sjp fig 11 demonstrates gw changes under the individual impact of climate change and lulc change as well as their combined effects for the whole sjp during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 gw flow increased by 4 4 mm considering the combined impacts of climate change and lulc change this increase was predominantly attributable to lulc changes which resulted in a 7 mm increase of gw flow while climate change contributed 2 6 mm decrease of gw flow in the opposite direction the gw storage also increased by 6 3 mm under the combined influences of climate and lulc changes a 7 2 mm increase of the gw storage was donated from the climate change while a 0 9 mm decrease of the gw storage was attributed to lulc change the results revealed that the gw flow and gw storage changes responding to climate and lulc changes differed considerably during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 throughout the sjp the gw flow increased with a principal contribution from the lulc change while the increase in gw storage was mainly influenced by climate change moreover opposite responses of gw flow to climate changes as well as the gw storage to lulc changes were found during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 the influence of climate change on gw flow was negative and climate change had a positive influence on gw storage which was opposed to the influence of lulc change the isolated influence of climate change and lulc change to gw flow and storage changes at pixel scale were also estimated to clarify if the contribution of either climate or lulc exceeded 50 to a single pixel this factor would be considered as the dominant factor governing the responses of either the gw flow or the gw storage for this pixel as illustrated in fig 12 53 of the gw flow changes at pixel scale was attributed to climate change during the periods of pre 2000 and post 2000 which emphasized that the gw flow change had a high sensitivity to climate change it also should be emphasized that in the majority 33 of these pixels the gw flow response to climate change were negative for the remaining pixels 46 of the gw flow variations were largely due to lulc change moreover the spatial distribution of dominant factor that governed the gw flow change exhibited highly scale dependent as observed in the whole sjp although more than half of these pixels 54 were affected by climate change lulc change still took the positive and predominant effect on the gw flow change in general which implied that the positive and negative impacts induced by the climate change could offset each other and weakened their impacts at the whole sjp scale for the responses of gw storage to either climate or lulc change and their joint effect the climate change contributed about 95 gw storage change at pixel scale with 89 positively and 6 negatively while lulc change contributed only 5 to the gw storage change over the remaining regions suggesting that climate change was the main factor controlling gw storage changes in sjp a noteworthy point was that gw flow under climate warming showed a decreasing during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 as shown in fig 11 climate warming undoubtedly increased the rate of soil moisture evaporation and vegetation transpiration azzam et al 2022 however due to the general weakening of solar radiation and wind speed the measured water surface evaporation at most meteorological and hydrological stations in china was decreasing which also inhibited vegetation transpiration wang et al 2018 the increase of co2 concentration also reduced the opening of leaf stomata and increased the resistance which was also an important factor to curb vegetation transpiration besides related studies showed that the calculated potential evapotranspiration of crop was also decreasing for the sjp ren et al 2019 on the other hand the prolongation of plant growth period and the increase of biomass caused by climate warming would also increase water consumption zhou et al 2021 however the plant growth period set in essi 3 model for this study was constant therefore gw flow i e actual evapotranspiration of farmland and ecosystem simulated by essi 3 model decreased after climate warming this founding also emphasized that whether the actual evapotranspiration of different regions and different crops increased or decreased after climate warming still needed to be measured and studied 3 4 2 dominant factors governing the gw flow and gw storage changes since lulc changes took the predominant role governing the gw flow changes over the sjp the impact of each lulc type on gw flow were further assessed in spite of the climate change effects using the contribution of land use cover change to gw flow as an indicator to reveal the relationship between the land use cover changes and the gw flow at different geographical locations and time according to statistics of lulc changes in the sjp in different time of study period in section 3 2 the significant land use conversion took place around 2000 with rapid area expansion of cropland and the shrinkage of forest grassland and wetland so the contributions of these four main land use types i e cropland forest grassland and wetland were distinguished the relative contribution rates for the remaining lulc types such as water settlement and bare soil were not shown due to the small proportion of the study region fig 13 presents each land use type and corresponding ratio to gw flow change during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 across the sjp before 2000 cropland contributed 37 64 to the gw flow change of the entire sjp followed by forest 31 79 wetland 17 67 and grassland 9 92 after 2000 the contribution of cropland exerted significantly to 58 84 while contributions of both wetland and grassland dropped to 5 85 and 4 16 respectively but the forest remained stable this result was similar to the historical lulc conversion patterns occurred in sjp where the majority of wetland and grassland was replaced by cropland during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 since climate change was the main factor controlling gw storage change the impacts of each climatic factor and corresponding ratio to gw storage change during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 across the sjp were investigated as presented in fig 14 before 2000 the relative contribution of precipitation to gw storage variation across the sjp was 42 42 followed by solar radiation 22 09 relative humidity 11 39 and wind speed 10 13 after 2000 the contribution of precipitation significantly increased to 56 80 followed by temperature 11 39 and relative humidity 10 13 the results indicated that precipitation remained the most important factor dominating gw storage change in addition because of the processes that simulated fluxes and water storage change occurred in soil aquifer climatic factors such as relative humidity and radiation which dominated changes in evapotranspiration and runoff components also affected soil hydrological processes therefore this study also highlighted the importance of these factors to gw storage 3 5 hydrological modelling uncertainty and limitations traditionally the hydrological models commonly use the single streamflow data for the model calibration and validation though this single evaluation approach is still being widely used around hydrological assessment more efforts have emphasized that a comprehensive calibration strategy e g intermediate gauges checking for additional variables and considering their spatial distribution not just at a specific point etc can achieve a better model performance puertes et al 2019 wen et al 2020 in this study two other water balance terms were selected for model validation firstly gw flow which represented actual evapotranspiration was carefully investigated the etmod16 product series were used as a reference to evaluate the model s performance in evapotranspiration simulation the mod16a2 product provides actual evapotranspiration estimates from the land surface which can be useful to evaluate the actual evapotranspiration simulated by the model additionally for gw storage representing soil moisture the model performance in the terrestrial soil moisture components simulations was carefully checked by comparing the results from the grace solutions the lsms and essi 3 model outputs and the results suggested that essi 3 model could effectively simulate the composition of gw yet ample space remained to improve some limitations that should be considered in the future in present study first because of the existing multi spatial resolutions input gridded datasets there was only a simplest method the bilinear interpolation method was used to downscale the coarse resolution climatic forecasts to fine resolution more advanced spatial downscaling approaches e g multilinear regression method random forests method artificial neural network method are suggested to be employed in the future studies for spatial performance improvement gao et al 2018 fortunately the satisfactory performance of the essi 3 simulations of various hydrological processes over the sjp ensured the present studies on the gw flow and storage second only five lulc maps that represented the underline condition of the sjp for specific periods were applied for simulations and the followed studies in the present study since lulc change is a dynamic process rather than abrupt change chen et al 2019a it is recommended to use more land use maps for better characterization of lulc dynamics in further studies thirdly this study did not consider the effects of other anthropogenic activities e g irrigation withdrawals reservoir regulation and topographic changes e g terrain and slope which were also significant driving factors in governing hydrological response to lulc changes wang et al 2022 4 conclusions in this study the essi 3 model was set up to assess the influences of climate and lulc changes on gw in the sjp of china the excellent capability of essi 3 model was confirmed by the strong correlations between the observed and simulated discharges the modis based and simulated evaporation the grace based and simulated twsa simulations showed that the combined effects of climate and lulc changes increased gw flow by 4 4 mm and increased gw storage by 6 3 mm during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 whereas gw flow and gw storage responded differently to climate and lulc changes climate change decreased gw flow by 2 6 mm and increased gw storage by 7 2 mm while lulc change had an opposite effect on gw flow increased by 7 mm and gw storage decreased by 0 9 mm although lulc change had a greater impact on gw flow than climate change for the whole sjp climate change altered gw flow to a greater extent than lulc change for the pixel scale accounting for 54 of the region moreover climate change played a more important role in gw storage for across the region and at pixel scale further analysis suggested that the contribution of cropland on gw flow exerted significantly from 37 64 to 58 84 during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 and the contribution of precipitation on gw storage increased from 42 42 before 2000 56 80 after 2000 although the hydrological modeling process in this study seems well represent the spatiotemporal distribution of green water there are some limitations associated with the study remain to be solved in future study especially for the uncertainty from input data e g precipitation and temperature the original spatial resolution of cmfd dataset is still coarse 0 1 for regional study and the data downscaling process from coarse resolution to fine resolution 1 km are unsatisfactory without combining various environmental variables to improve the accuracy and enhance the spatial information this implies that additional downscaling methods e g statistical downscaling methods need to be applied to obtain accurate high spatiotemporal gridded data this study can be used as a useful guideline for similar research to investigate the temporal and spatial pattern change and trend on green water under climate and lulc changes the findings of this study combined with related researches on crop water requirements can provides a scientific basis for suitable cultivation planning program and agricultural water management for crop production in sjp especially for rain fed crops credit authorship

7763,study region the sanjiang plain sjp located at the confluence reaches of the heilong songhua and wusuli rivers in northeast china study focus this study aimed to quantify the effects of varying climate and land use land cover lulc dynamics on green water gw over the sjp during two distinctive periods i e pre 2000 and post 2000 when synergetic effects of increased precipitation and temperature and rapid development of agriculture occurred this assessment used the distributed eco hydrological model essi 3 multivariable and multi objective calibration approaches i e discharge evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage anomaly were used to ensure the high accuracies of the model outputs new hydrological insights for the region this research concluded that gw flow and gw storage in the sjp evidently increased after 2000 compared with before across the sjp gw flow and gw storage responded differently to climate changes and lulc dynamics during pre 2000 and post 2000 period our results demonstrated that gw storage changes were predominately affected by climatic changes especially variations in precipitation whose contribution accounted for more than 56 after 2000 however gw flow changes were mainly governed by lulc changes especially the influence of cropland transformation whose contribution increased over 20 in the post 2000 period this study posed a deep insight regarding impacts of regional climatic and lulc changes on gw dynamics which may benefit decision making for planting structure optimization and adjustment over the region graphical abstract

introduction water is the most valuable resource on our earth degano et al 2021 water resources can be divided into blue water bw and green water gw quinteiro et al 2018 gw refers to the water infiltrated by precipitation and stored in unsaturated soil layers green water storage and also refers to the actual evapotranspiration et released into the atmosphere by the combination of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration green water flow fisher et al 2017 ma et al 2021 bw is freely flowing liquid water at the surface and in the subsurface layers i e water in rivers streams and groundwater falkenmark and rockström 2006 pioneer studies have reported that gw contributes significantly more to the human water consumption than bw at a global scale especially for agricultural products 87 xie et al 2020 furthermore comparisons of different models such as hydrological model agricultural model and vegetation growth model reveal that gw utilization rate of global agricultural production is approximately four or five times higher than the bw utilization rate hoff et al 2010 thereby gw is a vital water resource to support vegetation growth especially in the rain fed crop regions qiao et al 2014 velpuri et al 2017 it is an indisputable fact that the global warming has brought great pressure on agriculture water resources worldwide luan et al 2018 based on climate and socioeconomic changes mid and high latitude regions will face greater agriculture water stresses in the 21st century including greater regional disparities in the distribution of agriculture water availability and increased agricultural water requirements fabre et al 2015 both the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change and the fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations have ranked agriculture as one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change especially for developing countries veettil et al 2022 the increase of temperature with the increase of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions as well as the frequent occurrence of extreme climate events under climate change pose a direct impact on the growth of crops which will reduce the amount of agriculture water resources available and intensify the contradiction between crop water supply and demand azzam et al 2022 additionally the transformation of lulc types the adjustment of planting area and structure will also have a significant impact on agricultural water supply and water demand sivakumar 2011 mehrotra et al 2013 li et al 2021 thus information regarding the quantity and spatial temporal variations of regional and global gw and identification of its driving forces are fundamental needs for better understanding and managing regional ecosystem to ensure the safety of agricultural production which have become emerging issues in the field of environmental studies jeyrani et al 2021 hydrological models are helpful to quantitatively understand dynamics of gw variations and using them in conjunction with analyses of climate and lulc changes can provide essential information about the impacts of these factors on gw dynamics krysanova and white 2015 the choice of model depends on the availability of data the size of the problem the characteristics of the study region the desired spatial and temporal resolution the degree of error allowed the uncertainty of the simulation and the robustness of the model faramarzi et al 2017 ma and szilagyi 2019 ma and zhang 2022 hydrological models such as swat soil and water assessment tool and vic variable infiltration capacity are usually used for such purposes however for the semi distributed hydrological model swat the hydrologic response unit hru input approach of basic geographic data limits the comprehensive utilization of

simulate hydrological processes at high resolution zhang et al 2021 in addition the leaf area index lai remains constant within one month and is kept stable for each month of a year this oversimplification of crop growth constrains the vic model in accurate simulations of vegetation transpiration and soil moisture estimations siad et al 2019 therefore these hydrological models are not suitable for simulating the spatial distribution of hydrological components related to gw and thus the simulated results can t be used to estimate the temporal and spatial difference of gw under climate and underlying surface changes as a physically based distributed hydrological model that exploits spatially and temporally varying climate forcing and model driven parameters on maximum essi 3 the third version of the infiltration excess and saturation excess soil water integration model for hydrology has demonstrated excellent performances in hydrological simulations of various watersheds with different catchment sizes under various climatic conditions zhang and zhang 2006 xu et al 2009 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2015 chen and zhang 2019 wang et al 2022 it is worth emphasizing that preparation of reliable input model parameters is the essential step toward a dependable estimation of regional hydrology the soil and vegetation parameterization methods commonly used in hydrological models are normally based on parameter lookup table however these static parameter values e g lai soil hydraulic and thermal properties determined by soil and lulc type data cannot adequately reflect the spatiotemporal heterogeneity thus leading to additional uncertainties ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2021 an advancement of the essi 3 model is that the soil and vegetation related parameters are typically based on globally or regionally oriented spatiotemporal soil characteristics and vegetation parameters products derived from several types of remotely sensed dataset based on the soil parameters e g soil texture and bulk density and pedotransfer functions dai et al 2013 the grid based soil hydraulic properties e g saturated hydraulic conductivity saturated water content and permanent wilting point can be obtained to ensure that the model simulation of evapotranspiration and soil moisture meets the accuracy requirements wang et al 2022 in addition considering the continuity of the vegetation growth process a time dimensional approach is usually used to interpolate the long term dynamic vegetation parameters like lai to a daily scale zhang and zhang 2006 chen et al 2018 therefore essi 3 model was adopted in this research to simulate the regional hydrological processes for better understanding the gw water resource partitioning and its dynamic changes due to the unique natural conditions e g flat terrain fertile soil suitable climate and abundant water sources the sanjiang plain sjp is suitable for the development of agriculture jin et al 2016 after years of development and construction the sjp has become the most important commercial grain production base and the key edible oil production base ensuring country s food security of china fu et al 2020 however rapid population growth and enhanced industrialization over the sjp in recent decades have led to enormous pressure in water resource partitioning for the key croplands and wetlands of the region hao et al 2016 owing to the excessive pursuit of economic benefits the planting area of crops in the sjp has increased sharply which makes the water resource shortage for agricultural purposes become severe day by day moreover climate change has increased the occurrence frequency of extreme climate events which pose serious impact on crop growth and alter the hydrological processes in the sjp region wang et al 2011 thus it is essential to understand the current hydrological regime by evaluating the impacts of climate and underlying surface changes on hydrological processes of the region for water resource management and regional sustainable development as a microcosm of a water scarce region the water resource partitioning of the sjp is strongly influenced by climate and lulc changes and the gw variations in response to these changes have drawn extensive attention due to the importance of gw in regional sustainability sun et al 2022 nevertheless few knowledge about this issue is available from literature especially regarding its insufficient and fragmented temporal and spatial information furthermore some researches have addressed the influences of lulc changes on hydrology with focus mainly on the transition of land use from cropland to grassland due to its ecological function while the influences of other lulc changes i e wetland degradation was ignored therefore to quantitatively explore water resource partitioning for sustainable management policymaking across the sjp a comprehensive study was conducted under the context of significant climatic change characterized by the increased precipitation and temperature as well as the enhanced anthropogenic activities represented by rapid development of agriculture the study period 1985 2018 was divided into two periods 1985 1999 and 2000 2018 before and after 2000 this research mainly addressed the issues of the spatial temporal variations of the gw dynamics at the whole region and pixel scale in the two distinctive periods the isolated and combined impacts of climate and lulc changes on gw dynamics throughout the sjp and relative contributions of each lulc type and climate factor on gw variations were also systematically investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located in mid and high latitude region the sanjiang plain sjp 43 49 55 48 27 40 n 129 11 20 135 05 26 e plays critical roles as a biodiversity region a food production base and an ecological security barrier in northeastern china fig 1 the total area of this region is approximately 108 800 km2 which accounts for about 21 6 of heilongjiang province the terrain characteristic of the sjp is high in the southwest and low in the northeast three river systems namely the heilong songhua and wusuli rivers flow through the region which is renowned as a land of plenty shi et al 2015 the climate in the region is temperate humid and semi humid continental monsoon climate characterized by a rainy and humid summer and a cold and dry winter the annual average temperature and precipitation are between 1 4 and 3 6 c and 500 650 mm respectively fu et al 2020 sun et al 2022 the rainy season is mainly concentrated in summer and autumn accounting for approximately 80 of the annual rainfall lasting from june to september of a year abundant sunshine hours throughout the year ranging from 2400 to 2500

production of high quality rice maize and soybeans jin et al 2016 large scale reclamation began in the 1950 s and many large state owned farms were set up successively till approximately 2000 making this region the largest agricultural reclamation area and a vital commercial grain production base in china fu et al 2020 2 2 datasets to set up the hydrological model the detailed information of

observed discharge from four stations as shown in fig 1 on three main tributaries were collected from the hydrological yearbook of heilongjiang and the songhua river basin management organization for the period of 2007 2012 2 three mascon based grace gravity recovery and climate experiment products from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl m the center for space research at university of texas austin

variability of hydrological processes of the sjp briefly the essi 3 model which is based on energy balance and water balance and constituted with various basic modules e g a remote sensing based et module a three layer soil water balance module and a groundwater module and specific hydrological process modules e g permafrost hydrology snow melting and wetland hydrology can accurately characterize various hydrological fluxes e g runoff and et and states e g swe cws sms and groundwater storage zhang and zhang 2006 liu et al 2015 chen and zhang 2019 wang et al 2022 especially for this study based on a remote sensing based two leaf jarvis type canopy conductance model rst gc the actual et is partitioned into four parts including wet canopy evaporation ewet c saturated soil surface evaporation esat c wet soil evaporation emoi c and dry canopy transpiration edry c a three layer soil water balance module incorporates the remote sensing based et module to simulate soil water content and water storage tension thus the soil water storage of the essi 3 model is partitioned into three layers individual stores the vertical root distribution information and oxygen stress of roots are also considered when the soil water content approaches saturation chen and zhang 2019 mainly from the perspective of water balance the groundwater component is integrated in the essi 3 model the groundwater storage is considered based on a first order linear reservoir approach and a simple groundwater model with recharge from the third soil layer capillary rise and discharge into streams wang et al 2022 the groundwater consumption module e g the groundwater withdrawal is not considered in the model as such the groundwater component of essi 3 model is likely unsatisfactory due to the simplified generalization of the groundwater module additionally the essi 3 model integrates remotely sensed data e g lai ndvi and tree cover fraction and gridded soil products e g soilgrids250m data to calibrate the soil and vegetation parameters in conclusion the modeling architecture considerably improves the simulation accuracies of spatially heterogeneous hydrological processes with time by inhibiting uncertainties in model structure and physical parameterizations gw flow defined in this study is the sum of actual evapotranspiration and gw storage is defined as the essi 3 model output of water accumulated in the three soil moisture layers including swc1 swc2 and swc3 falkenmark and rockström 2006 zhao et al 2016 1 g w f l o w e a e d r y c e w e t c e s a t s e m o i s 2 gwstorage swc 1 swc 2 swc 3 where swc1 swc2 and swc3 is the soil water content in first second and third layer respectively ea is the actual evapotranspiration in this study essi 3 model simulations were conducted during the period 1982 2018 with the first three years serving as a warm up period the simulation results for the period of 1982 1984 is not considered in the following analysis for balancing main hydrological component conditions such as soil and groundwater aquifers and the remaining years being used for calibration and validation since the driving data input to the model had multiple spatial resolutions the bilinear interpolation approach was used to generate grid datasets with a consistent spatial resolution 1 km gao et al 2018 wang et al 2022 2 3 2 model validation the water yield of the sjp only accounts for a small part of the discharge through the mainstream of heilong songhua and wusuli rivers therefore using the measured discharge from the mainstream is not appropriate for calibrating and validating the model wen et al 2020 essi 3 model was calibrated and verified by using the measured discharge from four hydrologic stations on the representative tributaries of the songhua river and wusuli river in the study area the geolocation of these river basins and the corresponding hydrological stations were presented in fig 1 since daily observed discharge data were not available the model calibration was performed at monthly scale the main characteristics of these hydrometric stations and time periods of available streamflow data for model evaluation were shown in table 2 to evaluate model performance in evapotranspiration simulations the etmod16 product sequence was used as reference data of actual evapotranspiration in this study the modis terrestrial et product uses the penman monteith equation to estimate the sum of the evaporation from wet and dry soil layers the evaporation from canopy water retention and the transpiration from plant leaves and stems mu et al 2011 kisi 2016 therefore the mod16a2 et product was adopted to evaluate the actual evapotranspiration simulated by the essi 3 model sms is a key state variable of the regional hydrological cycle however it is difficult to assess the accuracy of simulated sms based on in situ measurements owing to the scarcity of gauged stations gao et al 2018 thus the terrestrial water storage tws simulated in essi 3 model was evaluated as an alternative solution for sms assessment the grace based tws data were utilized to evaluate the performance of the essi 3 model in tws simulations tws is defined as all phases of water stored above and below the earth s surface including soil moisture snow ice surface water groundwater and water contained in biomass chen et al 2019b in general a change in tws can be computed as 3 δ t w s δ s m s δ g w s δ c w s δ s w e where sms is the soil moisture storage swe is the snow water equivalent cws is the total canopy water storage gws is the groundwater storage tws simulated by essi 3 model can be computed as 4 δ t w s e s s i 3 δ s w c 1 δ s w c 2 δ s w c 3 δ g w s δ c w s δ s w e where swc1 swc2 swc3 swe cws and gws represent the first second and third layer of soil moisture storage snow water equivalent plant canopy water and groundwater storage from essi 3 model respectively tws of the study region was estimated with the grace based tws monthly changes of the grace based tws dataset was made available since april 2002 tapley et al 2004 soni and syed 2015 currently different processing centers offer various tws series however no data series of tws was confirmed as the best in quality landerer et al 2015 in the present study jpl csr and gsfc mascon solutions within the study region were extracted and compared to investigate tws from 2003 to 2016 in addition the scaling factors were used to modify their corresponding mascon grids for better comparisons between the grace based tws and the essi 3 simulated ones grace based tws were specifically computed relative to a timely mean baseline from jan 2004 to dec 2009 including every month of a year for comparisons essi 3 simulated outputs against grace based tws the baseline value over the 2004 2009 period of each simulated components was computed and subtracted from all time steps three common evaluation indicators i e the correlation coefficient r the nash sutcliff efficiency nse and the determination coefficient r 2 equations can be found in the study of chen et al 2019b were calculated for model evaluation 2 3 3 establishment of climate and lulc scenarios in order to quantitatively assess the green water response to climate and lulc changes three scenarios were established by combining different climate periods and lulc conditions based on the changing tendency of climate and lulc as shown in section 3 2 the meteorological data were divided into two periods the period of 1982 1999 and the period of 2000 2018 and the lulc map of 1980 and 2018 were selected to represent the lulc conditions during two periods as shown in fig 2 by comparing the simulation results under different scenarios the isolated and combined influences of climate change and lulc change on gw were quantitatively analyzed as shown in table 3 based on the simulated results under these scenarios the contributions of climate change and lulc change was estimated as follows 5 contribution c lim ate s 2 s 1 s 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 100 6 contribution l u l c s 3 s 2 s 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 100 2 3 4 relative contributions of single climatic factor and lulc type to explore the relative contribution of different lulc types the contribution index proposed by ahlström et al 2015 was used to partition the contribution of each lulc class to the gw musavi et al 2017 the contribution index fj was expressed as 7 f j t x j t x t x t t x t 8 x t j x j t where xjt is the anomaly value for gw of grid j at time t in years and xt is the anomaly value of gw in the whole region the value of fj ranges from 1 1 grid with higher and positive score means a greater contribution in governing gw to estimate the relative importance of different climatic factors i e wind speed pressure relative humidity precipitation temperature and solar radiation to gw changes the lmg method was used the lmg method identifies the direct contributions of a variable and its combined contributions with all other predictors fernández martínez et al 2014 this measure has the important advantage that the results do not depend on the order of predictors in the model as it clearly identifies nonlinear relationships between dependent and explanatory variables lee and biggs 2015 for details see groemping 2006 and the r package relaimpo 2 2 3 was us to calculate the lmg indicator groemping 2006 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of model performance model calibration and verification for essi 3 model at four hydrological stations were shown in table 4 the model performances for every selected subbasin were evaluated by nse and r 2 the observed and simulated discharge at representative caizuizi station on the naoli river a tributary of the wusuli river and baoquanling hydrological station on the wutong river a tributary of the songhua river are plotted in fig 3 for comparisons for calibration and validation periods model performance with r 2 of 0 82 0 92 and 0 81 0 83 and nse of 0 77 0 89 and 0 74 0 83 respectively suggested excellence of the essi 3 model in hydrological simulations in sjp fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of the correlation between et essi3 and et mod16 from 2000 to 2018 it can be observed that correlation coefficients over larger than 96 of the study region were greater than 0 8 for those with relatively low correlation coefficients 0 9 r 0 8 cropland took the predominant land use type mod16 did not distinguish and parameterize c3 and c4 crops which may result in a relatively low correlation between et essi3 and et mod16 for those regions in contrast the different parameterization schemes for evapotranspiration estimation from c3 and c4 crops in the essi 3 model were specifically designed therefore the evapotranspiration simulated by the essi 3 model was more refined and close to the actual conditions for these grids shown in blue with low correlation coefficients r 0 5 the underlying surface type is mainly rivers there is no doubt that water surface evaporation based on remote sensing estimation and model simulation will have large errors the blank grids are due to the special treatment of some special areas e g cities ice and snow and water bodies in the mod16 dataset fig 5 shows the monthly twsa derived from the three mascon solutions the essi 3 model and two lsm models vic model and noah model the simulated result of essi 3 model exhibited a high consistency over the period of 2003 2016 with those grace based solutions as shown in table 5 for the twsa simulated by the essi 3 and grace derived the results indicated a high agreement with r ranging from 0 65 to 0 69 p 0 01 for the period of 2003 2016 grace derived twsa and monthly scale vic and noah model simulation also showed a similar trends in terrestrial water storage with the correlation coefficients of 0 65 0 70 and from 0 71 to 0 75 p 0 01 respectively although the long term trend agreement between grace derived twsa and essi 3 noah and vic model simulations was at a high level the differences appeared mostly in amplitude it can be observed that the essi 3 model presented the better fit with grace observations with the smaller variation difference amplitude of twsa the performance of vic noah and essi 3 model was measured by nse ranging 0 96 0 05 2 64 to 0 49 and 0 33 0 47 respectively the primary reason for this phenomenon was that anthropogenic activities were not considered in the vic noah and essi 3 model and the intensive agriculture irrigation and groundwater extraction in sjp put enormous pressure on tws especially the groundwater additionally water storage components provided by noah and vic just included swe cws and sms noah and vic models belong to lsms thus the groundwater storage component is not included chen et al 2019b however the groundwater storage component is included in essi 3 model to better characterize the water balance with respect to the monthly amplitude this difference highlighted that the noah and vic model was obviously underestimated or overestimated of twsa relative to essi 3 model owing to the lack of groundwater storage component thus variations in various hydrological states e g soil moisture storage component obtained from essi 3 model can better describe the dynamic characteristics of water storage components although the essi 3 model doesn t take terrestrial water storage changes caused by anthropogenic factors such as groundwater extraction into account in summary despite some uncertainties existed in hydrological simulations for specific seasons the et sms tws and runoff were all simulated with satisfactory precision this demonstrated the superiority of model simulations in producing various hydrological fluxes and states and laid the foundation for further estimating hydrological processes and investigating their variations and potential influencing factors 3 2 climate and lulc changes analysis to detect the temporal variations of climate factors in the sjp the mann kendall test was employed to examine the trends and abrupt changes of the temperature and precipitation from 1985 to 2018 at the confidence level of 95 fig 6a d presented the area averaged annual climate factors and mann kendall z value over the study region the mean annual temperature and precipitation over the sjp varied with an increased rate during the study period the sequential mann kendall tests for the annual precipitation as illustrated in fig 6c indicated an apparent abrupt change in 2005 meanwhile several abrupt changes occurred from 2000 to 2005 in temperature which suggested a significant abrupt change of climate factors took place around 2000 2005 over the sjp fig 7 exhibits the areas and ratios of seven primary land use cover types from 1980 to 2018 over the sjp in the year 1980 cropland forest and wetland took the predominant land use cover types accounting for approximately 36 05 34 93 and 14 32 of the total area of the sjp respectively to the year 2018 land use cover types changed dramatically with approximately 50 76 of the sjp changed to cropland 31 98 forest and 6 68 the wetland the agricultural land increased rapidly from 1980 to 2018 primarily due to the conversion of wetland and grassland to quantitatively investigate the change trend and lulc transformation among preliminary lulc types in the sjp the lulc transformations during 5 specific periods i e the period of 1980 1990 1990 2000 2000 2010 2010 2018 and 1980 2018 were calculated and the results are shown in fig 8 for the period from 1980 to 2018 the most significant area changes in the positive direction increasing trend were cropland while the opposite cases were grassland and wetland in the period of 1980 1990 the fastest area decreasing rate occurred in wetland followed by grassland with a decreasing rate of 28 10 and 13 51 respectively from 1990 2000 the fastest area decreasing took place in grassland followed by wetland with a decreasing rate of 44 06 and 21 69 respectively the area increasing rate for cropland in these two periods was approximately15 80 and 16 05 respectively for the two periods of 2000 2010 and 2010 2018 less area changes were found for all lulc types except for wetlands these results also suggested that the 2000 can be taken as a turning year subject to the abrupt changes in lulc over the sjp in summary to reasonably explain the dynamic influences of the climate change and lulc change across the sjp scenarios studies between pre and post 2000 were conducted for the purpose 3 3 the spatial temporal variations of the gw flow and storage in the sjp fig 9 plots the area averaged annual gw flow and gw storage estimated from the simulated hydrological processes with essi 3 model over the sjp from 1985 to 2018 generally relative higher gw flow and gw storage can be observed for the post 2000 period compared with the pre 2000 period the averaged gw flow and gw storage were 319 8 mm and 479 3 mm in pre 2000 period but slightly increased to 323 9 mm and 485 9 mm in post 2000 period respectively fig 10 shows the spatial patterns of the trend significance computed at the 95 significance level for time series gw flow and gw storage images under the influence of climate change and lulc change as exhibited in fig 10 a b apparent spatial heterogeneity for the changes of gw flow and gw storage from 1985 to 2018 over the sjp was carefully investigated the results indicated that about 50 84 of the study region showed an increasing tendency in terms of gw flow in which approximately 23 13 tended to increase significantly p 0 05 where the most obvious increasing trend occurred in the southeast and northeast region of the sjp on the contrary a decreasing trend in gw flow was significant over about 10 16 of the sjp area where the most significant reductions in gw flow were mainly distributed in the southwestern sjp area over past 34 years in the sjp 91 25 of the total study area had exhibited an increasing trend in gw storage and pixels with a significant increasing trend accounted for about 55 21 3 4 impacts of climate and lulc changes on gw flow and gw storage 3 4 1 across the sjp fig 11 demonstrates gw changes under the individual impact of climate change and lulc change as well as their combined effects for the whole sjp during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 gw flow increased by 4 4 mm considering the combined impacts of climate change and lulc change this increase was predominantly attributable to lulc changes which resulted in a 7 mm increase of gw flow while climate change contributed 2 6 mm decrease of gw flow in the opposite direction the gw storage also increased by 6 3 mm under the combined influences of climate and lulc changes a 7 2 mm increase of the gw storage was donated from the climate change while a 0 9 mm decrease of the gw storage was attributed to lulc change the results revealed that the gw flow and gw storage changes responding to climate and lulc changes differed considerably during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 throughout the sjp the gw flow increased with a principal contribution from the lulc change while the increase in gw storage was mainly influenced by climate change moreover opposite responses of gw flow to climate changes as well as the gw storage to lulc changes were found during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 the influence of climate change on gw flow was negative and climate change had a positive influence on gw storage which was opposed to the influence of lulc change the isolated influence of climate change and lulc change to gw flow and storage changes at pixel scale were also estimated to clarify if the contribution of either climate or lulc exceeded 50 to a single pixel this factor would be considered as the dominant factor governing the responses of either the gw flow or the gw storage for this pixel as illustrated in fig 12 53 of the gw flow changes at pixel scale was attributed to climate change during the periods of pre 2000 and post 2000 which emphasized that the gw flow change had a high sensitivity to climate change it also should be emphasized that in the majority 33 of these pixels the gw flow response to climate change were negative for the remaining pixels 46 of the gw flow variations were largely due to lulc change moreover the spatial distribution of dominant factor that governed the gw flow change exhibited highly scale dependent as observed in the whole sjp although more than half of these pixels 54 were affected by climate change lulc change still took the positive and predominant effect on the gw flow change in general which implied that the positive and negative impacts induced by the climate change could offset each other and weakened their impacts at the whole sjp scale for the responses of gw storage to either climate or lulc change and their joint effect the climate change contributed about 95 gw storage change at pixel scale with 89 positively and 6 negatively while lulc change contributed only 5 to the gw storage change over the remaining regions suggesting that climate change was the main factor controlling gw storage changes in sjp a noteworthy point was that gw flow under climate warming showed a decreasing during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 as shown in fig 11 climate warming undoubtedly increased the rate of soil moisture evaporation and vegetation transpiration azzam et al 2022 however due to the general weakening of solar radiation and wind speed the measured water surface evaporation at most meteorological and hydrological stations in china was decreasing which also inhibited vegetation transpiration wang et al 2018 the increase of co2 concentration also reduced the opening of leaf stomata and increased the resistance which was also an important factor to curb vegetation transpiration besides related studies showed that the calculated potential evapotranspiration of crop was also decreasing for the sjp ren et al 2019 on the other hand the prolongation of plant growth period and the increase of biomass caused by climate warming would also increase water consumption zhou et al 2021 however the plant growth period set in essi 3 model for this study was constant therefore gw flow i e actual evapotranspiration of farmland and ecosystem simulated by essi 3 model decreased after climate warming this founding also emphasized that whether the actual evapotranspiration of different regions and different crops increased or decreased after climate warming still needed to be measured and studied 3 4 2 dominant factors governing the gw flow and gw storage changes since lulc changes took the predominant role governing the gw flow changes over the sjp the impact of each lulc type on gw flow were further assessed in spite of the climate change effects using the contribution of land use cover change to gw flow as an indicator to reveal the relationship between the land use cover changes and the gw flow at different geographical locations and time according to statistics of lulc changes in the sjp in different time of study period in section 3 2 the significant land use conversion took place around 2000 with rapid area expansion of cropland and the shrinkage of forest grassland and wetland so the contributions of these four main land use types i e cropland forest grassland and wetland were distinguished the relative contribution rates for the remaining lulc types such as water settlement and bare soil were not shown due to the small proportion of the study region fig 13 presents each land use type and corresponding ratio to gw flow change during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 across the sjp before 2000 cropland contributed 37 64 to the gw flow change of the entire sjp followed by forest 31 79 wetland 17 67 and grassland 9 92 after 2000 the contribution of cropland exerted significantly to 58 84 while contributions of both wetland and grassland dropped to 5 85 and 4 16 respectively but the forest remained stable this result was similar to the historical lulc conversion patterns occurred in sjp where the majority of wetland and grassland was replaced by cropland during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 since climate change was the main factor controlling gw storage change the impacts of each climatic factor and corresponding ratio to gw storage change during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 across the sjp were investigated as presented in fig 14 before 2000 the relative contribution of precipitation to gw storage variation across the sjp was 42 42 followed by solar radiation 22 09 relative humidity 11 39 and wind speed 10 13 after 2000 the contribution of precipitation significantly increased to 56 80 followed by temperature 11 39 and relative humidity 10 13 the results indicated that precipitation remained the most important factor dominating gw storage change in addition because of the processes that simulated fluxes and water storage change occurred in soil aquifer climatic factors such as relative humidity and radiation which dominated changes in evapotranspiration and runoff components also affected soil hydrological processes therefore this study also highlighted the importance of these factors to gw storage 3 5 hydrological modelling uncertainty and limitations traditionally the hydrological models commonly use the single streamflow data for the model calibration and validation though this single evaluation approach is still being widely used around hydrological assessment more efforts have emphasized that a comprehensive calibration strategy e g intermediate gauges checking for additional variables and considering their spatial distribution not just at a specific point etc can achieve a better model performance puertes et al 2019 wen et al 2020 in this study two other water balance terms were selected for model validation firstly gw flow which represented actual evapotranspiration was carefully investigated the etmod16 product series were used as a reference to evaluate the model s performance in evapotranspiration simulation the mod16a2 product provides actual evapotranspiration estimates from the land surface which can be useful to evaluate the actual evapotranspiration simulated by the model additionally for gw storage representing soil moisture the model performance in the terrestrial soil moisture components simulations was carefully checked by comparing the results from the grace solutions the lsms and essi 3 model outputs and the results suggested that essi 3 model could effectively simulate the composition of gw yet ample space remained to improve some limitations that should be considered in the future in present study first because of the existing multi spatial resolutions input gridded datasets there was only a simplest method the bilinear interpolation method was used to downscale the coarse resolution climatic forecasts to fine resolution more advanced spatial downscaling approaches e g multilinear regression method random forests method artificial neural network method are suggested to be employed in the future studies for spatial performance improvement gao et al 2018 fortunately the satisfactory performance of the essi 3 simulations of various hydrological processes over the sjp ensured the present studies on the gw flow and storage second only five lulc maps that represented the underline condition of the sjp for specific periods were applied for simulations and the followed studies in the present study since lulc change is a dynamic process rather than abrupt change chen et al 2019a it is recommended to use more land use maps for better characterization of lulc dynamics in further studies thirdly this study did not consider the effects of other anthropogenic activities e g irrigation withdrawals reservoir regulation and topographic changes e g terrain and slope which were also significant driving factors in governing hydrological response to lulc changes wang et al 2022 4 conclusions in this study the essi 3 model was set up to assess the influences of climate and lulc changes on gw in the sjp of china the excellent capability of essi 3 model was confirmed by the strong correlations between the observed and simulated discharges the modis based and simulated evaporation the grace based and simulated twsa simulations showed that the combined effects of climate and lulc changes increased gw flow by 4 4 mm and increased gw storage by 6 3 mm during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 whereas gw flow and gw storage responded differently to climate and lulc changes climate change decreased gw flow by 2 6 mm and increased gw storage by 7 2 mm while lulc change had an opposite effect on gw flow increased by 7 mm and gw storage decreased by 0 9 mm although lulc change had a greater impact on gw flow than climate change for the whole sjp climate change altered gw flow to a greater extent than lulc change for the pixel scale accounting for 54 of the region moreover climate change played a more important role in gw storage for across the region and at pixel scale further analysis suggested that the contribution of cropland on gw flow exerted significantly from 37 64 to 58 84 during the period of pre 2000 and post 2000 and the contribution of precipitation on gw storage increased from 42 42 before 2000 56 80 after 2000 although the hydrological modeling process in this study seems well represent the spatiotemporal distribution of green water there are some limitations associated with the study remain to be solved in future study especially for the uncertainty from input data e g precipitation and temperature the original spatial resolution of cmfd dataset is still coarse 0 1 for regional study and the data downscaling process from coarse resolution to fine resolution 1 km are unsatisfactory without combining various environmental variables to improve the accuracy and enhance the spatial information this implies that additional downscaling methods e g statistical downscaling methods need to be applied to obtain accurate high spatiotemporal gridded data this study can be used as a useful guideline for similar research to investigate the temporal and spatial pattern change and trend on green water under climate and lulc changes the findings of this study combined with related researches on crop water requirements can provides a scientific basis for suitable cultivation planning program and agricultural water management for crop production in sjp especially for rain fed crops credit authorship

7764,study region the study area comprising pakistan is distributed in five homogeneous climatic zones study focus an integrated five step approach has been used for zonal climate extreme analysis seven out of thirteen most appropriate global climate models gcms were selected using posterior inclusion probability in the bayesian model averaging approach the output of selected gcms is then downscaled using statistical downscaling climate extremes are projected for the baseline and future time periods spatio temporal trend and statistical significance analysis were performed for climate extremes new hydrological insights for the region most of the climate extremes have heterogeneous trends for the precipitation under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the increasing trends in climate extreme are noted in the northern region monsoon region and south west parts of pakistan significantly increasing trend is observed in tmaxmean and tminmean across the country tn10p cool nights and tx10p cool days have decreasing trends in the future for most of the gcms across the country for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in contrast tn90p warm nights and tx90p warm days have increasing trends for all gcms in future under both scenarios for rcp8 5 temperature extremes have significantly increased except tn10p and tx10p indicating significantly decreasing trends there is notable increase in the number of summer days in future under both scenarios graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate extremes indices homogeneous climate zones global climate models pakistan statistical downscaling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to anthropogenic activities the intensities and frequencies of extreme events would likely to increase during the 21st century ipcc 2007b ipcc 2013 troyat al 2015 lader et al 2017 wu 2020 ipcc 2021 it can be seen from observational data that the frequencies intensities and durations of extremes events have changed with time world meteorological organization 2013 sheikh et al 2015 mcphillips et al 2018 almazroui 2020 ipcc 2018 kharin et al 2018 extreme heatwave intense rainfall in monsoon and droughts are the major examples happened in the past decades sheikh et al 2015 ikram et al 2016 choudhary 2017 hegerl et al 2011 field et al 2012 in 2010 pakistan faced deadliest flood haq et al 2012 caused 2000 causalities and total economic impact was approximately pkr 855 billion asian development bank 2010 lau and kin 2012 investigated a connection between the flood of 2010 in pakistan and the russian heat wave pakistan has widely been experienced by the impacts of climate change in the recent past and this boosted vulnerability of the country to the threat of changing climate has extensively accredited ali et al 2015 2019a 2019b saeed and athar 2018 khan et al 2015 2017 chaudhry 2017 ghulam et al 2017 malik et al 2012 sheikh et al 2009 farooqi et al 2005 during 1961 2010 in pakistan 0 5 c and 0 8 c increase on average in mean and maximum temperature have been observed ali et al 2019a khan et al 2022 the future s projected increase in temperature is higher than the global on average particularly the northern parts located at higher elevations are more probably to experience preeminent surface air temperature ali et al 2015 khan et al 2015 kiani et al 2021 climate change and particularly climate extremes have significant impacts not only on food security socioeconomic factors demographic trends and water availability but also have a strong link with national security vogel 2019 the quadrennial defense review and national security strategy of the united states of america usa both identify that climate change is likely to trigger outcomes that will threaten the u s security mcelroy and baker 2014 unfortunately pakistan facing the same situation as it experienced many extremes events in the last decades the increase in extreme events observed in the last decades is expected to continue in the future as the natural variability and accelerated warming combine to produce changing weather conditions around the globe consequently this will impact critical infrastructure food security water security energy security and brings into focus the need to consider the accelerating nature of climate stress in concert with the more traditional political economic and social indicators therefore the knowledge on future climate change in particular climate extremes is pertinent to appraise its expected impacts and to formulate effective policies seeking timely adaptation and mitigation strategies the observed increase in droughts ﬂoods and heat waves which have sternly impacted the society and environment over the recent past decades has brought attention to the study of climate extremes hegerl et al 2011 field et al 2012 aghakouchak et al 2012 there are various studies about climate extreme analysis globally as well as regionally about pakistan there are a few studies including sheikh et al 2009 who performed climate extreme analysis using observed daily data temperature for the duration of 1971 2000 precipitation for the duration of 1961 2000 for the south asian countries pakistan india sri lanka bangladesh and nepal islam et al 2009 investigated climate extremes using the outputs of a single regional climate model precis precis providing regional climate for impact studies in their study they considered baseline duration 1961 1990 and last future of the 21st century 2071 2100 and concluded that the cold spell has significantly decreased and the warm spell has increasing trends in the future sajjad and ghaffar 2018 performed a study about climate extremes by using the outputs of three gcms with rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 however they considered pakistan as a single homogeneous climate zone they concluded that climate extremes are changing for example summer days mean minimum and mean maximum temperatures are increasing in the future ali et al 2019 performed a study about climate extreme analysis using the outputs of various gcms however they considered each province state as a homogeneous climate region which effect the analyses the climate of pakistan has significant spatial variation from coastal area in the south and one of the largest non polar glaciers in the north these altitudinal variations also affect the rainfall temperature change and climate extremes about two third of the area is arid in the country out of which half of that is extremely arid where annual rainfall is less than the average adnan 2009 construction of homogenous climatic regions given in fig 1 could provide the basis for better understanding about climate extremes ullah et al 2020 therefore it is important to conduct climate extremes analysis based on homogeneous climatic zones which may give better and representative results the atmosphere ocean general circulation model aogcm are the sophisticated tools developed to simulate climate variability on a wide range i e from synoptic time scales to multi century climate change however the outputs of these models have coarser resolution and therefore are unable to reflect some of the regional and local climate variability consequently we need some tools that can be used to make available the climate information on higher resolution downscaling is a process to transform the climatic information to finer resolution from coarser resolution there are two approaches for downscaling dynamical downscaling dd and statistical downscaling sd dd use regional climate model rcm by utilizing additional information in terms of topography and sea surface temperature besides the outputs of gcms on the other hand sd required observed station data and the output of gcms empirical relations can be developed between observed station data and gcms outputs for downscaling purposes both approaches have their pros and cons however one difference is that dd requires high computational power e g parallel computing system or supercomputer and huge storage capacity for their outputs on the other hand sd does not require such type of high computational power and storage capacity as compared to dd for further details about statistical downscaling we refer to wilby et al 1998 wilby and dawson 2013 liu et al 2016 pourmokhtarian et al 2016 lun et al 2020 hewitson et al 2014 gutiérrez et al 2013 ali et al 2019 there are various climate and weather extremes which occur due to the different intensities durations and frequencies of climate variables examples of these climate extremes include typhoons or cyclones heavy precipitation heat waves etc these phenomena further exacerbate other events like flooding and health s problems related to climate which causes casualties and other losses expert team on climate change detection monitoring and indices etccdmi developed climate indices which can be used for measuring different climate extremes a list of the core climate indices of etccdmi with brief definitions and their units can be found at http etccdi pacificclimate org and also provided in the supplementary information s8 the major aims of this study include 1 climate extremes projection in the homogeneous climatic zones for selected gcms 2 spatio temporal trend analysis of the projected climate extremes and 3 significance analysis of the projected climate extremes the findings of this study may help policy makers in decision making in various areas like water management agriculture water availability urban planning food security etc further the findings of this study may help to address some of the sustainable development goals sdgs of the united nations development programme undp related to climate change actions water management hunger and environment the remaining paper is structured as section 2 presents data and study area section 3 is reserved for methodology section 4 has results sections 5 and 6 are about discussion and conclusions and recommendations respectively 2 data and study area two types of data sets observed climate data and high resolution statistically downscaled gcms outputs data have been used in this study on daily basis the observed data for the duration of 1976 2005 was acquired from pakistan meteorological department mpd while the outputs of gcms are downloaded from world climate research programme https esgf node llnl gov search cmip5 and then statistically downscaled for 34 meteorological stations across pakistan the duration of simulated data is from 1976 to 2100 where the duration of 1976 2005 is considers as baseline or reference period and the remaining duration is divided into three future durations i e future one f1 2011 2040 future two f2 2041 2070 and future three f3 2071 2100 the target area for this study is pakistan which has 23 4 38 n 61 78 e latitude and longitude respectively pakistan has four neighbor countries india in the eastern side china in the north east side afghanistan in the western side iran in west south side it has ocean is in the south and 26 000 sq km glacier cover area about one fourth of the glaciers in high mountain asia muhammad et al 2019a 2019b pakistan has a total area of 881 913 square kilometers and remains 33rd largest country of the world it remains 6th largest country with respect to population and contains approximately 220 million inhabitants according to the latest census of the country pakistan economic survey 2020 21 wprev worldometer 2021 worldometer 2021 3 methodology an integrated approach comprises mainly of five major steps have been developed and implemented to accomplish this study these steps are gcm selection downscaling the outputs of selected gcms evaluation downscaling skills projection of climate extremes and finally their spatio temporal trends analysis in the first step a set of gcms is selected for all considered climate variables for each climate zone by incorporating bayesian model averaging bma khan et al 2021 from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 in the second step the outputs of selected gcms are statistically downscaled to project the climate extremes in each climate zone finally the projected climate extremes are analyzed by incorporating statistical techniques for example probability density function spatio temporal trend analysis and their statistical significance the detail description about each part is discussed in the subsequent subsections and presented schematically in fig 2 3 1 gcm s selection initially 13 gcms were selected based on available literature where different approaches have been used for gcms evaluation for example we selected a set of gcms based on the literature review of ashfaq et al 2017 and skills score warm dry wet and cold criteria of lutz et al 2016 as the aim of this study to analyze climate extremes in each climate zone therefore it is important to evaluate gcms in each climate region given in fig 1 to refine further the choice of gcms model evaluation procedures is carried out by using bma which is a regression based approach where the dependent variable represents observed data and covariates represent gcms outputs in bma all possible combinations of the regression model or customized number of regression models can be estimated where each covariate outputs of gcm has a weight called posterior probability and it depends on how closely it realized the observed data consequently the gcms having higher weights which perform better in terms of projected observed data closely the model s selection criterion is posterior inclusion probability of the gcm which is the sum of posterior probabilities of each covariate gcm in all regression models included in bma for further details about the methodology of model selection we refer to khan et al 2021 a brief detail about 13 gcms is given in supplementary information s9 3 2 downscaling gcms outputs in statistical downscaling stationarity is an important assumption as without stationarity the same relationship may not exist in future dixon et al 2016 lanzante et al 2018 however spatial disaggregation quantile delta mapping sdqdm is a nonparametric method and therefore there is no parameters which need to be calibrated gudmundsson et al 2012 a prerequisite condition for a statistical downscaling method e g sdqdm that a reliable long term historical dataset is available over a study domain to build a relationship between gcm outputs and the observed data in other words observed statistical characteristics at each station are reflected in the sdqdm processes using the observed dataset within a study domain for instance a 50th percentile value of gcm s output is simply interpolated by idw inverse distance weighting to stations and then the interpolated values correspond to the same percentile values of observation at each station are bias corrected by qdm in this way all gcm outputs are bias corrected at all stations and preserve gcm driven climate signals cannon et al 2015 cannon 2018 the resolution of the downscaled data is determine by the resolution of reference or observed data for further details about downscaling bias correction we refer to cannon et al 2015 cannon 2018 brekke et al 2013 and wood et al 2004 before the implementation of bias correction it is assumed that y o t y m h t and y m f t denote observed model s simulated historical and future data respectively in the subscript o m h f and t represent observed model historical future and time respectively similarly f o f m h f m f represent cumulative distribution function of observed data model s simulated data for historical time and future time period respectively we start with time dependent cumulative distribution function of model projected series 1 f m f y m f t p y m f t y m f t f m f t 0 1 find the relative change using the ratio of inverse cdf of model predicted data applied to the cdf of model predicted data and the inverse cdf of historical observed data applied to model predicted data mathematically this can be represented by eq 2 2 m y t f m f 1 f m f y m f t f m h 1 f m f y m f t y m f t f m h 1 f m f y m f t the quantile of model s predicted data can now be bias corrected by applying the inverse cdf estimated from observed data set over the historical duration 3 y ˆ m h t f o 1 f m f y t the f o 1 is the inverse of cumulative distribution function estimated from observed data during the calibration period and y ˆ m h t is the bias corrected model s simulated data for the historical duration the bias corrected future projections can be obtained by applying the relative changes to the historical bias corrected data given in eq 3 and expressed in eqs 4 and 5 for temperature and precipitation respectively 4 y ˆ m f t y ˆ m h t m y t 5 y ˆ m f t y ˆ m h t m y t 3 3 evaluating skills of downscaling method it is important to assess the skills of downscaling methos before proceeding for making futures projections there are various criteria that can be used for this purpose however the mean error me mean square error mse percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse are used in this study 3 4 climate extremes analysis extreme events are easy to recognize but due to different reasons it is difficult to define it mcphillips 2018 broska et al 2021 the reasons including no uniform definition of extreme events the word extremeness is relative and strongly depends on the context to calculate the climate extremes indices the observed and downscaled model simulated data was prepared for each climate zone for the reference and future durations the r s package climdex is used to compute 27 core climate indices based on daily minimum maximum temperature and precipitation karl et al 1999 peterson 2005 etccdi the parameters of climate extremes which are considered important for impact assessment include are intensity frequency and persistence statistical analysis of the projected climate extremes is then performed using probability density function pdf which shows full distribution of climate extremes for different durations a comparison between baseline and future durations is made by using pdfs of climate extremes which provide information about shift changes in the mean as well as in variability of climate extremes it is important to understand the spatial distribution of climate extremes therefore the projected climate extremes are spatially interpolated over the whole domain the interpolation is performed for the changes in comparison to reference period percent changes for some climate extreme in climate extremes for selected gcms in the future durations for both scenarios to 1 1 km grid size thirdly it is extremely important to know about the trend and statistical significance of the climate extremes in the future this will help policy makers to make policy accordingly and on priority basis the statistical significance of each climate extreme was tested at 5 level of significance and noted that if the p value for a particular climate extreme is less than or equal to significance level then we say that it is significantly changing if the p value for a particular climate extreme index is greater than the significance level then we say that it is insignificantly changing decreasing increasing 3 5 uncertainty assessment uncertainty assessment in climate projections particularly in climate extremes is important li et al 2022 ali et al 2019 this can help stakeholders and policymakers in taking mitigation adaptation measures in relevant sectors for the assessment of uncertainty in climate extremes the observed climate extremes are compared with the projected climate extremes for various gcm for the reference period this can show the deviation of projected climate extremes from observed climate extremes as well as between different gcms projected extremes for the assessment of uncertainty assessment in climate extremes pdfs and box whisker plots are used to assess whether the observed and model simulated climate extremes follow the same probability distribution the kolmogorov smirnov s k test has been implemented the null hypothesis in s k test is that the two data sets follow the same probability distribution if p value of the test is less than or equal to 0 05 this mean that the observed and simulated climate extremes don not follow the same probability distribution at 5 level of significance in addition the trajectory of projected climate data along with observed data can also provide information about the uncertainty in the projected data for both rcps 4 results results of this study are divided into three parts firstly evaluation of downscaling skills secondly the results of climate extremes analysis including probability density functions of projected climate extremes spatial temporal trend analysis and statistical significance of climate extremes are presented in the end uncertainties in climate extremes are given 4 1 downscaling skills evaluation the downscaling method is evaluated graphically and numerically by using climate extremes for the reference period fig 3 shows the comparison between climate extremes estimated from gcm output and downscaled data with observed climate extremes the downscaled r95p follows the pattern of observed r95p in terms of average values and variability in comparison to the gcm output for su25 the distribution of observed data is closely followed by the downscaled one as compared to the gcm output for r99p and txx the performance of downscaling method shows that these climate extremes are closely approximated by the downscaled data as comparison to the gcm output the number of cwd is significantly overestimated by gcm in terms of variability and maximum number of cwd on the other hand tnx is significantly underestimated by gcm output compared to the downscaled average minimum and maximum values the results show that all these climate extremes are approximated closely by the downscaled data in comparison to the gcm output table 1 show evaluation of downscaling method using daily climate data the results are based on four criteria me mse pbias and rmse for gcm outputs and downscaled climate data with observed data the results of these statistics show that the downscaled data is closer to the observed data as compared to the gcm original outputs in all climatic regions of the country except a few values therefore the downscaled climate data is used for further analysis 4 2 extremes analysis fig 4 shows the result of su25 the number of days when temperature is 25 c or higher for both climate change scenarios su25 has an increasing pattern in all climate zones for rcp4 5 there is positive increment in the mean number of summer days in future across the country however a maximum increase is noted during f1 in contrast to f2 and f3 in zone 1 in zone 2 there is clear increasing trend in the number of summer days during all future durations in zone 3 5 the maximum increase in the number of summer days is noted during f2 the number of summer days varies zonal wise with lowest of approximately 185 days per year in zone 1 the maximum annual increase is observed during f1 in zone 1 f2 in zones 3 5 and f3 in zone 2 the results of summer days under the rcp8 5 indicate a clearly visible increasing shift in the future it is significantly increasing however a maximum increase is noted during f1 in zone 4 in zone 1 the average number of summer days are approximately 160 170 200 and 225 during baseline f1 f2 and f3 respectively the increase in summer days will help in growing crops in zone 1 however it will severely affect crops production human health population s migration water availability and food security in the remaining zones therefore optimal utilization and smart management of available water may help to cope the worser situation about water scarcity in the future in addition the increasing number of summer days will increase the rate of snow and glacier melt and consequently more water will be available in summer with increased probability of hazards muhammad et al 2021 tian et al 2017 however the mass of glaciers may be reduced muhammad et al 2016 the spatio temporal distribution of changes in tx90p warm days for canesm2 during future is shown in fig 5 the tx90p represent total percentage of days when daily maximum temperature is greater than 90th percentile under rcp4 5 the tx90p has mixed and heterogenous trends the warm days are mostly decreasing except the south west part of the country during all three future durations maximum decrease in tx90p is observed in east central central and central western parts of the country while maximum increase is noted in the south western part of the country during f2 and f1 respectively under the rcp4 5 the maximum increase and decrease in rcp4 5 are approximately 2 days each under rcp8 5 the pattern is similar as for rcp4 5 with higher increment also the maximum increase under rcp8 5 is noted during f2 during f1 there is a decrease in tx90p across the country except south western part of the country where it is increasing maximum increase in tx90p is observed during f2 while minimum decrease is noted during f1 f3 has moderate increase in tx90p under the rcp8 5 however during this time period there is an increase in the northern part of the country which is rich with water resources fig 6 present the probability density functions of total precipitation for canesm2 with both climate change scenarios the total precipitation is increasing in zones 1 3 and decreasing during f3 in zones 4 5 a part of zones 1 is frozen water resources with mostly glacier and snow covered and zone 2 has monsoon effect with heavy precipitation the accumulated precipitation reaches to 1500 mm and 3400 mm in zone 1 and zone 2 respectively in zone 3 the relative changes are comparatively insignificant due to less precipitation accumulation the pattern is different in the results of rcp8 5 with different values fig 7 shows the future s spatio temporal distribution of percent changes in r99p over pakistan for canesm2 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the r99p represent annual total precipitation when daily precipitation is greater than 99th percentile maximum increase is noted in the south east part and in the coastal areas during future durations we found a maximum decrease of 38 and increase of 238 40 under the rcp8 5 the results of r99p show an increase during f1 mixed results increase decrease during f2 and maximum increase during f3 maximum decrease and increase are observed during f2 and f3 respectively under the rcp8 5 in addition maximum increase is observed during f2 and f3 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 maximum decrease in r99p is observed in the northern and south western parts of the country while maximum percent increase is noted in the south east part of the country in the entire duration under both scenarios the possible consequences of increasing r99p would be flash flooding damages infrastructures crops loses and casualties in the future however proper planning about storage of water plantation and hazard s resilience infrastructure can reduce such type of damages fig 8 shows the changes in cwd consecutive wet days for both climate change scenarios for canesm2 the results indicate a mixed trend with increasing cwd in the future in zone 1 in zone 2 there is decreasing trend during most of the years while an increase in few years in the future zone 3 has mixed trend in cwd throughout the future in zone 4 the first half of each future duration has a mixed trend however a decrease in cwd in the second half in all future durations is noted in zone 5 the first half of each time periods indicate a decrease in contrast to an increase in the second half for most of the years the maximum increase 14 days and decrease 13 days is noted in zone 2 the results of changes in cwd under rcp8 5 follow similar pattern however maximum increase 14 days and decrease 17 days are noted in zone 2 fig 9 represents the magnitudes and statistical significance at 5 level of significance of zonal temperature extremes under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 fig 9 indicates a clearly visible trend in some climate extremes for example tn10p cold nights and tx10p cold days these two climate extremes varies in different zones and models cold nights are significantly increasing only for fgoal s2 in zone 2 in zone 4 and 5 the cold nights and cold days are significantly decreasing in contrast tn90p warm nights and tx90p warm days are significantly increasing in most of the gcms zones with few exceptions of insignificant decrease and increase indicating future climate warming under rcp4 5 summer days are increasing throughout the future durations under rcp4 5 except short term decrease in zone 1 and 2 the increasing summer days will have significant impact on agriculture water and other important sectors ice days are either decreasing or not changing except zone 2 and 3 similarly frost days are mostly decreasing most of the temperature extremes are changing significantly under the rcp8 5 are shown in fig 9 cold night tn10p and cold days tx10p are significantly decreasing throughout future in contrast the warm night tn90p and warm days tx90p are significantly increasing throughout except for ccsm4 in zone 5 with significantly decreasing trend during f1 and f2 summer days are significantly increasing in most of the future durations frost days fd0 are decreasing throughout the future except f3 in zone 3 under gfdl esm 2 m model the results of tropical nights tr20 show significant increase in future except a decrease during f1 in zone 5 for ccsm4 the results of precipitation extremes under both scenarios are shown in fig 10 which indicate an irregular spatio temporal trend notably precipitation from extremely wet days r99p is increasing during f2 and f3 except a decrease in zone 3 with most of the decrease during f1 under the rcp4 5 in addition the number of heavy precipitation and very heavy precipitation days are increasing across zone 1 and 2 in contrast to the decreasing trends in the remaining zones with few exceptions the results of precipitation extremes under rcp8 5 show that most of the extremes have mixed trend with few significant changes like in rcp4 5 most of the significant changes are observed in the high altitude areas represented as zone 1 and 2 in zone 1 r95p is decreasing initially in f1 followed by a significant increase during f2 and insignificant increase during f3 for cmcc cms model similarly r99p is decreasing during f1 but significantly increasing during f2 and f3 for cmcc cms model a similar trend is noted in prcptot with a decrease during f1 and increase during f2 and f3 consecutive dry days cdd are insignificant except a significant increase by miroc esm chem model in zone 4 and canesm2 in zone 5 in zone 1 and 2 the cdd are increasing in f2 and f3 except canesm2 indicating decreasing trend during f3 during f1 cdd has mixed trend in zone 1 and 2 likewise the cwd also have mixed trend and mostly decreasing during f1 and increasing during f2 and f3 in zones 1 and 2 in zones 4 and 5 cwd has mostly increasing trend with few exceptions for some more results we refer to supplementary material 4 3 uncertainties in the projected climate extremes figs 11 12 show a comparison of observed climate extremes with projected climate extremes for the reference period using pdfs and box whisker plots respectively the r99p is approximated in a better way by cmcc cms in comparison to other gcms some of the gcms have bimodal distribution the su25 is projected reasonably by canesm3 and cmcc csm as compared to the other gcms in terms of extreme values the highest number of summer days are180 and 183 for observed and canesm2 projected data respectively the average summer days are 162 and 159 for observed and canesm2 projected data respectively for inmcm4 the average number of summer days is 129 with a significance difference in minimum and maximum number of summer days in comparison to observed data the other extremes like r99p tx90p and tn90p are closely approximated by various gcms however the observed maximum r99p is underestimated by all gcms the number cdd is overestimated by all gcms however the cmss csm has approximately better in terms of average values from fig 11 for most of the climate extremes the observed extremes and model predicted extremes follow the same probability distribution using k s test however for cdd the distribution of model simulated cdd is different for that of observed cdd for the mentioned gcms the uncertainty is higher in the projected cdd in comparison to other climate extremes as shown in fig 12 it is anticipated that the uncertainty in the projected extremes will increases in the future the trajectory supplementary information s1 of projected climate data closely approximates the observed maximum minimum temperature and precipitation however in the future there may be higher uncertainties in comparison the reference period the uncertainties level may vary in both rcps in the future as some of the climate extremes are interpolated from stations to the full domain of the study which can introduce uncertainties especially where the meteorological stations are at larger distance and have significant elevation variation therefore it is important for relevant policy makers to keep in mind the uncertainties in projected climate extremes while developing future plans 5 discussion if we look at the worst impacts of weather and climate extremes in the south asian region the findings are alarming recently wmo 2021 stated that climate and weather extremes killed thousands of people displaced millions of people causing a heavy toll on ecosystems and infrastructure and consequently cost hundreds of billions of dollars in the light of the above consequences it is important to have enough information about the duration frequency and persistence of these extremes during the recent and future duration as well toward this end there are a few studies regarding climate extreme analysis and projections over pakistan for instance sheikh et al 2009 analyzed climate extremes using daily data for temperature for the duration of 1971 2000 and precipitation for the duration of 1961 2000 for the south asian countries they concluded that the warm and cold extremes are more and less common respectively further their study suggested mixed trend for the indices related to heaviest rainfall r95p and r99p throughout south asia a conducted study by islam et al 2009 to project temperature and precipitation extremes using daily outputs of a regional climate model precis providing regional climate for impact studies with 50 by 50 km horizontal resolution over pakistan they considered the 1960 1990 and 2071 2100 as reference and future durations respectively in their study they concluded that the annual cold spell suggests significant decreasing trend however annual warm spell show slight upward trend in pakistan in another study over pakistan sajjad and ghaffar 2018 analyzed climate extremes using ensemble mean daily outputs of three gcms with two emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 their findings suggested that summer days has increasing trend over north eastern part of the country their findings further suggested that the frequency of heavy precipitation has significantly increasing trend over the north western part of the country ali et al 2019 projected climate extremes for the reference duration 1976 2005 and future durations 2006 2035 2036 2065 2066 2095 over six sub region of pakistan using daily data their results suggested that the consecutive wet days and consecutive dry days are increasing and decreasing in the future across the country generally and in the south eastern part particularly however the sub regions they considered in their study have no scientific background as the heavy precipitation increasing across the country and extremely heavy precipitation increasing significantly in the south eastern part therefore there may be flooding and can damage human lives infrastructure and crops on the other hand summer days and consecutive dry days are increasing across the country while the consecutive wet days are decreasing this may cause droughts in some parts of the country in the future and can further increase the demand of water for agriculture and other purposes the decrease in cold nights and days and increase in warm nights and days indicate a warming climate in the future the northern part of the country is rich with water resources himalaya hindukush karakoram hkh which may have severe consequences of this warming climate the potential consequences include glacial lake outburst flood glof floods due to higher snow and glacier melt glacier surges and collapses muhammad and tian 2020 as this region is very sensitive to climate change according to archer 2003 with the increase of 1 c increase in temperature can cause a 16 17 increase in river flow in the upper indus basin the abrupt changes increase decrease in river flow in the northern part of the country can disturb the supply demand balance of water of the country and can be a disaster for hydropower agriculture and infrastructure khadka et al 2014 shen et al 2003 noted that short term increase in temperature can cause glof in addition in the warming climate the snow and glaciers will melt at higher rate gul et al 2017 and can not only disturb the current systembut also the glacier will lose their mass sooner sigdel et al 2020 this needs special attention from government and relevant stakeholders to focus on mitigation and adaptation strategies for minimizing the impacts of climate change on snow and glaciers the other important region of pakistan is the central eastern part mainly comprised of punjab province which is considers as food basket for the country the increase in heavy and extremely heavy precipitation can destroy cops and toll heavy cost to the infrastructure due to flooding situation in the future as the warm days and nights are increasing while the cold days and cold nights are decreasing therefore the crops may need more water in future as compared to the requirement of today in addition the consecutive wet days and consecutive dry days are decreasing and increasing respectively which can further exacerbate the demand of water in the future beside all these problems taking appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures and better management of available water resources can reduce the worse consequences of weather and climate extremes considerably in the future this can further help to meet the undp sdgs related to hunger climate action and environment fao already stated in 2016 that the hunger level is constantly rising since 2014 and it may be difficult to meet zero hunger by 2030 6 conclusions and recommendations there is a clear shift increasing in total precipitation for canesm2 model under the rcp4 5 in future except in zone 5 with an increase during f1 and f2 and a decrease during f3 warm nights are mostly increasing in future with significant increase under rcp8 5 the number of warm days tx90p are increasing during f1 and f2 and decreasing during f3 for cmcc cms model it has significantly increasing trend under both scenarios except few decreasing or insignificantly increasing trends in contrast tn10p and tx10p have decreasing trends under both scenarios in the future except a few exceptions of increasing trends the trends in tx90p tn90p tn10p and tx10p indicate that there will warmer climate with more number extremes related to high temperature in the future summer days are homogenously increasing for canesm2 and cmcc cms models under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the changes are apparent both in the number of mean days and in the variability of summer days the number of summer days shows an increase with a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 55 days in a year the maximum increase is noted in the central west part of the country during f3 under rcp8 5 the number of very wet days r95p are increasing in future except f3 for some climate zones the spatial distribution of climate extremes of the extreme wet days r99p indicates a higher increase in percent in zone 4 during f2 and f3 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in contrast the overall extreme wet days in zones 1 3 are decreasing there is a mixed trend in the number of warm nights in canesm2 model maximum change is 2 days in zone 2 during f3 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the changes in the number of warm days have mixed trends throughout the country the maximum increase is observed in zone 4 while maximum decrease in zone 1 2 and 5 the trend of climate extreme and their significance vary between climate zones of the country the findings may help the government and policy makers in mitigation and adaptation strategies regarding climate change impacts in pakistan in addition the results suggest to find connection between climate extremes in the high altitude areas contributing snow and glacier melt this can further help to analyze the future s contribution of snow and glacier melt due to climate extremes similarly it may be interesting to investigate the potential impact of climate extreme on spatio temporal distribution of rainfall in zone 2 monsoon dominated region which receives more than 80 rainfall during monsoon mid of june mid of september season more importantly it is suggested to investigate the potential impact of projected climate extremes on food security in zone 5 the remaining zone are mostly drought prone therefore drought situation in zones 3 4 is the key future s research area further we will need crops and foods which are resilient to projected climate in the future credit authorship contribution statement dr firdos started the idea of this paper

7764,study region the study area comprising pakistan is distributed in five homogeneous climatic zones study focus an integrated five step approach has been used for zonal climate extreme analysis seven out of thirteen most appropriate global climate models gcms were selected using posterior inclusion probability in the bayesian model averaging approach the output of selected gcms is then downscaled using statistical downscaling climate extremes are projected for the baseline and future time periods spatio temporal trend and statistical significance analysis were performed for climate extremes new hydrological insights for the region most of the climate extremes have heterogeneous trends for the precipitation under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the increasing trends in climate extreme are noted in the northern region monsoon region and south west parts of pakistan significantly increasing trend is observed in tmaxmean and tminmean across the country tn10p cool nights and tx10p cool days have decreasing trends in the future for most of the gcms across the country for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in contrast tn90p warm nights and tx90p warm days have increasing trends for all gcms in future under both scenarios for rcp8 5 temperature extremes have significantly increased except tn10p and tx10p indicating significantly decreasing trends there is notable increase in the number of summer days in future under both scenarios graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate extremes indices homogeneous climate zones global climate models pakistan statistical downscaling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to anthropogenic activities the intensities and frequencies of extreme events would likely to increase during the 21st century ipcc 2007b ipcc 2013 troyat al 2015 lader et al 2017 wu 2020 ipcc 2021 it can be seen from observational data that the frequencies intensities and durations of extremes events have changed with time world meteorological organization 2013 sheikh et al 2015 mcphillips et al 2018 almazroui 2020 ipcc 2018 kharin et al 2018 extreme heatwave intense rainfall in monsoon and droughts are the major examples happened in the past decades sheikh et al 2015 ikram et al 2016 choudhary 2017 hegerl et al 2011 field et al 2012 in 2010 pakistan faced deadliest flood haq et al 2012 caused 2000 causalities and total economic impact was approximately pkr 855 billion asian development bank 2010 lau and kin 2012 investigated a connection between the flood of 2010 in pakistan and the russian heat wave pakistan has widely been experienced by the impacts of climate change in the recent past and this boosted vulnerability of the country to the threat of changing climate has extensively accredited ali et al 2015 2019a 2019b saeed and athar 2018 khan et al 2015 2017 chaudhry 2017 ghulam et al 2017 malik et al 2012 sheikh et al 2009 farooqi et al 2005 during 1961 2010 in pakistan 0 5 c and 0 8 c increase on average in mean and maximum temperature have been observed ali et al 2019a khan et al 2022 the future s projected increase in temperature is higher than the global on average particularly the northern parts located at higher elevations are more probably to experience preeminent surface air temperature ali et al 2015 khan et al 2015 kiani et al 2021 climate change and particularly climate extremes have significant impacts not only on food security socioeconomic factors demographic trends and water availability but also have a strong link with national security vogel 2019 the quadrennial defense review and national security strategy of the united states of america usa both identify that climate change is likely to trigger outcomes that will threaten the u s security mcelroy and baker 2014 unfortunately pakistan facing the same situation as it experienced many extremes events in the last decades the increase in extreme events observed in the last decades is expected to continue in the future as the natural variability and accelerated warming combine to produce changing weather conditions around the globe consequently this will impact critical infrastructure food security water security energy security and brings into focus the need to consider the accelerating nature of climate stress in concert with the more traditional political economic and social indicators therefore the knowledge on future climate change in particular climate extremes is pertinent to appraise its expected impacts and to formulate effective policies seeking timely adaptation and mitigation strategies the observed increase in droughts ﬂoods and heat waves which have sternly impacted the society and environment over the recent past decades has brought attention to the study of climate extremes hegerl et al 2011 field et al 2012 aghakouchak et al 2012 there are various studies about climate extreme analysis globally as well as regionally about pakistan there are a few studies including sheikh et al 2009 who performed climate extreme analysis using observed daily data temperature for the duration of 1971 2000 precipitation for the duration of 1961 2000 for the south asian countries pakistan india sri lanka bangladesh and nepal islam et al 2009 investigated climate extremes using the outputs of a single regional climate model precis precis providing regional climate for impact studies in their study they considered baseline duration 1961 1990 and last future of the 21st century 2071 2100 and concluded that the cold spell has significantly decreased and the warm spell has increasing trends in the future sajjad and ghaffar 2018 performed a study about climate extremes by using the outputs of three gcms with rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 however they considered pakistan as a single homogeneous climate zone they concluded that climate extremes are changing for example summer days mean minimum and mean maximum temperatures are increasing in the future ali et al 2019 performed a study about climate extreme analysis using the outputs of various gcms however they considered each province state as a homogeneous climate region which effect the analyses the climate of pakistan has significant spatial variation from coastal area in the south and one of the largest non polar glaciers in the north these altitudinal variations also affect the rainfall temperature change and climate extremes about two third of the area is arid in the country out of which half of that is extremely arid where annual rainfall is less than the average adnan 2009 construction of homogenous climatic regions given in fig 1 could provide the basis for better understanding about climate extremes ullah et al 2020 therefore it is important to conduct climate extremes analysis based on homogeneous climatic zones which may give better and representative results the atmosphere ocean general circulation model aogcm are the sophisticated tools developed to simulate climate variability on a wide range i e from synoptic time scales to multi century climate change however the outputs of these models have coarser resolution and therefore are unable to reflect some of the regional and local climate variability consequently we need some tools that can be used to make available the climate information on higher resolution downscaling is a process to transform the climatic information to finer resolution from coarser resolution there are two approaches for downscaling dynamical downscaling dd and statistical downscaling sd dd use regional climate model rcm by utilizing additional information in terms of topography and sea surface temperature besides the outputs of gcms on the other hand sd required observed station data and the output of gcms empirical relations can be developed between observed station data and gcms outputs for downscaling purposes both approaches have their pros and cons however one difference is that dd requires high computational power e g parallel computing system or supercomputer and huge storage capacity for their outputs on the other hand sd does not require such type of high computational power and storage capacity as compared to dd for further details about statistical downscaling we refer to wilby et al 1998 wilby and dawson 2013 liu et al 2016 pourmokhtarian et al 2016 lun et al 2020 hewitson et al 2014 gutiérrez et al 2013 ali et al 2019 there are various climate and weather extremes which occur due to the different intensities durations and frequencies of climate variables examples of these climate extremes include typhoons or cyclones heavy precipitation heat waves etc these phenomena further exacerbate other events like flooding and health s problems related to climate which causes casualties and other losses expert team on climate change detection monitoring and indices etccdmi developed climate indices which can be used for measuring different climate extremes a list of the core climate indices of etccdmi with brief definitions and their units can be found at http etccdi pacificclimate org and also provided in the supplementary information s8 the major aims of this study include 1 climate extremes projection in the homogeneous climatic zones for selected gcms 2 spatio temporal trend analysis of the projected climate extremes and 3 significance analysis of the projected climate extremes the findings of this study may help policy makers in decision making in various areas like water management agriculture water availability urban planning food security etc further the findings of this study may help to address some of the sustainable development goals sdgs of the united nations development programme undp related to climate change actions water management hunger and environment the remaining paper is structured as section 2 presents data and study area section 3 is reserved for methodology section 4 has results sections 5 and 6 are about discussion and conclusions and recommendations respectively 2 data and study area two types of data sets observed climate data and high resolution statistically downscaled gcms outputs data have been used in this study on daily basis the observed data for the duration of 1976 2005 was acquired from pakistan meteorological department mpd while the outputs of gcms are downloaded from world climate research programme https esgf node llnl gov search cmip5 and then statistically downscaled for 34 meteorological stations across pakistan the duration of simulated data is from 1976 to 2100 where the duration of 1976 2005 is considers as baseline or reference period and the remaining duration is divided into three future durations i e future one f1 2011 2040 future two f2 2041 2070 and future three f3 2071 2100 the target area for this study is pakistan which has 23 4 38 n 61 78 e latitude and longitude respectively pakistan has four neighbor countries india in the eastern side china in the north east side afghanistan in the western side iran in west south side it has ocean is in the south and 26 000 sq km glacier cover area about one fourth of the glaciers in high mountain asia muhammad et al 2019a 2019b pakistan has a total area of 881 913 square kilometers and remains 33rd largest country of the world it remains 6th largest country with respect to population and contains approximately 220 million inhabitants according to the latest census of the country pakistan economic survey 2020 21 wprev worldometer 2021 worldometer 2021 3 methodology an integrated approach comprises mainly of five major steps have been developed and implemented to accomplish this study these steps are gcm selection downscaling the outputs of selected gcms evaluation downscaling skills projection of climate extremes and finally their spatio temporal trends analysis in the first step a set of gcms is selected for all considered climate variables for each climate zone by incorporating bayesian model averaging bma khan et al 2021 from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 in the second step the outputs of selected gcms are statistically downscaled to project the climate extremes in each climate zone finally the projected climate extremes are analyzed by incorporating statistical techniques for example probability density function spatio temporal trend analysis and their statistical significance the detail description about each part is discussed in the subsequent subsections and presented schematically in fig 2 3 1 gcm s selection initially 13 gcms were selected based on available literature where different approaches have been used for gcms evaluation for example we selected a set of gcms based on the literature review of ashfaq et al 2017 and skills score warm dry wet and cold criteria of lutz et al 2016 as the aim of this study to analyze climate extremes in each climate zone therefore it is important to evaluate gcms in each climate region given in fig 1 to refine further the choice of gcms model evaluation procedures is carried out by using bma which is a regression based approach where the dependent variable represents observed data and covariates represent gcms outputs in bma all possible combinations of the regression model or customized number of regression models can be estimated where each covariate outputs of gcm has a weight called posterior probability and it depends on how closely it realized the observed data consequently the gcms having higher weights which perform better in terms of projected observed data closely the model s selection criterion is posterior inclusion probability of the gcm which is the sum of posterior probabilities of each covariate gcm in all regression models included in bma for further details about the methodology of model selection we refer to khan et al 2021 a brief detail about 13 gcms is given in supplementary information s9 3 2 downscaling gcms outputs in statistical downscaling stationarity is an important assumption as without stationarity the same relationship may not exist in future dixon et al 2016 lanzante et al 2018 however spatial disaggregation quantile delta mapping sdqdm is a nonparametric method and therefore there is no parameters which need to be calibrated gudmundsson et al 2012 a prerequisite condition for a statistical downscaling method e g sdqdm that a reliable long term historical dataset is available over a study domain to build a relationship between gcm outputs and the observed data in other words observed statistical characteristics at each station are reflected in the sdqdm processes using the observed dataset within a study domain for instance a 50th percentile value of gcm s output is simply interpolated by idw inverse distance weighting to stations and then the interpolated values correspond to the same percentile values of observation at each station are bias corrected by qdm in this way all gcm outputs are bias corrected at all stations and preserve gcm driven climate signals cannon et al 2015 cannon 2018 the resolution of the downscaled data is determine by the resolution of reference or observed data for further details about downscaling bias correction we refer to cannon et al 2015 cannon 2018 brekke et al 2013 and wood et al 2004 before the implementation of bias correction it is assumed that y o t y m h t and y m f t denote observed model s simulated historical and future data respectively in the subscript o m h f and t represent observed model historical future and time respectively similarly f o f m h f m f represent cumulative distribution function of observed data model s simulated data for historical time and future time period respectively we start with time dependent cumulative distribution function of model projected series 1 f m f y m f t p y m f t y m f t f m f t 0 1 find the relative change using the ratio of inverse cdf of model predicted data applied to the cdf of model predicted data and the inverse cdf of historical observed data applied to model predicted data mathematically this can be represented by eq 2 2 m y t f m f 1 f m f y m f t f m h 1 f m f y m f t y m f t f m h 1 f m f y m f t the quantile of model s predicted data can now be bias corrected by applying the inverse cdf estimated from observed data set over the historical duration 3 y ˆ m h t f o 1 f m f y t the f o 1 is the inverse of cumulative distribution function estimated from observed data during the calibration period and y ˆ m h t is the bias corrected model s simulated data for the historical duration the bias corrected future projections can be obtained by applying the relative changes to the historical bias corrected data given in eq 3 and expressed in eqs 4 and 5 for temperature and precipitation respectively 4 y ˆ m f t y ˆ m h t m y t 5 y ˆ m f t y ˆ m h t m y t 3 3 evaluating skills of downscaling method it is important to assess the skills of downscaling methos before proceeding for making futures projections there are various criteria that can be used for this purpose however the mean error me mean square error mse percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse are used in this study 3 4 climate extremes analysis extreme events are easy to recognize but due to different reasons it is difficult to define it mcphillips 2018 broska et al 2021 the reasons including no uniform definition of extreme events the word extremeness is relative and strongly depends on the context to calculate the climate extremes indices the observed and downscaled model simulated data was prepared for each climate zone for the reference and future durations the r s package climdex is used to compute 27 core climate indices based on daily minimum maximum temperature and precipitation karl et al 1999 peterson 2005 etccdi the parameters of climate extremes which are considered important for impact assessment include are intensity frequency and persistence statistical analysis of the projected climate extremes is then performed using probability density function pdf which shows full distribution of climate extremes for different durations a comparison between baseline and future durations is made by using pdfs of climate extremes which provide information about shift changes in the mean as well as in variability of climate extremes it is important to understand the spatial distribution of climate extremes therefore the projected climate extremes are spatially interpolated over the whole domain the interpolation is performed for the changes in comparison to reference period percent changes for some climate extreme in climate extremes for selected gcms in the future durations for both scenarios to 1 1 km grid size thirdly it is extremely important to know about the trend and statistical significance of the climate extremes in the future this will help policy makers to make policy accordingly and on priority basis the statistical significance of each climate extreme was tested at 5 level of significance and noted that if the p value for a particular climate extreme is less than or equal to significance level then we say that it is significantly changing if the p value for a particular climate extreme index is greater than the significance level then we say that it is insignificantly changing decreasing increasing 3 5 uncertainty assessment uncertainty assessment in climate projections particularly in climate extremes is important li et al 2022 ali et al 2019 this can help stakeholders and policymakers in taking mitigation adaptation measures in relevant sectors for the assessment of uncertainty in climate extremes the observed climate extremes are compared with the projected climate extremes for various gcm for the reference period this can show the deviation of projected climate extremes from observed climate extremes as well as between different gcms projected extremes for the assessment of uncertainty assessment in climate extremes pdfs and box whisker plots are used to assess whether the observed and model simulated climate extremes follow the same probability distribution the kolmogorov smirnov s k test has been implemented the null hypothesis in s k test is that the two data sets follow the same probability distribution if p value of the test is less than or equal to 0 05 this mean that the observed and simulated climate extremes don not follow the same probability distribution at 5 level of significance in addition the trajectory of projected climate data along with observed data can also provide information about the uncertainty in the projected data for both rcps 4 results results of this study are divided into three parts firstly evaluation of downscaling skills secondly the results of climate extremes analysis including probability density functions of projected climate extremes spatial temporal trend analysis and statistical significance of climate extremes are presented in the end uncertainties in climate extremes are given 4 1 downscaling skills evaluation the downscaling method is evaluated graphically and numerically by using climate extremes for the reference period fig 3 shows the comparison between climate extremes estimated from gcm output and downscaled data with observed climate extremes the downscaled r95p follows the pattern of observed r95p in terms of average values and variability in comparison to the gcm output for su25 the distribution of observed data is closely followed by the downscaled one as compared to the gcm output for r99p and txx the performance of downscaling method shows that these climate extremes are closely approximated by the downscaled data as comparison to the gcm output the number of cwd is significantly overestimated by gcm in terms of variability and maximum number of cwd on the other hand tnx is significantly underestimated by gcm output compared to the downscaled average minimum and maximum values the results show that all these climate extremes are approximated closely by the downscaled data in comparison to the gcm output table 1 show evaluation of downscaling method using daily climate data the results are based on four criteria me mse pbias and rmse for gcm outputs and downscaled climate data with observed data the results of these statistics show that the downscaled data is closer to the observed data as compared to the gcm original outputs in all climatic regions of the country except a few values therefore the downscaled climate data is used for further analysis 4 2 extremes analysis fig 4 shows the result of su25 the number of days when temperature is 25 c or higher for both climate change scenarios su25 has an increasing pattern in all climate zones for rcp4 5 there is positive increment in the mean number of summer days in future across the country however a maximum increase is noted during f1 in contrast to f2 and f3 in zone 1 in zone 2 there is clear increasing trend in the number of summer days during all future durations in zone 3 5 the maximum increase in the number of summer days is noted during f2 the number of summer days varies zonal wise with lowest of approximately 185 days per year in zone 1 the maximum annual increase is observed during f1 in zone 1 f2 in zones 3 5 and f3 in zone 2 the results of summer days under the rcp8 5 indicate a clearly visible increasing shift in the future it is significantly increasing however a maximum increase is noted during f1 in zone 4 in zone 1 the average number of summer days are approximately 160 170 200 and 225 during baseline f1 f2 and f3 respectively the increase in summer days will help in growing crops in zone 1 however it will severely affect crops production human health population s migration water availability and food security in the remaining zones therefore optimal utilization and smart management of available water may help to cope the worser situation about water scarcity in the future in addition the increasing number of summer days will increase the rate of snow and glacier melt and consequently more water will be available in summer with increased probability of hazards muhammad et al 2021 tian et al 2017 however the mass of glaciers may be reduced muhammad et al 2016 the spatio temporal distribution of changes in tx90p warm days for canesm2 during future is shown in fig 5 the tx90p represent total percentage of days when daily maximum temperature is greater than 90th percentile under rcp4 5 the tx90p has mixed and heterogenous trends the warm days are mostly decreasing except the south west part of the country during all three future durations maximum decrease in tx90p is observed in east central central and central western parts of the country while maximum increase is noted in the south western part of the country during f2 and f1 respectively under the rcp4 5 the maximum increase and decrease in rcp4 5 are approximately 2 days each under rcp8 5 the pattern is similar as for rcp4 5 with higher increment also the maximum increase under rcp8 5 is noted during f2 during f1 there is a decrease in tx90p across the country except south western part of the country where it is increasing maximum increase in tx90p is observed during f2 while minimum decrease is noted during f1 f3 has moderate increase in tx90p under the rcp8 5 however during this time period there is an increase in the northern part of the country which is rich with water resources fig 6 present the probability density functions of total precipitation for canesm2 with both climate change scenarios the total precipitation is increasing in zones 1 3 and decreasing during f3 in zones 4 5 a part of zones 1 is frozen water resources with mostly glacier and snow covered and zone 2 has monsoon effect with heavy precipitation the accumulated precipitation reaches to 1500 mm and 3400 mm in zone 1 and zone 2 respectively in zone 3 the relative changes are comparatively insignificant due to less precipitation accumulation the pattern is different in the results of rcp8 5 with different values fig 7 shows the future s spatio temporal distribution of percent changes in r99p over pakistan for canesm2 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the r99p represent annual total precipitation when daily precipitation is greater than 99th percentile maximum increase is noted in the south east part and in the coastal areas during future durations we found a maximum decrease of 38 and increase of 238 40 under the rcp8 5 the results of r99p show an increase during f1 mixed results increase decrease during f2 and maximum increase during f3 maximum decrease and increase are observed during f2 and f3 respectively under the rcp8 5 in addition maximum increase is observed during f2 and f3 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 maximum decrease in r99p is observed in the northern and south western parts of the country while maximum percent increase is noted in the south east part of the country in the entire duration under both scenarios the possible consequences of increasing r99p would be flash flooding damages infrastructures crops loses and casualties in the future however proper planning about storage of water plantation and hazard s resilience infrastructure can reduce such type of damages fig 8 shows the changes in cwd consecutive wet days for both climate change scenarios for canesm2 the results indicate a mixed trend with increasing cwd in the future in zone 1 in zone 2 there is decreasing trend during most of the years while an increase in few years in the future zone 3 has mixed trend in cwd throughout the future in zone 4 the first half of each future duration has a mixed trend however a decrease in cwd in the second half in all future durations is noted in zone 5 the first half of each time periods indicate a decrease in contrast to an increase in the second half for most of the years the maximum increase 14 days and decrease 13 days is noted in zone 2 the results of changes in cwd under rcp8 5 follow similar pattern however maximum increase 14 days and decrease 17 days are noted in zone 2 fig 9 represents the magnitudes and statistical significance at 5 level of significance of zonal temperature extremes under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 fig 9 indicates a clearly visible trend in some climate extremes for example tn10p cold nights and tx10p cold days these two climate extremes varies in different zones and models cold nights are significantly increasing only for fgoal s2 in zone 2 in zone 4 and 5 the cold nights and cold days are significantly decreasing in contrast tn90p warm nights and tx90p warm days are significantly increasing in most of the gcms zones with few exceptions of insignificant decrease and increase indicating future climate warming under rcp4 5 summer days are increasing throughout the future durations under rcp4 5 except short term decrease in zone 1 and 2 the increasing summer days will have significant impact on agriculture water and other important sectors ice days are either decreasing or not changing except zone 2 and 3 similarly frost days are mostly decreasing most of the temperature extremes are changing significantly under the rcp8 5 are shown in fig 9 cold night tn10p and cold days tx10p are significantly decreasing throughout future in contrast the warm night tn90p and warm days tx90p are significantly increasing throughout except for ccsm4 in zone 5 with significantly decreasing trend during f1 and f2 summer days are significantly increasing in most of the future durations frost days fd0 are decreasing throughout the future except f3 in zone 3 under gfdl esm 2 m model the results of tropical nights tr20 show significant increase in future except a decrease during f1 in zone 5 for ccsm4 the results of precipitation extremes under both scenarios are shown in fig 10 which indicate an irregular spatio temporal trend notably precipitation from extremely wet days r99p is increasing during f2 and f3 except a decrease in zone 3 with most of the decrease during f1 under the rcp4 5 in addition the number of heavy precipitation and very heavy precipitation days are increasing across zone 1 and 2 in contrast to the decreasing trends in the remaining zones with few exceptions the results of precipitation extremes under rcp8 5 show that most of the extremes have mixed trend with few significant changes like in rcp4 5 most of the significant changes are observed in the high altitude areas represented as zone 1 and 2 in zone 1 r95p is decreasing initially in f1 followed by a significant increase during f2 and insignificant increase during f3 for cmcc cms model similarly r99p is decreasing during f1 but significantly increasing during f2 and f3 for cmcc cms model a similar trend is noted in prcptot with a decrease during f1 and increase during f2 and f3 consecutive dry days cdd are insignificant except a significant increase by miroc esm chem model in zone 4 and canesm2 in zone 5 in zone 1 and 2 the cdd are increasing in f2 and f3 except canesm2 indicating decreasing trend during f3 during f1 cdd has mixed trend in zone 1 and 2 likewise the cwd also have mixed trend and mostly decreasing during f1 and increasing during f2 and f3 in zones 1 and 2 in zones 4 and 5 cwd has mostly increasing trend with few exceptions for some more results we refer to supplementary material 4 3 uncertainties in the projected climate extremes figs 11 12 show a comparison of observed climate extremes with projected climate extremes for the reference period using pdfs and box whisker plots respectively the r99p is approximated in a better way by cmcc cms in comparison to other gcms some of the gcms have bimodal distribution the su25 is projected reasonably by canesm3 and cmcc csm as compared to the other gcms in terms of extreme values the highest number of summer days are180 and 183 for observed and canesm2 projected data respectively the average summer days are 162 and 159 for observed and canesm2 projected data respectively for inmcm4 the average number of summer days is 129 with a significance difference in minimum and maximum number of summer days in comparison to observed data the other extremes like r99p tx90p and tn90p are closely approximated by various gcms however the observed maximum r99p is underestimated by all gcms the number cdd is overestimated by all gcms however the cmss csm has approximately better in terms of average values from fig 11 for most of the climate extremes the observed extremes and model predicted extremes follow the same probability distribution using k s test however for cdd the distribution of model simulated cdd is different for that of observed cdd for the mentioned gcms the uncertainty is higher in the projected cdd in comparison to other climate extremes as shown in fig 12 it is anticipated that the uncertainty in the projected extremes will increases in the future the trajectory supplementary information s1 of projected climate data closely approximates the observed maximum minimum temperature and precipitation however in the future there may be higher uncertainties in comparison the reference period the uncertainties level may vary in both rcps in the future as some of the climate extremes are interpolated from stations to the full domain of the study which can introduce uncertainties especially where the meteorological stations are at larger distance and have significant elevation variation therefore it is important for relevant policy makers to keep in mind the uncertainties in projected climate extremes while developing future plans 5 discussion if we look at the worst impacts of weather and climate extremes in the south asian region the findings are alarming recently wmo 2021 stated that climate and weather extremes killed thousands of people displaced millions of people causing a heavy toll on ecosystems and infrastructure and consequently cost hundreds of billions of dollars in the light of the above consequences it is important to have enough information about the duration frequency and persistence of these extremes during the recent and future duration as well toward this end there are a few studies regarding climate extreme analysis and projections over pakistan for instance sheikh et al 2009 analyzed climate extremes using daily data for temperature for the duration of 1971 2000 and precipitation for the duration of 1961 2000 for the south asian countries they concluded that the warm and cold extremes are more and less common respectively further their study suggested mixed trend for the indices related to heaviest rainfall r95p and r99p throughout south asia a conducted study by islam et al 2009 to project temperature and precipitation extremes using daily outputs of a regional climate model precis providing regional climate for impact studies with 50 by 50 km horizontal resolution over pakistan they considered the 1960 1990 and 2071 2100 as reference and future durations respectively in their study they concluded that the annual cold spell suggests significant decreasing trend however annual warm spell show slight upward trend in pakistan in another study over pakistan sajjad and ghaffar 2018 analyzed climate extremes using ensemble mean daily outputs of three gcms with two emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 their findings suggested that summer days has increasing trend over north eastern part of the country their findings further suggested that the frequency of heavy precipitation has significantly increasing trend over the north western part of the country ali et al 2019 projected climate extremes for the reference duration 1976 2005 and future durations 2006 2035 2036 2065 2066 2095 over six sub region of pakistan using daily data their results suggested that the consecutive wet days and consecutive dry days are increasing and decreasing in the future across the country generally and in the south eastern part particularly however the sub regions they considered in their study have no scientific background as the heavy precipitation increasing across the country and extremely heavy precipitation increasing significantly in the south eastern part therefore there may be flooding and can damage human lives infrastructure and crops on the other hand summer days and consecutive dry days are increasing across the country while the consecutive wet days are decreasing this may cause droughts in some parts of the country in the future and can further increase the demand of water for agriculture and other purposes the decrease in cold nights and days and increase in warm nights and days indicate a warming climate in the future the northern part of the country is rich with water resources himalaya hindukush karakoram hkh which may have severe consequences of this warming climate the potential consequences include glacial lake outburst flood glof floods due to higher snow and glacier melt glacier surges and collapses muhammad and tian 2020 as this region is very sensitive to climate change according to archer 2003 with the increase of 1 c increase in temperature can cause a 16 17 increase in river flow in the upper indus basin the abrupt changes increase decrease in river flow in the northern part of the country can disturb the supply demand balance of water of the country and can be a disaster for hydropower agriculture and infrastructure khadka et al 2014 shen et al 2003 noted that short term increase in temperature can cause glof in addition in the warming climate the snow and glaciers will melt at higher rate gul et al 2017 and can not only disturb the current systembut also the glacier will lose their mass sooner sigdel et al 2020 this needs special attention from government and relevant stakeholders to focus on mitigation and adaptation strategies for minimizing the impacts of climate change on snow and glaciers the other important region of pakistan is the central eastern part mainly comprised of punjab province which is considers as food basket for the country the increase in heavy and extremely heavy precipitation can destroy cops and toll heavy cost to the infrastructure due to flooding situation in the future as the warm days and nights are increasing while the cold days and cold nights are decreasing therefore the crops may need more water in future as compared to the requirement of today in addition the consecutive wet days and consecutive dry days are decreasing and increasing respectively which can further exacerbate the demand of water in the future beside all these problems taking appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures and better management of available water resources can reduce the worse consequences of weather and climate extremes considerably in the future this can further help to meet the undp sdgs related to hunger climate action and environment fao already stated in 2016 that the hunger level is constantly rising since 2014 and it may be difficult to meet zero hunger by 2030 6 conclusions and recommendations there is a clear shift increasing in total precipitation for canesm2 model under the rcp4 5 in future except in zone 5 with an increase during f1 and f2 and a decrease during f3 warm nights are mostly increasing in future with significant increase under rcp8 5 the number of warm days tx90p are increasing during f1 and f2 and decreasing during f3 for cmcc cms model it has significantly increasing trend under both scenarios except few decreasing or insignificantly increasing trends in contrast tn10p and tx10p have decreasing trends under both scenarios in the future except a few exceptions of increasing trends the trends in tx90p tn90p tn10p and tx10p indicate that there will warmer climate with more number extremes related to high temperature in the future summer days are homogenously increasing for canesm2 and cmcc cms models under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the changes are apparent both in the number of mean days and in the variability of summer days the number of summer days shows an increase with a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 55 days in a year the maximum increase is noted in the central west part of the country during f3 under rcp8 5 the number of very wet days r95p are increasing in future except f3 for some climate zones the spatial distribution of climate extremes of the extreme wet days r99p indicates a higher increase in percent in zone 4 during f2 and f3 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in contrast the overall extreme wet days in zones 1 3 are decreasing there is a mixed trend in the number of warm nights in canesm2 model maximum change is 2 days in zone 2 during f3 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the changes in the number of warm days have mixed trends throughout the country the maximum increase is observed in zone 4 while maximum decrease in zone 1 2 and 5 the trend of climate extreme and their significance vary between climate zones of the country the findings may help the government and policy makers in mitigation and adaptation strategies regarding climate change impacts in pakistan in addition the results suggest to find connection between climate extremes in the high altitude areas contributing snow and glacier melt this can further help to analyze the future s contribution of snow and glacier melt due to climate extremes similarly it may be interesting to investigate the potential impact of climate extreme on spatio temporal distribution of rainfall in zone 2 monsoon dominated region which receives more than 80 rainfall during monsoon mid of june mid of september season more importantly it is suggested to investigate the potential impact of projected climate extremes on food security in zone 5 the remaining zone are mostly drought prone therefore drought situation in zones 3 4 is the key future s research area further we will need crops and foods which are resilient to projected climate in the future credit authorship contribution statement dr firdos started the idea of this paper
