significantly important role for multiple purposes such as hydropower generation ding et al 2021 ma et al 2020 and irrigation wang et al 2021a rapid development in local industries has led to the increasing demand for water resources and electricity scientifically allocating the limited water resources among various demand could produce great social benefits hence multi objective optimal operation of cascade reservoirs is vital particularly in water deficient areas in the early 21st century a large variety of multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas flourished due to their effectiveness and robustness jones et al 2002 tan et al 2002 based on decomposition zhang and li 2007 domination deb et al 2002 zitzler et al 2001 or indicator zitzler and künzli 2004 multi objective optimization algorithms have been developed and had a wide range of water resources applications giuliani et al 2018 reed and kollat 2013 wang et al 2021b zheng et al 2016 for example qiu et al 2021 reduced the systematic risks among water supply hydropower generation and the environment by optimizing the operation of reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin zhang et al 2019 optimized the allocation of water resources to irrigation sectors and the result could guide local water management strategies nevertheless the performance of these algorithms deteriorates with an increase in the number of decision variables this is known as the curse of dimensionality the number of decision variables is positively correlated to the number of reservoirs number of planning years and reciprocal of the time step ma et al 2021 niu et al 2021 thus optimal operation of giant reservoir systems with long term planning periods or multi year regulation capacity is a typical large scale problem thus far many scholars in the field of water resources have ignored this issue owing to high evaluation costs to deal with the curse of dimensionality large scale multi objective optimization often uses divide and conquer or transformation strategies to downscale significantly large numbers of decision variables ren et al 2021 tian et al 2021 yang et al 2008 zille et al 2018 the former divides decision variables into several groups and optimizes each group separately whereas the latter alters the original variables and optimizes the problem in a new decision space the weight optimization framework wof zille et al 2018 combines these two strategies and is proven to outperform traditional algorithms cao et al 2020 on large scale benchmark problems moreover the framework still needs an optimizer to implement optimization process in the original work of zille the performance of wof with optimizer nsgaii was superior to other optimizers since the first time nsgaii was introduced into water resources kapelan et al 2005 the algorithm has showed promise in this field aboutalebi et al 2015 xu et al 2015 there are modified version of nsgaii aim at better dominance archiving kollat and reed 2006 larger search space ahmadi and tiruta barna 2015 bai et al 2015 considering their improvement for the specific issue and easier access to the original nsgaii we select nsgaii optimizer to implement our study which could also be recognized as a step in nsga families to alleviate the curse of dimensionality to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to adopt the wof for reservoir operation optimization to deal with curse of dimensionality when putting into practice a range of grouping mechanisms proposed by the author zille et al 2018 yields biased performances a possible way to determine the best grouping mechanism is discussed later herein another limitation of wof arises when complicated constraints are involved because wof was designed without constraints traditional constraints handling methods such as penalty function datta et al 2017 li et al 2008 constrained domination deb 2000 ning et al 2017 fail in the real world problem and as such a new repair method is proposed to better emulate cascade reservoir system this study mainly aims to adapt and tune the wof to optimize long term reservoir operation with multi year regulation capacity the main contributions of this study include improving the wof performance in the field of reservoir operation by modifying the grouping mechanism and repair constraints cascade reservoirs in the upper yellow

discussion are presented in section 4 section 5 concludes the study findings 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the upper yellow river refers to the stream running from the river source to hekou town with a length of 3471 6 km and a drainage area of 428 000 km2 with an average annual runoff of 20 billion m3 of the tangnaihai station the upper part of river holds 36 of the total runoff and serves as the water resources for 52 billion people 2019 living in five provinces of qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia and inner mongolia in china as well as their production activities elevated demands have made the contradiction between supply and demand more prominent the uyrb known as a clean energy base holds dozens of reservoirs fig 1 with the main target being hydropower generation the key characteristics of the reservoirs are presented in table 1 in the context of increasing demand for water resources these reservoirs especially longyangxia and liujiaxia with multi year regulation capacity and yearly regulation capacity respectively are playing important roles for multiple use purposes e g water supply at the lanzhou section and ecological protection at the shizuishan and toudaoguai station some studies selected typical years to formulate reservoir operation failing to fully utilize the multi year regulation capacity of longyangxia bai et al 2019 si et al 2019 hence we adopted the 2005 2017 series to simulate and optimize the reservoir operation for multiple use the scheduling horizon is from sep 2005 to aug 2017 with 144 identical periods because by the end of the flood season in 2005 the water level of longyangxia hit an all time high 2 2 datasets real operations including inflow and outflow of reservoirs were extracted from the online database from the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources http www yrcc gov cn the parameters of reservoirs and the basic operation rules were extracted from the huanghe hydropower development co ltd which is shown in table 1 water demand was set in three scenarios based on the the water distribution plan 1987 and the comprehensive planning of the yellow river basin representing the water utilization levels in 2010 2020 and 2030 yang et al 2021 hereinafter the scenarios are abbreviated as s1 s2 and s3 respectively table 2 presents the values of water demand in each scenario 3 methodology 3 1 multi objective reservoir operation model in this study a multi purpose reservoir operation model was developed for hydropower generation and comprehensive water supply for the objectives of the study whereas other operation targets such as ice control flood control were set as constraints the objectives could be expressed in terms of maximum hydropower generation and minimum water shortage objective 1 represents the maximum hydropower generation from reservoirs as presented below 1 max e i 1 n j 1 t k i q i j e h i j δ t j where e is the hydropower generation function kw h n and t is the number of reservoir and period respectively k i is the hydropower efficiency coefficient of the i th reservoirs q ei j is the water release for the i th hydropower during the j th period m³ s h i j is the average hydropower head of the i th reservoir during the j th period m and t j is the duration of the j th period h objective 2 represents the minimum water shortage at the lanzhou section as described below 2 min s j 1 t a j d j q j l z δ t j 3 a j 0 ifd j q j l z 1 ifd j q j l z 4 q j l z q 10 j q j l o c a l where s is the water supply function m³ s month a j is the coefficient of water shortage during the j th period d j and q lzj are the water demand and supply at the lanzhou section during the j th period respectively m³ s q 10 j is the outflow of liujiaxia the 10th reservoir in this study during the j th period and q localj is the local inflow from liujiaxia to the lanzhou section m³ s which is mainly consist of huang shui and tao he the largest two tributaries in uyrb constraints include water balance water level outflow ice control flood control hydropower outputs and operation schedule which are demonstrated below water balance constraints 5 v i j 1 v i j q i j q i j l i j δ t j i 1 6 v i j 1 v i j q i j l o c a l q i 1 j q i j l i j δ t j i 2 3 n where v i j is the i th reservoir storage volume during the jth period m³ q i

reservoir during the j th period m³ s l i j is the average loss of the ith reservoir during the j th period including water spillage and evapotranspiration m³ s considering the interval is a month we do not consider the movement of water only water volume is counted instead water level constraints 7 z i j z i j z i j where z i j is forebay water level of the i th reservoir at the end of j th period m z i j and z i j are the lower and upper bounds m when j belongs to flood season the lower and upper bounds are corresponding to dead water level and flood control water level when j belongs to dry season the lower and upper bounds are corresponding to dead water level and normal water level outflow constraints 8 q i j q i j q i j where q i j is average outflow of the i th reservoir during the j th period m q i j and q i j are the lower and upper bounds m it s notable that when ice control and flood control are merged into constraints but it only scopes at liujiaxia i 10 because it is the nearest reservoir to lanzhou with regulation capacity when j belongs to flood season q 10 j is equal to 2500 a calibrated value to guarantee downstream flood safety when j belongs to ice

reservoir during the j th period kw the power output should below the installed capacity initial and final water level constraints 10 z i 1 z i b e g i n z i t z i e n d where z i beg in and z i end are preset forebay water level according to real world schedule operation schedule constraints according to the operation schedule longyangxia is plan to store from june to november and release from december to may liujiaxia is plan to store from july to september and december to march for flood control and ice control while vacate storage capacity in other periods for irrigation or pre release 3 2 wof in this section we first introduce the wof briefly which has been explained in detail by zille et al 2018 the wof aims to reduce the dimensionality of the search space by optimizing weights instead of decision variables a multi objective problem mop can be formulated as follows where f represents the objective function x is the decision variable vector m is the number of objectives and ω is the decision space 11 z min f x f 1 x f 2 x f m x s t x ω r n by taking a fixed solution x the original optimization problem z can be reformulated into a new problem z x which optimizes vector w with input parameter x 12 z x min f x w f 1 x w f 2 x w f m x w s t w φ r n f o x w f o ψ w x o 1 2 m ψ w x w 1 x 1 w 2 x 2 w n x n to reduce the dimensionality of the problem grouping is introduced decision variables n are divided into γ groups with size l γ l n each group shares the same weight w j j 1 2 γ for every l decision variable hence the transformation function ψ can be reformulated as follows and the decision variables are reduced from n to γ for a fixed x algorithm can approximate the pareto set by optimizing the weight instead by switching the fixed few x according to the crowding distance in the current population the optimization process is guided by x herein nsgaii was set to the optimizer in the wof to enable a direct comparison with the classic nsgaii deb et al 2002 13 ψ w x w 1 x 1 w 1 x 2 w 1 x l w 1 w γ x n l 1 w γ x n w γ the flowchart and main steps of the wof are described below and presented in fig 2 a optimize problem z for t 1 evaluations with the optimizer for warm up this step is entirely unrelated to the wof and problem z is optimized by nsgaii for t 1 evaluations b select q typically q equals the number of objectives plus 1 solutions based on the crowding distance c reformulate all the q solutions in the form of function ψ as suggested in eq 13 thereafter the new decision variables of the weight are optimized by nsgaii for t 2 evaluations this step is crucial for the wof because the original decisions are divided and transformed to reduce the dimensionality d the above steps are repeated until the used evaluations reach threshold1 e the remaining evaluations are used without the weight until all the evaluations are completed 3 3 tuning wof this study is novel in that it proposes a method to determine the grouping mechanism including the grouping strategy and grouping number and a constraint handing method to repair constraints in reservoir operation in zille et al 2018 research three group strategies were proposed linear grouping order grouping and random grouping and it was recommended that the grouping mechanism had a direct influence on the solution set however an appropriate method for a specific problem was not suggested hence we tune the adaptability of the grouping mechanism in the field of water resources in the following manner according to the coding model all decision variables water release are in chronological order with the upper reservoir at the beginning of the queue the chronological order corresponds to linear grouping which preserves the input features input the inflow of reservoir operation as for the number of groups inspired by sequential clustering dong et al 2014 sundaray et al 2011 we intend to decrease increase the intra group variance inter group variance since discharges in the same group share the same weight however the decision variables are not constant and it is not possible to group them directly based on variance previous research de la cruz courtois et al 2021 yang et al 2020 has shown that water release is closely related to the inflow of lead reservoir indicating that we can cluster the inflows instead of outflows we can merely cluster the inflows of the first reservoir which is longyangxia in our study owing to hydraulic connections and the total number of groups is given by the cluster number multiplied by reservoir numbers to address complicated constraints dual progressive repair fig 3 was adopted in this study to modify infeasible solutions into feasible ones which is another aspect wherein the study is novel inspired by wang et al 2017 efforts to ensure search solutions in feasible space is a must pre defining feasible search space is not applicable in a cascade system because hydraulic connection makes the feasible bounds tentative as an alternative dual progressive repair method is proposed after every generation of offspring to make all the solutions feasible after crossover and mutation it is very likely that the next generation q i t fails to satisfy the constraints leading to distortion if q i t exceeds the upper bound it is forced to equal the bound if q i t does not reach the lower bound it is forced to equal the bound similarly at the operational level dual implies that repair method works from the upper level reservoir longyangxia to the lower level liujiaxia in each step because an unreasonable q i 1 t might lead to the i th reservoir breaking through constraints irrespective of the value of q i t all the variables are checked in a sequential loop as a result the dual progressive repair method could reduce time complexity from o n2 to o n another advantage is that the sequential order could naturally guarantee the operation schedule constraints that the forebay water level is ascending or descending without tracing back the main steps are summarized as follows a loop j 1 2 t b check whether all the constraints at i th reservoir are within the constraints if not go to c otherwise i i 1 c calibrate variable q i t to bounds according to all the constraints 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of reservoir operation results with the long series historical inflow data as input and different water utilization level as parameters in objectives optimal solutions of reservoirs are obtained using nsgaii and wof nsgaii in five independent runs with default parameters γ 4 linear grouping t 1 1000 t 2 500 q 4 and threshold1 0 5 threshold2 on platemo 2 8 tian et al 2017 the test of benchmark problems he et al 2019 of lsmop is listed in the supplementary materials it s notable that different optimizers are provided in two phases but we do not adopt this strategy for consistency the number of individuals is set at 100 and threshold2 is equal to the total iterations i e 40000 the indicator hypervolume hv jia et al 2020 tian et al 2021 yang et al 2017 is selected to evaluate the convergence and diversity of the algorithm because the true pareto front is unknown in real world problems figs 4 and 5 show the pareto fronts and hv process in three scenarios the results agree well with former research si et al 2019 as there exists prominent tradeoff between hydropower generation and water supply the range of hydropower generation is larger than that recorded in yellow river yearbook from the yellow river institute of hydraulic research owing to optimization based on known reservoir inflow it can be observed that the results of wof nsgaii are better than those of nsgaii because they have lower water deficiency for the same hydropower generation from the average perspective wof nsgaii achieves 19 7 26 6 and 62 2 million more hydropower generation and 11 41 8 721 and 6 736 lower in water deficiency in s1 s2 and s3 respectively in all runs although pfs in fig 5a and c do not show a strictly dominated trend the average results seem to prove that it is probably due to randomness of moeas the mean different between hv lines in terms of the performance of the algorithms reaches from 1 6 to 9 1 in the final iterations the hvs obtained by wof nsgaii are significantly greater than those obtained by nsgaii in s1 and s2 based on rank sum test 4 2 comparison of results between different grouping mechanisms in this section we consider s2 as an example to examine the performances of different grouping mechanisms in section 3 2 we proposed the most suitable grouping number based on minimal intra group variance which is aligned with maximum inter group variance another index named trace within clusters tr is calculated complementarily the higher the tr value the better the grouping fig 6 shows the performance in terms of inter group variance and tr index there are considerable differences between the neighbors at γ 6 in the inter group variance and the elbow point in tr line is achieved at this value l a relatively special point the grouping improves with the increase in the group number predictably but reversely adds difficulty to the divide and conquer intends that s why we use γ 6 as a reasonable grouping number figs 7 and 8 present the results obtained for different grouping numbers and grouping mechanisms the results are consistent with the earlier assumption and analysis the pareto front at γ 6 achieves the best performance whereas the results exacerbate with an increase in the grouping number the main improvement is in the high hydropower generation part with a factor of 0 8 smaller than those of γ 4 8 12 and 24 in terms of water deficiency as the number of groups increases the corresponding weights that need to optimize also increases undoubtedly leading to deteriorating hv values as for grouping mechanisms there is no clear difference among the pareto fronts in the final iteration with order grouping slightly worse than others we believe that the optimization is not sensitive to the order of variables however stakeholders show significantly higher tolerance to less power generation than less water wu et al 2021 indicating that decision makers mainly prefer solutions in the lower left part of pareto fronts hence the pareto front obtained by linear grouping is preferred over others differences in reservoir storage trajectories obtained by topsis dai et al 2010 and realistic operation are presented in fig 9 hydropower generation and water deficiency of the selected solutions from the pareto front with parameters of linear grouping and γ 6 are presented in table 3 the schedules with higher water levels obtained by optimization can significantly increase hydropower generation by 1 04 but decrease water supply shortage by 32 6 the trajectories of water supply and demand at the lanzhou section are presented in fig 10 in generally water deficiency mainly occurs during winter every year the optimized schedule can provide approximately 20 7 more water as it is more reasonable compared to the realistic one the three key improvements of 29 5 25 2 and 68 1 were achieved in 2009 2011 and 2016 respectively 5 conclusions to facilitate long term planning of large reservoir systems with multi year regulation capacity a state of the art large scale multi objective algorithm called wof was introduced in this study the tuning of the wof was proposed to determine the optimal parameters also a new constraints handling method called dual progressive repair was introduce to emulate the reservoir system operation the innovations were examined in the case of reservoirs in the uyrb our first conclusion is that the wof with the optimizer nsgaii outperformed the classic nsgaii because the water supply was lesser for the same hydropower generation validating the necessity and feasibility of wof in water resources management second the tuning of the wof based on the grouping mechanism and repairing infeasible solutions was found to be effective and was verified for practical use for the series from 2005 to 2017 the optimal grouping number was 6 and the grouping strategy was linear grouping although not that sensitive the method of determining grouping mechanisms and repairing infeasible solutions could be extended to other cases third the optimization schedule slightly increased the hydropower generation by 1 04 but significantly decreased water deficiency by 32 6 compared to those of realistic schedules water supply mostly increased in winter which was the most water deficient season however this study has some limitations since the model is applicable to deterministic inflow and water demand situations furthermore stochastic optimization and agent based models could be coupled to simulate inflow with uncertainty and human reaction to water shortage additionally parallelism can be further coupled in the algorithm to reduce runtime ethical

2 wof in this section we first introduce the wof briefly which has been explained in detail by zille et al 2018 the wof aims to reduce the dimensionality of the search space by optimizing weights instead of decision variables a multi objective problem mop can be formulated as follows where f represents the objective function x is the decision variable vector m is the number of objectives and ω is the decision space 11 z min f x f 1 x f 2 x f m x s t x ω r n by taking a fixed solution x the original optimization problem z can be reformulated into a new problem z x which optimizes vector w with input parameter x 12 z x min f x w f 1 x w f 2 x w f m x w s t w φ r n f o x w f o ψ w x o 1 2 m ψ w x w 1 x 1 w 2 x 2 w n x n to reduce the dimensionality of the problem grouping is introduced decision variables n are divided into γ groups with size l γ l n each group shares the same weight w j j 1 2 γ for every l decision variable hence the transformation function ψ can be reformulated as follows and the decision variables are reduced from n to γ for a fixed x algorithm can approximate the pareto set by optimizing the weight instead by switching the fixed few x according to the crowding distance in the current population the optimization process is guided by x herein nsgaii was set to the optimizer in the wof to enable a direct comparison with the classic nsgaii deb et al 2002 13 ψ w x w 1 x 1 w 1 x 2 w 1 x l w 1 w γ x n l 1 w γ x n w γ the flowchart and main steps of the wof are described below and presented in fig 2 a optimize problem z for t 1 evaluations with the optimizer for warm up this step is entirely unrelated to the wof and problem z is optimized by nsgaii for t 1 evaluations b select q typically q equals the number of objectives plus 1 solutions based on the crowding distance c reformulate all the q solutions in the form of function ψ as suggested in eq 13 thereafter the new decision variables of the weight are optimized by nsgaii for t 2 evaluations this step is crucial for the wof because the original decisions are divided and transformed to reduce the dimensionality d the above steps are repeated until the used evaluations reach threshold1 e the remaining evaluations are used without the weight until all the evaluations are completed 3 3 tuning wof this study is novel in that it proposes a method to determine the grouping mechanism including the grouping strategy and grouping number and a constraint handing method to repair constraints in reservoir operation in zille et al 2018 research three group strategies were proposed linear grouping order grouping and random grouping and it was recommended that the grouping mechanism had a direct influence on the solution set however an appropriate method for a specific problem was not suggested hence we tune the adaptability of the grouping mechanism in the field of water resources in the following manner according to the coding model all decision variables water release are in chronological order with the upper reservoir at the beginning of the queue the chronological order corresponds to linear grouping which preserves the input features input the inflow of reservoir operation as for the number of groups inspired by sequential clustering dong et al 2014 sundaray et al 2011 we intend to decrease increase the intra group variance inter group variance since discharges in the same group share the same weight however the decision variables are not constant and it is not possible to group them directly based on variance previous research de la cruz courtois et al 2021 yang et al 2020 has shown that water release is closely related to the inflow of lead reservoir indicating that we can cluster the inflows instead of outflows we can merely cluster the inflows of the first reservoir which is longyangxia in our study owing to hydraulic connections and the total number of groups is given by the cluster number multiplied by reservoir numbers to address complicated constraints dual progressive repair fig 3 was adopted in this study to modify infeasible solutions into feasible ones which is another aspect wherein the study is novel inspired by wang et al 2017 efforts to ensure search solutions in feasible space is a must pre defining feasible search space is not applicable in a cascade system because hydraulic connection makes the feasible bounds tentative as an alternative dual progressive repair method is proposed after every generation of offspring to make all the solutions feasible after crossover and mutation it is very likely that the next generation q i t fails to satisfy the constraints leading to distortion if q i t exceeds the upper bound it is forced to equal the bound if q i t does not reach the lower bound it is forced to equal the bound similarly at the operational level dual implies that repair method works from the upper level reservoir longyangxia to the lower level liujiaxia in each step because an unreasonable q i 1 t might lead to the i th reservoir breaking through constraints irrespective of the value of q i t all the variables are checked in a sequential loop as a result the dual progressive repair method could reduce time complexity from o n2 to o n another advantage is that the sequential order could naturally guarantee the operation schedule constraints that the forebay water level is ascending or descending without tracing back the main steps are summarized as follows a loop j 1 2 t b check whether all the constraints at i th reservoir are within the constraints if not go to c otherwise i i 1 c calibrate variable q i t to bounds according to all the constraints 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of reservoir operation results with the long series historical inflow data as input and different water utilization level as parameters in objectives optimal solutions of reservoirs are obtained using nsgaii and wof nsgaii in five independent runs with default parameters γ 4 linear grouping t 1 1000 t 2 500 q 4 and threshold1 0 5 threshold2 on platemo 2 8 tian et al 2017 the test of benchmark problems he et al 2019 of lsmop is listed in the supplementary materials it s notable that different optimizers are provided in two phases but we do not adopt this strategy for consistency the number of individuals is set at 100 and threshold2 is equal to the total iterations i e 40000 the indicator hypervolume hv jia et al 2020 tian et al 2021 yang et al 2017 is selected to evaluate the convergence and diversity of the algorithm because the true pareto front is unknown in real world problems figs 4 and 5 show the pareto fronts and hv process in three scenarios the results agree well with former research si et al 2019 as there exists prominent tradeoff between hydropower generation and water supply the range of hydropower generation is larger than that recorded in yellow river yearbook from the yellow river institute of hydraulic research owing to optimization based on known reservoir inflow it can be observed that the results of wof nsgaii are better than those of nsgaii because they have lower water deficiency for the same hydropower generation from the average perspective wof nsgaii achieves 19 7 26 6 and 62 2 million more hydropower generation and 11 41 8 721 and 6 736 lower in water deficiency in s1 s2 and s3 respectively in all runs although pfs in fig 5a and c do not show a strictly dominated trend the average results seem to prove that it is probably due to randomness of moeas the mean different between hv lines in terms of the performance of the algorithms reaches from 1 6 to 9 1 in the final iterations the hvs obtained by wof nsgaii are significantly greater than those obtained by nsgaii in s1 and s2 based on rank sum test 4 2 comparison of results between different grouping mechanisms in this section we consider s2 as an example to examine the performances of different grouping mechanisms in section 3 2 we proposed the most suitable grouping number based on minimal intra group variance which is aligned with maximum inter group variance another index named trace within clusters tr is calculated complementarily the higher the tr value the better the grouping fig 6 shows the performance in terms of inter group variance and tr index there are considerable differences between the neighbors at γ 6 in the inter group variance and the elbow point in tr line is achieved at this value l a relatively special point the grouping improves with the increase in the group number predictably but reversely adds difficulty to the divide and conquer intends that s why we use γ 6 as a reasonable grouping number figs 7 and 8 present the results obtained for different grouping numbers and grouping mechanisms the results are consistent with the earlier assumption and analysis the pareto front at γ 6 achieves the best performance whereas the results exacerbate with an increase in the grouping number the main improvement is in the high hydropower generation part with a factor of 0 8 smaller than those of γ 4 8 12 and 24 in terms of water deficiency as the number of groups increases the corresponding weights that need to optimize also increases undoubtedly leading to deteriorating hv values as for grouping mechanisms there is no clear difference among the pareto fronts in the final iteration with order grouping slightly worse than others we believe that the optimization is not sensitive to the order of variables however stakeholders show significantly higher tolerance to less power generation than less water wu et al 2021 indicating that decision makers mainly prefer solutions in the lower left part of pareto fronts hence the pareto front obtained by linear grouping is preferred over others differences in reservoir storage trajectories obtained by topsis dai et al 2010 and realistic operation are presented in fig 9 hydropower generation and water deficiency of the selected solutions from the pareto front with parameters of linear grouping and γ 6 are presented in table 3 the schedules with higher water levels obtained by optimization can significantly increase hydropower generation by 1 04 but decrease water supply shortage by 32 6 the trajectories of water supply and demand at the lanzhou section are presented in fig 10 in generally water deficiency mainly occurs during winter every year the optimized schedule can provide approximately 20 7 more water as it is more reasonable compared to the realistic one the three key improvements of 29 5 25 2 and 68 1 were achieved in 2009 2011 and 2016 respectively 5 conclusions to facilitate long term planning of large reservoir systems with multi year regulation capacity a state of the art large scale multi objective algorithm called wof was introduced in this study the tuning of the wof was proposed to determine the optimal parameters also a new constraints handling method called dual progressive repair was introduce to emulate the reservoir system operation the innovations were examined in the case of reservoirs in the uyrb our first conclusion is that the wof with the optimizer nsgaii outperformed the classic nsgaii because the water supply was lesser for the same hydropower generation validating the necessity and feasibility of wof in water resources management second the tuning of the wof based on the grouping mechanism and repairing infeasible solutions was found to be effective and was verified for practical use for the series from 2005 to 2017 the optimal grouping number was 6 and the grouping strategy was linear grouping although not that sensitive the method of determining grouping mechanisms and repairing infeasible solutions could be extended to other cases third the optimization schedule slightly increased the hydropower generation by 1 04 but significantly decreased water deficiency by 32 6 compared to those of realistic schedules water supply mostly increased in winter which was the most water deficient season however this study has some limitations since the model is applicable to deterministic inflow and water demand situations furthermore stochastic optimization and agent based models could be coupled to simulate inflow with uncertainty and human reaction to water shortage additionally parallelism can be further coupled in the algorithm to reduce runtime ethical

8011,study region sydney basin new south wales australia study focus some of temperate highland peat swamps on sandstone of sydney basin overlie existing underground mining areas which may impact the hydrological fluxes into and out of the swamps understanding and predicting these potential impacts and their consequences for swamps vegetation requires knowledge of the relevant physical properties of the soil however such knowledge is almost completely absent from the literature this study addresses this gap and provides new insight into the degree and nature of variability between swamp sites and between groups of swamps the soil properties controlling these variabilities and the classification of these swamps in the context of peatland soil samples were collected up to a depth of 750 mm from ten sites in upper nepean and newnes plateau swamps samples were analysed for organic matter bulk density texture saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristics new hydrological insights not only the organic matter but also bulk density and sand content control soil physical properties of the swamps soil properties vary between swamps however the variabilities were not large relative to those found in peatlands globally these thpss of the sydney basin cannot be classified as peatland and so their soil parameters cannot be estimated through the generalisation of peatland soil physical properties it is concluded that the insights into soil properties provide new scope for developing hydrological models to assist in hydrological and ecological impacts analysis of the swamps keywords organic matter content soil hydraulic parameters upland swamps van genuchten parameters wetlands 1 introduction temperate highland peat swamps on sandstone thpss are ecological communities that consist of either ephemeral or permanent swamps developed in peat overlying triassic sandstone formations fryirs et al 2014b these swamps are a unique feature of highlands in the sydney basin bioregion of eastern australia that expand into the geological regions of blue mountains 1585 swamps newnes plateau 274 swamps budderoo 173 swamps and upper nepean and woronora plateau 1084 swamps cowley et al 2019 fryirs et al 2014a 2019 young 2017 thpss support distinctive vegetation which is dependent on soil water availability and organic rich soil and can assist with carbon capture and storage and enhancing biodiversity keith et al 2014 young 2017 the swamps can accumulate and sort sands and finer material as well as organic debris washed in from surrounding higher ground fryirs et al 2019 keith et al 2014 young 2017 based on general knowledge of wetland hydrology it may be assumed that the thpss play a significant storage release role in the hydrological cycle and in regulating and purifying drinking water supplies bullock and acreman 2003 cowley et al 2019 during rainfall the groundwater level can rise to near the surface and after rainfall gradually decline due to swamp drainage and evapotranspiration young 2017 however the thpss of sydney basin bioregion are not typical swamps as they are valley infill swamps dominated by sand interspersed with organic matter and their soils drain well where a head gradient exists some thpss of sydney basin overlie underground coal mining areas the mining activities may affect swamps hydrology and thus may change their soil moisture fluctuations altering swamp vegetation and their environmental values biodiversity supplying drinking water etc krogh 2007 mason et al 2021 young 2017 the vegetation cover and environmental values of swamps depend on soil moisture behaviour to the extent that understanding and predicting soil moisture variability is often considered essential for conservation and management aguilera et al 2016 munro 1984 the soil moisture conditions of swamps are typically governed by groundwater levels climatic variability and the soil properties of swamps predominantly soil hydraulic parameters aguilera et al 2016 the lack of knowledge of soil physical characteristics including their heterogeneity can lead to inaccuracies in soil hydrological modelling as well as swamp hydrology modelling and thus influence the suitability of conservation and management practices amezaga and santamaría 2000 kingsford 2000 successful conservation and management of swamps as well as hydrological modelling require the knowledge of swamp functional setting and soil physical properties providing conditions for swamp formation there is a particular lack of knowledge of the soil physical properties of the thpss of sydney basin bioregion affected by mining thpss of sydney basin research has included geomorphology cowley et al 2016 2018 fryirs et al 2014b 2016 hydrology gough 2010 mason et al 2021 and ecology flora and fauna baird 2012 belmer et al 2018 young 2017 however the literature does not provide information on soil characterisation of thpss affected by mining that can be used for soil hydrological modelling to predict soil moisture variability that will assist with understanding the effect of mining on swamp hydrology influencing conservation and management practices a wide range of international studies on swamps peatlands and wetlands aguilera et al 2016 chen et al 2011 hájek et al 2013 hogan 2005 munro 1984 provide general information on the moisture behaviour and physical properties of soils that are high in organic material 50 however the thpss of the sydney basin bioregion are unique in terms of the geological settings that shape soil physical properties as they have soil profiles rather than sediments with layers of organic matter therefore utilising soil physical properties of other peatlands and swamps may not be practical and appropriate for the hydrological modelling of the thpss of sydney basin thpss have high organic matter content with some reports indicating up to 40 organic matter content young 2017 this high organic matter content may strongly influence the soil physical properties such as bulk density dexter 2004 rawls 1983 ruehlmann and körschens 2009 however the organic matter effects on soil hydraulic parameters are not clear dexter et al 2008 particularly for swamp soil furthermore the organic matter accumulation may control thpss physical properties and may lead to strong physical heterogeneity among thpsss and even within each thpss therefore we hypothesised that organic matter can significantly affect soil physical properties and heterogeneity among thpsss within each thpss and even over depth understanding this heterogeneity between thpss groups of thpss and over depth is critical for understanding observed variabilities in soil moisture and assist with soil hydrological modelling and the prediction of changes in the hydrology of swamps affected by mining a second area of interest is how the thpss should be classified within swamp classification systems soil properties of swamps particularly organic matter content bulk density and water holding capacity are key factors in classifications cowley et al 2016 the comparison of soil physical properties of thpss affected by mining with other global swamps can help classify these thpss and support their recognition as unique hydrological and ecological systems this assists with understanding whether thpss of sydney basin affected by mining can be considered as peatland and to what degree the thpss soil physical parameters required for modelling can be estimated using the generalisation of peatlands soil physical properties we hypothesised that these thpss of sydney basin cannot be classified as peatland and so their parameters cannot be estimated using the generalisation of peatlands parameters this study addresses the above research hypotheses and gaps by investigating the soil physical properties and associated hydrological functions of a sample of thpss in the sydney basin bioregion affected by mining the paper aims to 1 evaluate the degree of similarity heterogeneity between thpsss within thpss and over depth 2 determine the soil property which controls the soil hydraulic parameters of thpss 3 investigate whether thpss can be considered as peatland and to what degree peatland parameters can be generalised for the estimation of thpss soil properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of swamps and soil sampling thpss are divided in to three types headwater swamps valley infill swamps and hanging swamps young 2017 the study thpss are valley infill swamps that overlie underground coal mining areas of sydney basin bioregion the study sites are situated within newnes plateau four sites and upper nepean six sites in the western and southern sydney basin bioregion fig 1 the sites were selected based on their accessibility underground mining history and historical groundwater level fluctuations the selected sites were undermined and their groundwater levels have dropped the selected sites also covered as far as practicable intra swamp and inter swamp spatial variability the study swamps are situated in the temperate climate zone and have a warm summer and a cool winter the long term annual average precipitation is 1092 mm 61 years and 801 mm 40 years for newnes plateau and upper nepean areas respectively bureau of meteorology 2020 the average annual maximum and minimum temperatures at newnes plateau and upper nepean are 23 5 c and 1 1 c and 29 3 c and 1 7 c bureau of meteorology 2020 the studied swamps overlie triassic sandstone and their typical plant species include carex spp lepidosperma limicolum dichelachne inaequalis poa labillardieri var labillardieri epacris microphylla epacris paludosa and shrubs xyris spp grevillea acanthifolia hakea spp banksia spp leptospermum spp and gleichenia dicarpa fryirs et al 2019 keith and myerscough 1993 young 2017 the average depth of soil in the study swamps is approximately 2000 mm disturbed soil samples 200 cm3 and undisturbed soil cores 40 mm height and 56 mm diameter were collected from four different depths 50 100 200 250 450 500 and 700 750 mm of soil profile the depth of soil sampling was defined based on the observed average depth of plants roots in the study areas sampling procedure and statistical design are site i e study specific depending on the heterogeneity of each site i e land in this study soil sample replicates at each site were not collected as the soil profiles across each site were found to be similar other published studies bogacz 2000 faul et al 2016 kechavarzi et al 2010 on swamps and peatlands also followed the same procedure and did not collect replicates replications were also restricted by government regulatory requirements for sampling in this nature protected environment no rain was recorded during sampling it should be noted that all studied soil physical characteristics are rain independent 2 2 measurement of soil physical properties the disturbed soil samples were dried at 40 c in a dehydrating oven and were then sieved to 2 mm subsequently the soil organic matter content of each sample was measured using loss on ignition method as described in waksman and stevens 1930 the particle size distribution of each sample was measured using the hydrometer method as mentioned in sheldrick and wang 1993 the soil samples were pre treated with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to remove organic matter sheldrick and wang 1993 then a 10 ml sodium hexametaphosphate napo3 6 solution 10 was mixed with 25 g soil and 125 ml di water deionised water subsequently a sonifier branson model 450 was used for 10 min to break aggregated particles sheldrick and wang 1993 the particle density values of samples were measured using a gas pycnometer hillel 1982 the saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristic curves were measured using the field sampled cores which were saturated for 48 hrs using di water from the base of the cores soil water repellency was not observed in this study subsequently the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using a constant head permeability test klute and dirksen 1982 in this test the volume of water upflowing through the soil cores was determined to calculate the flow rate and hence the hydraulic conductivity based on darcy s law marshall et al 1996 the water retention curve of each soil core was determined as described in shaygan et al 2017 each water saturated core was desiccated to 1 2 and 3 kpa for 24 hrs each using a sand based tension table vacuum controlled pressure was used to achieve lower water potential in which the soil cores were placed on a porous plate for 4 days 6 days and 5 days sequentially to obtain water content in equilibrium with the water potential at 10 30 and 50 kpa desiccation equivalent to 500 kpa was applied to the soil cores using a pressure plate extractor 1500f1 soil moisture santa barbara usa for 3 weeks following the last desiccation step soil cores were dried at 105 c in the drying oven for 24 hrs to determine the bulk density the soil samples were weighed to determine the gravimetric water content for each desiccation step the volumetric water content of each sample was calculated after measuring the gravimetric water content and multiplying that by the bulk density of the sample the van genuchten parameters α and n of the water retention curve for each soil sample were determined based on the measured data and using retc software van genuchten et al 1991 for the soil water retention curve fitting the residual water content θ r was set to zero based on the soils texture and after comparison to water retention curves considering non zero residual water content the saturated water content θ s was fixed and its suitability was checked by the calculated total porosity which derived from measured bulk density and particle density different values including 10 kpa kay 1990 5 kpa white 2006 33 kpa lyon and buckman 1943 and 50 kpa colman 1947 have been suggested as defining water potential at field capacity instead of arbitrarily selecting one of these definitions the water potential at field capacity was determined based on the following equation mentioned in assouline and or 2014 using the parametric model of van genuchten 1980 1 ψ fc 1 α n 1 n 1 2 n n water content at 1500 kpa permanent wilting point and field capacity was then calculated using the following van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 and the previously determined van genuchten parameters θ s θ r α and n 2 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 1 n where θ ψ is the water content cm3 cm 3 ψ is the water potential cm water head θ s is the saturated water content cm3 cm 3 θ r is the residual water content cm3 cm 3 α is the inverse of the air entry suction cm 1 and n is the gradient of the water retention curve and reflects the pore size distribution the difference of water content between field capacity and permanent wilting point is considered to be plant available water marshall et al 1996 the difference of saturated water content and water content at field capacity reflects the macro pore volume of each substrate marshall et al 1996 2 3 data analysis the data analysis aims to support understanding of the similarities and contrasts between the studied thpss in terms of soil physical characteristics the data analysis is also a preliminary exploration of whether there are patterns in the data that may guide the estimation of soil properties for un sampled valley infill thpss locations the data analysis principally relied on plotting of data and visual assessment of trends and differences supplemented by selected statistical tests a two way analysis of variance anova was employed to test the hypothesis that the soil property values are not the same across the six upper nepean sites and not the same over the four sampled depths this test was repeated for the four newnes plateau sites welch s t tests were conducted to test the hypothesis that the mean value of each soil property over the upper nepean sites is different from the mean value over newnes plateau sites welch s t test was used here rather than anova because only two sets of samples are being compared and it is considered a more powerful test because it does not assume equal variance between the compared samples to explore the depth dependencies of soil properties their values were plotted against depth and correlation coefficients were calculated correlation analysis was also used to explore the effect of organic matter content controls on soil properties finally the measured soil properties were compared against those found in the literature for a range of global peatlands 3 results 3 1 soil physical properties the observed soil textures in study sites were clay loam loam sandy clay loam sandy loam loamy sand and sand fig 2 and table 1 the textures were highly variable between upper nepean sites while a more uniform and sandy soil texture was observed within each soil profile in newnes plateau particularly for sites b2 b3 and b4 fig 2 and table 1 the soil organic matter content ranged between 4 7 and 34 4 for the newnes plateau sites and between 2 7 and 34 9 for the upper nepean sites table 1 fig 3 and appendix a the soil bulk density fluctuated between 0 25 and 1 63 g cm 3 for the upper nepean sites and between 0 45 and 0 84 g cm 3 for the newnes plateau sites table 1 fig 3 and appendix a the saturated hydraulic conductivity of surface soil 50 100 mm ranged from 0 0001 to 0 047 mm s 1 and varied between 0 0004 and 0 028 mm s 1 for the upper nepean and newnes plateau sites respectively table 1 fig 3 and appendix a the van genuchten mualem model single porosity fitted the measured water retention data well r2 0 89 appendix b f the saturated water content values within the soil profiles ranged between 0 40 and 0 73 cm3 cm 3 and most saturated water content values were distributed between 0 45 and 0 70 cm3 cm 3 table 1 and fig 4 the α values were between 0 08 and 1 00 cm 1 for 65 of sites and n value was between 1 10 and 1 25 for 75 of the sites table 1 and fig 4 reflecting the similarity of many of the water retention curves appendix b f most of the macro pore volume values varied between 0 15 and 0 22 cm3 cm 3 table 1 and fig 4 with the highest value of 0 30 cm3 cm 3 near the soil surface 50 100 mm at site a1 table 1 the maximum water holding capacity θfc fluctuated from 0 22 to 0 54 cm3 cm 3 and from 0 32 to 0 50 cm3 cm 3 for the upper nepean and newnes plateau sites respectively table 1 the soil water content at permanent wilting point ranged from 0 04 to 0 32 cm3 cm 3 at the upper nepean sites and from 0 10 to 0 39 cm3 cm 3 for the newnes plateau sites table 1 sixty eight percent 68 of plant available water values were between 0 17 and 0 22 cm3 cm 3 table 1 and fig 4 3 2 significance of differences in soil properties between sites differences in soil properties between individual sites can generally be considered significant table 1 using the two way anova test differences were identified with high confidence p1 0 1 for 10 of the 14 tested soil properties at the upper nepean sites and seven out of 14 at the newnes plateau sites table 1 using the welch s t test differences between mean values at the upper nepean sites and those at the newnes plateau sites were significant with a high degree of confidence p3 0 1 for 12 of the 14 tested properties with only saturated hydraulic conductivities and saturated water content not considered different at that confidence level table 1 3 3 significance and nature of differences in soil properties over depth differences in soil properties between depths can be considered significant at the upper nepean sites but much less so at the newnes plateau sites table 1 using the two way anova test differences were identified with high confidence p1 0 1 for seven organic matter content bulk density saturated water content n macro pore volume water content at field capacity and water content at permanent wilting point of the 14 soil properties at the upper nepean sites but at none of the newnes plateau sites table 1 table 2 and fig 3 provide further insight into the degree and nature of the depth variations organic matter content was found to be reduced markedly with depth fig 3 and appendix a this is reflected in strong negative correlations between organic matter content and depth table 2 with the exception of site b1 due to an outlier at 750 mm depth fig 3 and appendix a saturated hydraulic conductivity was found to usually reduce with depth table 1 fig 3 and appendix a although in some sites b2 and b3 the correlation is weak and at others a3 and b1 the opposite effect is observed table 2 at the upper nepean sites bulk density has the most consistently strong positive correlation with depth table 2 fig 3 and appendix a however this consistency was not observed at the newnes plateau sites where negative correlations between bulk density and depth existed at three sites table 2 fig 3 and appendix a the correlation of other properties with depth was generally weaker and less consistent over sites although all tested properties were significantly correlated p statistic 0 1 with depth when considering data from all ten sites both upper nepean and newnes plateau table 2 using qualitative assessment the soil textures were highly variable over depths with no apparent trends except at site a3 where the amount of coarse sand increased with depth fig 2 and table 1 3 4 the effect of organic matter on soil hydraulic properties the saturated hydraulic conductivities and organic matter contents were positively correlated at nine of the ten sites strongly so at six sites and also when grouping data from all upper nepean sites and all newnes plateau sites table 2 strong correlation existed between organic matter content and bulk density at all six upper nepean sites with increasing organic matter leading to less dense soil however at the newnes plateau sites the opposite dependency was found at three sites table 2 a significant positive correlation was found between organic matter content and saturated water content at both sets of sites but this was quite variable across the ten sites with four correlations being negative and six positive table 2 the correlation between organic matter and plant available water were significantly positive only for three sites in upper nepean and two sites in newnes plateau table 2 4 discussion this study is the first to focus on characterising soil physical properties in the thpss swamps of the sydney basin bioregion which have been undermined and it adds considerably to the existing knowledge of the variability of soil hydraulic properties α n θs and ksat within the region and possible reasons understanding the variability assists with accurate swamp hydrology modelling understanding swamp hydrology affected by mining as well as finding suitable management practices for these thpsss we firstly discuss the role of organic matter on changes to the soil physical properties and evaluating the variability of soil physical properties among the study thpsss and over depth these address the first hypothesis mentioned in the introduction then we discuss the classification of study swamps in the context of peatland and to what degree the soil hydraulic properties of these thpss can be estimated by the generalisation of peatland soil physical characteristics this addresses the second hypothesis noted in the introduction we also discuss the contribution of this study to regional and global knowledge of swamp soil hydraulic parameters applicability of the new knowledge and limitations of the study 4 1 organic matter as a control on soil physical properties the addition of organic matter can affect soil properties of agricultural land loveland and webb 2003 in the context of thpss swamps trap organic matter washed from higher ground surrounding areas young 2017 organic matter is also produced by in situ decomposition of dead plant materials such as leaves and roots young 2017 for the above reasons high amounts of organic matter content up to 35 average of 15 8 were found at the studied sites table 1 fig 3 and appendix a although high these values are lower than those found average of 31 7 in some other thpss swamps in the sydney basin bioregion fryirs et al 2014a the swamps vegetation communities are soil moisture dependent young 2017 generally there is a positive correlation between organic matter content and soil gravimetric water content marshall et al 1996 the lack of strong positive correlations between organic matter content and plant available water as well as saturated water content for five of the 10 swamps table 2 was likely related to the variability in the type of organic matter soil organic matter can be divided in to three major types 1 plant residues and living microbial biomass 2 active soil organic matter known as detritus and 3 stable soil organic matter known as humus blume et al 2014 in this study loose mass of plant residues provided high total porosity saturated water content due to a reduction in bulk density the example of which can be found for the surface soil table 1 this high total porosity as a result of low bulk density likely could not lead to high water holding capacity due to the presence of a high volume of macro pores and connectivity among pores and so this resulted in low plant available water in contrast the total porosity saturated water content of soils with decomposed organic matter humus was lower than the soil containing plant residue table 1 this conducted a lower macro pore volume leading to an increase in plant available water a loose mass of dead plant debris with some fine clays and silts could likely allow water to drain quickly a higher hydraulic conductivity as per site a3 appendix a and g and fig 3 in contrast the highly organic and fine grained organic materials which were denser likely retarded water movement a lower hydraulic conductivity an example of which can be found in site b2 appendix a and h and fig 3 thus the general decrease of organic matter and saturated hydraulic conductivity with increasing depth fig 3 table 1 and appendix a is thought to be due to the more decomposed organic matter and more compacted soil higher bulk density at greater depths 4 2 variability of soil physical properties in the sydney basin bioregion thpss understanding hydrology of swamps affected by mining precise hydrological modelling and finding the appropriate management practices depend on understanding the variability of soil physical characteristics among thpsss within each thpss and over depth this can be achieved through soil characterisation there is only one previous published study cowley et al 2016 that included some geomorphic characterisation of the sydney basin bioregion thpss cowley et al 2016 compared the sedimentology of intact and channelised thpss swamps in the blue mountain area by examining indicators of sediment structure sediment unit thickness and bulk density carbon storage function organic matter and c n ratio and water holding capacity gravimetric water content in that study intact swamps were described by the absence of a channel and associated geomorphic units presence of preferential discontinuous drainage lines and presence of waterlogged highly organic sediment fryirs et al 2016 and channelised swamps were characterised by a well defined channel with associated geomorphic units in this context cowley et al 2016 reported no significant differences in bulk density or organic matter content between the intact and channelised thpss swamps in both cases there were 12 sediment cores consisting of two cores per swamp the lack of significant difference may be explained by the scale of sampling and high variance within each swamp e g the estimated mean and standard deviation of organic matter content were 12 1 12 4 and 9 66 7 11 for intact and channelised swamps respectively in our study significant differences p statistic 0 1 were found for twelve soil properties organic matter content bulk density plant available water macro pore volume n α volumetric water content at field capacity permanent wilting point and amount of coarse sand fine sand silt and clay between the southern upper nepean and western newnes plateau thpss table 1 study sites within newnes plateau were significantly different p statistic 0 1 in terms of saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density n volumetric water content at permanent wilting point coarse sand fine sand and clay while upper nepean sites differ significantly p statistic 0 1 for organic matter content bulk density saturated water content macro pore volume volumetric water content at field capacity plant available water coarse sand fine sand silt and clay interestingly bulk density sand and clay content were the only soil characteristic found to have a significant difference p statistic 0 1 between sites at both newnes plateau and upper nepean and between the two sets of sites table 1 organic matter closely follows in terms of consistently significant differences table 1 in this study the soil texture particularly sand content and organic matter affected the bulk density tables 1 2 this influenced soil characteristics and in particular created variability in soil hydraulic properties such as water retention characteristics and hydraulic conductivity table 1 a reduction in soil bulk density as a result of the existence of plant residues and high sand content possibly increased the total porosity and macro porosity therefore it affected soil hydraulic conductivity in which a higher hydraulic conductivity was observed at the surface soils of some sites such as most sites of upper nepean fig 3 and appendix a the decomposed organic matter and sand content possibly improved porosity and the connectivity of pores and so affected hydraulic conductivity the examples of which were observed for some sites over depth particularly site a3 fig 3 and tables 1 2 for all above reasons this study suggests bulk density sand content as well as organic matter content and type as discussed previously strongly characterise the variability of upper nepean and newnes plateau swamps this conclusion is in agreement with marshall et al 1996 stated that for agricultural soil bulk density and organic matter are the two basic soil characteristics that typically affect other soil physical properties it should be noted that there are consistent in cases strong correlations between property parameters and with depth within each profile e g table 2 which become weaker when generalising across sampling sites 4 3 classification of thpss of sydney basin bioregion in context of peatlands to explore whether the soil hydraulic properties of thpsss affected by mining can be estimated by generalisation of peatland soil physical characteristics understanding the thpss classification in the context of peatlands is required this is critical for hydrological modelling and understanding swamp hydrology changes as knowledge and information related to peatlands are typically used for decision making purposes on the thpss of sydney basin a comparison between the soil physical properties of thpss and peatlands are required to investigate whether these thpss can be considered as peatland and to understand whether the soil physical properties of the thpss can be estimated using generalisation of peatland soil characterisations in this context table 3 summarises the review of soil organic matter content and most studied physical properties in peatlands globally the maximum saturated hydraulic conductivities measured in the study swamps were low compared to the maximum saturated hydraulic conductivity values measured in peatlands globally table 3 the minimum saturated hydraulic conductivity values were also relatively low although much lower values exist in some wet highly organic peatlands table 3 the bulk density values of peatland soils globally were lower than those found at our study sites table 3 the soil organic matter contents and saturated water contents of other peatland were generally higher than those found in this study table 3 the generally low saturated hydraulic conductivities compared to those of peatlands table 3 is likely due to higher bulk densities and relatively lower organic matter contents at the study swamps than those of peatlands globally however the very low saturated hydraulic conductivities observed in consolidated peats that are high in decomposed organic matter bogacz 2000 rycroft et al 1975 are not seen in the thpss compared to the study sites that had average bulk density values of 0 80 g cm 3 for the upper soil horizon 0 500 mm and 1 14 g cm 3 for depths over 500 mm gough 2010 noted a bulk density of 0 15 g cm 3 for the fibric organic fines of the upper soil horizon 0 500 mm of swamps in budderoo plateau australia which increased to 0 37 g cm 3 for the more decomposed organic matters in a deeper horizon 500 mm the soil organic matter content of the study sites was not only lower than other sydney basin bio region thpss as discussed previously but also of peatlands globally table 3 according to bradley 1996 in order to be considered as peatland the swamps should have more than 50 organic content and the total porosity saturated water content of their soil should be between 88 and 92 on that basis the studied swamps are not classified as peatland therefore the soil hydraulic properties of peatlands cannot be used for the estimation of soil hydraulic functions of thpss of sydney basin and thus they cannot be applied for hydrological modelling of these thpss 4 4 contribution to guidance on soil hydraulic parameter values for hydrological modelling physically based soil hydrology models are commonly used to support land management aguilera et al 2016 ballard et al 2012 shaygan and baumgartl 2020 shaygan et al 2018a 2018b šimůnek et al 2013 soil hydraulic parameters α n θs θr and ksat are essential inputs to these models as these parameters are affected by soil texture organic matter and bulk density each soil is expected to have a unique set of parameters for the studied swamps this is illustrated by the results in table 1 however the results allow tentative generalisations about some parameters of water retention curve particularly α n and θr θr 0 fig 4 and table 1 and about decreases in saturated hydraulic conductivity with increasing depth fig 3 and appendix a also the insignificant differences between the saturated hydraulic conductivity values within the upper nepean swamps table 1 and minor differences among the newnes plateau sites invites some tentative generalisations for saturated hydraulic conductivity as well while tentative generalisations about parameter values can be made for the purpose of developing a numerical model of a typical swamp wherever possible site specific measurements should be obtained and statistical analysis focus on sites this study established soil water retention characteristics θs θr α n field capacity plant available water and macro pore volume and hydraulic conductivity table 1 as a function of textural class with specific organic matter content and bulk density the presented pedotransfer functions van genuchten parameters table 1 extend the van genuchten guideline values described in carsel and parrish 1988 appendix i and hydrus model for the soil textures clay loam loam sandy clay loam sandy loam loamy sand and sand found in the swamps for instance the saturated water content for the studied thpss sandy soil ranged between 0 67 and 0 56 cm3 cm 3 compared to 0 43 cm3 cm 3 in the guideline table 1 and appendix i this difference is probably because the guideline values described in carsel and parrish 1988 were based on soils with a lower amount of organic matter and higher bulk density than those observed in the studied swamps the presented soil hydraulic parameters can be used for the projection of the likelihood of alteration in swamp vegetation which can be induced by climate variability and or climate change and in many thpss also by mining soil moisture dynamics regulated by soil physical characteristics particularly water retention curves hillel 1982 marshall et al 1996 influence plant growth and health rendig and taylor 1989 as well as the ecological succession of landscapes gairola and soni 2010 estimation of the soil moisture fluctuations using scenario modelling through soil hydrological models e g hydrus can assist with understanding and forecasting the alteration and ecological succession of swamps vegetation for instance a soil hydrological model can predict swamp soil moisture regimes and thus assist with identifying whether or not swamps vegetation changes from the plants adopted to waterlogged conditions to water stress tolerant plant species this can also help the prediction of plant diversity reduction and a movement towards a uniform plant composition 4 5 limitations of the study one of the main characteristics of thpss swamps is dense vegetation cover young 2017 that can result in the occurrence of preferential flow within the near surface soil jarvis et al 2016 plant roots and macro fauna as well as cracks are able to create connected macro pores or channels that can contribute to preferential flow gerke 2006 jarvis et al 2016 2012 in this study although signals of dual porosity were not detected in the water retention curves for any of the studied soil layers the calculated high values for macro pore volumes table 3 suggests the potential for preferential flow pathways particularly under high rainfall events there are different methods to identify dual porosity signals over a range of spatial scales including non newtonian fluids atallah and abou najm 2018 ground penetrating radar fluorescent dye ghodrati and jury 1990 magnetic resonance imaging posadas et al 1996 and continuous time soil moisture measurements down the soil profile arnold et al 2020 hence the employed laboratory analyses would benefit from complementary in situ monitoring techniques taking samples from more sites and at deeper depths would also help characterise soil heterogeneity within swamps 5 conclusions soil characterisation of the thpss of the sydney basin bioregion is necessary for their conservation and rehabilitation particularly when a soil hydrological model is used as a decision making tool or when monitoring potential changes in plant available water and other key soil properties new insights from this research included the quantification of key soil physical properties of swamps affected by mining evaluating their variability between sites and down the soil profile determining how specific soil properties affect other soil physical characteristics and classification of the swamps in the context of peatlands the research suggests bulk density and sand content as well as organic matter control soil physical properties of swamps and their variabilities soil physical variabilities among swamps are considerable yet lower than those found in peatlands globally this research suggests water retention curve parameters can be generalised for modelling purposes although wherever possible site specific parameters should be used the study swamps cannot be classified as peatlands due to a lower organic matter content and a higher bulk density compared with peatlands and so the soil physical properties of peatlands cannot be used for the thpss swamps modelling this study also extended guidelines for van genuchten parameters water retention characteristics and hydraulic conductivity as a function of textural class with specific organic matter content and bulk density that supports soil hydrology modelling funding this research was funded by australian coal

8011,study region sydney basin new south wales australia study focus some of temperate highland peat swamps on sandstone of sydney basin overlie existing underground mining areas which may impact the hydrological fluxes into and out of the swamps understanding and predicting these potential impacts and their consequences for swamps vegetation requires knowledge of the relevant physical properties of the soil however such knowledge is almost completely absent from the literature this study addresses this gap and provides new insight into the degree and nature of variability between swamp sites and between groups of swamps the soil properties controlling these variabilities and the classification of these swamps in the context of peatland soil samples were collected up to a depth of 750 mm from ten sites in upper nepean and newnes plateau swamps samples were analysed for organic matter bulk density texture saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristics new hydrological insights not only the organic matter but also bulk density and sand content control soil physical properties of the swamps soil properties vary between swamps however the variabilities were not large relative to those found in peatlands globally these thpss of the sydney basin cannot be classified as peatland and so their soil parameters cannot be estimated through the generalisation of peatland soil physical properties it is concluded that the insights into soil properties provide new scope for developing hydrological models to assist in hydrological and ecological impacts analysis of the swamps keywords organic matter content soil hydraulic parameters upland swamps van genuchten parameters wetlands 1 introduction temperate highland peat swamps on sandstone thpss are ecological communities that consist of either ephemeral or permanent swamps developed in peat overlying triassic sandstone formations fryirs et al 2014b these swamps are a unique feature of highlands in the sydney basin bioregion of eastern australia that expand into the geological regions of blue mountains 1585 swamps newnes plateau 274 swamps budderoo 173 swamps and upper nepean and woronora plateau 1084 swamps cowley et al 2019 fryirs et al 2014a 2019 young 2017 thpss support distinctive vegetation which is dependent on soil water availability and organic rich soil and can assist with carbon capture and storage and enhancing biodiversity keith et al 2014 young 2017 the swamps can accumulate and sort sands and finer material as well as organic debris washed in from surrounding higher ground fryirs et al 2019 keith et al 2014 young 2017 based on general knowledge of wetland hydrology it may be assumed that the thpss play a significant storage release role in the hydrological cycle and in regulating and purifying drinking water supplies bullock and acreman 2003 cowley et al 2019 during rainfall the groundwater level can rise to near the surface and after rainfall gradually decline due to swamp drainage and evapotranspiration young 2017 however the thpss of sydney basin bioregion are not typical swamps as they are valley infill swamps dominated by sand interspersed with organic matter and their soils drain well where a head gradient exists some thpss of sydney basin overlie underground coal mining areas the mining activities may affect swamps hydrology and thus may change their soil moisture fluctuations altering swamp vegetation and their environmental values biodiversity supplying drinking water etc krogh 2007 mason et al 2021 young 2017 the vegetation cover and environmental values of swamps depend on soil moisture behaviour to the extent that understanding and predicting soil moisture variability is often considered essential for conservation and management aguilera et al 2016 munro 1984 the soil moisture conditions of swamps are typically governed by groundwater levels climatic variability and the soil properties of swamps predominantly soil hydraulic parameters aguilera et al 2016 the lack of knowledge of soil physical characteristics including their heterogeneity can lead to inaccuracies in soil hydrological modelling as well as swamp hydrology modelling and thus influence the suitability of conservation and management practices amezaga and santamaría 2000 kingsford 2000 successful conservation and management of swamps as well as hydrological modelling require the knowledge of swamp functional setting and soil physical properties providing conditions for swamp formation there is a particular lack of knowledge of the soil physical properties of the thpss of sydney basin bioregion affected by mining thpss of sydney basin research has included geomorphology cowley et al 2016 2018 fryirs et al 2014b 2016 hydrology gough 2010 mason et al 2021 and ecology flora and fauna baird 2012 belmer et al 2018 young 2017 however the literature does not provide information on soil characterisation of thpss affected by mining that can be used for soil hydrological modelling to predict soil moisture variability that will assist with understanding the effect of mining on swamp hydrology influencing conservation and management practices a wide range of international studies on swamps peatlands and wetlands aguilera et al 2016 chen et al 2011 hájek et al 2013 hogan 2005 munro 1984 provide general information on the moisture behaviour and physical properties of soils that are high in organic material 50 however the thpss of the sydney basin bioregion are unique in terms of the geological settings that shape soil physical properties as they have soil profiles rather than sediments with layers of organic matter therefore utilising soil physical properties of other peatlands and swamps may not be practical and appropriate for the hydrological modelling of the thpss of sydney basin thpss have high organic matter content with some reports indicating up to 40 organic matter content young 2017 this high organic matter content may strongly influence the soil physical properties such as bulk density dexter 2004 rawls 1983 ruehlmann and körschens 2009 however the organic matter effects on soil hydraulic parameters are not clear dexter et al 2008 particularly for swamp soil furthermore the organic matter accumulation may control thpss physical properties and may lead to strong physical heterogeneity among thpsss and even within each thpss therefore we hypothesised that organic matter can significantly affect soil physical properties and heterogeneity among thpsss within each thpss and even over depth understanding this heterogeneity between thpss groups of thpss and over depth is critical for understanding observed variabilities in soil moisture and assist with soil hydrological modelling and the prediction of changes in the hydrology of swamps affected by mining a second area of interest is how the thpss should be classified within swamp classification systems soil properties of swamps particularly organic matter content bulk density and water holding capacity are key factors in classifications cowley et al 2016 the comparison of soil physical properties of thpss affected by mining with other global swamps can help classify these thpss and support their recognition as unique hydrological and ecological systems this assists with understanding whether thpss of sydney basin affected by mining can be considered as peatland and to what degree the thpss soil physical parameters required for modelling can be estimated using the generalisation of peatlands soil physical properties we hypothesised that these thpss of sydney basin cannot be classified as peatland and so their parameters cannot be estimated using the generalisation of peatlands parameters this study addresses the above research hypotheses and gaps by investigating the soil physical properties and associated hydrological functions of a sample of thpss in the sydney basin bioregion affected by mining the paper aims to 1 evaluate the degree of similarity heterogeneity between thpsss within thpss and over depth 2 determine the soil property which controls the soil hydraulic parameters of thpss 3 investigate whether thpss can be considered as peatland and to what degree peatland parameters can be generalised for the estimation of thpss soil properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of swamps and soil sampling thpss are divided in to three types headwater swamps valley infill swamps and hanging swamps young 2017 the study thpss are valley infill swamps that overlie underground coal mining areas of sydney basin bioregion the study sites are situated within newnes plateau four sites and upper nepean six sites in the western and southern sydney basin bioregion fig 1 the sites were selected based on their accessibility underground mining history and historical groundwater level fluctuations the selected sites were undermined and their groundwater levels have dropped the selected sites also covered as far as practicable intra swamp and inter swamp spatial variability the study swamps are situated in the temperate climate zone and have a warm summer and a cool winter the long term annual average precipitation is 1092 mm 61 years and 801 mm 40 years for newnes plateau and upper nepean areas respectively bureau of meteorology 2020 the average annual maximum and minimum temperatures at newnes plateau and upper nepean are 23 5 c and 1 1 c and 29 3 c and 1 7 c bureau of meteorology 2020 the studied swamps overlie triassic sandstone and their typical plant species include carex spp lepidosperma limicolum dichelachne inaequalis poa labillardieri var labillardieri epacris microphylla epacris paludosa and shrubs xyris spp grevillea acanthifolia hakea spp banksia spp leptospermum spp and gleichenia dicarpa fryirs et al 2019 keith and myerscough 1993 young 2017 the average depth of soil in the study swamps is approximately 2000 mm disturbed soil samples 200 cm3 and undisturbed soil cores 40 mm height and 56 mm diameter were collected from four different depths 50 100 200 250 450 500 and 700 750 mm of soil profile the depth of soil sampling was defined based on the observed average depth of plants roots in the study areas sampling procedure and statistical design are site i e study specific depending on the heterogeneity of each site i e land in this study soil sample replicates at each site were not collected as the soil profiles across each site were found to be similar other published studies bogacz 2000 faul et al 2016 kechavarzi et al 2010 on swamps and peatlands also followed the same procedure and did not collect replicates replications were also restricted by government regulatory requirements for sampling in this nature protected environment no rain was recorded during sampling it should be noted that all studied soil physical characteristics are rain independent 2 2 measurement of soil physical properties the disturbed soil samples were dried at 40 c in a dehydrating oven and were then sieved to 2 mm subsequently the soil organic matter content of each sample was measured using loss on ignition method as described in waksman and stevens 1930 the particle size distribution of each sample was measured using the hydrometer method as mentioned in sheldrick and wang 1993 the soil samples were pre treated with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to remove organic matter sheldrick and wang 1993 then a 10 ml sodium hexametaphosphate napo3 6 solution 10 was mixed with 25 g soil and 125 ml di water deionised water subsequently a sonifier branson model 450 was used for 10 min to break aggregated particles sheldrick and wang 1993 the particle density values of samples were measured using a gas pycnometer hillel 1982 the saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristic curves were measured using the field sampled cores which were saturated for 48 hrs using di water from the base of the cores soil water repellency was not observed in this study subsequently the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using a constant head permeability test klute and dirksen 1982 in this test the volume of water upflowing through the soil cores was determined to calculate the flow rate and hence the hydraulic conductivity based on darcy s law marshall et al 1996 the water retention curve of each soil core was determined as described in shaygan et al 2017 each water saturated core was desiccated to 1 2 and 3 kpa for 24 hrs each using a sand based tension table vacuum controlled pressure was used to achieve lower water potential in which the soil cores were placed on a porous plate for 4 days 6 days and 5 days sequentially to obtain water content in equilibrium with the water potential at 10 30 and 50 kpa desiccation equivalent to 500 kpa was applied to the soil cores using a pressure plate extractor 1500f1 soil moisture santa barbara usa for 3 weeks following the last desiccation step soil cores were dried at 105 c in the drying oven for 24 hrs to determine the bulk density the soil samples were weighed to determine the gravimetric water content for each desiccation step the volumetric water content of each sample was calculated after measuring the gravimetric water content and multiplying that by the bulk density of the sample the van genuchten parameters α and n of the water retention curve for each soil sample were determined based on the measured data and using retc software van genuchten et al 1991 for the soil water retention curve fitting the residual water content θ r was set to zero based on the soils texture and after comparison to water retention curves considering non zero residual water content the saturated water content θ s was fixed and its suitability was checked by the calculated total porosity which derived from measured bulk density and particle density different values including 10 kpa kay 1990 5 kpa white 2006 33 kpa lyon and buckman 1943 and 50 kpa colman 1947 have been suggested as defining water potential at field capacity instead of arbitrarily selecting one of these definitions the water potential at field capacity was determined based on the following equation mentioned in assouline and or 2014 using the parametric model of van genuchten 1980 1 ψ fc 1 α n 1 n 1 2 n n water content at 1500 kpa permanent wilting point and field capacity was then calculated using the following van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 and the previously determined van genuchten parameters θ s θ r α and n 2 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 1 n where θ ψ is the water content cm3 cm 3 ψ is the water potential cm water head θ s is the saturated water content cm3 cm 3 θ r is the residual water content cm3 cm 3 α is the inverse of the air entry suction cm 1 and n is the gradient of the water retention curve and reflects the pore size distribution the difference of water content between field capacity and permanent wilting point is considered to be plant available water marshall et al 1996 the difference of saturated water content and water content at field capacity reflects the macro pore volume of each substrate marshall et al 1996 2 3 data analysis the data analysis aims to support understanding of the similarities and contrasts between the studied thpss in terms of soil physical characteristics the data analysis is also a preliminary exploration of whether there are patterns in the data that may guide the estimation of soil properties for un sampled valley infill thpss locations the data analysis principally relied on plotting of data and visual assessment of trends and differences supplemented by selected statistical tests a two way analysis of variance anova was employed to test the hypothesis that the soil property values are not the same across the six upper nepean sites and not the same over the four sampled depths this test was repeated for the four newnes plateau sites welch s t tests were conducted to test the hypothesis that the mean value of each soil property over the upper nepean sites is different from the mean value over newnes plateau sites welch s t test was used here rather than anova because only two sets of samples are being compared and it is considered a more powerful test because it does not assume equal variance between the compared samples to explore the depth dependencies of soil properties their values were plotted against depth and correlation coefficients were calculated correlation analysis was also used to explore the effect of organic matter content controls on soil properties finally the measured soil properties were compared against those found in the literature for a range of global peatlands 3 results 3 1 soil physical properties the observed soil textures in study sites were clay loam loam sandy clay loam sandy loam loamy sand and sand fig 2 and table 1 the textures were highly variable between upper nepean sites while a more uniform and sandy soil texture was observed within each soil profile in newnes plateau particularly for sites b2 b3 and b4 fig 2 and table 1 the soil organic matter content ranged between 4 7 and 34 4 for the newnes plateau sites and between 2 7 and 34 9 for the upper nepean sites table 1 fig 3 and appendix a the soil bulk density fluctuated between 0 25 and 1 63 g cm 3 for the upper nepean sites and between 0 45 and 0 84 g cm 3 for the newnes plateau sites table 1 fig 3 and appendix a the saturated hydraulic conductivity of surface soil 50 100 mm ranged from 0 0001 to 0 047 mm s

water retention data well r2 0 89 appendix b f the saturated water content values within the soil profiles ranged between 0 40 and 0 73 cm3 cm 3 and most saturated water content values were distributed between 0 45 and 0 70 cm3 cm 3 table 1 and fig 4 the α values were between 0 08 and 1 00 cm 1 for 65 of sites and n value was between 1 10 and 1 25 for 75 of the sites table 1 and fig 4 reflecting the similarity of many of the water retention curves appendix b f most of the macro pore volume values varied between 0 15 and 0 22 cm3 cm 3 table 1 and fig 4 with the highest value of 0 30

plateau sites respectively table 1 the soil water content at permanent wilting point ranged from 0 04 to 0 32 cm3 cm 3 at the upper nepean sites and from 0 10 to 0 39 cm3 cm 3 for the newnes plateau sites table 1 sixty eight percent 68 of plant available water values were between 0 17 and 0 22 cm3 cm 3 table 1 and fig 4 3 2 significance of differences in soil properties between sites differences in soil properties between individual sites can generally be considered significant table 1 using the two way anova test differences were identified with high confidence p1 0 1 for 10 of the 14 tested soil properties at the upper nepean sites and seven out of 14 at the newnes plateau sites table 1 using the welch s t test differences between mean values at the upper nepean sites and those at the newnes plateau sites were significant with a high degree of confidence p3 0 1 for 12 of the 14 tested properties with only saturated hydraulic conductivities and saturated water content not considered different at that confidence level table 1 3 3 significance and nature of differences in soil properties over depth differences in soil properties between depths can be considered significant at the upper nepean sites but much less so at the newnes plateau sites table 1 using the two way anova test differences were identified with high confidence p1 0 1 for seven organic matter content bulk density saturated water content n macro pore volume water content at field capacity and water content at permanent wilting point of the 14 soil properties at the upper nepean sites but at none of the newnes plateau sites table 1 table 2 and fig 3 provide further insight into the degree and nature of the depth variations organic matter content was found to be reduced markedly with depth fig 3 and appendix a this is reflected in strong negative correlations between organic matter content and depth table 2 with the exception of site b1 due to an outlier at 750 mm depth fig 3 and appendix a saturated hydraulic conductivity was found to usually reduce with depth table 1 fig 3 and appendix a although in some sites b2 and b3 the correlation is weak and at others a3 and b1 the opposite effect is observed table 2 at the upper nepean sites bulk density has the most consistently strong positive correlation with depth table 2 fig 3 and appendix a however this consistency was not observed at the newnes plateau sites where negative correlations between bulk density and depth existed at three sites table 2 fig 3 and appendix a the correlation of other properties with depth was generally weaker and less consistent over sites although all tested properties were significantly correlated p statistic 0 1 with depth when considering data from all ten sites both upper nepean and newnes plateau table 2 using qualitative assessment the soil textures were highly variable over depths with no apparent trends except at site a3 where the amount of coarse sand increased with depth fig 2 and table 1 3 4 the effect of organic matter on soil hydraulic properties the saturated hydraulic conductivities and organic matter contents were positively correlated at nine of the ten sites strongly so at six sites and also when grouping data from all upper nepean sites and all newnes plateau sites table 2 strong correlation existed between organic matter content and bulk density at all six upper nepean sites with increasing organic matter leading to less dense soil however at the newnes plateau sites the opposite dependency was found at three sites table 2 a significant positive correlation was found between organic matter content and saturated water content at both sets of sites but this was quite variable across the ten sites with four correlations being negative and six positive table 2 the correlation between organic matter and plant available water were significantly positive only for three sites in upper nepean and two sites in newnes plateau table 2 4 discussion this study is the first to focus on characterising soil physical properties in the thpss swamps of the sydney basin bioregion which have been undermined and it adds considerably to the existing knowledge of the variability of soil hydraulic properties α n θs and ksat within the region and possible reasons understanding the variability assists with accurate swamp hydrology modelling understanding swamp hydrology affected by mining as well as finding suitable management practices for these thpsss we firstly discuss the role of organic matter on changes to the soil physical properties and evaluating the variability of soil physical properties among the study thpsss and over depth these address the first hypothesis mentioned in the introduction then we discuss the classification of study swamps in the context of peatland and to what degree the soil hydraulic properties of these thpss can be estimated by the generalisation of peatland soil physical characteristics this addresses the second hypothesis noted in the introduction we also discuss the contribution of this study to regional and global knowledge of swamp soil hydraulic parameters applicability of the new knowledge and limitations of the study 4 1 organic matter as a control on soil physical properties the addition of organic matter can affect soil properties of agricultural land loveland and webb 2003 in the context of thpss swamps trap organic matter washed from higher ground surrounding areas young 2017 organic matter is also produced by in situ decomposition of dead plant materials such as leaves and roots young 2017 for the above reasons high amounts of organic matter content up to 35 average of 15 8 were found at the studied sites table 1 fig 3 and appendix a although high these values are lower than those found average of 31 7 in some other thpss swamps in the sydney basin bioregion fryirs et al 2014a the swamps vegetation communities are soil moisture dependent young 2017 generally there is a positive correlation between organic matter content and soil gravimetric water content marshall et al 1996 the lack of strong positive correlations between organic matter content and plant available water as well as saturated water content for five of the 10 swamps table 2 was likely related to the variability in the type of organic matter soil organic matter can be divided in to three major types 1 plant residues and living microbial biomass 2 active soil organic matter known as detritus and 3 stable soil organic matter known as humus blume et al 2014 in this study loose mass of plant residues provided high total porosity saturated water content due to a reduction in bulk density the example of which can be found for the surface soil table 1 this high total porosity as a result of low bulk density likely could not lead to high water holding capacity due to the presence of a high volume of macro pores and connectivity among pores and so this resulted in low plant available water in contrast the total porosity saturated water content of soils with decomposed organic matter humus was lower than the soil containing plant residue table 1 this conducted a lower macro pore volume leading to an increase in plant available water a loose mass of dead plant debris with some fine clays and silts could likely allow water to drain quickly a higher hydraulic conductivity as per site a3 appendix a and g and fig 3 in contrast the highly organic and fine grained organic materials which were denser likely retarded water movement a lower hydraulic conductivity an example of which can be found in site b2 appendix a and h and fig 3 thus the general decrease of organic matter and saturated hydraulic conductivity with increasing depth fig 3 table 1 and appendix a is thought to be due to the more decomposed organic matter and more compacted soil higher bulk density at greater depths 4 2 variability of soil physical properties in the sydney basin bioregion thpss understanding hydrology of swamps affected by mining precise hydrological modelling and finding the appropriate management practices depend on understanding the variability of soil physical characteristics among thpsss within each thpss and over depth this can be achieved through soil characterisation there is only one previous published study cowley et al 2016 that included some geomorphic characterisation of the sydney basin bioregion thpss cowley et al 2016 compared the sedimentology of intact and channelised thpss swamps in the blue mountain area by examining indicators of sediment structure sediment unit thickness and bulk density carbon storage function organic matter and c n ratio and water holding capacity gravimetric water content in that study intact swamps were described by the absence of a channel and associated geomorphic units presence of preferential discontinuous drainage lines and presence of waterlogged highly organic sediment fryirs et al 2016 and channelised swamps were characterised by a well defined channel with associated geomorphic units in this context cowley et al 2016 reported no significant differences in bulk density or organic matter content between the intact and channelised thpss swamps in both cases there were 12 sediment cores consisting of two cores per swamp the lack of significant difference may be explained by the scale of sampling and high variance within each swamp e g the estimated mean and standard deviation of organic matter content were 12 1 12 4 and 9 66 7 11 for intact and channelised swamps respectively in our study significant differences p statistic 0 1 were found for twelve soil properties organic matter content bulk density plant available water macro pore volume n α volumetric water content at field capacity permanent wilting point and amount of coarse sand fine sand silt and clay between the southern upper nepean and western newnes plateau thpss table 1 study sites within newnes plateau were significantly different p statistic 0 1 in terms of saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density n volumetric water content at permanent wilting point coarse sand fine sand and clay while upper nepean sites differ significantly p statistic 0 1 for organic matter content bulk density saturated water content macro pore volume volumetric water content at field capacity plant available water coarse sand fine sand silt and clay interestingly bulk density sand and clay content were the only soil characteristic found to have a significant difference p statistic 0 1 between sites at both newnes plateau and upper nepean and between the two sets of sites table 1 organic matter closely follows in terms of consistently significant differences table 1 in this study the soil texture particularly sand content and organic matter affected the bulk density tables 1 2 this influenced soil characteristics and in particular created variability in soil hydraulic properties such as water retention characteristics and hydraulic conductivity table 1 a reduction in soil bulk density as a result of the existence of plant residues and high sand content possibly increased the total porosity and macro porosity therefore it affected soil hydraulic conductivity in which a higher hydraulic conductivity was observed at the surface soils of some sites such as most sites of upper nepean fig 3 and appendix a the decomposed organic matter and sand content possibly improved porosity and the connectivity of pores and so affected hydraulic conductivity the examples of which were observed for some sites over depth particularly site a3 fig 3 and tables 1 2 for all above reasons this study suggests bulk density sand content as well as organic matter content and type as discussed previously strongly characterise the variability of upper nepean and newnes plateau swamps this conclusion is in agreement with marshall et al 1996 stated that for agricultural soil bulk density and organic matter are the two basic soil characteristics that typically affect other soil physical properties it should be noted that there are consistent in cases strong correlations between property parameters and with depth within each profile e g table 2 which become weaker when generalising across sampling sites 4 3 classification of thpss of sydney basin bioregion in context of peatlands to explore whether the soil hydraulic properties of thpsss affected by mining can be estimated by generalisation of peatland soil physical characteristics understanding the thpss classification in the context of peatlands is required this is critical for hydrological modelling and understanding swamp hydrology changes as knowledge and information related to peatlands are typically used for decision making purposes on the thpss of sydney basin a comparison between the soil physical properties of thpss and peatlands are required to investigate whether these thpss can be considered as peatland and to understand whether the soil physical properties of the thpss can be estimated using generalisation of peatland soil characterisations in this context table 3 summarises the review of soil organic matter content and most studied physical properties in peatlands globally the maximum saturated hydraulic conductivities measured in the study swamps were low compared to the maximum saturated hydraulic conductivity values measured in peatlands globally table 3 the minimum saturated hydraulic conductivity values were also relatively low although much lower values exist in some wet highly organic peatlands table 3 the bulk density values of peatland soils globally were lower than those found at our study sites table 3 the soil organic matter contents and saturated water contents of other peatland were generally higher than those found in this study table 3 the generally low saturated hydraulic conductivities compared to those of peatlands table 3 is likely due to higher bulk densities and relatively lower organic matter contents at the study swamps than those of peatlands globally however the very low saturated hydraulic conductivities observed in consolidated peats that are high in decomposed organic matter bogacz 2000 rycroft et al 1975 are not seen in the thpss compared to the study sites that had average bulk density values of 0 80 g cm 3 for the upper soil horizon 0 500 mm and 1 14 g cm 3 for depths over 500 mm gough 2010 noted a bulk density of 0 15 g cm 3 for the fibric organic fines of the upper soil horizon 0 500 mm of swamps in budderoo plateau australia which increased to 0 37 g cm 3 for the more decomposed organic matters in a deeper horizon 500 mm the soil organic matter content of the study sites was not only lower than other sydney basin bio region thpss as discussed previously but also of peatlands globally table 3 according to bradley 1996 in order to be considered as peatland the swamps should have more than 50 organic content and the total porosity saturated water content of their soil should be between 88 and 92 on that basis the studied swamps are not classified as peatland therefore the soil hydraulic properties of peatlands cannot be used for the estimation of soil hydraulic functions of thpss of sydney basin and thus they cannot be applied for hydrological modelling of these thpss 4 4 contribution to guidance on soil hydraulic parameter values for hydrological modelling physically based soil hydrology models are commonly used to support land management aguilera et al 2016 ballard et al 2012 shaygan and baumgartl 2020 shaygan et al 2018a 2018b šimůnek et al 2013 soil hydraulic parameters α n θs θr and ksat are essential inputs to these models as these parameters are affected by soil texture organic matter and bulk density each soil is expected to have a unique set of parameters for the studied swamps this is illustrated by the results in table 1 however the results allow tentative generalisations about some parameters of water retention curve particularly α n and θr θr 0 fig 4 and table 1 and about decreases in saturated hydraulic conductivity with increasing depth fig 3 and appendix a also the insignificant differences between the saturated hydraulic conductivity values within the upper nepean swamps table 1 and minor differences among the newnes plateau sites invites some tentative generalisations for saturated hydraulic conductivity as well while tentative generalisations about parameter values can be made for the purpose of developing a numerical model of a typical swamp wherever possible site specific measurements should be obtained and statistical analysis focus on sites this study established soil water retention characteristics θs θr α n field capacity plant available water and macro pore volume and hydraulic conductivity table 1 as a function of textural class with specific organic matter content and bulk density the presented pedotransfer functions van genuchten parameters table 1 extend the van genuchten guideline values described in carsel and parrish 1988 appendix i and hydrus model for the soil textures clay loam loam sandy clay loam sandy loam loamy sand and sand found in the swamps for instance the saturated water content for the studied thpss sandy soil ranged between 0 67 and 0 56 cm3 cm 3 compared to 0 43 cm3 cm 3 in the guideline table 1 and appendix i this difference is probably because the guideline values described in carsel and parrish 1988 were based on soils with a lower amount of organic matter and higher bulk density than those observed in the studied swamps the presented soil hydraulic parameters can be used for the projection of the likelihood of alteration in swamp vegetation which can be induced by climate variability and or climate change and in many thpss also by mining soil moisture dynamics regulated by soil physical characteristics particularly water retention curves hillel 1982 marshall et al 1996 influence plant growth and health rendig and taylor 1989 as well as the ecological succession of landscapes gairola and soni 2010 estimation of the soil moisture fluctuations using scenario modelling through soil hydrological models e g hydrus can assist with understanding and forecasting the alteration and ecological succession of swamps vegetation for instance a soil hydrological model can predict swamp soil moisture regimes and thus assist with identifying whether or not swamps vegetation changes from the plants adopted to waterlogged conditions to water stress tolerant plant species this can also help the prediction of plant diversity reduction and a movement towards a uniform plant composition 4 5 limitations of the study one of the main characteristics of thpss swamps is dense vegetation cover young 2017 that can result in the occurrence of preferential flow within the near surface soil jarvis et al 2016 plant roots and macro fauna as well as cracks are able to create connected macro pores or channels that can contribute to preferential flow gerke 2006 jarvis et al 2016 2012 in this study although signals of dual porosity were not detected in the water retention curves for any of the studied soil layers the calculated high values for macro pore volumes table 3 suggests the potential for preferential flow pathways particularly under high rainfall events there are different methods to identify dual porosity signals over a range of spatial scales including non newtonian fluids atallah and abou najm 2018 ground penetrating radar fluorescent dye ghodrati and jury 1990 magnetic resonance imaging posadas et al 1996 and continuous time soil moisture measurements down the soil profile arnold et al 2020 hence the employed laboratory analyses would benefit from complementary in situ monitoring techniques taking samples from more sites and at deeper depths would also help characterise soil heterogeneity within swamps 5 conclusions soil characterisation of the thpss of the sydney basin bioregion is necessary for their conservation and rehabilitation particularly when a soil hydrological model is used as a decision making tool or when monitoring potential changes in plant available water and other key soil properties new insights from this research included the quantification of key soil physical properties of swamps affected by mining evaluating their variability between sites and down the soil profile determining how specific soil properties affect other soil physical characteristics and classification of the swamps in the context of peatlands the research suggests bulk density and sand content as well as organic matter control soil physical properties of swamps and their variabilities soil physical variabilities among swamps are considerable yet lower than those found in peatlands globally this research suggests water retention curve parameters can be generalised for modelling purposes although wherever possible site specific parameters should be used the study swamps cannot be classified as peatlands due to a lower organic matter content and a higher bulk density compared with peatlands and so the soil physical properties of peatlands cannot be used for the thpss swamps modelling this study also extended guidelines for van genuchten parameters water retention characteristics and hydraulic conductivity as a function of textural class with specific organic matter content and bulk density that supports soil hydrology modelling funding this research was funded by australian coal

8012,study region east africa ea study focus the current poor capability of drought resistance and the high dependence of local residents on agriculture and animal husbandry initiated a comprehensive understanding of soil moisture sm droughts in ea previous lower order subspace drought investigations that have neglected the space time continuity of actual droughts hindered deeper knowledge of droughts to fill this gap this study investigated the sm droughts in ea from a space time joint perspective focusing on drought spatiotemporal patterns and variations and climate drivers new hydrological insights for the region based on the space time joint approach 582 drought clusters and 226 events over 1979 2014 were identified spatially historical droughts presented a dual centre pattern in the northwest and southeast they were characterised by high frequency long duration and large severity driven by the climate forcing of precipitation prep and temperature temp this pattern differed seasonally due to the major control of prep and the partly strengthening effect of temp temporally seasonal droughts displayed significant p 0 05 increasing decreasing trends in summer autumn regarding the climate drivers the partial least squares regression approach was first employed in the space time continuous drought domain the innovative method clarified the contribution of different climate elements to sm droughts and recognised the critical climate drivers of prep wind speed and downward radiation the results provides important implications for drought mechanism exploration and drought prediction keywords soil moisture droughts patterns climate drivers east africa 1 introduction drought is a creeping phenomenon in which the deficiency of water relative to normal conditions can last for several months to years and spread across regional and continental scales mishra and singh 2010 sheffield and wood 2011 van loon and lanen 2013 east africa ea is one of the most drought prone regions in the world muller 2014 tadesse 2016 recurrent droughts have attacked ea in recent decades resulting in massive crop failures livestock deaths and human casualties ipcc 2007 zhao and dai 2015 due to the commonly observed poor capabilities in drought resistance drought has long been the main constraint of domestic socioeconomic instabilities in ea ayana et al 2016 drought in ea has attracted extensive attention anderson et al 2012 awange et al 2013 haile et al 2019 thomas et al 2020 most studies have focused on meteorological droughts indicated mainly by precipitation prep temperature temp and potential evapotranspiration pet e g ntale and gan 2003 dutra et al 2013 nicholson 2014 degefu and bewket 2015 nguvava et al 2019 tan et al 2020 these studies are informative for understanding the spatial and temporal characteristics and causes of droughts in ea however meteorological factors cannot effectively reflect the actual drought status on the land surface because of the insufficiency to account for the feedback from the land surface to the atmosphere vegetation health is a synthetic result of land surface atmosphere feedback thus studies have used vegetation indices e g normalized difference vegetation index as drought indicators omute et al 2012 rulinda et al 2012 winkler et al 2017 although sometimes effective in drought detection vegetation indices are not a direct sign of land surface water deficiency because they are disturbed by vegetation self regulation rulinda et al 2012 winkler et al 2017 soil moisture sm is at the core of the water and energy cycle between land and atmosphere it is the largest storage component of precipitation and radiation anomalies on land sm anomalies can effectively explain climate anomalies and account for land surface feedback seneviratne et al 2010 hence abnormal sm deficiency i e sm drought can represent the underlying drought conditions under a coupled land and atmosphere sm drought is closely related to agricultural production which guarantees the basic survival of the local populations however according to our review of the literature sm drought studies in ea are still preliminary and insufficient spatiotemporal patterns and variations and the climate drivers of sm droughts remain unclear which is a significant hindrance to drought mechanism exploration and effective drought prediction previous drought studies of ea have usually identified drought events in lower order subspace i e only identified droughts from time dimension and consequently analyzed drought characteristics from the temporal variations or spatial distributions separately while neglecting the space time continuous property of actual droughts anderson et al 2012 mcnally et al 2016 the lack of information on the space dimension in drought identification hinders accurate drought characterisation in the real world lloyd hughes 2012 recently space time synchronous drought identification methods have been proved to be a success these methods adhere to the intrinsic spatiotemporal continuity and reproduce the development process of drought events andreadis et al 2005 zhu et al 2019 herrera estrada et al 2017 liu et al 2021 compared with the time domain only methods the latest methods could improve the determination of real drought characteristics e g the spatial position overall severity duration of a drought and benefit the investigation of climate drivers diaz et al 2020 therefore this study focused on the sm droughts of ea from a space time joint perspective for the first time the primary objectives of this study were twofold first we attempted to gain comprehensive knowledge of the spatiotemporal patterns and variations of sm droughts over a typical drought prone region and to achieve this objective we reconstructed and analysed in depth historical drought events in ea second we attempted to explore and determine the major contributing climate forces of the drought events 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the area in ea between 12 s 14 n and 22 e 47 covering a total area of approximately 3 62 million km2 was the focus of this study it mainly includes sudan ethiopia somalia uganda kenya tanzania and burundi fig 1a the topography varies significantly from the highland to the lowland and coastal areas with a range of 0 5841 m fig 1a the dominant land cover types were grassland cropland and forests fig 1b most of the study area is located in a semi arid region with a savanna climate awange et al 2013 the multi year average precipitation air temperature and sm and their intra annual variations are presented in fig 1c h 2 2 data remotely sensed data are specifically important for drought monitoring and assessment in ea because instrumental data recording starts much later than in other continents and is insufficient in africa remote sensing observations provide large scale data with spatial and temporal continuity nicholson et al 2012 anderson et al 2012 the multi source remote sensing synthetic sm data developed by the climate change initiative cci project by the esa is a long term gridded sm dataset that has substantial potential for agricultural drought monitoring and extreme hydrological analysis in ea gruber et al 2019 dorigo et al 2017 in this study the active and passive combined esa cci sm dataset v4 8 was used it has a 0 25 spatial resolution and a daily temporal interval representing soil wetness in 2 cm of topsoil for drought analysis daily data were aggregated to 1 month from 1979 to 2014 the data gaps missing values were filled based on a land surface reanalysis dataset of gldasv2 0 noah by the cumulative distribution frequency cdf matching approach reichle and koster 2004 specifically the missing data for 1 month were filled with a rescaled sm of gldas2 0 noah which had the same probabilistic rank in their cdfs on a pixel basis liu et al 2019a this data gap filling would not alter the original dynamics of the esa cci sm because of the low percentages no more than 30 of data gap filling for most 95 pixels fig s1 to support the drought study and particularly for exploring the climate drivers of sm droughts we used the monthly precipitation prep surface 2 m air temperature temp downward radiation radi near surface 10 m wind speed wind and vapour pressure deficit vpd data with a 0 25 spatial resolution over ea they were obtained from the gldasv2 0 noah forcing dataset beaudoing et al 2019 directly for prep temp and wind or indirectly for radi the sum of short and long wave downward radiation and vpd a function of the 2 m air temperature and specific humidity and the surface pressure gldasv2 0 noah was entirely forced by the princeton meteorological forcing dataset sheffield et al 2006 this dataset was constructed by combining a suite of global observation based datasets with the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis specifically the contributing datasets used in the development of the forcing dataset comprised the ncep ncar reanalysis climate research unit global precipitation climatology project tropical rainfall measuring mission and the national aeronautics and space administration langley surface radiation budget project 3 methodology 3 1 space time identification and characterisation of drought events the space time synchronous identification of drought events involves the recognition of the spatial continuity of drought units i e drought clusters and the temporal continuity of drought clusters generally it is based on a clustering method andreadis et al 2005 lloyd hughes 2012 in which the space time continuous structure is extracted from the 3 dimensional 3 d latitude longitude and time array of the monthly drought index in this study the sm anomaly percentage index smapi bergman et al 1988 is used as the drought indicator because of its effectiveness in long term regional and global drought assessment e g liu et al 2019a the smapi is defined as the relative departure of soil moisture from its multi year average value representing normal climate conditions 1 smapi θ θ θ where θ and θ are the monthly sm and the multi year average sm for each calendar month respectively the sm utilized here was the gap filled esa cci sm on each grid pixel the sm grid pixels with smapi 0 15 are believed to be under drought as the moderate and the above moderate droughts are accounted for in this study wu et al 2016 specifically drought event identification comprises the following two steps i identify drought clusters in the study region for each month first the spatial noises of the 1 month smapi 1 smapi map were smoothed using a 3 3 median filter this practice can help reduce the existence of porous clusters drought clusters with many non drought and discontinuous drought grid pixels related to data quality next the drought clusters were identified based on the clustering algorithm of andreadis et al 2005 which are sets of grid pixels with smapi 0 15 that have spatial continuity to avoid spurious long lasting drought events caused by tenuous spatial continuity we ignored small drought clusters of less than 53 750 km2 i e 86 grid pixels approximately 1 5 of the study area the adoption of this truncation threshold was analogous to that of wang et al 2011 and liu et al 2019b ii determine the temporal continuity of drought clusters the temporal connection of the drought clusters between adjacent months was determined based on their overlapping areas based on the literature e g corzo perez et al 2011 herrera estrada et al 2017 liu et al 2021 eight neighbour continuity recognition methods were utilized temporal adjacent clusters were considered to be from one drought event when they spatially overlapped the following drought characteristics were accounted for in the aforementioned space time drought event identification framework 1 drought duration time span between the initiation and termination of one drought event 2 drought area projected area over the longitude latitude surface in the 3 d drought event domain 3 drought severity indicator of the degree of water deficiency for a drought event cluster here it is characterized by the cumulative value of the grid based 1 smapi within the 3 d drought event drought cluster thus the more negative the drought severity value the more severe is the drought 4 the spatial location of the drought cluster event was characterised by the centroid of the drought cluster projected drought area for one event in this case the centroid was defined as the weighted centre of the 1 smapi with the 1 smapi values at each grid pixel within the drought cluster projected drought event area as weights the expression for the two dimensional cen x cen y centroid is as follows 2 cen x i 1 n smapi i x i i 1 n smapi i 3 cen y i 1 n smapi i y i i 1 n smapi i where cen x and cen y represent the geographical coordinates of the drought centroid n is the number of grid pixels within the drought cluster projected drought event area smapi i is the smapi value for the ith drought grid pixel and x i and y i are the geographical coordinates of the ith drought grid pixel spatial changes of a drought over time are represented by the changes of the drought cluster centroids referenced from xu et al 2015 herrera estrada et al 2017 and liu et al 2021 over the long lasting process of one drought the cluster centroids generate tracks paths as the drought clusters displace from one to the next month 3 2 climate driver identification for drought events sm dynamics are generally constrained by precipitation and evapotranspiration processes which mainly involve the climatic factors of prep temp radi wind and vpd the climate driving forces of the aforementioned factors on sm droughts were identified based on the partial least squares regression plsr approach because of its strong ability to process data with high collinearity farifteh et al 2007 fan et al 2015 plsr combines the features of principal component analysis and multiple regression first it extracts a set of latent factors that explain as much of the variance as possible between the independent and dependent variables a regression step then predicts the values of the dependent variables by using the decomposition of the independent variables the regression equation can be expressed as 4 y k 1 n w k x k w 0 where y is the dependent variable the standardised 1 smapi in this study x k is the kth independent variable the standardised anomaly of the individual climate factors mentioned above w k is the corresponding regression coefficient w 0 is the truncated value of the regression line and n is the number of climate factors considered in this study the plsr approach was performed on the level of a 3 d drought event that had one or several temporal continuous drought clusters a classification regression method was adopted considering the large number of grid pixels in the 3 d drought event domain first for each cluster the drought grids were divided into 10 categories based on the 1 smapi value with equal intervals second the mean value of the standardized 1 smapi and the corresponding mean statistics of prep temp radi wind vpd anomaly for each category were calculated finally the obtained category based mean values for one drought event were utilized to construct the regression equation eq 4 regression coefficients and variable importance in projection vip scores for each climate factor were calculated the vip score is an indicator of the contribution of climate factor x k to sm droughts y and calculated as 5 vip n m 1 m λ m 2 ssy comp m m 1 m ssy comp m where λ 2 m is the squared pls weight of component m ssy comp m is the sum of squares of y explained by component m and m is the number of principle components 2 in this study the magnitude of the regression coefficients and their vips for each climate factor co determine their importance as drivers of sm droughts specifically for prep when the regression coefficient is positive and vip 1 0 it is regarded as an important driver of one sm drought event for temp radi wind vpd when the regression coefficient is negative and vip 1 0 it is considered as an important driver notably one sm drought event can be forced by one or more important drivers the driver with the largest vip value was the first most important driver to quantify the contribution of important climate drivers to sm drought we applied the contribution rate method li et al 2014 the contributions contribution weight can be calculated by 6 contribution weight w k k 1 n w k 100 the performance of the plsr can be generally evaluated using the correlation coefficient r 2 between the predicted and actual 1 smapi values for one event the larger the r 2 the better the performance of plsr and the more reliable the identification of important climate drivers 4 results 4 1 soil moisture drought events identified in a space time framework based on the space time synchronous drought identification approach 582 drought clusters and 226 drought events were identified in ea from 1979 to 2014 these events with their drought duration varied from 1 to 14 months drought area from 0 05 to 2 75 million km2 i e 1 4 76 of the study region and drought severity from 15 78 to 3568 the probability distributions of these three characteristic parameters for all identified events are presented in fig 2 although the more severe the drought the lower the probability of occurrence severe events with a drought duration of more than 6 months drought area over 1 million km2 28 of the whole study area and drought severity less than 1000 the more negative the value of severity the more severe the drought still approaches 7 5 17 of 226 of the total events specifically table 1 lists the top 20 severe sm drought events including their start and end times drought duration area and severity these identified events are supported by the literature e g haile et al 2019 masih et al 2014 nicholson 2014 funk et al 2013 and em dat database em dat 2018 detailed in table 1 drought events with their specific spatial reach cumulative intensity smapi and migration paths tracks over the duration are provided in fig 3 notably sm droughts can appear anywhere over the entire ea the southeast and northwest regions including somalia east kenya southeast tanzania and sudan are frequently affected by large scale and severe droughts in addition the spatial location of a drought generally changes over time the monthly displacements of drought clusters can reach hundreds of kilometres followed by the migration path track of one drought 4 2 spatial temporal patterns and variations of soil moisture droughts fig 4 overviews the spatial distribution of sm droughts in drought frequency represented by the number of drought events and the accumulated drought duration and severity the three drought parameters exhibited similar spatial patterns ea with its northwest and southeast regions more frequently 40 events experiences sm droughts with long lasting duration 80 months and a high order of severity in accumulation 15 for temporal accumulated smapi with a more negative value indicating greater severity drought clusters with their locations represented by drought cluster centroids could better reflect the spatial patterns of droughts fig 5 displays the drought cluster centroids together with their probability density both for the total period 1979 2014 and for all four boreal seasons of spring summer autumn and winter generally the highest drought probability with the densest cluster centroids occurred in the southeastern and northwestern regions this pattern is consistent with that of the accumulated drought characteristic parameters in fig 4 and is supported by anderson et al 2012 and mcnally et al 2016 the spatial patterns of the drought clusters showed seasonal differences in spring the drought clusters were distributed mainly in the northwest and sporadically in the southeast summer droughts became less frequent in the northwest but more frequent in the southeast and south in autumn droughts were again frequent in the northeast and also becomes frequent in the south but less frequent in the southeast winter droughts seem to be frequent in large regions over the southeast northwest of ea regarding temporal variations drought severity for the entire ea did not present a significant tendency p 0 05 from 1979 to 2014 although there was high interannual variability fig s2 however significant p 0 05 seasonal trends were observed particularly in the boreal summer and autumn fig 6 summer droughts were largely enhanced but autumn droughts were substantially weakened fig 6b and c similar results have been reported e g lyon and dewitt 2012 liebmann et al 2014 rowell et al 2015 winter droughts also decreased but not significantly p 0 05 spring droughts didnot show trends over time but have large interannual variability 4 3 climate drivers of soil moisture droughts the space time identification of droughts could reshape the development process of a drought event this is beneficial for the investigation of the driving forces of sm droughts based on the plsr approach the driving forces of the climate factors involved in precipitation and evapotranspiration processes that is precipitation prep surface air temperature temp downward radiation radi near surface wind speed wind and vapour pressure deficit vpd were explored within the 3 d space time continuous domain of sm drought events the delayed impacts of the aforementioned climate elements on sm droughts van loon and van lanen 2012 were accounted for based on their correlations with sm anomalies under different time lags and consequently a time lag of three months was adopted fig s3 fig 7 shows the proportion of sm drought events events with unidentified unknown drivers were not included caused by different climate drivers for both cases of the important driver fig 7a and the first important driver fig 7b generally most sm droughts are driven by one or a combination of two or three climatic factors fig 7a wind prep and radi are the first three important drivers of sm droughts in ea which is true for both the important driver and first important driver statistics the climate driver map for individual sm drought events is presented in fig 8 the important climate drivers vary significantly among the drought events in ea fig 8a there seems to be no spatial regularity however the large scale and severe sm droughts in southeast and northwest are mainly under the single combined forces of prep wind and radi fig 8a the dominance of prep wind and radi on sm droughts is more obvious in the first important climate driver map in fig 8b for the driving capability the contribution weight of the climate drivers see eq 6 for both the important drivers i e prep temp radi wind and vpd individually and the summarised weight of the important drivers for one event and the first important driver for all drought events is presented in fig 9 generally prep wind and radi have substantially higher contribution weight than temp and vpd highlighting the dominant role of prep wind and radi on sm droughts in ea in addition the comparatively high value mostly 38 68 of the summarised weight for the important drivers indicates the consistency between the identified important drivers and the corresponding strong driving capability the relatively low mostly 28 42 driving capacity of the first important driver suggests the inability of the first important drivers to explain the whole sm drought events 5 discussion 5 1 interpretation of spatial patterns of soil moisture droughts in ea the sm droughts are generally centred in the northwest and southeast this pattern is consistent with the spatial distributions of prep and temp fig 1c and d both are closely related to the topography of the ea fig 1a particularly for the temp because ea is within the deep tropics the spatial heterogeneity of temp is dominated by elevation similar to temp the prep of ea is also affected by topography to a large degree in addition prep is still highly affected by tropical circulation land atmosphere feedback and maritime influence funk et al 2014 nicholson 2017 sm droughts exhibit seasonal differences in their spatial patterns section 4 2 the high seasonal and interannual variability of the climate system are considered as the main driving forces of sm droughts haile 2005 among the climate elements that control sm dynamics i e prep temp radi wind and vpd which one ones is dominant here prep temp radi wind and vpd were further explored on their seasonal variation indicated by the seasonal average state and interannual variability represented by the temporal variation coefficient which is a measure of the deviation from the average state we found that the seasonal dynamics of sm drought patterns were generally consistent with those of the seasonal average state and the variation coefficient of prep figs 5 10 and fig 11 the drought prone regions are qualified with low but highly variable prep specifically the sm drought centre in the northwest of ea is qualified with considerably low 50 mm month and high variability 1 of rainfall in spring figs 10a 11a and 5a however in summer the low rainfall with high variation spreads over the southeast and south corresponding to high sm drought density figs 10b 11b and 5b in autumn the low and highly variable rainfall remains distributed in the southeast and south where the droughts clustered although it has weakened compared with summer in the northwest low and highly variable rainfall reappears and is accompanied by frequent sm droughts figs 10c 11c and 5c in winter low and highly variable rainfall prevails in large regions along the southeast northwest of ea with frequent sm droughts figs 10d 11d and 5d the considerably high consistency between the spatial patterns of prep and sm droughts suggests that the seasonal dynamics of sm droughts are mainly driven by prep the dominant role of prep in drought occurrence in ea is also supported by the findings of lyon 2014 and nicholson 2017 in addition temp also contributes to the formation of sm drought patterns in each season although it presents similar spatial patterns in the four boreal seasons and low variability in time figs 12 and s4 for example the high density of sm droughts in the northwest in spring is also related to the extremely high temp fig 12a the sm drought centre in the southeast in winter remains affected by high temp fig 12d overall the general long term spatial patterns of sm droughts were jointly controlled by prep and temp which can partly be considered a result of strongly marked orographic effects however the seasonal dynamics of the spatial patterns of sm droughts were predominantly controlled by prep and partly strengthened by temp 5 2 reasonability and uncertainty of the identified climate drivers for sm droughts prep wind and radi are the predominant drivers of sm droughts in ea based on the plsr approach the results indicate that sm droughts are under the control of both water and energy which is consistent with the significant role of sm in the water and energy cycles wanders et al 2014 most of the severe droughts in ea are attributed to the failure of the long rains nicholson 2017 funk et al 2018 which indicates the significance of prep in the occurrence and development of drought researches e g schreck and semazzi 2004 nicholson 2017 have elucidated the importance of zonal winds and low level circulations in seasonal drought forecasts indicating that wind is a pivotal driver of droughts in addition sm is closely related to the underlying evapotranspiration process which is energy driven radi is an effective indicator of the energy income from the atmosphere hence radi should be an important driver of sm droughts overall the three predominant drivers of sm droughts in ea identified based on the plsr approach are reasonable the performance indicator of the plsr that is the correlation coefficient r 2 between the predicted and the actual 1 smapi values for total 226 sm drought events demonstrates the reliability of the identified climate drivers fig 13a most 59 events qualified with a comparatively high r 2 value 0 5 compared with small droughts large scale severe events tended to have relatively low r 2 values fig 13b this suggests that the identified climate drivers for severe events likely bear more uncertainty this result is consistent with the actual situations large scale and severe droughts usually last several months to years during which climate elements strongly interact and drought propagation and recovery occur in different drought domains xu et al 2015 herrera estrada et al 2017 therefore large scale droughts are likely controlled by varying climate drivers during their long evolutionary processes lyon 2014 this increases the uncertainty of climate driver identification and makes drought prediction more difficult and complicated data quality of both sm and climate variables including prep temp radi wind and vpd are another limitation on climate driver exploration ea has been suffered from a lack of long term in situ meteorological and hydrological recorded data because of the sparse and unreliable local monitoring networks mu et al 2013 sheffield et al 2014 remotely sensed and reanalyzed data can fill the gaps while bearing unquantified errors the data errors further propagated to the determination of climate drivers which might be the reason for the unidentified unknown driver cases section 4 3 in addition to the vital role of climate forces on sm droughts human activities e g land use change might also contribute to drought occurrence neglecting human impacts may cause uncertainty in climate driver identification 6 conclusion this study investigated the sm droughts in ea from a space time joint perspective based on a merged dataset of remote sensing and land surface modelling the focus was on the spatiotemporal patterns and variations and the climate drivers of sm droughts the main results are as follows i a total of582 drought clusters and 226 drought events were recognised in ea from 1979 to 2014 based on the space time synchronous drought identification approach large and severe events with a drought duration of more than 6 months drought area over 1 million km2 and drought severity less than 1000 accounted for 7 5 these droughts appeared almost anywhere in ea with the southeast and northwest regions including somalia east kenya southeast tanzania and sudan being more prone be attacked spatially sm droughts presented a dual centre pattern in the northwest and southeast dominated by prep and temp which can be partly considered a result of the strongly marked orographic effects however this pattern displayed seasonal differences the seasonal dynamics of sm droughts were predominantly controlled by prep and were partly strengthened by temp temporally the seasonal sm droughts showed a clear tendency in summer and autumn with significant p 0 05 increasing and decreasing trends respectively ii most sm droughts are driven by one or a combination of two or three climate factors precipitation near surface wind speed and downward radiation were the top three important drivers based on the plsr approach applied in the space time continuous drought event domain large scale and severe droughts with their identified climate drivers tended to bear more uncertainty than those of small droughts the occurrence of large droughts is likely controlled by varying and intertangled climate drivers during the long evolutionary process thus it significantly increases the complexity and difficulty of drought prediction overall this study provides a comprehensive investigation of the spatiotemporal patterns and variations and the climate drivers of sm droughts in ea from a novel space time i e 3 d perspective the seasonal dynamics of the drought spatial patterns were interpreted based on climate variability the climate drivers of sm droughts were explored at the level of a 3 d individual drought event this innovative work could deepen the knowledge on the formation and development mechanism of sm drought in ea and serve as an important implication for early warning and future drought prediction additionally the neglected human impacts on sm droughts may introduce certain uncertainties to

8012,study region east africa ea study focus the current poor capability of drought resistance and the high dependence of local residents on agriculture and animal husbandry initiated a comprehensive understanding of soil moisture sm droughts in ea previous lower order subspace drought investigations that have neglected the space time continuity of actual droughts hindered deeper knowledge of droughts to fill this gap this study investigated the sm droughts in ea from a space time joint perspective focusing on drought spatiotemporal patterns and variations and climate drivers new hydrological insights for the region based on the space time joint approach 582 drought clusters and 226 events over 1979 2014 were identified spatially historical droughts presented a dual centre pattern in the northwest and southeast they were characterised by high frequency long duration and large severity driven by the climate forcing of precipitation prep and temperature temp this pattern differed seasonally due to the major control of prep and the partly strengthening effect of temp temporally seasonal droughts displayed significant p 0 05 increasing decreasing trends in summer autumn regarding the climate drivers the partial least squares regression approach was first employed in the space time continuous drought domain the innovative method clarified the contribution of different climate elements to sm droughts and recognised the critical climate drivers of prep wind speed and downward radiation the results provides important implications for drought mechanism exploration and drought prediction keywords soil moisture droughts patterns climate drivers east africa 1 introduction drought is a creeping phenomenon in which the deficiency of water relative to normal conditions can last for several months to years and spread across regional and continental scales mishra and singh 2010 sheffield and wood 2011 van loon and lanen 2013 east africa ea is one of the most drought prone regions in the world muller 2014 tadesse 2016 recurrent droughts have attacked ea in recent decades resulting in massive crop failures livestock deaths and human casualties ipcc 2007 zhao and dai 2015 due to the commonly observed poor capabilities in drought resistance drought has long been the main constraint of domestic socioeconomic instabilities in ea ayana et al 2016 drought in ea has attracted extensive attention anderson et al 2012 awange et al 2013 haile et al 2019 thomas et al 2020 most studies have focused on meteorological droughts indicated mainly by precipitation prep temperature temp and potential evapotranspiration pet e g ntale and gan 2003 dutra et al 2013 nicholson 2014 degefu and bewket 2015 nguvava et al 2019 tan et al 2020 these studies are informative for understanding the spatial and temporal characteristics and causes of droughts in ea however meteorological factors cannot effectively reflect the actual drought status on the land surface because of the insufficiency to account for the feedback from the land surface to the atmosphere vegetation health is a synthetic result of land surface atmosphere feedback thus studies have used vegetation indices e g normalized difference vegetation index as drought indicators omute et al 2012 rulinda et al 2012 winkler et al 2017 although sometimes effective in drought detection vegetation indices are not a direct sign of land surface water deficiency because they are disturbed by vegetation self regulation rulinda et al 2012 winkler et al 2017 soil moisture sm is at the core of the water and energy cycle between land and atmosphere it is the largest storage component of precipitation and radiation anomalies on land sm anomalies can effectively explain climate anomalies and account for land surface feedback seneviratne et al 2010 hence abnormal sm deficiency i e sm drought can represent the underlying drought conditions under a coupled land and atmosphere sm drought is closely related to agricultural production which guarantees the basic survival of the local populations however according to our review of the literature sm drought studies in ea are still preliminary and insufficient spatiotemporal patterns and variations and the climate drivers of sm droughts remain unclear which is a significant hindrance to drought mechanism exploration and effective drought prediction previous drought studies of ea have usually identified drought events in lower order subspace i e only identified droughts from time dimension and consequently analyzed drought characteristics from the temporal variations or spatial distributions separately while neglecting the space time continuous property of actual droughts anderson et al 2012 mcnally et al 2016 the lack of information on the space dimension in drought identification hinders accurate drought characterisation in the real world lloyd hughes 2012 recently space time synchronous drought identification methods have been proved to be a success these methods adhere to the intrinsic spatiotemporal continuity and reproduce the development process of drought events andreadis et al 2005 zhu et al 2019 herrera estrada et al 2017 liu et al 2021 compared with the time domain only methods the latest methods could improve the determination of real drought characteristics e g the spatial position overall severity duration of a drought and benefit the investigation of climate drivers diaz et al 2020 therefore this study focused on the sm droughts of ea from a space time joint perspective for the first time the primary objectives of this study were twofold first we attempted to gain comprehensive knowledge of the spatiotemporal patterns and variations of sm droughts over a typical drought prone region and to achieve this objective we reconstructed and analysed in depth historical drought events in ea second we attempted to explore and determine the major contributing climate forces of the drought events 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the area in ea between 12 s 14 n and 22 e 47 covering a total area of approximately 3 62 million km2 was the focus of this study it mainly includes sudan ethiopia somalia uganda kenya tanzania and burundi fig 1a the topography varies significantly from the highland to the lowland and coastal areas with a range of 0 5841 m fig 1a the dominant land cover types were grassland cropland and forests fig 1b most of the study area is located in a semi arid region with a savanna climate awange et al 2013 the multi year average precipitation air temperature and sm and their intra annual variations are presented in fig 1c h 2 2 data remotely sensed data are specifically important for drought monitoring and assessment in ea because instrumental data recording starts much later than in other continents and is insufficient in africa remote sensing observations provide large scale data with spatial and temporal continuity nicholson et al 2012 anderson et al 2012 the multi source remote sensing synthetic sm data developed by the climate change initiative cci project by the esa is a long term gridded sm dataset that has substantial potential for agricultural drought monitoring and extreme hydrological analysis in ea gruber et al 2019 dorigo et al 2017 in this study the active and passive combined esa cci sm dataset v4 8 was used it has a 0 25 spatial resolution and a daily temporal interval representing soil wetness in 2 cm of topsoil for drought analysis daily data were aggregated to 1 month from 1979 to 2014 the data gaps missing values were filled based on a land surface reanalysis dataset of gldasv2 0 noah by the cumulative distribution frequency cdf matching approach reichle and koster 2004 specifically the missing data for 1 month were filled with a rescaled sm of gldas2 0 noah which had the same probabilistic rank in their cdfs on a pixel basis liu et al 2019a this data gap filling would not alter the original dynamics of the esa cci sm because of the low percentages no more than 30 of data gap filling for most 95 pixels fig s1 to support the drought study and particularly for exploring the climate drivers of sm droughts we used the monthly precipitation prep surface 2 m air temperature temp downward radiation radi near surface 10 m wind speed wind and vapour pressure deficit vpd data with a 0 25 spatial resolution over ea they were obtained from the gldasv2 0 noah forcing dataset beaudoing et al 2019 directly for prep temp and wind or indirectly for radi the sum of short and long wave downward radiation and vpd a function of the 2 m air temperature and specific humidity and the surface pressure gldasv2 0 noah was entirely forced by the princeton meteorological forcing dataset sheffield et al 2006 this dataset was constructed by combining a suite of global observation based datasets with the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis specifically the contributing datasets used in the development of the forcing dataset comprised the ncep ncar reanalysis climate research unit global precipitation climatology project tropical rainfall measuring mission and the national aeronautics and space administration langley surface radiation budget project 3 methodology 3 1 space time identification and characterisation of drought events the space time synchronous identification of drought events involves the recognition of the spatial continuity of drought units i e drought clusters and the temporal continuity of drought clusters generally it is based on a clustering method andreadis et al 2005 lloyd hughes 2012 in which the space time continuous structure is extracted from the 3 dimensional 3 d latitude longitude and time array of the monthly drought index in this study the sm anomaly percentage index smapi bergman et al 1988 is used as the drought indicator because of its effectiveness in long term regional and global drought assessment e g liu et al 2019a the smapi is defined as the relative departure of soil moisture from its multi year average value representing normal climate conditions 1 smapi θ θ θ where θ and θ are the monthly sm and the multi year average sm for each calendar month respectively the sm utilized here was the gap filled esa cci sm on each grid pixel the sm grid pixels with smapi 0 15 are believed to be under drought as the moderate and the above moderate droughts are accounted for in this study wu et al 2016 specifically drought event identification comprises the following two steps i identify drought clusters in the study region for each month first the spatial noises of the 1 month smapi 1 smapi map were smoothed using a 3 3 median filter this practice can help reduce the existence of porous clusters drought clusters with many non drought and discontinuous drought grid pixels related to data quality next the drought clusters were identified based on the clustering algorithm of andreadis et al 2005 which are sets of grid pixels with smapi 0 15 that have spatial continuity to avoid spurious long lasting drought events caused by tenuous spatial continuity we ignored small drought clusters of less than 53 750 km2 i e 86 grid pixels approximately 1 5 of the study area the adoption of this truncation threshold was analogous to that of wang et al 2011 and liu et al 2019b ii determine the temporal continuity of drought clusters the temporal connection of the drought clusters between adjacent months was determined based on their overlapping areas based on the literature e g corzo perez et al 2011 herrera estrada et al 2017 liu et al 2021 eight neighbour continuity recognition methods were utilized temporal adjacent clusters were considered to be from one drought event when they spatially overlapped the following drought characteristics were accounted for in the aforementioned space time drought event identification framework 1 drought duration time span between the initiation and termination of one drought event 2 drought area projected area over the longitude latitude surface in the 3 d drought event domain 3 drought severity indicator of the degree of water deficiency for a drought event cluster here it is characterized by the cumulative value of the grid based 1 smapi within the 3 d drought event drought cluster thus the more negative the drought severity value the more severe is the drought 4 the spatial location of the drought cluster event was characterised by the centroid of the drought cluster projected drought area for one event in this case the centroid was defined as the weighted centre of the 1 smapi with the 1 smapi values at each grid pixel within the drought cluster projected drought event area as weights the expression for the two dimensional cen x cen y centroid is as follows 2 cen x i 1 n smapi i x i i 1 n smapi i 3 cen y i 1 n smapi i y i i 1 n smapi i where cen x and cen y represent the geographical coordinates of the drought centroid n is the number of grid pixels within the drought cluster projected drought event area smapi i is the smapi value for the ith drought grid pixel and x i and y i are the geographical coordinates of the ith drought grid pixel spatial changes of a drought over time are represented by the changes of the drought cluster centroids referenced from xu et al 2015 herrera estrada et al 2017 and liu et al 2021 over the long lasting process of one drought the cluster centroids generate tracks paths as the drought clusters displace from one to the next month 3 2 climate driver identification for drought events sm dynamics are generally constrained by precipitation and evapotranspiration processes which mainly involve the climatic factors of prep temp radi wind and vpd the climate driving forces of the aforementioned factors on sm droughts were identified based on the partial least squares regression plsr approach because of its strong ability to process data with high collinearity farifteh et al 2007 fan et al 2015 plsr combines the features of principal component analysis and multiple regression first it extracts a set of latent factors that explain as much of the variance as possible between the independent and dependent variables a regression step then predicts the values of the dependent variables by using the decomposition of the independent variables the regression equation can be expressed as 4 y k 1 n w k x k w 0 where y is the dependent variable the standardised 1 smapi in this study x k is the kth independent variable the standardised anomaly of the individual climate factors mentioned above w k is the corresponding regression coefficient w 0 is the truncated value of the regression line and n is the number of climate factors considered in this study the plsr approach was performed on the level of a 3 d drought event that had one or several temporal continuous drought clusters a classification regression method was adopted considering the large number of grid pixels in the 3 d drought event domain first for each cluster the drought grids were divided into 10 categories based on the 1 smapi value with equal intervals second the mean value of the standardized 1 smapi and the corresponding mean statistics of prep temp radi wind vpd anomaly for each category were calculated finally the obtained category based mean values for one drought event were utilized to construct the regression equation eq 4 regression coefficients and variable importance in projection vip scores for each climate factor were calculated the vip score is an indicator of the contribution of climate factor x k to sm droughts y and calculated as 5 vip n m 1 m λ m 2 ssy comp m m 1 m ssy comp m where λ 2 m is the squared pls weight of component m ssy comp m is the sum of squares of y explained by component m and m is the number of principle components 2 in this study the magnitude of the regression coefficients and their vips for each climate factor co determine their importance as drivers of sm droughts specifically for prep when the regression coefficient is positive and vip 1 0 it is regarded as an important driver of one sm drought event for temp radi wind vpd when the regression coefficient is negative and vip 1 0 it is considered as an important driver notably one sm drought event can be forced by one or more important drivers the driver with the largest vip value was the first most important driver to quantify the contribution of important climate drivers to sm drought we applied the contribution rate method li et al 2014 the contributions contribution weight can be calculated by 6 contribution weight w k k 1 n w k 100 the performance of the plsr can be generally evaluated using the correlation coefficient r 2 between the predicted and actual 1 smapi values for one event the larger the r 2 the better the performance of plsr and the more reliable the identification of important climate drivers 4 results 4 1 soil moisture drought events identified in a space time framework based on the space time synchronous drought identification approach 582 drought clusters and 226 drought events were identified in ea from 1979 to 2014 these events with their drought duration varied from 1 to 14 months drought area from 0 05 to 2 75 million km2 i e 1 4 76 of the study region and drought severity from 15 78 to 3568 the probability distributions of these three characteristic parameters for all identified events are presented in fig 2 although the more severe the drought the lower the probability of occurrence severe events with a drought duration of more than 6 months drought area over 1 million km2 28 of the whole study area and drought severity less than 1000 the more negative the value of severity the more severe the drought still approaches 7 5 17 of 226 of the total events specifically table 1 lists the top 20 severe sm drought events including their start and end times drought duration area and severity these identified events are supported by the literature e g haile et al 2019 masih et al 2014 nicholson 2014 funk et al 2013 and em dat database em dat 2018 detailed in table 1 drought events with their specific spatial reach cumulative intensity smapi and migration paths tracks over the duration are provided in fig 3 notably sm droughts can appear anywhere over the entire ea the southeast and northwest regions including somalia east kenya southeast tanzania and sudan are frequently affected by large scale and severe droughts in addition the spatial location of a drought generally changes over time the monthly displacements of drought clusters can reach hundreds of kilometres followed by the migration path track of one drought 4 2 spatial temporal patterns and variations of soil moisture droughts fig 4 overviews the spatial distribution of sm droughts in drought frequency represented by the number of drought events and the accumulated drought duration and severity the three drought parameters exhibited similar spatial patterns ea with its northwest and southeast regions more frequently 40 events experiences sm droughts with long lasting duration 80 months and a high order of severity in accumulation 15 for temporal accumulated smapi with a more negative value indicating greater severity drought clusters with their locations represented by drought cluster centroids could better reflect the spatial patterns of droughts fig 5 displays the drought cluster centroids together with their probability density both for the total period 1979 2014 and for all four boreal seasons of spring summer autumn and winter generally the highest drought probability with the densest cluster centroids occurred in the southeastern and northwestern regions this pattern is consistent with that of the accumulated drought characteristic parameters in fig 4 and is supported by anderson et al 2012 and mcnally et al 2016 the spatial patterns of the drought clusters showed seasonal differences in spring the drought clusters were distributed mainly in the northwest and sporadically in the southeast summer droughts became less frequent in the northwest but more frequent in the southeast and south in autumn droughts were again frequent in the northeast and also becomes frequent in the south but less frequent in the southeast winter droughts seem to be frequent in large regions over the southeast northwest of ea regarding temporal variations drought severity for the entire ea did not present a significant tendency p 0 05 from 1979 to 2014 although there was high interannual variability fig s2 however significant p 0 05 seasonal trends were observed particularly in the boreal summer and autumn fig 6 summer droughts were largely enhanced but autumn droughts were substantially weakened fig 6b and c similar results have been reported e g lyon and dewitt 2012 liebmann et al 2014 rowell et al 2015 winter droughts also decreased but not significantly p 0 05 spring droughts didnot show trends over time but have large interannual variability 4 3 climate drivers of soil moisture droughts the space time identification of droughts could reshape the development process of a drought event this is beneficial for the investigation of the driving forces of sm droughts based on the plsr approach the driving forces of the climate factors involved in precipitation and evapotranspiration processes that is precipitation prep surface air temperature temp downward radiation radi near surface wind speed wind and vapour pressure deficit vpd were explored within the 3 d space time continuous domain of sm drought events the delayed impacts of the aforementioned climate elements on sm droughts van loon and van lanen 2012 were accounted for based on their correlations with sm anomalies under different time lags and consequently a time lag of three months was adopted fig s3 fig 7 shows the proportion of sm drought events events with unidentified unknown drivers were not included caused by different climate drivers for both cases of the important driver fig 7a and the first important driver fig 7b generally most sm droughts are driven by one or a combination of two or three climatic factors fig 7a wind prep and radi are the first three important drivers of sm droughts in ea which is true for both the important driver and first important driver statistics the climate driver map for individual sm drought events is presented in fig 8 the important climate drivers vary significantly among the drought events in ea fig 8a there seems to be no spatial regularity however the large scale and severe sm droughts in southeast and northwest are mainly under the single combined forces of prep wind and radi fig 8a the dominance of prep wind and radi on sm droughts is more obvious in the first important climate driver map in fig 8b for the driving capability the contribution weight of the climate drivers see eq 6 for both the important drivers i e prep temp radi wind and vpd individually and the summarised weight of the important drivers for one event and the first important driver for all drought events is presented in fig 9 generally prep wind and radi have substantially higher contribution weight than temp and vpd highlighting the dominant role of prep wind and radi on sm droughts in ea in addition the comparatively high value mostly 38 68 of the summarised weight for the important drivers indicates the consistency between the identified important drivers and the corresponding strong driving capability the relatively low mostly 28 42 driving capacity of the first important driver suggests the inability of the first important drivers to explain the whole sm drought events 5 discussion 5 1 interpretation of spatial patterns of soil moisture droughts in ea the sm droughts are generally centred in the northwest and southeast this pattern is consistent with the spatial distributions of prep and temp fig 1c and d both are closely related to the topography of the ea fig 1a particularly for the temp because ea is within the deep tropics the spatial heterogeneity of temp is dominated by elevation similar to temp the prep of ea is also affected by topography to a large degree in addition prep is still highly affected by tropical circulation land atmosphere feedback and maritime influence funk et al 2014 nicholson 2017 sm droughts exhibit seasonal differences in their spatial patterns section 4 2 the high seasonal and interannual variability of the climate system are considered as the main driving forces of sm droughts haile 2005 among the climate elements that control sm dynamics i e prep temp radi wind and vpd which one ones is dominant here prep temp radi wind and vpd were further explored on their seasonal variation indicated by the seasonal average state and interannual variability represented by the temporal variation coefficient which is a measure of the deviation from the average state we found that the seasonal dynamics of sm drought patterns were generally consistent with those of the seasonal average state and the variation coefficient of prep figs 5 10 and fig 11 the drought prone regions are qualified with low but highly variable prep specifically the sm drought centre in the northwest of ea is qualified with considerably low 50 mm month and high variability 1 of rainfall in spring figs 10a 11a and 5a however in summer the low rainfall with high variation spreads over the southeast and south corresponding to high sm drought density figs 10b 11b and 5b in autumn the low and highly variable rainfall remains distributed in the southeast and south where the droughts clustered although it has weakened compared with summer in the northwest low and highly variable rainfall reappears and is accompanied by frequent sm droughts figs 10c 11c and 5c in winter low and highly variable rainfall prevails in large regions along the southeast northwest of ea with frequent sm droughts figs 10d 11d and 5d the considerably high consistency between the spatial patterns of prep and sm droughts suggests that the seasonal dynamics of sm droughts are mainly driven by prep the dominant role of prep in drought occurrence in ea is also supported by the findings of lyon 2014 and nicholson 2017 in addition temp also contributes to the formation of sm drought patterns in each season although it presents similar spatial patterns in the four boreal seasons and low variability in time figs 12 and s4 for example the high density of sm droughts in the northwest in spring is also related to the extremely high temp fig 12a the sm drought centre in the southeast in winter remains affected by high temp fig 12d overall the general long term spatial patterns of sm droughts were jointly controlled by prep and temp which can partly be considered a result of strongly marked orographic effects however the seasonal dynamics of the spatial patterns of sm droughts were predominantly controlled by prep and partly strengthened by temp 5 2 reasonability and uncertainty of the identified climate drivers for sm droughts prep wind and radi are the predominant drivers of sm droughts in ea based on the plsr approach the results indicate that sm droughts are under the control of both water and energy which is consistent with the significant role of sm in the water and energy cycles wanders et al 2014 most of the severe droughts in ea are attributed to the failure of the long rains nicholson 2017 funk et al 2018 which indicates the significance of prep in the occurrence and development of drought researches e g schreck and semazzi 2004 nicholson 2017 have elucidated the importance of zonal winds and low level circulations in seasonal drought forecasts indicating that wind is a pivotal driver of droughts in addition sm is closely related to the underlying evapotranspiration process which is energy driven radi is an effective indicator of the energy income from the atmosphere hence radi should be an important driver of sm droughts overall the three predominant drivers of sm droughts in ea identified based on the plsr approach are reasonable the performance indicator of the plsr that is the correlation coefficient r 2 between the predicted and the actual 1 smapi values for total 226 sm drought events demonstrates the reliability of the identified climate drivers fig 13a most 59 events qualified with a comparatively high r 2 value 0 5 compared with small droughts large scale severe events tended to have relatively low r 2 values fig 13b this suggests that the identified climate drivers for severe events likely bear more uncertainty this result is consistent with the actual situations large scale and severe droughts usually last several months to years during which climate elements strongly interact and drought propagation and recovery occur in different drought domains xu et al 2015 herrera estrada et al 2017 therefore large scale droughts are likely controlled by varying climate drivers during their long evolutionary processes lyon 2014 this increases the uncertainty of climate driver identification and makes drought prediction more difficult and complicated data quality of both sm and climate variables including prep temp radi wind and vpd are another limitation on climate driver exploration ea has been suffered from a lack of long term in situ meteorological and hydrological recorded data because of the sparse and unreliable local monitoring networks mu et al 2013 sheffield et al 2014 remotely sensed and reanalyzed data can fill the gaps while bearing unquantified errors the data errors further propagated to the determination of climate drivers which might be the reason for the unidentified unknown driver cases section 4 3 in addition to the vital role of climate forces on sm droughts human activities e g land use change might also contribute to drought occurrence neglecting human impacts may cause uncertainty in climate driver identification 6 conclusion this study investigated the sm droughts in ea from a space time joint perspective based on a merged dataset of remote sensing and land surface modelling the focus was on the spatiotemporal patterns and variations and the climate drivers of sm droughts the main results are as follows i a total of582 drought clusters and 226 drought events were recognised in ea from 1979 to 2014 based on the space time synchronous drought identification approach large and severe events with a drought duration of more than 6 months drought area over 1 million km2 and drought severity less than 1000 accounted for 7 5 these droughts appeared almost anywhere in ea with the southeast and northwest regions including somalia east kenya southeast tanzania and sudan being more prone be attacked spatially sm droughts presented a dual centre pattern in the northwest and southeast dominated by prep and temp which can be partly considered a result of the strongly marked orographic effects however this pattern displayed seasonal differences the seasonal dynamics of sm droughts were predominantly controlled by prep and were partly strengthened by temp temporally the seasonal sm droughts showed a clear tendency in summer and autumn with significant p 0 05 increasing and decreasing trends respectively ii most sm droughts are driven by one or a combination of two or three climate factors precipitation near surface wind speed and downward radiation were the top three important drivers based on the plsr approach applied in the space time continuous drought event domain large scale and severe droughts with their identified climate drivers tended to bear more uncertainty than those of small droughts the occurrence of large droughts is likely controlled by varying and intertangled climate drivers during the long evolutionary process thus it significantly increases the complexity and difficulty of drought prediction overall this study provides a comprehensive investigation of the spatiotemporal patterns and variations and the climate drivers of sm droughts in ea from a novel space time i e 3 d perspective the seasonal dynamics of the drought spatial patterns were interpreted based on climate variability the climate drivers of sm droughts were explored at the level of a 3 d individual drought event this innovative work could deepen the knowledge on the formation and development mechanism of sm drought in ea and serve as an important implication for early warning and future drought prediction additionally the neglected human impacts on sm droughts may introduce certain uncertainties to the exploration of climate drivers the topic of our further work credit authorship contribution statement liu yongwei undertook the major work of this study including conceptualization methodology

8013,study region the ephemeral notwane river catchment nrc is situated in semi arid southeast se botswana it is part of the ramotswa transboundary dolomitic aquifer rtbda in the limpopo basin shared by botswana and south africa study focus stable isotopic composition of deuterium 2h and oxygen 18o of the water molecule and water chemistry of groundwater and surface water gw and sw including rainfall samples were used to assess gw sw interactions in the nrc in addition the seasonal effects on gw sw interactions were also evaluated as such sample collection excursions were timed to coincide with the wet and dry seasons respectively new hydrological insights for the region gw and sw were found to have similar chemical characteristics the major ions in both water types were ca2 and hco 3 in both the dry and wet season there was a clear inverse relationship between ground relief and or elevation and the concentration of chloride ions mg l and electrical conductivity µs cm that is higher concentrations of chlorine were measured downstream compared to upstream and vice versa the same trend was manifested for ec levels overall the data indicated the existence of some highly active groundwater recharge sites along the notwane river that may be responsible for the aquifer recharge during above normal rainfall events in addition the data revealed albeit inconclusively that gw sw interactions in the nrc are likely to be influenced by an interplay of several factors such as a the difference in water levels between the river and the adjacent groundwater table b the hydrogeology and location of the river channel because geologic formations such as faults and karsts play a critical role in gw sw interactions karsts are known to support groundwater recharge which is different from the nearby semi arid kalahari region where recharge is driven by soil profile keywords botswana groundwater surface water interactions notwane river catchment recharge stable isotopes 1 introduction in arid semi arid regions ephemeral streams are thought of as providing key hydrological path way mechanisms capable of contributing to the overall groundwater recharge costa et al 2012 cuthbert et al 2019 keppel and renard 1962 lerner et al 1990 mccallum et al 2013 wang et al 2014 this is against the background that in these regions groundwater abstraction is usually high and expected to increase tremendously given the ever increasing demand for water resources which may often lead to progressive aquifer degradation ali rahmani et al 2017 falkenmark et al 2003 for instance botswana has an estimated extractable volume of 100 000 mm3 arntzen and setlhogile 2007 khupe 1994 however there are great uncertainties in the amount of rainfall that can be recharged meanwhile the total groundwater supplied to the lobatse management center which includes the study area has been estimated at 4066 mm3 per annum department of water affairs 2017 this then shows the potential for a regional over abstraction and worse still the trend towards outright over exploitation of water resources in botswana indications are that this situation is likely to worsen in the future because water demand is projected to rise center for applied research and department of water affairs 2014 compounding to this problem is the climate change phenomenon which is expected to exacerbate the existing pressure on groundwater resources especially in arid semi arid regions bates et al 2008 engelbrecht et al 2015 for example the annual rainfall for botswana is projected to decrease by 5 10 this is according to projections generated using the ipcc s multi model data set mmd under scenario a1b special emissions scenario which considers 21 models datasets for southern africa christensen et al 2007 ipcc 2007 similarly the annual rainfall occurrences are projected to decrease by 1 4 in contrast to an estimated increment in rainfall intensity of 4 12 nkemelang et al 2018 these variations in the local rainfall patterns are likely to impact negatively on the hydrological response in particular groundwater recharge overall research focused on groundwater surface water interactions gw sw in ephemeral streams has not received favorable interest compared to gw sw interactions under perennial streamflow conditions jarihani et al 2015 the reasons for this knowledge gap are still unclear therefore a holistic research approach is necessary to attain a full understanding of gw sw interactions it is of essence in order to effectively manage water resources appreciate the degree and extent of gw sw interactions characterize water availability for dryland vegetation understand climate gw interactions including a full understanding of the geochemical processing of nutrients and contaminants within the hyporheic zone of ephemeral stream systems belnap et al 2005 cuthbert et al 2019 kalbus et al 2006 meixner et al 2007 quichimbo et al 2020 sargeant and singer 2016 singer et al 2016 snyder and williams 2000 sophocleous 2002 valett et al 1990 winter et al 1998 to this end gw sw interactions can be assessed evaluated using several approaches for example at the local scale where specific infiltration sites are identified within a river system or at the regional scale where the entire regional river system comprising of several reaches is assessed xu et al 2008 and at the sub catchment scale level where several different streams tributaries are assessed barthel and banzhaf 2016 these approaches often use a variety of measurement instruments such as seepage meters brodie et al 2007 2009 cherkauer and mcbride 1988 lee and hynes 1978 river bed piezometers baxter et al 2003 time series temperature measurements and hydrological modeling approaches quichimbo et al 2020 2021 schreiner mcgraw et al 2019 stonestrom and constantz 2003 a promising technique is the use of environmental tracers such as stable isotopes which are usually determined using commercially available field and benchtop instruments such as liquid water isotope analyzers and isotope ratio dilution mass spectrometers etc bertrand et al 2014 crandall et al 1999 fontes 1980 kendall et al 1995 mccarthy et al 1992 turner et al 1987 normally the data obtained in this way is complemented by additional determination of major cations and anions in the same samples qin et al 2017 somaratne et al 2016 isotopic techniques in particular the measurement of 2h and 18o of a water molecule are the most preferred approaches to identify and quantify gw recharge flow interconnections between aquifers and the sources and mechanism of pollution aggarwal et al 2009 in this approach the content of stable isotopes for deuterium 2h and oxygen 18o or any other abundant isotopic element e g 13c 15n etc in a water sample i e surface water groundwater etc is determined beforehand and then followed up by a simple calculation to determine isotopic ratios in that way the source of recharge rainfall riverbed seepage etc can be easily identified aggarwal et al 2009 mazor 2004 pang et al 2011 for example isotopic signatures for rainfall precipitation events can be easily identified by their peculiar fractionations and mixing with native water bodies gibson et al 2020 kirkels et al 2020 stephens and rose 2005 the isotopic data is then reported in units or alternatively as δ to denote the deviation from the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as shown in eq 1 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where r sample is the ratio of the isotopic species 18o 16o or 2h 1h in the sample or standard craig 1961 overall the approaches of estimating gw sw interactions are numerous and vary a great deal however a more promising strategy is to utilize a multi method approach such as using insights from stable isotopic data and for instance hydrochemical data to identify and or reveal exchanges if any between gw and sw anuard et al 2019 liu et al 2006 oyarzún et al 2016 shamsuddin et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 indeed 2h and 18o have been widely used as environmental tracers in studies pertaining to gw sw interactions especially when the objective is to accurately estimate the extent of evaporation and determine water provenance and or origin at various scales ranging from small to large catchments cai et al 2020 levy and xu 2012 alternatively interpretation of these data may be extended to study water availability to vegetation this was adequately proven by dawson and ehleringer 1991 1993 dawson and hinton 2003 who successfully used the 2h 18o ratio to demonstrate the tendency of preference for deep gw sources over stream water by mature rooted riparian trees possibly as a survival strategy to evade moisture competition by other riparian tree species in addition snyder and williams 2000 concluded that the different water sources used by tree species has important connotations implications on the forest water balance while sargeant and singer 2016 postulated an all embracing quantitative framework to harmonize the divergence of the many quantitative frameworks that are currently in use and or recommended on this subject regarding botswana a considerable amount of work has been carried out in the kalahari region where the main objective was to characterize the gw recharge dynamics de vries et al 2000 mazor et al 1974 1977 selaolo 1998 notwithstanding this data pertaining to sw percolation rates are still lacking in fact there are none in the public domain pertaining to the study area i e nrc except for instances where the use of environmental tracers e g pollutants of anthropogenic provenance such as pesticides and metabolites have been highly recommended as potential indicators of gw sw interactions table 1 summarizes the data available thus far and the lack of information on gw sw interactions in the nrc formed basis for this work against this background this study sought to investigate gw sw interactions and their possible implications on both quality and quantity of water in the nrc using stable isotopes and other hydrochemical parameters therefore the objectives are to a investigate the seasonal dynamics such as high flows and effects of storms on gw sw interactions in the nrc b determine how gw sw interactions influence the evolution of groundwater chemistry nutrients and contamination in the aquifer and c identify and quantify areas with potential hydrological pathways that could facilitate gw sw interactions along the ephemeral notwane river in southeastern botswana 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is situated in the ramotswa wellfield located in semi arid southeastern botswana and forms part of the nrc in the lower limpopo basin fig 1 the notwane river which transects the study area is the main ephemeral tributary for the gaborone dam which supplies the capital city gaborone and its peripheral areas the climate in the study area can be described as semi arid and is characterized by summer rainfall october april with annual amounts that range between 475 and 525 mm fig 2 and maximum summer temperatures ranging between 20 and 40 ºc matlhodi et al 2019 rainfall in this area is mostly sporadic intense unreliable and in most cases accompanied by hailstorms winter season is the driest and lasts only three months may july characterized by low temperatures with 0 ºc being the extreme lowest ever recorded the current phenomenon of prolonged droughts such as the one experienced between 2013 and 2016 is obviously the main driver of inadequate reservoir replenishment and may possibly expedite drying up of reservoirs a detailed hydrogeological context for the study area has been described by altchenko et al 2017 of greater lithological importance to the study area is its location on a basin made up of two primary aquifers known as the ramotswa transboundary aquifer and lephala aquifer systems fig 3 a large part of the study area is dominated by the ramotswa transboundary dolomitic aquifer rtbda which consists of dolomites and quarzites while the lephala aquifer found to the southern end of the study area is dominated by shales quartzites and conglomerates staudt and vogel 2004 fig 4 is the piezometry map that shows among others the gw flow direction and levels in meters above mean sea level for the study area as can be seen the flow is in a north north eastern direction following the main gradient as well as the course of the ephemeral notwane river the conceptual model for the study area is shown in fig 5 briefly the main inflow is hypothesized to originate from the notwane ephemeral stream altchenko et al 2017 ranganai et al 2001 staudt and vogel 2004 while the outflow is mainly via abstraction of gw through boreholes and gw evapotranspiration however the model does not account for potential sources such as leakages from sewer pipes and effluent discharge based on the assumption that their contribution to gw is negligible 2 2 sampling design water samples were collected from existing boreholes coded g1 g7 for gw situated along the notwane river the boreholes are designated as observation and or monitoring boreholes and are managed by the department of water and sanitation dws surface water samples were collected in the notwane river at locations coded s1 s7 fig 3 illustrates a close up view of the sampling points the sampling task comprised of two expeditions one in the wet and the other in the dry season complete with geographical reference points the wet season sampling coincided with the hottest and yet wettest month of november 2019 see rainfall data in fig 2 conversely the dry season s sampling coincided with the driest months in may and august 2 3 sampling protocol and handling of samples generally sampling protocols followed procedures described in stephens and rose 2005 briefly precleaned 1 l polyethylene bottles were used to collect samples initially bottles were thoroughly rinsed with ultrapure water millipore milford ma usa then rinsed repeatedly with the intended sample and subsequently filled ensuring minimal headspace void i e to reduce interaction with air and bacterial activity each borehole was purged for 1 hr to ensure destratification of the bore water especially for boreholes with high water levels to promote mixing and subsequently to collect a more representative sample samples intended for cations analyses were acidified to ph 2 using 1 ml of 15 nitric acid hno3 to minimize ligand complexation all samples were placed in an insulated box containing ice packs and transported to the laboratory for processing within 24 hrs this was possible because sampling excursions always coincided with instrument availability pre analysis sample processing entailed vacuum filtering using 2 7 µm 47 mm followed by 0 45 µm 25 mm gf d glass microfiber filters whatman maidstone england to remove suspended solids the laboratory work for the analyses of stable isotopes was performed at two south african universities the university of witwatersrand for processing of wet season samples and the university of cape town for processing of dry season samples in all instances the same sample points were maintained in all sampling expeditions temperature and electrical conductivity ec were measured on site and values are presented in table 2 precipitation or rainfall sampling entailed funneling rain drops into 500 ml precleaned polyethylene bottles fitted with a wide diameter funnel and placed in the open during a rainfall event until full the samples acquired here were coded p1 and p2 respectively 2 4 analytical procedures 2 4 1 isotope analysis the isotope ratios of deuterium 2h h2o and oxygen 18o h2o of the water samples section 2 3 were determined using los gatos research lgr liquid water isotope analyzer model 45 ep situated at the department of geology university of the witwatersrand south africa these were samples collected during the wet season the obtained data were converted to per mil delta values δ against the v smow in accordance with eq 1 the dry season s samples were assayed in the same way except that they were processed at the department of archeology university of cape town where a different stable isotope analyzer was used instrument availability necessitated this variation in approaches in this instance a deltaxp dual inlet gas source mass spectrometer was used following a procedure by dunn and carter 2018 the average precision for the obtained data in both instruments was 1 2 4 2 determination of cations and anions an agilent 4210 micro plasma atomic emission spectroscopy mp aes was used for the determination of ca2 na mg2 and k in water samples the instrument settings flow rate torch temperature were set up for the best sensitivity and calibration was achieved using a 7 point calibration curve comprising of analytes in the range 0 5 5 ppm the instruments repeatability and reproducibility were deemed adequate for this study anions were analyzed at the department of water and sanitation using metrohm ion chromatography 850 professional system equipped with a conductivity flow cell detector separation of anions hco 3 cl so2 4 and co 3 was achieved using an ion exchanger column metrosep a supp 5 150 40 maintained at 300 c using a mobile phase comprising of 10 mm sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate the flow rate was maintained at 0 7 ml min for the entire run 2 4 3 field analyses physico chemical parameters ph temperature and ec were measured on site during sampling this was achieved using a multi meter oakton pcstestr 35 capable of obtaining ph temperature and electrical conductivity simultaneously in a single determination and or measurement measurements were performed according to the manufacturer s recommended protocol 2 5 data curation analysis and presentation 2 5 1 stable isotopes a simple δ18o versus δ2h plot is a widely used method to visualize gw sw interactions the theory of using stable isotopes as environmental tracers has been explained elsewhere in the manuscript in accordance with eqs 1 and 2 craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 gat 1996 2 5 2 major ion chemistry 2 5 2 1 piper diagram piper diagrams were used for graphical representations of the water quality data these were created using an open source software known as gw chart which is described in detail in winston 2000 2 5 2 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hca hierarchical cluster analysis hca is a widely accepted statistical method used to determine similar groups of cases using each group s measured characteristics zhang et al 2017 zolfaghari et al 2019 several studies have utilized multivariate statistical approaches such as hca to identify gw sw facies and processes with success güler and thyne 2004 mcneil et al 2005 cloutier et al 2008 woocay and walton 2008 raiber et al 2012 tatou et al 2017 and it was used for the same purpose in this study 3 results the results for the determination of isotopic species in both wet and dry season samples including hydrochemical data are presented in table 2 borehole water levels are reported in terms of meters below ground level mbgl which may be indicative of the water level in the aquifer system under consideration 3 1 characterization of precipitation induced isotopic composition the influence of rainfall on the overall isotopic composition was evaluated based on a total of four 4 precipitation events two 2 of which were experimental measurements recorded november 2019 and an additional two 2 events obtained in the form of secondary data from a previous study by baqa 2017 while this sampling frequency may be considered inadequate to provide a comprehensive understanding of the overall rainfall induced isotopic composition a contrary proof of concept has been established indicating that in fact insightful generalizations may still be obtained using fewer data points shamsuddin et al 2018 in much the same way shamsuddin and co workers successfully characterized rainfall induced isotopic signatures in the lower muda river basin malaysia using data obtained from only five 5 precipitation events shamsuddin et al 2018 as already stated data were collected during negligible rainfall events 30 mm in 2019 and supplemented with additional two secondary data sets baqa 2017 where measurements were obtained during above average hailstorms at a location situated further upstream 25 41972 s and 25 81735 e in the nrc fig 6a since no isotope monitoring data pertaining to the nrc are available the obtained experimental isotopic precipitation values were compared and validated against a web based algorithm platform online isotopes in precipitation calculator based on the work by bowen 2017 the experimental values obtained for δ2h ranged from 59 12 for δ2h and 0 4 to 9 4 for δ18o compared to the predicted ranges of 3 0 2 and 11 3 for δ2h and δ18o respectively notably there is a clear disagreement between the two data sets experimental versus predicted which may be ascribed to an interplay of several factors chiefly of which is the unreliability and lack of precision in prediction algorithms and probably the differences between the data sets briefly the data indicate conclusively that the experimental precipitation measurements fall outside the estimated predicted annual isotopic composition range this disparity may be ascribed to the vast and unpredictable spatio temporal variations in the rain forming mechanisms which are mostly endemic to semi arid regions craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 plots of δ18o versus δ2h were constructed using the lobatse and the global meteoric local meteoric water lines l and gmwl as references because the meteoric water line for the study area is not yet calculated partly due to the limited isotope monitoring work in this catchment the rationale for this choice of data is the proximity of lobatse 73 km south of nrc to the sampling points therefore not much variation was expected in fact the lmwl is already known and is represented according to eq 2 talma and van wyk 2013 2 δ d 6 4 δ 18 o 6 7 3 2 δ18o δ2h composition and major ion composition along the notwane river the δ2h values for surface water across sampling sites for both seasons are in the ranges 9 4 to 4 3 compared to 3 4 to 2 0 for δ18o seasonal comparison of isotopic composition data averaged according to sampling sites show negligible and or no net season induced differences for δ2h and δ18o respectively briefly δ2h was measured at 6 6 6 6 for the dry wet seasons respectively similarly δ18o was recorded as 2 1 2 5 for the dry wet seasons respectively table 2 subsequent comparison of seasonal data based on δ18o versus δ2h plots shows a tendency of clustering of data points along the lmwl and gmwl for both isotopes with partial exception of the wet season data for δ18o also noticeable is the establishment of the local evaporation line lel for isotopes in the wet season fig 6c the hydrochemistry for surface water samples collected in the dry season and assessed according to concentration mg l of major cations show the following trend ca2 na mg2 k in contrast to mg2 ca2 na k for samples collected in the wet season thus in the dry season the surface water is dominated by ca2 ions which were measured at 6 3 9 1 7 8 mg l for minimum maximum mean ca2 values respectively in contrast the wet season data reveal a slight loss in concentration of ca2 ions likely due to rainfall dilution and a net gain in the concentration of mg2 ions suggesting that rainwater may contain significantly higher concentration of mg2 ions all this is shown by the swapping of positions of ca2 and mg2 ions in the concentration rankings shown above a similar concentration ranking for anions determined in the dry and wet season samples is in the order hco 3 cl so2 4 co 3 if concentrations of the dominant ions ca2 hco3 are considered then the surface water samples can be entirely classified as ca hco3 water type fig 7 3 3 δ18o δ2h temperature and major ion composition of groundwater in the nrc the minimum maximum average temperature values measured in groundwater samples for the dry season samples were 22 9 25 5 24 3 c respectively the values did not differ markedly with measurements for the samples collected in the wet season 24 9 26 7 26 1 c for min max average temperature values respectively regarding surface water slightly higher temperatures were measured in the wet season as compared to dry season for the wet season the min max average temperatures were as follows 23 8 25 6 25 3 c respectively and 22 9 27 2 24 8 c for the dry season the rest of the data is shown in table 2 the δ2h content for groundwater across sampling sites in both seasons fluctuates between 30 1 to 10 8 and pooled averages of 21 4 23 1 for the dry wet seasons respectively this contrasts with the δ18o content of 5 1 1 4 min max values and pooled averages of 3 7 3 7 for the dry wet seasons respectively interestingly the hydrochemistry data for groundwater samples agrees remarkably well with the data obtained for surface water section 3 2 in this instance the characterization of the major cations and anions shows a similar concentration based trend mg l ca2 mg2 na k and hco 3 cl so2 4 co 3 note data presented here are for both seasons on this basis groundwater can be classified into two distinct water types ca hco3 type which accounts for 86 of the total samples analyzed and the ca mg cl type representing 14 of the total samples analyzed fig 7 this may be true considering that sampling site g6 is a borehole that recorded the highest value of ec µs cm and previously identified with high levels of nitrate nitrogen no3 n mcgill 2019 and is also part of these samples 4 discussion 4 1 hydrochemical and isotopic composition of water in the nrc 4 1 1 δ18o and δ2h composition of rainfall in general it was observed that the δ2h composition was inversely proportional to rainfall intensity in that higher and or intense precipitation events lead to δ2h depletion in contrast to δ2h enrichment during weaker and less intense precipitation events fig 6a hailstorms undergo less fractionation than rainwater due to the differences in phase properties between water and ice mazor 2003 similarly lower ambient temperatures experienced during cloud formation and evaporation of rain droplets are both responsible for the amount effect phenomenon as previously articulated by dansgaard 1964 and mazor 2003 our results agree with this principle 4 1 2 δ18o and δ2h composition of surface water generally it can be concluded that atmospheric precipitation is the main source of surface water recharge in the nrc in arid semi arid regions surface water bodies are isotopically enriched due to higher evaporation rates and fractionation processes caused by high temperatures making it possible to distinguish them from other potential sources of recharge mazor 2003 zhu et al 2016 our data show a slight seasonal variability in the composition of δ18o as a function of seasons dry wet seasons this may be ascribed to an interplay of several factors chief of which is the amount effect mazor 2003 for instance heavy downpours during the wet season may prevent part of the precipitation isotopes from returning to the background value conversely the dry season normally characterized by low precipitation events promotes isotopic enrichment due to evaporation an ideal environment that promotes precipitation isotopes to rebound to higher background conditions 4 1 3 changes in hydrochemical and isotopic composition of groundwater a plot of δ18o versus δ2h fig 6b and d reveals two conflicting scenarios relating to groundwater recharge on one hand the experimental data points are superimposed into the mwl shown by dotted circle fig 6d an indication of a comparatively lower evaporation and fractionation rate in water prior to recharge during high precipitation events and also reveals highly active recharge sites with enhanced rapid infiltration and or fast rapid watershed response to flood events on the other hand clear evidence of a possibility of recharge is revealed as shown by a linear deviation of data points evaporation line from the reference gmwl it also indicates the possibility of the presence of a much slower groundwater recharge infiltration site this hypothesis may be true considering the proximity of sampling points to the river channel i e sampling boreholes were located 2 2500 m closest furthest respectively in dryland regions overland flow is high due to low infiltration so channel flow may dominate recharge during intense storms goodrich et al 1997 singer and michaelides 2017 the rest of the data relating to sampling points relative to the river channel are summarized in table 3 supplementary data the results further reveal high ionic strength variable in these groundwater samples compared to surface water samples fig 7 this has resulted in most surface samples forming a cluster beneath the groundwater samples indicating a slight difference in ionic strength of the two waters this was expected since rock water interactions and dissolution of the dolomite during infiltration can increase the ionic strength of groundwater lakshmanan and kannan 2007 4 1 4 implications of gw sw interactions on nutrients and contamination the results of multivariate cluster analysis are presented in fig 8 briefly the analysis represents a two clustered data output i e cluster a is predominantly surface water samples which are low in cl content and cluster b is groundwater samples which are high in cl content as may be seen the main feature of differentiation between these datasets is the cl content for instance sampling boreholes in this cluster g3 g6 and g7 measured up to 110 246 mg l chlorine the high concentrations of chlorine ions may be ascribed to the fact that sampling site g3 is located within the village and in close proximity to pit latrines while site g6 is located within a productive irrigated farm and site g7 is in close proximity to a wastewater stabilization ponds then the elevated cl content may emanate from the anthropogenic activities in the vicinity of these sampling sites e g chlorine which is a well known household disinfectant with the potential to cause groundwater pollution groundwater pollution in some of these boreholes have been reported in previous studies dwa 2000 mcgill et al 2019 the same trend is exhibited by the ec levels across the same boreholes discussed above in addition a distinctive trend is observed in which ec levels are significantly higher in downstream boreholes compared to upstream boreholes fig 9a and b it is evident that the distribution of pollutants is promoted by the direction of water flow paths staudt and vogel 2004 in the same way the ec content may be linked to anthropogenic activities because most parts of this aquifer system are being exploited for socio economic activities 4 2 implications of changes in isotopic composition on gw sw interactions previously there have been uncertainties regarding the actual recharge mechanisms in the ephemeral notwane river altchenko et al 2017 and this study provides new findings on the actual gw sw interactions using seasonal stable isotope and hydrochemical data in a semi arid environment unlike other regions where recharge is by direct infiltration the recharge mechanism in the nrc is dominated by the streambed recharge which may be influenced by several factors such as the differences in the water levels between the river systems and adjacent groundwater table and geologic formations such as faults and karsts which play a role in promoting gw sw interactions as already noted karsts provide hydrological pathways that facilitate recharge to this end most studies on this subject in botswana have been focused on the kalahari region boocock and van straten 1961 1962 bredenkamp and vogel 1974 de vries and von hoyer 1988 mazor 1974 selaolo 1998 which is predominantly characterized by direct infiltration recharge to the best of our knowledge there is no previous study that focused on gw sw interactions in the nrc 4 3 hydrochemistry and stable isotope relationship on gw sw in the study area the interpretation of results based on concentrations of major ions generally indicate that both gw and sw belong to a common water type ca hco3 this is shown in fig 7 where 26 of the 28 gw sw samples both wet and dry season plotted in the ca hco3 facies while one sample plotted in the mixed facies and the other one plotted borderline between mixed and ca hco3 type the dominance of ca2 mg2 and hco 3 in gw sw samples was expected since these ions are normally part of the dolomites make up as already reported by beukes 1987 and dawson and hinton 2003 both results for major ions and stable isotopes indicate conclusively that recharge in the nrc originates from the riverbed likely during high flows and floods this is further illustrated in fig 6b and d which shows active recharge sites within the river system interestingly the isotopic compositions of all gw samples were plotted along the meteoric water line and were generally isotopically depleted an indication of fast recharge rates during river flow furthermore both gw and sw samples displayed a narrow range of the δ18o stable isotope which may signify similarity in the spatial extent and evaporation conditions as these samples were collected in the same geographic area fig 7 this then means that groundwater is closely related to streamflow but due to the reaction with oxygen bearing minerals in the carbonate rock there is a slight enrichment of groundwater with δ18o in summary the utilization of stable environmental tracers 2h and 18o and hydrochemistry data have unambiguously demonstrated that the gw sw interactions in the nrc are driven by recharge sites located along the ephemeral notwane river and that aquifer recharge is highly likely during high river flows 5 conclusion this study s main aim was to investigate gw sw interactions dynamics and their possible implications on the quality and quantity of water in the karst dolomite dominated notwane river catchment nrc in the south eastern part of botswana with the view of advancing knowledge of groundwater resources in the study area findings from the study indicate that there are some highly active groundwater recharge areas along the ephemeral notwane river that recharges the aquifer during periods of high flows like flooding these sites are perceived to indicate the possibility of a rapid infiltration due to rapid watershed response to flood events in the study area influenced by geological formations such as karst dolomites which are dominant these recharge sites are also considered to be hydrological pathways which may contribute to pollutants entering the groundwater system hence highlighting the vulnerability of the aquifer to pollution groundwater ec composition in the study area was found to increase in value and or concentration from upstream toward downstream location and mostly following groundwater flow paths these revelations are deemed important in that the identified sites locations could be used as targets for aquifer protection and or remediation measures to reduce prevent future groundwater contamination in the area in summary findings from this study have shown the importance of ephemeral streams and their contribution to groundwater replenishment in drylands the potential contaminants transported through preferential path flows and their implications on the water resources of the nrc these provide an opportunity for the development of comprehensive frameworks to protect the ephemeral streams and aquifers from anthropogenic activities that may aide groundwater pollution in the nrc and similar environments the study recommends a long term strategy to monitor environmental isotopes from precipitation and groundwater in both upstream and downstream areas to add on to the existing water level monitoring credit authorship contribution statement modie l t

8013,study region the ephemeral notwane river catchment nrc is situated in semi arid southeast se botswana it is part of the ramotswa transboundary dolomitic aquifer rtbda in the limpopo basin shared by botswana and south africa study focus stable isotopic composition of deuterium 2h and oxygen 18o of the water molecule and water chemistry of groundwater and surface water gw and sw including rainfall samples were used to assess gw sw interactions in the nrc in addition the seasonal effects on gw sw interactions were also evaluated as such sample collection excursions were timed to coincide with the wet and dry seasons respectively new hydrological insights for the region gw and sw were found to have similar chemical characteristics the major ions in both water types were ca2 and hco 3 in both the dry and wet season there was a clear inverse relationship between ground relief and or elevation and the concentration of chloride ions mg l and electrical conductivity µs cm that is higher concentrations of chlorine were measured downstream compared to upstream and vice versa the same trend was manifested for ec levels overall the data indicated the existence of some highly active groundwater recharge sites along the notwane river that may be responsible for the aquifer recharge during above normal rainfall events in addition the data revealed albeit inconclusively that gw sw interactions in the nrc are likely to be influenced by an interplay of several factors such as a the difference in water levels between the river and the adjacent groundwater table b the hydrogeology and location of the river channel because geologic formations such as faults and karsts play a critical role in gw sw interactions karsts are known to support groundwater recharge which is different from the nearby semi arid kalahari region where recharge is driven by soil profile keywords botswana groundwater surface water interactions notwane river catchment recharge stable isotopes 1 introduction in arid semi arid regions ephemeral streams are thought of as providing key hydrological path way mechanisms capable of contributing to the overall groundwater recharge costa et al 2012 cuthbert et al 2019 keppel and renard 1962 lerner et al 1990 mccallum et al 2013 wang et al 2014 this is against the background that in these regions groundwater abstraction is usually high and expected to increase tremendously given the ever increasing demand for water resources which may often lead to progressive aquifer degradation ali rahmani et al 2017 falkenmark et al 2003 for instance botswana has an estimated extractable volume of 100 000 mm3 arntzen and setlhogile 2007 khupe 1994 however there are great uncertainties in the amount of rainfall that can be recharged meanwhile the total groundwater supplied to the lobatse management center which includes the study area has been estimated at 4066 mm3 per annum department of water affairs 2017 this then shows the potential for a regional over abstraction and worse still the trend towards outright over exploitation of water resources in botswana indications are that this situation is likely to worsen in the future because water demand is projected to rise center for applied research and department of water affairs 2014 compounding to this problem is the climate change phenomenon which is expected to exacerbate the existing pressure on groundwater resources especially in arid semi arid regions bates et al 2008 engelbrecht et al 2015 for example the annual rainfall for botswana is projected to decrease by 5 10 this is according to projections generated using the ipcc s multi model data set mmd under scenario a1b special emissions scenario which considers 21 models datasets for southern africa christensen et al 2007 ipcc 2007 similarly the annual rainfall occurrences are projected to decrease by 1 4 in contrast to an estimated increment in rainfall intensity of 4 12 nkemelang et al 2018 these variations in the local rainfall patterns are likely to impact negatively on the hydrological response in particular groundwater recharge overall research focused on groundwater surface water interactions gw sw in ephemeral streams has not received favorable interest compared to gw sw interactions under perennial streamflow conditions jarihani et al 2015 the reasons for this knowledge gap are still unclear therefore a holistic research approach is necessary to attain a full understanding of gw sw interactions it is of essence in order to effectively manage water resources appreciate the degree and extent of gw sw interactions characterize water availability for dryland vegetation understand climate gw interactions including a full understanding of the geochemical processing of nutrients and contaminants within the hyporheic zone of ephemeral stream systems belnap et al 2005 cuthbert et al 2019 kalbus et al 2006 meixner et al 2007 quichimbo et al 2020 sargeant and singer 2016 singer et al 2016 snyder and williams 2000 sophocleous 2002 valett et al 1990 winter et al 1998 to this end gw sw interactions can be assessed evaluated using several approaches for example at the local scale where specific infiltration sites are identified within a river system or at the regional scale where the entire regional river system comprising of several reaches is assessed xu et al 2008 and at the sub catchment scale level where several different streams tributaries are assessed barthel and banzhaf 2016 these approaches often use a variety of measurement instruments such as seepage meters brodie et al 2007 2009 cherkauer and mcbride 1988 lee and hynes 1978 river bed piezometers baxter et al 2003 time series temperature measurements and hydrological modeling approaches quichimbo et al 2020 2021 schreiner mcgraw et al 2019 stonestrom and constantz 2003 a promising technique is the use of environmental tracers such as stable isotopes which are usually determined using commercially available field and benchtop instruments such as liquid water isotope analyzers and isotope ratio dilution mass spectrometers etc bertrand et al 2014 crandall et al 1999 fontes 1980 kendall et al 1995 mccarthy et al 1992 turner et al 1987 normally the data obtained in this way is complemented by additional determination of major cations and anions in the same samples qin et al 2017 somaratne et al 2016 isotopic techniques in particular the measurement of 2h and 18o of a water molecule are the most preferred approaches to identify and quantify gw recharge flow interconnections between aquifers and the sources and mechanism of pollution aggarwal et al 2009 in this approach the content of stable isotopes for deuterium 2h and oxygen 18o or any other abundant isotopic element e g 13c 15n etc in a water sample i e surface water groundwater etc is determined beforehand and then followed up by a simple calculation to determine isotopic ratios in that way the source of recharge rainfall riverbed seepage etc can be easily identified aggarwal et al 2009 mazor 2004 pang et al 2011 for example isotopic signatures for rainfall precipitation events can be easily identified by their peculiar fractionations and mixing with native water bodies gibson et al 2020 kirkels et al 2020 stephens and rose 2005 the isotopic data is then reported in units or alternatively as δ to denote the deviation from the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as shown in eq 1 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where r sample is the ratio of the isotopic species 18o 16o or 2h 1h in the sample or standard craig 1961 overall the approaches of estimating gw sw interactions are numerous and vary a great deal however a more promising strategy is to utilize a multi method approach such as using insights from stable isotopic data and for instance hydrochemical data to identify and or reveal exchanges if any between gw and sw anuard et al 2019 liu et al 2006 oyarzún et al 2016 shamsuddin et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 indeed 2h and 18o have been widely used as environmental tracers in studies pertaining to gw sw interactions especially when the objective is to accurately estimate the extent of evaporation and determine water provenance and or origin at various scales ranging from small to large catchments cai et al 2020 levy and xu 2012 alternatively interpretation of these data may be extended to study water availability to vegetation this was adequately proven by dawson and ehleringer 1991 1993 dawson and hinton 2003 who successfully used the 2h 18o ratio to demonstrate the tendency of preference for deep gw sources over stream water by mature rooted riparian trees possibly as a survival strategy to evade moisture competition by other riparian tree species in addition snyder and williams 2000 concluded that the different water sources used by tree species has important connotations implications on the forest water balance while sargeant and singer 2016 postulated an all embracing quantitative framework to harmonize the divergence of the many quantitative frameworks that are currently in use and or recommended on this subject regarding botswana a considerable amount of work has been carried out in the kalahari region where the main objective was to characterize the gw recharge dynamics de vries et al 2000 mazor et al 1974 1977 selaolo 1998 notwithstanding this data pertaining to sw percolation rates are still lacking in fact there are none in the public domain pertaining to the study area i e nrc except for instances where the use of environmental tracers e g pollutants of anthropogenic provenance such as pesticides and metabolites have been highly recommended as potential indicators of gw sw interactions table 1 summarizes the data available thus far and the lack of information on gw sw interactions in the nrc formed basis for this work against this background this study sought to investigate gw sw interactions and their possible implications on both quality and quantity of water in the nrc using stable isotopes and other hydrochemical parameters therefore the objectives are to a investigate the seasonal dynamics such as high flows and effects of storms on gw sw interactions in the nrc b determine how gw sw interactions influence the evolution of groundwater chemistry nutrients and contamination in the aquifer and c identify and quantify areas with potential hydrological pathways that could facilitate gw sw interactions along the ephemeral notwane river in southeastern botswana 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is situated in the ramotswa wellfield located in semi arid southeastern botswana and forms part of the nrc in the lower limpopo basin fig 1 the notwane river which transects the study area is the main ephemeral tributary for the gaborone dam which supplies the capital city gaborone and its peripheral areas the climate in the study area can be described as semi arid and is characterized by summer rainfall october april with annual amounts that range between 475 and 525 mm fig 2 and maximum summer temperatures ranging between 20 and 40 ºc matlhodi et al 2019 rainfall in this area is mostly sporadic intense unreliable and in most cases accompanied by hailstorms winter season is the driest and lasts only three months may july characterized by low temperatures with 0 ºc being the extreme lowest ever recorded the current phenomenon of prolonged droughts such as the one experienced between 2013 and 2016 is obviously the main driver of inadequate reservoir replenishment and may possibly expedite drying up of reservoirs a detailed hydrogeological context for the study area has been described by altchenko et al 2017 of greater lithological importance to the study area is its location on a basin made up of two primary aquifers known as the ramotswa transboundary aquifer and lephala aquifer systems fig 3 a large part of the study area is dominated by the ramotswa transboundary dolomitic aquifer rtbda which consists of dolomites and quarzites while the lephala aquifer found to the southern end of the study area is dominated by shales quartzites and conglomerates staudt and vogel 2004 fig 4 is the piezometry map that shows among others the gw flow direction and levels in meters above mean sea level for the study area as can be seen the flow is in a north north eastern direction following the main gradient as well as the course of the ephemeral notwane river the conceptual model for the study area is shown in fig 5 briefly the main inflow is hypothesized to originate from the notwane ephemeral stream altchenko et al 2017 ranganai et al 2001 staudt and vogel 2004 while the outflow is mainly via abstraction of gw through boreholes and gw evapotranspiration however the model does not account for potential sources such as leakages from sewer pipes and effluent discharge based on the assumption that their contribution to gw is negligible 2 2 sampling design water samples were collected from existing boreholes coded g1 g7 for gw situated along the notwane river the boreholes are designated as observation and or monitoring boreholes and are managed by the department of water and sanitation dws surface water samples were collected in the notwane river at locations coded s1 s7 fig 3 illustrates a close up view of the sampling points the sampling task comprised of two expeditions one in the wet and the other in the dry season complete with geographical reference points the wet season sampling coincided with the hottest and yet wettest month of november 2019 see rainfall data in fig 2 conversely the dry season s sampling coincided with the driest months in may and august 2 3 sampling protocol and handling of samples generally sampling protocols followed procedures described in stephens and rose 2005 briefly precleaned 1 l polyethylene bottles were used to collect samples initially bottles were thoroughly rinsed with ultrapure water millipore milford ma usa then rinsed repeatedly with the intended sample and subsequently filled ensuring minimal headspace void i e to reduce interaction with air and bacterial activity each borehole was purged for 1 hr to ensure destratification of the bore water especially for boreholes with high water levels to promote mixing and subsequently to collect a more representative sample samples intended for cations analyses were acidified to ph 2 using 1 ml of 15 nitric acid hno3 to minimize ligand complexation all samples were placed in an insulated box containing ice packs and transported to the laboratory for processing within 24 hrs this was possible because sampling excursions always coincided with instrument availability pre analysis sample processing entailed vacuum filtering using 2 7 µm 47 mm followed by 0 45 µm 25 mm gf d glass microfiber filters whatman maidstone england to remove suspended solids the laboratory work for the analyses of stable isotopes was performed at two south african universities the university of witwatersrand for processing of wet season samples and the university of cape town for processing of dry season samples in all instances the same sample points were maintained in all sampling expeditions temperature and electrical conductivity ec were measured on site and values are presented in table 2 precipitation or rainfall sampling entailed funneling rain drops into 500 ml precleaned polyethylene bottles fitted with a wide diameter funnel and placed in the open during a rainfall event until full the samples acquired here were coded p1 and p2 respectively 2 4 analytical procedures 2 4 1 isotope analysis the isotope ratios of deuterium 2h h2o and oxygen 18o h2o of the water samples section 2 3 were determined using los gatos research lgr liquid water isotope analyzer model 45 ep situated at the department of geology university of the witwatersrand south africa these were samples collected during the wet season the obtained data were converted to per mil delta values δ against the v smow in accordance with eq 1 the dry season s samples were assayed in the same way except that they were processed at the department of archeology university of cape town where a different stable isotope analyzer was used instrument availability necessitated this variation in approaches in this instance a deltaxp dual inlet gas source mass spectrometer was used following a procedure by dunn and carter 2018 the average precision for the obtained data in both instruments was 1 2 4 2 determination of cations and anions an agilent 4210 micro plasma atomic emission spectroscopy mp aes was used for the determination of ca2 na mg2 and k in water samples the instrument settings flow rate torch temperature were set up for the best sensitivity and calibration was achieved using a 7 point calibration curve comprising of analytes in the range 0 5 5 ppm the instruments repeatability and reproducibility were deemed adequate for this study anions were analyzed at the department of water and sanitation using metrohm ion chromatography 850 professional system equipped with a conductivity flow cell detector separation of anions hco 3 cl so2 4 and co 3 was achieved using an ion exchanger column metrosep a supp 5 150 40 maintained at 300 c using a mobile phase comprising of 10 mm sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate the flow rate was maintained at 0 7 ml min for the entire run 2 4 3 field analyses physico chemical parameters ph temperature and ec were measured on site during sampling this was achieved using a multi meter oakton pcstestr 35 capable of obtaining ph temperature and electrical conductivity simultaneously in a single determination and or measurement measurements were performed according to the manufacturer s recommended protocol 2 5 data curation analysis and presentation 2 5 1 stable isotopes a simple δ18o versus δ2h plot is a widely used method to visualize gw sw interactions the theory of using stable isotopes as environmental tracers has been explained elsewhere in the manuscript in accordance with eqs 1 and 2 craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 gat 1996 2 5 2 major ion chemistry 2 5 2 1 piper diagram piper diagrams were used for graphical representations of the water quality data these were created using an open source software known as gw chart which is described in detail in winston 2000 2 5 2 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hca hierarchical cluster analysis hca is a widely accepted statistical method used to determine similar groups of cases using each group s measured characteristics zhang et al 2017 zolfaghari et al 2019 several studies have utilized multivariate statistical approaches such as hca to identify gw sw facies and processes with success güler and thyne 2004 mcneil et al 2005 cloutier et al 2008 woocay and walton 2008 raiber et al 2012 tatou et al 2017 and it was used for the same purpose in this study 3 results the results for the determination of isotopic species in both wet and dry season samples including hydrochemical data are presented in table 2 borehole water levels are reported in terms of meters below ground level mbgl which may be indicative of the water level in the aquifer system under consideration 3 1 characterization of precipitation induced isotopic composition the influence of rainfall on the overall isotopic composition was evaluated based on a total of four 4 precipitation events two 2 of which were experimental measurements recorded november 2019 and an additional two 2 events obtained in the form of secondary data from a previous study by baqa 2017 while this sampling frequency may be considered inadequate to provide a comprehensive understanding of the overall rainfall induced isotopic composition a contrary proof of concept has been established indicating that in fact insightful generalizations may still be obtained using fewer data points shamsuddin et al 2018 in much the same way shamsuddin and co workers successfully characterized rainfall induced isotopic signatures in the lower muda river basin malaysia using data obtained from only five 5 precipitation events shamsuddin et al 2018 as already stated data were collected during negligible rainfall events 30 mm in 2019 and supplemented with additional two secondary data sets baqa 2017 where measurements were obtained during above average hailstorms at a location situated further upstream 25 41972 s and 25 81735 e in the nrc fig 6a since no isotope monitoring data pertaining to the nrc are available the obtained experimental isotopic precipitation values were compared and validated against a web based algorithm platform online isotopes in precipitation calculator based on the work by bowen 2017 the experimental values obtained for δ2h ranged from 59 12 for δ2h and 0 4 to 9 4 for δ18o compared to the predicted ranges of 3 0 2 and 11 3 for δ2h and δ18o respectively notably there is a clear disagreement between the two data sets experimental versus predicted which may be ascribed to an interplay of several factors chiefly of which is the unreliability and lack of precision in prediction algorithms and probably the differences between the data sets briefly the data indicate conclusively that the experimental precipitation measurements fall outside the estimated predicted annual isotopic composition range this disparity may be ascribed to the vast and unpredictable spatio temporal variations in the rain forming mechanisms which are mostly endemic to semi arid regions craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 plots of δ18o versus δ2h were constructed using the lobatse and the global meteoric local meteoric water lines l and gmwl as references because the meteoric water line for the study area is not yet calculated partly due to the limited isotope monitoring work in this catchment the rationale for this choice of data is the proximity of lobatse 73 km south of nrc to the sampling points therefore not much variation was expected in fact the lmwl is already known and is represented according to eq 2 talma and van wyk 2013 2 δ d 6 4 δ 18 o 6 7 3 2 δ18o δ2h composition and major ion composition along the notwane river the δ2h values for surface water across sampling sites for both seasons are in the ranges 9 4 to 4 3 compared to 3 4 to 2 0 for δ18o seasonal comparison of isotopic composition data averaged according to sampling sites show negligible and or no net season induced differences for δ2h and δ18o respectively briefly δ2h was measured at 6 6 6 6 for the dry wet seasons respectively similarly δ18o was recorded as 2 1 2 5 for the dry wet seasons respectively table 2 subsequent comparison of seasonal data based on δ18o versus δ2h plots shows a tendency of clustering of data points along the lmwl and gmwl for both isotopes with partial exception of the wet season data for δ18o also noticeable is the establishment of the local evaporation line lel for isotopes in the wet season fig 6c the hydrochemistry for surface water samples collected in the dry season and assessed according to concentration mg l of major cations show the following trend ca2 na mg2 k in contrast to mg2 ca2 na k for samples collected in the wet season thus in the dry season the surface water is dominated by ca2 ions which were measured at 6 3 9 1 7 8 mg l for minimum maximum mean ca2 values respectively in contrast the wet season data reveal a slight loss in concentration of ca2 ions likely due to rainfall dilution and a net gain in the concentration of mg2 ions suggesting that rainwater may contain significantly higher concentration of mg2 ions all this is shown by the swapping of positions of ca2 and mg2 ions in the concentration rankings shown above a similar concentration ranking for anions determined in the dry and wet season samples is in the order hco 3 cl so2 4 co 3 if concentrations of the dominant ions ca2 hco3 are considered then the surface water samples can be entirely classified as ca hco3 water type fig 7 3 3 δ18o δ2h temperature and major ion composition of groundwater in the nrc the minimum maximum average temperature values measured in groundwater samples for the dry season samples were 22 9 25 5 24 3 c respectively the values did not differ markedly with measurements for the samples collected in the wet season 24 9 26 7 26 1 c for min max average temperature values respectively regarding surface water slightly higher temperatures were measured in the wet season as compared to dry season for the wet season the min max average temperatures were as follows 23 8 25 6 25 3 c respectively and 22 9 27 2 24 8 c for the dry season the rest of the data is shown in table 2 the δ2h content for groundwater across sampling sites in both seasons fluctuates between 30 1 to 10 8 and pooled averages of 21 4 23 1 for the dry wet seasons respectively this contrasts with the δ18o content of 5 1 1 4 min max values and pooled averages of 3 7 3 7 for the dry wet seasons respectively interestingly the hydrochemistry data for groundwater samples agrees remarkably well with the data obtained for surface water section 3 2 in this instance the characterization of the major cations and anions shows a similar concentration based trend mg l ca2 mg2 na k and hco 3 cl so2 4 co 3 note data presented here are for both seasons on this basis groundwater can be classified into two distinct water types ca hco3 type which accounts for 86 of the total samples analyzed and the ca mg cl type representing 14 of the total samples analyzed fig 7 this may be true considering that sampling site g6 is a borehole that recorded the highest value of ec µs cm and previously identified with high levels of nitrate nitrogen no3 n mcgill 2019 and is also part of these samples 4 discussion 4 1 hydrochemical and isotopic composition of water in the nrc 4 1 1 δ18o and δ2h composition of rainfall in general it was observed that the δ2h composition was inversely proportional to rainfall intensity in that higher and or intense precipitation events lead to δ2h depletion in contrast to δ2h enrichment during weaker and less intense precipitation events fig 6a hailstorms undergo less fractionation than rainwater due to the differences in phase properties between water and ice mazor 2003 similarly lower ambient temperatures experienced during cloud formation and evaporation of rain droplets are both responsible for the amount effect phenomenon as previously articulated by dansgaard 1964 and mazor 2003 our results agree with this principle 4 1 2 δ18o and δ2h composition of surface water generally it can be concluded that atmospheric precipitation is the main source of surface water recharge in the nrc in arid semi arid regions surface water bodies are isotopically enriched due to higher evaporation rates and fractionation processes caused by high temperatures making it possible to distinguish them from other potential sources of recharge mazor 2003 zhu et al 2016 our data show a slight seasonal variability in the composition of δ18o as a function of seasons dry wet seasons this may be ascribed to an interplay of several factors chief of which is the amount effect mazor 2003 for instance heavy downpours during the wet season may prevent part of the precipitation isotopes from returning to the background value conversely the dry season normally characterized by low precipitation events promotes isotopic enrichment due to evaporation an ideal environment that promotes precipitation isotopes to rebound to higher background conditions 4 1 3 changes in hydrochemical and isotopic composition of groundwater a plot of δ18o versus δ2h fig 6b and d reveals two conflicting scenarios relating to groundwater recharge on one hand the experimental data points are superimposed into the mwl shown by dotted circle fig 6d an indication of a comparatively lower evaporation and fractionation rate in water prior to recharge during high precipitation events and also reveals highly active recharge sites with enhanced rapid infiltration and or fast rapid watershed response to flood events on the other hand clear evidence of a possibility of recharge is revealed as shown by a linear deviation of data points evaporation line from the reference gmwl it also indicates the possibility of the presence of a much slower groundwater recharge infiltration site this hypothesis may be true considering the proximity of sampling points to the river channel i e sampling boreholes were located 2 2500 m closest furthest respectively in dryland regions overland flow is high due to low infiltration so channel flow may dominate recharge during intense storms goodrich et al 1997 singer and michaelides 2017 the rest of the data relating to sampling points relative to the river channel are summarized in table 3 supplementary data the results further reveal high ionic strength variable in these groundwater samples compared to surface water samples fig 7 this has resulted in most surface samples forming a cluster beneath the groundwater samples indicating a slight difference in ionic strength of the two waters this was expected since rock water interactions and dissolution of the dolomite during infiltration can increase the ionic strength of groundwater lakshmanan and kannan 2007 4 1 4 implications of gw sw interactions on nutrients and contamination the results of multivariate cluster analysis are presented in fig 8 briefly the analysis represents a two clustered data output i e cluster a is predominantly surface water samples which are low in cl content and cluster b is groundwater samples which are high in cl content as may be seen the main feature of differentiation between these datasets is the cl content for instance sampling boreholes in this cluster g3 g6 and g7 measured up to 110 246 mg l chlorine the high concentrations of chlorine ions may be ascribed to the fact that sampling site g3 is located within the village and in close proximity to pit latrines while site g6 is located within a productive irrigated farm and site g7 is in close proximity to a wastewater stabilization ponds then the elevated cl content may emanate from the anthropogenic activities in the vicinity of these sampling sites e g chlorine which is a well known household disinfectant with the potential to cause groundwater pollution groundwater pollution in some of these boreholes have been reported in previous studies dwa 2000 mcgill et al 2019 the same trend is exhibited by the ec levels across the same boreholes discussed above in addition a distinctive trend is observed in which ec levels are significantly higher in downstream boreholes compared to upstream boreholes fig 9a and b it is evident that the distribution of pollutants is promoted by the direction of water flow paths staudt and vogel 2004 in the same way the ec content may be linked to anthropogenic activities because most parts of this aquifer system are being exploited for socio economic activities 4 2 implications of changes in isotopic composition on gw sw interactions previously there have been uncertainties regarding the actual recharge mechanisms in the ephemeral notwane river altchenko et al 2017 and this study provides new findings on the actual gw sw interactions using seasonal stable isotope and hydrochemical data in a semi arid environment unlike other regions where recharge is by direct infiltration the recharge mechanism in the nrc is dominated by the streambed recharge which may be influenced by several factors such as the differences in the water levels between the river systems and adjacent groundwater table and geologic formations such as faults and karsts which play a role in promoting gw sw interactions as already noted karsts provide hydrological pathways that facilitate recharge to this end most studies on this subject in botswana have been focused on the kalahari region boocock and van straten 1961 1962 bredenkamp and vogel 1974 de vries and von hoyer 1988 mazor 1974 selaolo 1998 which is predominantly characterized by direct infiltration recharge to the best of our knowledge there is no previous study that focused on gw sw interactions in the nrc 4 3 hydrochemistry and stable isotope relationship on gw sw in the study area the interpretation of results based on concentrations of major ions generally indicate that both gw and sw belong to a common water type ca hco3 this is shown in fig 7 where 26 of the 28 gw sw samples both wet and dry season plotted in the ca hco3 facies while one sample plotted in the mixed facies and the other one plotted borderline between mixed and ca hco3 type the dominance of ca2 mg2 and hco 3 in gw sw samples was expected since these ions are normally part of the dolomites make up as already reported by beukes 1987 and dawson and hinton 2003 both results for major ions and stable isotopes indicate conclusively that recharge in the nrc originates from the riverbed likely during high flows and floods this is further illustrated in fig 6b and d which shows active recharge sites within the river system interestingly the isotopic compositions of all gw samples were plotted along the meteoric water line and were generally isotopically depleted an indication of fast recharge rates during river flow furthermore both gw and sw samples displayed a narrow range of the δ18o stable isotope which may signify similarity in the spatial extent and evaporation conditions as these samples were collected in the same geographic area fig 7 this then means that groundwater is closely related to streamflow but due to the reaction with oxygen bearing minerals in the carbonate rock there is a slight enrichment of groundwater with δ18o in summary the utilization of stable environmental tracers 2h and 18o and hydrochemistry data have unambiguously demonstrated that the gw sw interactions in the nrc are driven by recharge sites located along the ephemeral notwane river and that aquifer recharge is highly likely during high river flows 5 conclusion this study s main aim was to investigate gw sw interactions dynamics and their possible implications on the quality and quantity of water in the karst dolomite dominated notwane river catchment nrc in the south eastern part of botswana with the view of advancing knowledge of groundwater resources in the study area findings from the study indicate that there are some highly active groundwater recharge areas along the ephemeral notwane river that recharges the aquifer during periods of high flows like flooding these sites are perceived to indicate the possibility of a rapid infiltration due to rapid watershed response to flood events in the study area influenced by geological formations such as karst dolomites which are dominant these recharge sites are also considered to be hydrological pathways which may contribute to pollutants entering the groundwater system hence highlighting the vulnerability of the aquifer to pollution groundwater ec composition in the study area was found to increase in value and or concentration from upstream toward downstream location and mostly following groundwater flow paths these revelations are deemed important in that the identified sites locations could be used as targets for aquifer protection and or remediation measures to reduce prevent future groundwater contamination in the area in summary findings from this study have shown the importance of ephemeral streams and their contribution to groundwater replenishment in drylands the potential contaminants transported through preferential path flows and their implications on the water resources of the nrc these provide an opportunity for the development of comprehensive frameworks to protect the ephemeral streams and aquifers from anthropogenic activities that may aide groundwater pollution in the nrc and similar environments the study recommends a long term strategy to monitor environmental isotopes from precipitation and groundwater in both upstream and downstream areas to add on to the existing water level monitoring credit authorship contribution statement modie l t

8014,study region china study focus water evaporation represents a pivotal indicator of the terrestrial ecosystem and hydrological cycle influencing regional water and energy balance to some extent in this study the long term data series of water surface evaporation e p were assimilated across china with the observations from 552 national benchmark weather stations the trends of e p and the influential climate variables were well detected the analytical derivation method was built up to quantitatively attribute the effects from 5 key climate fields to e p variations including wind speed u 2 sunshine duration n relative humidity rh daily maximum t max and minimum t min air temperature new hydrological insights for the region the attribution results were more accurate and reasonable than those from two commonly used statistically based climate elasticity methods which tended to overestimated the e p variations most weather stations had experienced the decreasing trends of e p during the entire research period of 1961 2018 which were mainly attributed to the decreasing in u 2 n and rh while the effects of regional warming rising air temperature were less influential on e p variations at the long term scale the variations of e p attributed to the three main influential climate variables u 2 n and rh across china had also shown different temporal and spatial tendency patterns during different historical research periods for example the changing n and rh had shown increasing power on e p variations in the western china climate zones comparatively the u 2 has been losing its power in decreasing e p in most regions of china due to the slowdown in the declining rates of wind speed this dynamic e p attribution process is worthy of continuous focus and systematic research keywords water surface evaporation variations effects quantification analytical derivation method china 1 introduction global change and its influences on natural and social system is a hot topic in the past decades as it has posed great challenges on related natural resources management and extreme hazards prevention ipcc 2014 the hydro cycle is more sensitive to environmental change than many other natural systems the water cycle processes including precipitation evaporation and runoff generation are subject to regional changes climate condition changes and watershed structure changes wherein evaporation playing a key role in land surface atmosphere interaction regional water and energy balance and watershed hydrological cycle has been experiencing remarkable changes during the past decades as reported globally cong et al 2008 peterson et al 1995 roderick and farquhar 2002 analyzing the variations and its driving factors of evaporation is of great significance especially in hydrological knowledge extension and water resources assessment during the past half century pan evaporation measured by pan evaporimeters and commonly taken to represent potential evaporation has decreased over most parts of the world brutsaert and parlange 1998 peterson et al 1995 roderick and farquhar 2002 with no exception of china lots of previous studies have reported decreasing tendencies in both pan observed evaporation and model estimated potential evapotranspiration across china liu et al 2004 cong et al 2008 liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 guan et al 2021 for example liu et al 2004 collected long term 1951 2000 d20 pan evaporation observation datasets from 85 national benchmark stations across china and found that the decrease of pan evaporation was statistically significant in most climatic regions of china similar results were also validated by liu et al 2010 yan and li 2015 yang and yang 2012 guan et al 2021 used fao56 penman monteith p m model to simulate the potential evapotranspiration at 175 meteorological stations of huang huai hai river basin and reported consistent decreasing tendencies of changing potential evapotranspiration with detected trends in other regions of china wang et al 2017a 2017b including but not limited to tibetan plateau xie and zhu 2013 yangtze river basin gong et al 2012 and poyang lake catchment ye et al 2015 overall the detected decline in pan evaporation is at odds with the expectation that the global warming should have accelerated the evaporation process and increase the potential evaporation cong et al 2008 wang et al 2017a 2017b many methods had been tested to explore the determining driving factors influencing evaporating process at both site and basin scale generally the correlation analysis approach regression analysis climate elasticity method and analytical derivation method were frequently implemented to construct the attribution of changing evaporation liu et al 2004 proposed that the decrease in solar irradiance was most likely the driving force for the reduced pan evaporation in china by calculating and comparing the changing rates and correlation coefficients of evaporation and possible influential climate variables zhang et al 2015 proposed that relative humidity was the principal influencing factor for pan evaporation decreases 1960 2005 especially in northwestern northern and northeastern china based on sensitivity analysis while the effect from relative humidity in southern china was relatively complex indicating other factors can have impacts on pan evaporation changes guan et al 2021 tended to use multiple linear regression and climate elasticity method to quantify the effects of changing weather fields like wind speed relative humidity sunshine duration and so on on evaporation variations the decline in evaporation is mainly subject to aerodynamic and irradiance factors wind speed and sunshine duration li et al 2013 2018 yang and yang 2012 you et al 2013 wang et al 2017a 2017b although different research regions historical periods and applied methods might bring about uncertainties in attribution results for example li et al 2013 found that the pan evaporation in the arid region of northwest china exhibited an obvious decreasing trend 6 0 mm a2 until early 1990s caused by decreasing wind speed and then the downward trend reversed in 1993 and the rate of increase after that was 10 7 mm a2 due to the increasing strength from vapor pressure deficit the results were also confirmed by wang et al 2017a 2017b that pan evaporation decreased in most parts of china at an average of about 2 60 mm a2 and this decrease disappeared around 1993 the similar characteristics of evaporation variations during different historical periods were also reported in huang huai hai river basin guan et al 2021 indicating that the influences of changing climate variables on evaporation variation was a dynamic process and the dominant driving force might vary during different historical periods furthermore the quantitative attribution researches were also constraint by the evaporation representations namely pan observed evaporation and model simulated potential evaporation the p m model was frequently implemented to estimate the potential evaporation and the attribution was conducted combined with relationship analysis or climate elasticity method gong et al 2012 guan et al 2021 wang et al 2017a 2017b xie and zhu 2013 ye et al 2015 on the other hand the long term pan d20 pan with a depth of 10 cm and a diameter of 20 cm in china evaporation observations were also used for variation attribution you et al 2013 and li et al 2018 used the penpan model to estimate the d20 pan evaporation and attributed the evaporation variations based on analytical derivation method in typical regions of southwest china and huai river basin respectively however most meteorological stations in china substituted the d20 pan with e601 pan after 1995 given that the d20 pan tended to overestimate the water surface evaporation which may lead to inconsistency in long term evaporation observations therefore the evaporation observation data assimilation was highly suggested before analyzing the changing characteristics and influential factors of evaporation variations fu et al 2004 liu et al 2017 ren et al 2002 sheng et al 2007 in this study the long term evaporation observation data from both d20 pan and e601 pan at national benchmark weather stations across china are collected in order to build up consistent long term 1961 2018 water surface evaporation dataset for changes detection and attribution the d20 pan evaporation data will be converted into e601 pan evaporation based on parallel observations then the performance of fao56 penman monteith model on water surface e601 evaporation estimation across china will be validated and the derivative method will be built up to quantify the effects of changing climate variables on evaporation variations the results from this method will also be compared with those from two climate elasticity methods given the temporal heterogeneity in evaporation changes the research periods will be divided into two stages according to mutation change test results to reveal the dominant forcing factors in evaporation variation respectively during different historical periods of interest 2 study area and data materials 2 1 study area in this study based on provincial level administrative region boundaries the mainland china was divided into 8 major climate zones see fig 1 namely northeast china north china east china central china south china southwest china northwest china and xinjiang zone and the main information of interest is listed in table 1 fig 1 also shows the spatial pattern of topography and land use across china the terrain of china is high in the west and low in the east showing a ladder distribution which to some extent determines the distribution of diversified land use types 2 2 data sources the daily data series of elemental weather fields including sunshine duration n relative humidity rh wind speed u and daily maximum minimum air temperature t max t min from 1961 to 2018 were provided by the national meteorological information center china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn which manages 699 national standard meteorological stations throughout the country in line with standard quality control methodology what s more the weather station also observed water evaporation by using two types of evaporation pan one is the d20 pan which is constructed from copper is cylindrical with a flat bottom cross sectional area of 314 cm2 and installed on a bracket with a depth of 10 cm and a diameter of 20 cm normally located 70 cm above the ground the other is e601 evaporation pan which is made of fiber reinforced polymer and is of cylindrical design with a surface area of 3000 cm2 and depth of 60 cm it is normally set in the soil with its rim 30 cm above the ground and with a cone shaped or a cylindrical shaped bottom and there is a needle ruler attached at the rim of the pan to measure water level change caused by evaporation wmo 2010 liu et al 2016 we also collected the net radiation data at 99 radiation observations from cma for radiation parameter calibration and validation in water surface evaporation estimation the locations of weather stations and radiation observation across in china are shown in fig 1 the statistical information of 8 zones like number of weather stations located in each zone is listed in table 11 2 3 data preprocessing weather stations are set up in different years in china most of which were established no earlier than 1961 and it is necessary to choose a uniform data period for consistent analysis of temporal tendencies of water surface evaporation therefore the research period is set as 1961 2018 in this study the weather station provides two types of evaporation observation from two evaporimeters d20 pan and e601 evaporation pan and the foundation and start observation time are different before 1970 s evaporation data were obtained mainly by observations of d20 pan across china since the 1970 s observations have been made at a few stations in non icing periods using both d20 and e601 evaporation pan according to the evaporation observation standards suggested by world meteorology organization in 1995 china meteorological administration substituted e601 evaporation pan for d20 evaporation pan at the national benchmark weather stations since e601 pan observation is much closer to actual water surface evaporation wmo 2010 ren et al 2002 sheng et al 2007 zhang and shi 2009 liu 2010 liu et al 2017 the assimilation of pan evaporations is a premise and basic work for analyzing spatial and temporal distribution of evaporation with long term data series in this study the parallel observations from two kinds of evaporation pans were carried out at most stations for more than 2 years before the d20 pans were cancelled ren et al 2002 sheng et al 2007 based on synchronous evaporation observations the conversion relationships between d20 and e601 pan evaporation can be investigated and the linear conversion coefficients can be computed for converting early e20 pan evaporation into e601 pan evaporation liu 2010 in the conversion procedure the evaporation conversion coefficients between d20 pan and e601 pan in each month are calculated directly for most of the stations with more than 3 years of parallel observations for a few stations with less than 3 years of synchronous observations or for stations without synchronous observations the conversion coefficients of adjacent stations are adopted alternatively liu 2010 after a series of preprocessing steps above 552 out of 699 national benchmark weather stations across china were finally selected and the early d20 pan evaporation observations are all converted into e601 pan evaporation to form a complete long term 1961 2018 and consistent evaporation observation dataset the locations of selected weather stations and spatial pattern of mean annual water surface evaporation were shown in fig 1 a and c respectively 3 method description 3 1 trend test methods both the linear regression model and the mann kendall rank test mk test are commonly used methods to test the linear trend of climatic variables while the later could provide the significance of variation trend the tendency rate estimated by linear regression method is denoted as s slope hereinafter the mk test is a non parametric distribution free method to detect trends of time series with minimal assumptions guan et al 2018 lv et al 2019 and has been widely applied to test trends in hydrological and meteorological series all over the world the mann kendall rank test statistic index u so called mk value follows the standard normal distribution the positive or negative of the u value determines the upward and downward of the trend the statistic u is under the null hypothesis of no trend when number of series increases the null hypothesis in this test is that there is no significant trend in the time series at the significance level of α if u u α 2 where u α 2 is the critical value of the standard normal distribution with a probability exceeding α 2 then the null hypothesis is rejected namely the trend is significant given α 0 05 then u α 2 1 96 3 2 pettitt s test this method proposed by pettitt 1979 is a non parametric approach to the change point problem in this function the test is implemented as given by verstraeten et al 2006 where the ranks r 1 r n of the x 1 x n are used for the statistic 1 u k 2 i 1 k r i k n 1 k 1 2 n the test statistic is the maximum of the absolute value of the vector 2 u ˆ max u k the probable change point denoted as ck is located where u ˆ has its maximum the approximate probability for a two sided test is calculated according to p 2 e 6 k 2 n 3 n 2 3 3 fao56 penman monteith model for water surface evaporation estimation generally pan evaporation data when combined with an appropriate pan coefficient or with an adjustment for the energy exchange through the sides and bottom of the tank can be considered to be open water evaporation allen et al 1980 dingman 2015 jensen 2010 khobragade et al 2019 for example fuentes et al 2020 implemented the fao56 penman monteith p m equation combined with a constant crop factor to estimate the free surface water evaporation liu 2010 suggested the constant scaling factor from fao56 estimates to surface water evaporation to be 1 in most regions of china which is also adopted in this study to attribute the changing water surface evaporation therefore the formula for water surface evaporation estimation is as follows 3 e p k c e re k c 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 d δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where e p is the water surface evaporation and e re is

of the variations in the e p trend we followed roderick et al 2007 and calculated the first order differential of eq 3 as follows 20 d e p dt e p f t max d t max dt f t min d t min dt f u 2 d u 2 dt f rh drh dt f n dn dt t max t m in u 2 rh n the changes of e p e p could be attributed to the changes in the daily maximum t max f t max d t max dt minimum t min f t min d t min dt air temperature wind

were assumed to remain constant at their long term means as the relationship of e p between and climatic variables are given by p m model then f x can be derived mathematically see appendix a for detailed equations in this study we also estimate the effect of climatic variables on e p using the method of climate elasticity of streamflow proposed by schaake and waggoner 1990 the elasticity coefficient ɛ of e p is defined by the proportional change in e p divided by the proportional change in a climatic variable x such as rh or t max and the elasticity coefficient is expressed as 21 ε x de p e p dx x where ε x is the sensitivity coefficient of e p with respect to climatic variable x it is clear that ε x f x x e p then the eq 20 can be rewritten as 22 d e p dt ε t max e p t max d t max dt ε t min e p t min d t min dt ε u 2 e p u 2 d u 2 dt ε rh e p rh drh dt ε n e p n dn dt sankarasubramanian et al 2001 proposed a nonparametric approach to estimate the climate elasticity directly from observed data and median descriptive statistics was also used to overcome numeric problem which was expressed as 23 ε x median e p e p x x median e p e p e p x x x where δ e p and δ x are the changes of annual e p and climatic variable with respect to long term average of e p e p and climate factors x respectively zheng et al 2009 proposed an alternative nonparametric estimator of climate elasticity to overcome the problem associated with small sample size and rewrite eq 21 as 24 δ e p e ε x δ x x thus the sensitivity coefficient of e p can be regarded as the linear regression coefficient between d e p e p and dx x using the least squares estimator the sensitivity coefficient can be estimated as 25 ε x x e p x x e p e p x x 2 ρ x e p c e p c x where ρ x e p is the correlation coefficient of x i and e p c e p and c x are variation coefficients of x and e p basically a positive negative sensitivity coefficient value of a climatic variable indicates that e p will increase decrease as the variable increase decrease the larger the sensitivity coefficient the larger effect a given variable has on e p 4 results and discussion 4 1 dynamic variations of meteorological variables and e p fig 2 shows the temporal variation of observed water surface evaporation e p and the main influencing weather variables across china during the research period of 1961 2018 together with the variations of changing rates slope of the climatic fields computed by implementing a 11 year window which can reveal the positive or negative tendency of climate variables during different research periods of interest furthermore the changing tendency of key variables at each weather station is also tested by using both linear regression approach and mann kendall test and the results are shown in fig 3 it can be found in fig 2 that an overall decreasing trend was detected in e p across china with the average declining rate of 0 601 mm a2 during the long term period of 1961 2018 however the evolution tendency decreasing is not continuous throughout the research period of interest as a significant decreasing tendency can be observed in e p before 1995 and then the trend was reversed until 2008 from the prospective of spatial pattern of e p variation trend see fig 3 more than half weather stations show decreasing trend of e p throughout the research period of 1961 2018 while there are some stations with slightly increasing trends of e p mostly located in southern region of xj zone northeast part of xn zone and northeast region of china continuous upward trends are detected in both daily maximum t max and minimum t min air temperature in china especially after 1985 and the warming rates in northern china are significantly higher than those in southern china as shown in fig 3 therefore the trends of e p are not completely consistent with the warming trend throughout the research period indicating that the variations of e p are subject to more than air temperature but other climate variables it can be seen from fig 2 b d that a remarkable decreasing tendency was observed in both wind speed u 2 and sunshine duration n before 2000 after which the changing rates were much smaller and fluctuated at the low level the relative humidity rh presented a slight fluctuating downward trend across china see fig 3c and the trends were more significant in hb zone and southern zones of china while in some weather station of northeast and northwest china db zone and xj zone the changing tendencies of rh were not significant and several stations showed increasing trends of rh as the e p and the main influencing climate variables have not shown completely consistent variation characteristics during the entire research period of 1961 2018 it may be necessary to divide the research period into different historical stages and to identify the main driving climate variables affecting the variations of e p in china then in this study the pettitt s test was applied to detect the abrupt changes in the entire e p series to probably partition the period of 1961 2018 into two historical stages namely the period before the e p mutation year pre ck and the period after the detected abrupt changing point post ck the temporal and spatial distribution pattern of pettitt s test results ck and its significance are shown in fig 4 a and d then the changing tendencies of e p in the periods before and after the ck are investigated respectively with the results also shown in fig 4 it can be found that the mutations in e p variations mostly occurred in the period range of 1980 2000 and 371 out of 552 weather stations experienced significant e p abrupt changes with p values in pettitt s test lower than 0 05 in term of spatial pattern most weather stations in db hn hz and xb zones of china tended to experience the e p abrupt changes earlier than other zones mostly in the 1980 s according to the e p trends test results in the two historical stages see fig 4b c and e f near 70 weather stations experienced decreasing trends of e p during the period of pre ck while after the abrupt changing years post ck only 45 3 weather stations shows decreasing trends in e p and the downward tendencies were not significant and decreasing rates were much smaller than those during pre ck periods as can be seen in fig 4 b and c from the perspective of spatial heterogeneity e p in db zone and hb zone showed negative tendency during both the pre ck and post ck periods the difference between these two historical stages were not obvious for hd zone e p showed decreasing trends during the pre ck periods while the downward trends were alleviated with average changing rates close to 0 during the post ck periods for the rest 5 zones in china most weather station observed increasing tendencies in e p in the last 3 decades rather than decreasing trends throughout the entire research period especially in xj zone the increasing trends were remarkable therefore the e p variation across china was more a dynamic process than a uniformly continuously decreasing process and the main influencing climate variables and their contributions may differ during different historical periods 4 2 validation of the p m model in water surface evaporation e p estimation in this study before the p m model can be implemented to estimate the water surface evaporation e p and to partition the contributions from 5 climate variables to e p variations the p m model should be well validated across china in p m model for estimating net radiation solar radiation is calculated by an empirical equation involving the sunshine duration daily maximum and minimum air temperature with two parameters a s and b s allen et al 1980 the default values for a s and b s are 0 25 and 0 5 respectively but it is highly suggested that these two parameters should be calibrated based on observed radiation flux data before implementation guan et al 2021 yang et al 2006 therefore these two radiation parameters a s and b s are calibrated based on 10 years 2005 2004 net radiation data series observed at 99 radiation stations across china the evaluation indices including nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 correlation coefficient cc mean square root error rmse and relative error re are selected to evaluate the model performance in net radiation estimation these 4 indices are frequently used in hydrological modeling evaluation guan et al 2020 and normally a good estimation result will have nse and cc approaching to 1 rmse and re close to 0 the spatial distribution of calibrated radiation parameters at 99 radiation observations is shown in fig 5 together with the statistical results of evaluation indices it can be seen in fig 5 that higher a s values tend to locate in western and northern regions of china and the a s values are lower than the default value 0 25 the values of parameter b s are mainly located in the range of 0 5 0 55 as for calibration results net radiation estimation performance is pretty good at the 99 stations across china with most nse values over 0 8 cc higher than 0 9 rmse no more than 3 mj m2 and re in the range of 1 then the radiation parameters a s and b s at the selected 552 weather stations can be obtained by using kriging interpolation method based on the calibration results and consequently the p m evaporation are calculated and compared with long term assimilated e p data similarly the 4 evaluation indices nse cc rmse and re are also used to validate the performance of p m model in water surface evaporation estimation both spatial distribution and statistical results of evaluation indices in p m model validation across china are shown in fig 6 in addition fig 7 gives the long term variations of observed and p m model estimated e p in 8 climate zones and fig 8 shows the mean annual monthly comparison overall p m model shows good performance in e p estimation in china with most nse values over 0 7 cc more than 0 8 rmse under 30 mm month and re located in the range of 5 3 most weather station across china have nse values around 0 8 except at some stations in northeast parts of xn zone and southeast coastal areas of china hn zone by calculating and comparing the zonal average e p in 8 climate zones the estimated e p by p m model matched well with observed e p and the corresponding standard deviations were also well correlated in addition p m model can also estimate mean annual monthly e p process in 8 climate zones across china very well although tended to a little underestimate the e p in seasons from october to december in hd hn hz zone nonetheless the fitting precision by p m model in this study was quite high relative to the results from previous similar studies on attribution of evaporation variations li et al 2018 yang and yang 2012 4 3 attribution analysis of changes in e p in this study we built up the derivative method to attribute the effects of changing climate fields including wind speed u 2 relative humidity rh sunshine duration n daily maximum t max and minimum t min air temperature the attribution results are also compared with the results from two elasticity methods namely sankarasubramanian et al 2001 and zheng et al 2009 method fig 9 and fig 10 show the comparison between observed e p variations changing tendency calculated by linear regression method denoted as o e p with the unit of mm a2 and estimated e p variations denoted as e e p by three methods in both china and 8 climate zones throughout the entire research period of 1961 2018 it can be found that the derivative method showed good performance in changing tendency estimation of e p across china although represented a little systematic deviation in xb and xj zone of china overall the e e p by derivative method correlated much better with o e p than e e p from two elasticity methods did both the sankarasubramanian 2001 and zheng 2009 elasticity method tended to overestimated the e p variations across china a possible reason for the misestimation is the relatively small sample size which leads to a relatively large error in the climate elasticity zheng et al 2009 climate elasticity given in eq 23 was tested and found to be robust through monte carlo experiments for three catchments in the united states sankarasubramanian et al 2001 compared with eqs 23 and 25 which require large amounts of observed historical climatic data the analytical derivation method in this study can estimate climate elasticity based only on the mean annual climate fields yang and yang 2011 therefore the derivative method is the best choice and selected here to quantify the effects of changing climate variables on e p variations across china fig 11 shows the spatial pattern of contributions from 5 climate fields to e p variations across china during the research period of 1961 2018 together with the statistical results as can be seen that the effects of changing rh and t max tended to intensify the water surface evaporation while other 3 influential climate variables tended to reduce the evaporation with negative contributions in most regions of china e p variations in northern zones of china were more sensitive to the changes in t max than southern zones while t min was more influential in western regions of china like xj xn and parts of xb zone compared with other 3 climate variables the changes in air temperature showed not significant influence in e p variations with absolute contributions absolute values of t max and t min no more than 1 mm a2 during the period of interest as shown in fig 11 d f as for the other 3 climate fields the decreasing sunshine duration n and wind speed u 2 had posed more power on e p decreasing than relative humidity rh although slightly declining rh see fig 2c and fig 3c had posed positive effects and accelerated the evaporation of water most weather stations across china experienced downward e p trends during the period of 1961 2018 due to the combined effects of climate condition variations including decreasing u 2 and n as for the spatial pattern of contributions from the 3 main influential climate variables the decreasing u 2 had shown more power on e p changes in northern regions of china especially in xj hb and db zone the effects of changing u 2 in southern zones of china were relatively weak with much lower u 2 values in the southeast climate zones of china including hz hd and hn zone rh and n were the dominant influential factors in dynamics of e p overall the decreasing n and u 2 could explain the downward e p trends across china to a large degree during the entire research period from the results of fig 11 f though the spatial pattern of variations of e p across china in fig 3 a were not very consistent with those of n and u 2 in fig 11 therefore in order to partition the effects quantitatively and identify the main influential climate variables on e p variations in different historical periods the derivative method was also implemented at the periods both before and after the e p abrupt change point ck based on the pettitt s test results shown in fig 4 at each weather station respectively fig 12 shows the boxplot statistical results of the contributions from 5 climate fields to changing e p at different historical stages and fig 13 gives the spatial pattern of contributions from 3 main influential climate variables namely u 2 n and rh exempted with the spatial distribution of contributions from air temperature variations for manuscript clarity due to their relatively weak influential power on e p variations in most regions of china as shown in both fig 11 and fig 12 as shown in fig 12 that the boxplot statistical results of contributions from changing climate variables to e p variations in two different historical periods quite differed with each other as in climate zone of db hb xb and hz mostly northern regions of china see fig 13 the effects of changing sunshine duration n on e p variations had not shown significant changes while in hd and hn zone the decreasing effects of n had seen a weaken trend during the period of post ck and in zone of xj and xn western regions of china the changing n tended to increase the water evaporation after the cks as for the changes of contributions from relative humidity rh between the two different periods rh had shown an increasing trend in most regions of china during the second historical period especially in the xj and xn climate zone with higher absolute values than those in the periods before cks compared with other influential variables wind speed u 2 showed more spatial heterogeneity in contributing to the e p variations across china during the two research periods pre and post ck during the pre ck periods 63 6 of the total 552 weather stations experienced the negative u 2 across china and 21 6 shown significant downward trends mk 1 96 the spatial distribution of weather stations with negative u 2 across china seems to be very consistent with those with decreasing e p shown in fig 4 b during the research period of post cks only 57 2 of the weather stations experienced the decreasing trends of e p and no more than 10 was significant indicating that the u 2 has been losing its power in decreasing e p in most regions of china especially in western parts due to the slowdown in the declining rates of wind speed 4 4 discussion overall the dynamic of e p variations in different climate zones of china is a complicated and multivariate influencing process among the selected 5 key climate variables the e p is less sensitive to air temperature changes at the long term scale although it plays a key role in p m evaporation model calculation at daily scale in this study we used pettitt s test to divide the entire research periods into two different historical periods to study the variations of effects of climate variables on e p and identify the dominant factor in different historical stages which may introduce uncertainty because of the spatial heterogeneity in mutation change points across china in order to investigate the dynamic process of contributions from three main influencing factors n u 2 and rh a 11 year window was applied to calculate the contributions to the changing e p at each weather station during the whole research period of 1961 2018 the dynamic variations of the contributions zonal average and standard deviation can be seen in fig 14 it can be found that in the northern china namely hb db xj and xb u 2 played the dominant and negative role in changing tendencies of e p during the period of 1970 1990 with much lower average contribution values than other two climatic factors while after 1990 the contributions from u 2 to e p variations tended to increase and approach to zero indicating that the influence of changing u 2 on e p has been weakened in the past two decades comparatively in the southern zones hd hn and xn of china the variations of contributions from u 2 showed no remarkable changing trends with much smaller standard deviations than those in northern zones and the changes in n dominated the dynamic process of e p instead showing an increasing power as for the dynamic influence put by rh on e p during the research period the contributions from changing rh to e p were small with slight fluctuations and steady standard deviations while after 2000 the rh showed increasing strength on e p especially in the db hb hd hn and hz zone the influences of main climatic factors on e p variations and the contributions were not steady and the advantage factor also changed during different climate contexts this dynamic e p attribution process is worthy of continuous focus and systematic research on the other hand the e p variation attribution research in this study was conducted at the long term scale for each weather station based on observed annual data series the evaporation variation attribution in derivative method is highly subject to e p estimation from p m model the p m model may cannot fully represent the observed water surface evaporation in parts of china with special climate conditions as two important parameters in p m model the radiation parameters a s and b s are not only spatially heterogeneous but also subject to interannual climate variabilities as liu et al 2021 highly suggested that a s and b s should better be calibrated at monthly scale especially in the southwest china qinghai tibet plateau zone xn additionally the annual changing tendencies of e p is composed of the variations at the seasonal scale and the climate condition in mainland china is governed by different circulation systems during different seasons like western pacific subtropical high in summer and siberia high in winter in the context of climate warming the interannual variations of circulation systems can greatly influence the weather systems and the key climatic variables like e p so it is also of great significance to conduct the attribution analysis at the sub annual scale for better understanding the evolution of water surface evaporation 5 conclusion evaporation plays a key role in atmosphere land surface interaction and water cycle system meanwhile its variation is also an important indicator of climate system change in this study the long term data series of water surface evaporation e p were assimilated across china with the observations from 552 national benchmark weather stations the trends of e p and the influential climate variables were well detected the derivative method was built up in this study to quantitatively attribute the effects from different climate fields to e p variations the attribution results were also compared with those from two statistical climate elasticity methods most weather stations had experienced the decreasing trends of e p during the entire research period of 1961 2018 which were mainly attributed to the decrease in wind speed u 2 together with sunshine duration n and relative humidity rh although air temperature plays an important role in daily evaporation estimation and both daily maximum and minimum air temperature had shown significant rising trends across china the effects of regional warming were less influential on e p variations at the long term scale the comparison results between different attribution methods show that the two statistically based climate elasticity method tended to overestimate the e p variations due to limited series length the analytical derivation method built in this study was more suitable and efficient the variations of e p attributed to three main influential climate variables u 2 n and rh across china had also shown different tendency patterns during different historical research periods according to the abrupt changes detection results from pettitt s method the effects of n on decreasing e p had seen a weaken trend in most southeast zones of china while tended to increase the water evaporation especially in xinjiang zone the rh had shown increasing power on e p variations in most regions of china especially in the western china climate zones comparatively the u 2 has been losing its power in decreasing e p in most regions of china due to the slowdown in the declining rates of wind speed overall the e p variation is a complicated and dynamic process driven by combined effects of different changing climate variables which deserves continuous focus and

8014,study region china study focus water evaporation represents a pivotal indicator of the terrestrial ecosystem and hydrological cycle influencing regional water and energy balance to some extent in this study the long term data series of water surface evaporation e p were assimilated across china with the observations from 552 national benchmark weather stations the trends of e p and the influential climate variables were well detected the analytical derivation method was built up to quantitatively attribute the effects from 5 key climate fields to e p variations including wind speed u 2 sunshine duration n relative humidity rh daily maximum t max and minimum t min air temperature new hydrological insights for the region the attribution results were more accurate and reasonable than those from two commonly used statistically based climate elasticity methods which tended to overestimated the e p variations most weather stations had experienced the decreasing trends of e p during the entire research period of 1961 2018 which were mainly attributed to the decreasing in u 2 n and rh while the effects of regional warming rising air temperature were less influential on e p variations at the long term scale the variations of e p attributed to the three main influential climate variables u 2 n and rh across china had also shown different temporal and spatial tendency patterns during different historical research periods for example the changing n and rh had shown increasing power on e p variations in the western china climate zones comparatively the u 2 has been losing its power in decreasing e p in most regions of china due to the slowdown in the declining rates of wind speed this dynamic e p attribution process is worthy of continuous focus and systematic research keywords water surface evaporation variations effects quantification analytical derivation method china 1 introduction global change and its influences on natural and social system is a hot topic in the past decades as it has posed great challenges on related natural resources management and extreme hazards prevention ipcc 2014 the hydro cycle is more sensitive to environmental change than many other natural systems the water cycle processes including precipitation evaporation and runoff generation are subject to regional changes climate condition changes and watershed structure changes wherein evaporation playing a key role in land surface atmosphere interaction regional water and energy balance and watershed hydrological cycle has been experiencing remarkable changes during the past decades as reported globally cong et al 2008 peterson et al 1995 roderick and farquhar 2002 analyzing the variations and its driving factors of evaporation is of great significance especially in hydrological knowledge extension and water resources assessment during the past half century pan evaporation measured by pan evaporimeters and commonly taken to represent potential evaporation has decreased over most parts of the world brutsaert and parlange 1998 peterson et al 1995 roderick and farquhar 2002 with no exception of china lots of previous studies have reported decreasing tendencies in both pan observed evaporation and model estimated potential evapotranspiration across china liu et al 2004 cong et al 2008 liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 guan et al 2021 for example liu et al 2004 collected long term 1951 2000 d20 pan evaporation observation datasets from 85 national benchmark stations across china and found that the decrease of pan evaporation was statistically significant in most climatic regions of china similar results were also validated by liu et al 2010 yan and li 2015 yang and yang 2012 guan et al 2021 used fao56 penman monteith p m model to simulate the potential evapotranspiration at 175 meteorological stations of huang huai hai river basin and reported consistent decreasing tendencies of changing potential evapotranspiration with detected trends in other regions of china wang et al 2017a 2017b including but not limited to tibetan plateau xie and zhu 2013 yangtze river basin gong et al 2012 and poyang lake catchment ye et al 2015 overall the detected decline in pan evaporation is at odds with the expectation that the global warming should have accelerated the evaporation process and increase the potential evaporation cong et al 2008 wang et al 2017a 2017b many methods had been tested to explore the determining driving factors influencing evaporating process at both site and basin scale generally the correlation analysis approach regression analysis climate elasticity method and analytical derivation method were frequently implemented to construct the attribution of changing evaporation liu et al 2004 proposed that the decrease in solar irradiance was most likely the driving force for the reduced pan evaporation in china by calculating and comparing the changing rates and correlation coefficients of evaporation and possible influential climate variables zhang et al 2015 proposed that relative humidity was the principal influencing factor for pan evaporation decreases 1960 2005 especially in northwestern northern and northeastern china based on sensitivity analysis while the effect from relative humidity in southern china was relatively complex indicating other factors can have impacts on pan evaporation changes guan et al 2021 tended to use multiple linear regression and climate elasticity method to quantify the effects of changing weather fields like wind speed relative humidity sunshine duration and so on on evaporation variations the decline in evaporation is mainly subject to aerodynamic and irradiance factors wind speed and sunshine duration li et al 2013 2018 yang and yang 2012 you et al 2013 wang et al 2017a 2017b although different research regions historical periods and applied methods might bring about uncertainties in attribution results for example li et al 2013 found that the pan evaporation in the arid region of northwest china exhibited an obvious decreasing trend 6 0 mm a2 until early 1990s caused by decreasing wind speed and then the downward trend reversed in 1993 and the rate of increase after that was 10 7 mm a2 due to the increasing strength from vapor pressure deficit the results were also confirmed by wang et al 2017a 2017b that pan evaporation decreased in most parts of china at an average of about 2 60 mm a2 and this decrease disappeared around 1993 the similar characteristics of evaporation variations during different historical periods were also reported in huang huai hai river basin guan et al 2021 indicating that the influences of changing climate variables on evaporation variation was a dynamic process and the dominant driving force might vary during different historical periods furthermore the quantitative attribution researches were also constraint by the evaporation representations namely pan observed evaporation and model simulated potential evaporation the p m model was frequently implemented to estimate the potential evaporation and the attribution was conducted combined with relationship analysis or climate elasticity method gong et al 2012 guan et al 2021 wang et al 2017a 2017b xie and zhu 2013 ye et al 2015 on the other hand the long term pan d20 pan with a depth of 10 cm and a diameter of 20 cm in china evaporation observations were also used for variation attribution you et al 2013 and li et al 2018 used the penpan model to estimate the d20 pan evaporation and attributed the evaporation variations based on analytical derivation method in typical regions of southwest china and huai river basin respectively however most meteorological stations in china substituted the d20 pan with e601 pan after 1995 given that the d20 pan tended to overestimate the water surface evaporation which may lead to inconsistency in long term evaporation observations therefore the evaporation observation data assimilation was highly suggested before analyzing the changing characteristics and influential factors of evaporation variations fu et al 2004 liu et al 2017 ren et al 2002 sheng et al 2007 in this study the long term evaporation observation data from both d20 pan and e601 pan at national benchmark weather stations across china are collected in order to build up consistent long term 1961 2018 water surface evaporation dataset for changes detection and attribution the d20 pan evaporation data will be converted into e601 pan evaporation based on parallel observations then the performance of fao56 penman monteith model on water surface e601 evaporation estimation across china will be validated and the derivative method will be built up to quantify the effects of changing climate variables on evaporation variations the results from this method will also be compared with those from two climate elasticity methods given the temporal heterogeneity in evaporation changes the research periods will be divided into two stages according to mutation change test results to reveal the dominant forcing factors in evaporation variation respectively during different historical periods of interest 2 study area and data materials 2 1 study area in this study based on provincial level administrative region boundaries the mainland china was divided into 8 major climate zones see fig 1 namely northeast china north china east china central china south china southwest china northwest china and xinjiang zone and the main information of interest is listed in table 1 fig 1 also shows the spatial pattern of topography and land use across china the terrain of china is high in the west and low in the east showing a ladder distribution which to some extent determines the distribution of diversified land use types 2 2 data sources the daily data series of elemental weather fields including sunshine duration n relative humidity rh wind speed u and daily maximum minimum air temperature t max t min from 1961 to 2018 were provided by the national meteorological information center china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn which manages 699 national standard meteorological stations throughout the country in line with standard quality control methodology what s more the weather station also observed water evaporation by using two types of evaporation pan one is the d20 pan which is constructed from copper is cylindrical with a flat bottom cross sectional area of 314 cm2 and installed on a bracket with a depth of 10 cm and a diameter of 20 cm normally located 70 cm above the ground the other is e601 evaporation pan which is made of fiber reinforced polymer and is of cylindrical design with a surface area of 3000 cm2 and depth of 60 cm it is normally set in the soil with its rim 30 cm above the ground and with a cone shaped or a cylindrical shaped bottom and there is a needle ruler attached at the rim of the pan to measure water level change caused by evaporation wmo 2010 liu et al 2016 we also collected the net radiation data at 99 radiation observations from cma for radiation parameter calibration and validation in water surface evaporation estimation the locations of weather stations and radiation observation across in china are shown in fig 1 the statistical information of 8 zones like number of weather stations located in each zone is listed in table 11 2 3 data preprocessing weather stations are set up in different years in china most of which were established no earlier than 1961 and it is necessary to choose a uniform data period for consistent analysis of temporal tendencies of water surface evaporation therefore the research period is set as 1961 2018 in this study the weather station provides two types of evaporation observation from two evaporimeters d20 pan and e601 evaporation pan and the foundation and start observation time are different before 1970 s evaporation data were obtained mainly by observations of d20 pan across china since the 1970 s observations have been made at a few stations in non icing periods using both d20 and e601 evaporation pan according to the evaporation observation standards suggested by world meteorology organization in 1995 china meteorological administration substituted e601 evaporation pan for d20 evaporation pan at the national benchmark weather stations since e601 pan observation is much closer to actual water surface evaporation wmo 2010 ren et al 2002 sheng et al 2007 zhang and shi 2009 liu 2010 liu et al 2017 the assimilation of pan evaporations is a premise and basic work for analyzing spatial and temporal distribution of evaporation with long term data series in this study the parallel observations from two kinds of evaporation pans were carried out at most stations for more than 2 years before the d20 pans were cancelled ren et al 2002 sheng et al 2007 based on synchronous evaporation observations the conversion relationships between d20 and e601 pan evaporation can be investigated and the linear conversion coefficients can be computed for converting early e20 pan evaporation into e601 pan evaporation liu 2010 in the conversion procedure the evaporation conversion coefficients between d20 pan and e601 pan in each month are calculated directly for most of the stations with more than 3 years of parallel observations for a few stations with less than 3 years of synchronous observations or for stations without synchronous observations the conversion coefficients of adjacent stations are adopted alternatively liu 2010 after a series of preprocessing steps above 552 out of 699 national benchmark weather stations across china were finally selected and the early d20 pan evaporation observations are all converted into e601 pan evaporation to form a complete long term 1961 2018 and consistent evaporation observation dataset the locations of selected weather stations and spatial pattern of mean annual water surface evaporation were shown in fig 1 a and c respectively 3 method description 3 1 trend test methods both the linear regression model and the mann kendall rank test mk test are commonly used methods to test the linear trend of climatic variables while the later could provide the significance of variation trend the tendency rate estimated by linear regression method is denoted as s slope hereinafter the mk test is a non parametric distribution free method to detect trends of time series with minimal assumptions guan et al 2018 lv et al 2019 and has been widely applied to test trends in hydrological and meteorological series all over the world the mann kendall rank test statistic index u so called mk value follows the standard normal distribution the positive or negative of the u value determines the upward and downward of the trend the statistic u is under the null hypothesis of no trend when number of series increases the null hypothesis in this test is that there is no significant trend in the time series at the significance level of α if u u α 2 where u α 2 is the critical value of the standard normal distribution with a probability exceeding α 2 then the null hypothesis is rejected namely the trend is significant given α 0 05 then u α 2 1 96 3 2 pettitt s test this method proposed by pettitt 1979 is a non parametric approach to the change point problem in this function the test is implemented as given by verstraeten et al 2006 where the ranks r 1 r n of the x 1 x n are used for the statistic 1 u k 2 i 1 k r i k n 1 k 1 2 n the test statistic is the maximum of the absolute value of the vector 2 u ˆ max u k the probable change point denoted as ck is located where u ˆ has its maximum the approximate probability for a two sided test is calculated according to p 2 e 6 k 2 n 3 n 2 3 3 fao56 penman monteith model for water surface evaporation estimation generally pan evaporation data when combined with an appropriate pan coefficient or with an adjustment for the energy exchange through the sides and bottom of the tank can be considered to be open water evaporation allen et al 1980 dingman 2015 jensen 2010 khobragade et al 2019 for example fuentes et al 2020 implemented the fao56 penman monteith p m equation combined with a constant crop factor to estimate the free surface water evaporation liu 2010 suggested the constant scaling factor from fao56 estimates to surface water evaporation to be 1 in most regions of china which is also adopted in this study to attribute the changing water surface evaporation

of the variations in the e p trend we followed roderick et al 2007 and calculated the first order differential of eq 3 as follows 20 d e p dt e p f t max d t max dt f t min d t min dt f u 2 d u 2 dt f rh drh dt f n dn dt t max t m in u 2 rh n the changes of e p e p could be attributed to the changes in the daily maximum t max f t max d t max dt minimum t min f t min d t min dt air temperature wind speed u 2 f u 2 d u 2 dt relative humidity rh f rh drh dt and sunshine hours n f n dn dt with f x e p x x t max t min u 2 rh n when calculating the contribution of each variable the other variables were assumed to remain constant at their long term means as the relationship of e p between and climatic variables are given by p m model then f x can be derived mathematically see appendix a for detailed equations in this study we also estimate the effect of climatic variables on e p using the method of climate elasticity of streamflow proposed by schaake and waggoner 1990 the elasticity coefficient ɛ of e p is defined by the proportional change in e p divided by the proportional change in a climatic variable x such as rh or t max and the elasticity coefficient is expressed as 21 ε x de p e p dx x where ε x is the sensitivity coefficient of e p with respect to climatic variable x it is clear that ε x f x x e p then the eq 20 can be rewritten as 22 d e p dt ε t max e p t max d t max dt ε t min e p t min d t min dt ε u 2 e p u 2 d u 2 dt ε rh e p rh drh dt ε n e p n dn dt sankarasubramanian et al 2001 proposed a nonparametric approach to estimate the climate elasticity directly from observed data and median descriptive statistics was also used to overcome numeric problem which was expressed as 23 ε x median e p e p x x median e p e p e p x x x where δ e p and δ x are the changes of annual e p and climatic variable with respect to long term average of e p e p and climate factors x respectively zheng et al 2009 proposed an alternative nonparametric estimator of climate elasticity to overcome the problem associated with small sample size and rewrite eq 21 as 24 δ e p e ε x δ x x thus the sensitivity coefficient of e p can be regarded as the linear regression coefficient between d e p e p and dx x using the least squares estimator the sensitivity coefficient can be estimated as 25 ε x x e p x x e p e p x x 2 ρ x e p c e p c x where ρ x e p is the correlation coefficient of x i and e p c e p and c x are variation coefficients of x and e p basically a positive negative sensitivity coefficient value of a climatic variable indicates that e p will increase decrease as the variable increase decrease the larger the sensitivity coefficient the larger effect a given variable has on e p 4 results and discussion 4 1 dynamic variations of meteorological variables and e p fig 2 shows the temporal variation of observed water surface evaporation e p and the main influencing weather variables across china during the research period of 1961 2018 together with the variations of changing rates slope of the climatic fields computed by implementing a 11 year window which can reveal the positive or negative tendency of climate variables during different research periods of interest furthermore the changing tendency of key variables at each weather station is also tested by using both linear regression approach and mann kendall test and the results are shown in fig 3 it can be found in fig 2 that an overall decreasing trend was detected in e p across china with the average declining rate of 0 601 mm a2 during the long term period of 1961 2018 however the evolution tendency decreasing is not continuous throughout the research period of interest as a significant decreasing tendency can be observed in e p before 1995 and then the trend was reversed until 2008 from the prospective of spatial pattern of e p variation trend see fig 3 more than half weather stations show decreasing trend of e p throughout the research period of 1961 2018 while there are some stations with slightly increasing trends of e p mostly located in southern region of xj zone northeast part of xn zone and northeast region of china continuous upward trends are detected in both daily maximum t max and minimum t min air temperature in china especially after 1985 and the warming rates in northern china are significantly higher than those in southern china as shown in fig 3 therefore the trends of e p are not completely consistent with the warming trend throughout the research period indicating that the variations of e p are subject to more than air temperature but other climate variables it can be seen from fig 2 b d that a remarkable decreasing tendency was observed in both wind speed u 2 and sunshine duration n before 2000 after which the changing rates were much smaller and fluctuated at the low level the relative humidity rh presented a slight fluctuating downward trend across china see fig 3c and the trends were more significant in hb zone and southern zones of china while in some weather station of northeast and northwest china db zone and xj zone the changing tendencies of rh were not significant and several stations showed increasing trends of rh as the e p and the main influencing climate variables have not shown completely consistent variation characteristics during the entire research period of 1961 2018 it may be necessary to divide the research period into different historical stages and to identify the main driving climate variables affecting the variations of e p in china then in this study the pettitt s test was applied to detect the abrupt changes in the entire e p series to probably partition the period of 1961 2018 into two historical stages namely the period before the e p mutation year pre ck and the period after the detected abrupt changing point post ck the temporal and spatial distribution pattern of pettitt s test results ck and its significance are shown in fig 4 a and d then the changing tendencies of e p in the periods before and after the ck are investigated respectively with the results also shown in fig 4 it can be found that the mutations in e p variations mostly occurred in the period range of 1980 2000 and 371 out of 552 weather stations experienced significant e p abrupt changes with p values in pettitt s test lower than 0 05 in term of spatial pattern most weather stations in db hn hz and xb zones of china tended to experience the e p abrupt changes earlier than other zones mostly in the 1980 s according to the e p trends test results in the two historical stages see fig 4b c and e f near 70 weather stations experienced decreasing trends of e p during the period of pre ck while after the abrupt changing years post ck only 45 3 weather stations shows decreasing trends in e p and the downward tendencies were not significant and decreasing rates were much smaller than those during pre ck periods as can be seen in fig 4 b and c from the perspective of spatial heterogeneity e p in db zone and hb zone showed negative tendency during both the pre ck and post ck periods the difference between these two historical stages were not obvious for hd zone e p showed decreasing trends during the pre ck periods while the downward trends were alleviated with average changing rates close to 0 during the post ck periods for the rest 5 zones in china most weather station observed increasing tendencies in e p in the last 3 decades rather than decreasing trends throughout the entire research period especially in xj zone the increasing trends were remarkable therefore the e p variation across china was more a dynamic process than a uniformly continuously decreasing process and the main influencing climate variables and their contributions may differ during different historical periods 4 2 validation of the p m model in water surface evaporation e p estimation in this study before the p m model can be implemented to estimate the water surface evaporation e p and to partition the contributions from 5 climate variables to e p variations the p m model should be well validated across china in p m model for estimating net radiation solar radiation is calculated by an empirical equation involving the sunshine duration daily maximum and minimum air temperature with two parameters a s and b s allen et al 1980 the default values for a s and b s are 0 25 and 0 5 respectively but it is highly suggested that these two parameters should be calibrated based on observed radiation flux data before implementation guan et al 2021 yang et al 2006 therefore these two radiation parameters a s and b s are calibrated based on 10 years 2005 2004 net radiation data series observed at 99 radiation stations across china the evaluation indices including nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 correlation coefficient cc mean square root error rmse and relative error re are selected to evaluate the model performance in net radiation estimation these 4 indices are frequently used in hydrological modeling evaluation guan et al 2020 and normally a good estimation result will have nse and cc approaching to 1 rmse and re close to 0 the spatial distribution of calibrated radiation parameters at 99 radiation observations is shown in fig 5 together with the statistical results of evaluation indices it can be seen in fig 5 that higher a s values tend to locate in western and northern regions of china and the a s values are lower than the default value 0 25 the values of parameter b s are mainly located in the range of 0 5 0 55 as for calibration results net radiation estimation performance is pretty good at the 99 stations across china with most nse values over 0 8 cc higher than 0 9 rmse no more than 3 mj m2 and re in the range of 1 then the radiation parameters a s and b s at the selected 552 weather stations can be obtained by using kriging interpolation method based on the calibration results and consequently the p m evaporation are calculated and compared with long term assimilated e p data similarly the 4 evaluation indices nse cc rmse and re are also used to validate the performance of p m model in water surface evaporation estimation both spatial distribution and statistical results of evaluation indices in p m model validation across china are shown in fig 6 in addition fig 7 gives the long term variations of observed and p m model estimated e p in 8 climate zones and fig 8 shows the mean annual monthly comparison overall p m model shows good performance in e p estimation in china with most nse values over 0 7 cc more than 0 8 rmse under 30 mm month and re located in the range of 5 3 most weather station across china have nse values around 0 8 except at some stations in northeast parts of xn zone and southeast coastal areas of china hn zone by calculating and comparing the zonal average e p in 8 climate zones the estimated e p by p m model matched well with observed e p and the corresponding standard deviations were also well correlated in addition p m model can also estimate mean annual monthly e p process in 8 climate zones across china very well although tended to a little underestimate the e p in seasons from october to december in hd hn hz zone nonetheless the fitting precision by p m model in this study was quite high relative to the results from previous similar studies on attribution of evaporation variations li et al 2018 yang and yang 2012 4 3 attribution analysis of changes in e p in this study we built up the derivative method to attribute the effects of changing climate fields including wind speed u 2 relative humidity rh sunshine duration n daily maximum t max and minimum t min air temperature the attribution results are also compared with the results from two elasticity methods namely sankarasubramanian et al 2001 and zheng et al 2009 method fig 9 and fig 10 show the comparison between observed e p variations changing tendency calculated by linear regression method denoted as o e p with the unit of mm a2 and estimated e p variations denoted as e e p by three methods in both china and 8 climate zones throughout the entire research period of 1961 2018 it can be found that the derivative method showed good performance in changing tendency estimation of e p across china although represented a little systematic deviation in xb and xj zone of china overall the e e p by derivative method correlated much better with o e p than e e p from two elasticity methods did both the sankarasubramanian 2001 and zheng 2009 elasticity method tended to overestimated the e p variations across china a possible reason for the misestimation is the relatively small sample size which leads to a relatively large error in the climate elasticity zheng et al 2009 climate elasticity given in eq 23 was tested and found to be robust through monte carlo experiments for three catchments in the united states sankarasubramanian et al 2001 compared with eqs 23 and 25 which require large amounts of observed historical climatic data the analytical derivation method in this study can estimate climate elasticity based only on the mean annual climate fields yang and yang 2011 therefore the derivative method is the best choice and selected here to quantify the effects of changing climate variables on e p variations across china fig 11 shows the spatial pattern of contributions from 5 climate fields to e p variations across china during the research period of 1961 2018 together with the statistical results as can be seen that the effects of changing rh and t max tended to intensify the water surface evaporation while other 3 influential climate variables tended to reduce the evaporation with negative contributions in most regions of china e p variations in northern zones of china were more sensitive to the changes in t max than southern zones while t min was more influential in western regions of china like xj xn and parts of xb zone compared with other 3 climate variables the changes in air temperature showed not significant influence in e p variations with absolute contributions absolute values of t max and t min no more than 1 mm a2 during the period of interest as shown in fig 11 d f as for the other 3 climate fields the decreasing sunshine duration n and wind speed u 2 had posed more power on e p decreasing than relative humidity rh although slightly declining rh see fig 2c and fig 3c had posed positive effects and accelerated the evaporation of water most weather stations across china experienced downward e p trends during the period of 1961 2018 due to the combined effects of climate condition variations including decreasing u 2 and n as for the spatial pattern of contributions from the 3 main influential climate variables the decreasing u 2 had shown more power on e p changes in northern regions of china especially in xj hb and db zone the effects of changing u 2 in southern zones of china were relatively weak with much lower u 2 values in the southeast climate zones of china including hz hd and hn zone rh and n were the dominant influential factors in dynamics of e p overall the decreasing n and u 2 could explain the downward e p trends across china to a large degree during the entire research period from the results of fig 11 f though the spatial pattern of variations of e p across china in fig 3 a were not very consistent with those of n and u 2 in fig 11 therefore in order to partition the effects quantitatively and identify the main influential climate variables on e p variations in different historical periods the derivative method was also implemented at the periods both before and after the e p abrupt change point ck based on the pettitt s test results shown in fig 4 at each weather station respectively fig 12 shows the boxplot statistical results of the contributions from 5 climate fields to changing e p at different historical stages and fig 13 gives the spatial pattern of contributions from 3 main influential climate variables namely u 2 n and rh exempted with the spatial distribution of contributions from air temperature variations for manuscript clarity due to their relatively weak influential power on e p variations in most regions of china as shown in both fig 11 and fig 12 as shown in fig 12 that the boxplot statistical results of contributions from changing climate variables to e p variations in two different historical periods quite differed with each other as in climate zone of db hb xb and hz mostly northern regions of china see fig 13 the effects of changing sunshine duration n on e p variations had not shown significant changes while in hd and hn zone the decreasing effects of n had seen a weaken trend during the period of post ck and in zone of xj and xn western regions of china the changing n tended to increase the water evaporation after the cks as for the changes of contributions from relative humidity rh between the two different periods rh had shown an increasing trend in most regions of china during the second historical period especially in the xj and xn climate zone with higher absolute values than those in the periods before cks compared with other influential variables wind speed u 2 showed more spatial heterogeneity in contributing to the e p variations across china during the two research periods pre and post ck during the pre ck periods 63 6 of the total 552 weather stations experienced the negative u 2 across china and 21 6 shown significant downward trends mk 1 96 the spatial distribution of weather stations with negative u 2 across china seems to be very consistent with those with decreasing e p shown in fig 4 b during the research period of post cks only 57 2 of the weather stations experienced the decreasing trends of e p and no more than 10 was significant indicating that the u 2 has been losing its power in decreasing e p in most regions of china especially in western parts due to the slowdown in the declining rates of wind speed 4 4 discussion overall the dynamic of e p variations in different climate zones of china is a complicated and multivariate influencing process among the selected 5 key climate variables the e p is less sensitive to air temperature changes at the long term scale although it plays a key role in p m evaporation model calculation at daily scale in this study we used pettitt s test to divide the entire research periods into two different historical periods to study the variations of effects of climate variables on e p and identify the dominant factor in different historical stages which may introduce uncertainty because of the spatial heterogeneity in mutation change points across china in order to investigate the dynamic process of contributions from three main influencing factors n u 2 and rh a 11 year window was applied to calculate the contributions to the changing e p at each weather station during the whole research period of 1961 2018 the dynamic variations of the contributions zonal average and standard deviation can be seen in fig 14 it can be found that in the northern china namely hb db xj and xb u 2 played the dominant and negative role in changing tendencies of e p during the period of 1970 1990 with much lower average contribution values than other two climatic factors while after 1990 the contributions from u 2 to e p variations tended to increase and approach to zero indicating that the influence of changing u 2 on e p has been weakened in the past two decades comparatively in the southern zones hd hn and xn of china the variations of contributions from u 2 showed no remarkable changing trends with much smaller standard deviations than those in northern zones and the changes in n dominated the dynamic process of e p instead showing an increasing power as for the dynamic influence put by rh on e p during the research period the contributions from changing rh to e p were small with slight fluctuations and steady standard deviations while after 2000 the rh showed increasing strength on e p especially in the db hb hd hn and hz zone the influences of main climatic factors on e p variations and the contributions were not steady and the advantage factor also changed during different climate contexts this dynamic e p attribution process is worthy of continuous focus and systematic research on the other hand the e p variation attribution research in this study was conducted at the long term scale for each weather station based on observed annual data series the evaporation variation attribution in derivative method is highly subject to e p estimation from p m model the p m model may cannot fully represent the observed water surface evaporation in parts of china with special climate conditions as two important parameters in p m model the radiation parameters a s and b s are not only spatially heterogeneous but also subject to interannual climate variabilities as liu et al 2021 highly suggested that a s and b s should better be calibrated at monthly scale especially in the southwest china qinghai tibet plateau zone xn additionally the annual changing tendencies of e p is composed of the variations at the seasonal scale and the climate condition in mainland china is governed by different circulation systems during different seasons like western pacific subtropical high in summer and siberia high in winter in the context of climate warming the interannual variations of circulation systems can greatly influence the weather systems and the key climatic variables like e p so it is also of great significance to conduct the attribution analysis at the sub annual scale for better understanding the evolution of water surface evaporation 5 conclusion evaporation plays a key role in atmosphere land surface interaction and water cycle system meanwhile its variation is also an important indicator of climate system change in this study the long term data series of water surface evaporation e p were assimilated across china with the observations from 552 national benchmark weather stations the trends of e p and the influential climate variables were well detected the derivative method was built up in this study to quantitatively attribute the effects from different climate fields to e p variations the attribution results were also compared with those from two statistical climate elasticity methods most weather stations had experienced the decreasing trends of e p during the entire research period of 1961 2018 which were mainly attributed to the decrease in wind speed u 2 together with sunshine duration n and relative humidity rh although air temperature plays an important role in daily evaporation estimation and both daily maximum and minimum air temperature had shown significant rising trends across china the effects of regional warming were less influential on e p variations at the long term scale the comparison results between different attribution methods show that the two statistically based climate elasticity method tended to overestimate the e p variations due to limited series length the analytical derivation method built in this study was more suitable and efficient the variations of e p attributed to three main influential climate variables u 2 n and rh across china had also shown different tendency patterns during different historical research periods according to the abrupt changes detection results from pettitt s method the effects of n on decreasing e p had seen a weaken trend in most southeast zones of china while tended to increase the water evaporation especially in xinjiang zone the rh had shown increasing power on e p variations in most regions of china especially in the western china climate zones comparatively the u 2 has been losing its power in decreasing e p in most regions of china due to the slowdown in the declining rates of wind speed overall the e p variation is a complicated and dynamic process driven by combined effects of different changing climate variables which deserves continuous focus and
