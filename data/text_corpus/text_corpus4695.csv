23475,a design procedure of contra rotating azimuth propulsor crap is developed based on vortex theory coupled with low order potential based panel method the forward propeller fp and rear propeller rp are designed using the written computer code with the pod unit pu which includes the pod body and the strut being given first the hydrodynamic interactions among fp rp and pu are considered through induced velocities which are calculated using panel method a conventional propeller cp supplying the same thrust with crap at the same inflow velocity is designed to analyze the energy saving performance of crap the case study shows that at design condition crap has a decrease in delivered power by approximately 8 compared with cp the tangential induced velocities in the slipstream indicate that crap recovers the rotational energy of slipstream effectively the open water characteristics of crap are also analyzed systematically keywords crap design vortex theory panel method induced velocity hydrodynamic performance 1 introduction nowadays energy saving and greenhouse gas reduction are the main themes of the times therefore reducing fuel consumption and building green ships have been the important subjects of marine industry researchers around the world osborne 2012 as the most important energy consumption device propulsors having high propulsive efficiency are of great significance for building green ships to the authors knowledge the conventional propulsion systems in which the propeller is driven by a diesel are still used by most ships the conventional propulsion system cannot meet the need of modern green ship constructions for its disadvantages such as low propulsive efficiency and high emissions with the development of motor technology the electrical propulsion shows significant advantages over traditional propulsion and better conforms to the design requirements of green ships for controlling environmental pollution jukola and ronkainen 2006 the azimuthing podded drive azipod systems have been widely used in the marine industry for the last decade in this system an electrical motor is located inside a steerable pod housing that drives a propeller the total unit is hung below the stern of ship by a strut and can be rotated through 360 around its vertical axis therefore the forces generated in any direction supply better maneuverability researchers around the world have carried out numerical and experimental researches to predict the hydrodynamic characteristics about azipod gupta 2004 bal and güner 2009 ghassemi and ghadimi 2008 korsström et al 2015 gierusz 2015 tuulio 2016 however the achievements of present researches show that azipod just has limited increase in propulsive efficiency compared with conventional propellers because of the resistance of the pod body and strut at present the contra rotating propellers or crp s are commonly accepted as the propulsor having the highest propulsive efficiency in marine industry and have been widely used by underwater vehicles however the complex shafting and expensive installation cost make crp not suitable for large scale vessels lee et al 2014 the contra rotating azimuth propulsor crap consists of the forward propeller fp rear propeller rp and pod unit pu which includes the pod body and the strut in this paper the two propellers driven by two independent motor modules in pu ensure enough redundancy in all situations fp and rp rotating in opposite directions can achieve the energy saving effect of crp therefore crap offers the benefit of high propulsive efficiency and operational safety kuuskoski and holmsten 2001 the layout of crap at ship stern is given in fig 1 in which the x axis points downstream z axis points upward and the y axis is determined through right hand rule at present steerprop ltd from finland has designed crap systems which have been successfully applied to several kinds of ships however we have not found research literature about crap in order to obtain crap systems with higher propulsive efficiency it is indeed imperative that we use reliable procedures in the design and performance analysis of crap in an attempt to meet these needs the lifting line theory and lifting surface theory improved by koichi 2013 are adopted for crap design and the low order potential based panel method is used for the hydrodynamic performance analysis the energy saving performance of crap is studied through comparing the delivered power of the designed crap with that of a corresponding conventional propeller at design condition at last the open water performance of crap is analyzed 2 theoretical methods 2 1 vortex theory for propeller design the optimum forward and rear propellers of crap are designed through vortex theory with the pod unit being given first the vortex theory includes the lifting line theory and lifting surface theory the lifting line method is generally used for the preliminary design of propellers and the lifting surface theory used for the designed propeller modification as the determination of circulation distribution is the key point of propeller design the calculation of circulation distribution is presented in general the velocity induced by a vortex filament can be computed via the biot savard law 1 u 1 4 π d γ d r 0 d r 0 l ρ d l ρ 3 where γ is the circulation distribution of the bound vortex which is arranged in the radial direction other parameters of eq 1 are identified in fig 2 d l is a segment of the trailing vortex and ρ is the vector from the vortex segment to the field point p at which the induced velocity is calculated for a z bladed propeller the axial and tangential induced velocities are only considered integrating the influence of the trailing vortex shed from each radius r 0 eq 1 can be recast as 2 u a t r 1 4 π r h r p d γ d r 0 i a t r r 0 d r 0 where u a and u t are the axial and tangential velocities induced at r r h and r p are the radius of the propeller hub and tip respectively the induction factors i a and i t follow from the equations for the velocities induced by constant pitch and constant radius helical vortices kawada 1936 hardin 1982 the circulation distribution form ψ r is known a priori and the circulation distribution γ r can be written as 3 γ r k ψ r where k is an unknown constant eq 2 can be rearranged as follow 4 u a t r k 4 π r h r p d ψ r d r 0 i a t r r 0 d r 0 the designed propeller needs to generate the thrust t demanded under the design condition the ideal thrust coefficient c t i can be defined as 5 c t i t 1 2 ρ v 0 2 π r p 2 4 z k v 0 r p r h r p ψ r 2 π n r u t d r substituting eq 4 into eq 5 the following quadratic equation in k can be obtained 6 2 z r h r p ψ r r h r p d ψ r 0 d r 0 i t r r 0 d r 0 d r k 2 8 z π n v 0 r p r h r p ψ r r d r k c t i 0 the induction factors i a and i t are functions of the hydrodynamic pitch angle ε i r which is calculated through eq 7 7 ε i r arctan v 0 1 ω x r u a r 2 π n r u t r where v 0 ω x r denote the undisturbed axial inflow velocity and axial wake fraction at the radius r respectively n is the rotational speed of propeller the circulation distribution γ r is determined through iterative calculation at the first iteration the hydrodynamic pitch angle ε i 1 r takes the approximate value a r c t a n 1 ω x r v 0 2 π n r and i a and i t are calculated then k 1 is obtained using eq 6 the new hydrodynamic pitch angle ε i 2 r can be obtained by pluging k 1 i a and i t into eqs 4 and 7 repeat the above calculation until the results converge the circulation distribution the hydrodynamic pitch angle and the induced velocities u a and u t can be determined through above calculation then calculating the thickness chamber and the chord length of blade the geometry of propeller blade can be determined considering the blade stress and cavitation with the aid of lifting surface corrections fig 3 gives the detailed design procedure for a single propeller 2 2 panel method description we consider a lifting body whose boundary is ω b in a single closed fluid domain ω with outside boundary ω as shown in fig 4 ω w ω w denote the upper face and lower face of the wake boundary respectively the total boundary ω is defined as the union of ω b ω ω w and ω w the undisturbed inflow velocity is v 0 the unit normal vectors n on ω b and ω are oriented into ω the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid and the flow is considered to be irrotational define p as a variable point within ω and q as a fixed point located on ω the perturbation velocity potential ϕ at point p is the solution of the following laplace equation 8 2 ϕ p 0 applying green s theorem the perturbation velocity potential can be expressed as follows 9 4 π ς φ p ω φ q g p q n q g p q φ q n q d s where g denotes the green s function in the case of unbounded three dimensional fluid domain g is given as 10 g g p q 1 r p q with r p q being the distance between points p and q ς in equation 9 has values as follows ς 1 if p lies in the flow field but not on ω ς 1 2 if p lies on ω ς 0 if p lies outside ω taking into account the boundary conditions 11 φ q 0 as ω 12 φ q n q v 0 n q q ω b furthermore the wake surface is considered as an infinitely thin domain where both sides of the surfaces coincide kinematic and dynamic conditions in the wake imply that there is not any flow and pressure jump across the wake surface ω w 13 δ φ q n q ω w φ q n q ω w φ q n q ω w 0 14 δ p ω w p ω w p ω w 0 taking into account the above boundary conditions eq 9 can be rearranged as 15 4 π ς φ p ω b φ q n q 1 r p q v 0 n q 1 r p q d s ω w δ φ q n q 1 r p q d s where δ ϕ is the velocity potential jump on the wake surface ω w the propeller surface and wake sheet is discretized with hyperboloidal panels a constant source and a constant dipole are then distributed on each panel for unsteady calculation the integral eq 15 is solved at each time step and time dependent terms are updated at the next time step eq 8 can be discretized as follows 16 j 1 n p a i j φ j n m 1 n r w i m 1 δ φ m 1 n r h s i n i 1 2 n p r h s i n z 1 n b j 1 n p b

the number of chordwise panels n r is the number of spanwise panels n p 2 n c n r is the total number of panels of a blade and n w is the number of chordwise panels in the wake the influence coefficients a i j z and b i j z are defined as the potentials induced at panel i by unit constant strength dipole and source distributions respectively located at panel j on blade z the wake influence coefficients w i m l z are defined similarly the specific definitions of the influence coefficients are given in the dissertation of hsin 1990 and the influence coefficients are calculated through morino s method morino et al 1975 the velocity potential ϕ of the key blade of propeller is calculated through eq 16 at time step n the left terms of eq 16 are unknown and the right terms are given through iteration and assignment the detailed process of iteration and assignment is given by hsin 1990 the induced velocities can be obtained by differentiating the resulting velocity potential and the pressure distribution is calculated through bernoulli s equation for the hydrodynamic performance calculation of pu the strut is a lifting body while the pod body is treated as a nonlifting body the hydrodynamic performance of the strut is calculated using the same method with propeller as the pod body is nonlifting the dipoles on the panels of pod body are set to zero so just a constant source is distributed on each panel of the pod body the strut and the pod body are treated as an integral in the process of hydrodynamic performance prediction of crap the interferences among the different components of crap are considered through induced velocities the induced velocities from propellers are calculated at each time step during unsteady hydrodynamic performance predictions as pu is at rest the induced velocities of fp and rp at the panel centroids of pu are averaged over one propeller revolution what s more since the relative positions of fp and rp are specified at any time step the induced velocities between fp and rp are calculated at the corresponding panel centroids at each time step therefore the induced velocities of fp at the panel centroids of rp are different at different time steps and those of rp at the panel centroids of fp have the same situation as the pod unit is up down asymmetric the induced velocities from the pod unit are considered as the non uniform wake in which the unsteady hydrodynamic performance predictions of propellers are carried out the hydrodynamic performance coefficients of crap can be defined as follows j v 0 n d f k t f t f ρ n 2 d f 4 k q f q f ρ n 2 d f 5 η f k t f k q f j 2 π k t r t r ρ n 2 d f 4 k q r q r ρ n 2 d f 5 η r k t r k q r j 2 π t s t f t r r p o d where t q k t k q and η represent thrust torque thrust coefficient torque coefficient and propulsive efficiency respectively d is the propeller diameter the subscript f denote the forward propeller and r the rear propeller r p o d is the resistance of pu n is the rotational speed of crap t s is the total thrust of crap j is the advance coefficient the delivered power representing the fuel directly consumed by a propeller is used to indicate the energy consumption level of propellers in this paper the delivered powers of the forward and rear propellers of crap as well as that of cp can be calculated as follows d p f 2 π q f n d p r 2 π q r n d p z d p f d p r d p c 2 π q c n c where d p f d p r represent the delivered powers of the forward and rear propellers of crap d p z denotes the total delivered power of crap d p c is the delivered power of cp n c and q c represent the rotational speed and the torque of cp respectively 3 crap design 3 1 design procedure the design system of crap is established by combining the vortex theory and panel method fig 5 gives the detailed design procedure the pod unit pu is given first and the forward propeller fp and rear propeller rp are designed theoretically in step a of fig 5 the induced velocities from pu and rp are not considered in the first design process and performance prediction of fp the induced velocities of rp and pu in step f include the induced velocities used for fp design at the design points of fp and those used for the hydrodynamic performance prediction at the panel centroids of the newest designed fp the induced velocities of rp at the panel centroids of pu are also calculated in step f the rear propeller diameter d r is determined through analyzing the fp slipstream and the tip radius of rear propeller is set equal to the radius of the contracted slipstream of fp at the rear propeller disk in step c the contraction ratio of the fp slipstream at the rp disc is δ the rp diameter can be determined as d r δ d f in step d the induced velocities from fp are considered during the performance prediction and induced velocity calculation of pu while those from rp are not considered in the first design iteration during the design and hydrodynamic performance prediction of rp the induced velocities from fp and pu are considered in step e the initial input data of propellers is adjusted until the total thrust t s of crap reach the required thrust 3 2 design results the crap is designed in uniform flow with the inflow velocity v 0 being 10 m s the forward propeller fp diameter d f is 3 2 m and the rotational speeds of fp and the rear propeller rp are both 4 464 rps therefore the design advance coefficient is j 0 7 fp has 3 blades and rp 4 blades the shaft depth is 4 0 m the designed crap is aimed for a thrust of 590 kn the thrust ratio of fp and rp is t f t r 1 25 at design condition fp is a right handed propeller and rp a left handed propeller this paper has theoretical designs about fp and rp with the pod unit pu being given first table 1 gives the main parameters of pu whose strut adopts symmetric aerofoil naca0012 study of boswell 1971 shows that a propeller with skew can have better cavitation performance and smaller force fluctuating amplitude however the propeller skew ought not to be too large considering the blade strength especially for a large scale propeller in order to strike a balance between the propeller strength and the propulsive performance the designed propellers both have a maximum skew of 12 in addition the existence of rear rake can effectively restrain the blade tip vortices which can have severe impingement on the devices behind the propeller the propellers designed in this paper both have a rear rake of 15 both fp and rp adopt the modified naca66 section with a 0 8 for the determinations of the chord and thickness distributions along the radial direction the non cavitating condition is considered the slipstream contraction ratio δ of fp at the rp disc is 0 91 so the rp diameter d r is 2 912 m the design result is given in fig 6 the slipstreams of the key blade of fp and the strut are displayed the slipstream of fp is arranged clinging to the pod body as pu and rp are installed within the slipstream of fp the influence coefficients of fp slipstream may have singularity when the panel centroids of fp slipstream get too close to those of pu and rp what s more the singularity occurs when the panel centroids of strut slipstream and rp get too close as shown in fig 6 b it is assumed that the singular influence coefficient appears when the distance between two panel centroids is less than one hundredth of the length of relevant blade or strut panel diagonal this paper ignores the singular influence coefficients of fp slipstream and strut slipstream directly as skimming individual singular influence coefficient has little effect on the hydrodynamic performance calculation liu 2013 what s more the influence from the slipstream panels are not considered when the panel centroids of slipstream are inside the strut or rp for better understanding about the energy saving performance of the designed crap this paper designs a conventional propeller cp which can generate the same thrust with the integrated propulsion system at the same design condition using the design procedure given in fig 3 as the propeller diameter is limited cp has the same diameter and rotational speed with fp fig 7 gives the designed cp and table 2 gives the main parameters of cp as well as those of fp and rp it can be known that cp has significantly lager disc ratio compared with fp and rp in order to have a better understanding about the effect of pu on fp and rp as well as the mutual perturbations between fp and rp fig 8 gives the induced velocities of pu at fp and rp discs the induced velocities of fp at rp disc and those of rp at fp disc v i x and v i p denote the axial and cross induced velocities respectively the velocities are divided by the inflow velocity v 0 to express them in non dimensional forms the arrows represent the non dimensional cross induced velocities and the axial induced velocity components along the propeller axis are represented by contour plots it can be known from fig 8 a and b that the existence of pu changes the inflow velocity of fp and rp to some extent the pu produces axial induced velocities in the direction opposite to the inflow velocity v 0 as pu impedes water flow the induced velocities are left and right symmetrical the strut of pod has a significant influence on the velocity field the cross induced velocities of pu at rp disc direct inward with respect to the hub from the external flow field while those at fp disc have totally opposite direction in the process of design and hydrodynamic performance calculation of propellers the induced velocities between fp and rp are calculated at the design points and panel centroids of propellers in order to have a more intuitive understanding about the mutual perturbation between fp and rp fig 8 c and d briefly give the induced velocity of fp at rp disc and that of rp at fp disc as rp works in the slipstream of fp fp has strong disturbance at rp disc given that fp is a right handed propeller the cross induced velocities of fp at rp disc are in clockwise direction viewing from downstream the induced velocities of fp at rp firstly increase and then decrease with the radius increasing as fp located upstream rp fp is less affected by rp the cross induced velocities of rp at fp disc direct inward with respect to the hub from the external flow field as the rp rotation effect doesn t work at fp disc it can be known from the above analysis that the effective inflow velocity superposition of initial inflow velocity and induced velocities given in fig 8 of rp is significantly larger than that of fp therefore the geometric pitch angles of rp are obviously larger than those of fp as shown in fig 9 4 performance analysis 4 1 results at design condition the combined propulsor crap and the corresponding cp are both designed to produce 590 kn at j 0 7 this section has hydrodynamic performance predictions of the designed crap and cp at design condition respectively and the hydrodynamic performance of crap is predicted considering the interferences among fp rp and pu table 3 gives the time averaged hydrodynamic forces and delivered powers of cp and the three components of crap over one revolution the total thrust of crap is the summation of the thrusts of fp rp and pu and the total delivered power of crap is the summation of the delivered powers of fp and rp it can be known that the designed crap has a decrease in delivered power by 8 03 compared with the designed cp what s more the electrical transmission efficiency of crap is much higher than the energy transmission efficiency of combustion engine therefore the designed crap has more potential for fuel saving compared with cp according to fig 8 pu generates non uniform induced velocities at fp and rp discs in order to investigate the effect of this non uniformity on the hydrodynamic performances of fp and rp this paper gives the thrust and torque coefficients of the key blades of fp and rp as shown in fig 10 the key blade of fp rotates clockwise from y axis and that of rp rotates anticlockwise from y axis viewing from downstream it can be known from fig 10 that the hydrodynamic coefficients of the key blades of fp and rp change with the angular position in uniform flow owing to the mutual interferences among the three components fp rp and pu of crap the maximum values occur at φ 270 12 o clock position the overall amplitudes of the thrust and torque of rp are significantly smaller than those of the thrust and torque of fp what s more the thrust and torque of rp have obvious local oscillations while those of fp are much smoother this can be explained that the existence of pu causes a reduction in the axial inflow velocity see fig 8 a b the induced velocities from pu in the upper parts of fp and rp discs are significantly smaller than those in the lower parts and the minimum values appear at 12 o clock positions in fig 8 a b this means that the effective axial inflow velocities of propellers are reduced under the effect of pu especially at 12 o clock positions therefore the maximum hydrodynamic force values occur at 12 o clock positions for fp and rp it can be known from fig 8 that the unsteadiness of the hydrodynamic performance of fp is mainly attributed by pu as rp has weak influence on fp therefore the thrust and torque of fp are much smooth on the contrary besides the influence from pu the hydrodynamic performance of rp is also intensely affected by fp as rp works in the slipstream of fp see fig 8 c the local non uniformity of the induced velocities of fp at the panel centroids of rp causes local oscillations what s more the intense influence of fp on rp weakens the unsteady effect of pu on the hydrodynamic performance of rp thus the overall amplitudes of the thrust and torque of rp are obviously smaller than those of fp in order to get a better insight into the nature of the hydrodynamic forces generated by the blades of the forward and rear propellers of crap over one revolution figs 11 and 12 give the contour plots of the pressure distributions on the key blades of fp and rp at design condition j 0 7 the pressure distributions of the key blades at four different angular positions i e φ 0 90 180 270 are presented the pressure is non dimensionalized by p p 0 0 5 ρ v 0 2 where p 0 0 is the reference pressure it can be known that the pressure intensities on the blade surfaces of fp and rp change with the angular position overall the key blades of fp and rp have similar pressure distribution trend and the pressure on the key blade of fp is somewhat higher than that of rp this is mainly because that the effective inflow velocity of rp is greater than that of fp and the loads on the surface of rp are lower owing to the effect of pu the pressure intensities on the pressure sides at φ 270 are highest and those on the suction sides at φ 270 are lowest therefore the key blade at φ 270 has the maximum thrust and torque for both fp and rp the differences among the pressures of the key blade at φ 0 90 180 are not obvious for fp the pressures on the pressure side and suction side at φ 90 are slightly higher than those at φ 0 180 but the pressure difference between the pressure side and suction side at φ 90 is smaller therefore the key blade of fp has minimum hydrodynamic forces at near 90 compared with fp the pressure distributions of rp key blade at φ 0 90 180 are basically the same overall the pressure distributions experienced by the key blades over one revolution are consistent with the forces generated by the key blades given in fig 10 the induced velocities from fp and rp on the surface of pu are averaged over one propeller revolution and the effective inflow velocity of pu is the summation of the initial inflow velocity and the induced velocities from fp and rp fig 13 gives the pressure distribution on the surface of pu the x axis points downstream and z axis upward it can be seen that the pressure on the forebody of pu is significantly greater than that on the afterbody therefore the resistance is generated by pu what s more the pressure distribution is not symmetrical left and right for the strut the pressure at the starboard side is lower than that at the port side while the pressures on the surface of pu at the starboard and the port sides are almost the same this phenomenon can be explained as follows as pu is allocated in the slipstream of fp fp has stronger influence on pu what s more considering that fp is a right handed propeller and the strut is a lifting body the port side of the strut is the pressure side and the starboard side is the suction side therefore the pressure on the surface of the strut at the port side is higher than that at the starboard side the axial induced velocity generated by a propeller is necessary for generating thrust while the tangential induced velocity is a by product in other words the rotational energy in the propeller slipstream is a net energy loss therefore having further calculation about the tangential induced velocity in the slipstream can give us a better understanding about the slipstream rotational energy of the propeller this paper calculates the time averaged tangential induced velocity of crap on disc c which is 2 5 d f downstream from the fp disc the disc c is parallel to the fp disc and has the same diameter with fp as shown in fig 14 for simplicity the time averaged tangential induced velocity of crap is further averaged circumferentially in order to have a better understand of the energy saving performance of crap the tangential induced velocity of cp on disc c is also calculated and further averaged circumferentially fig 15 gives the calculated tangential induced velocities of fp rp and cp the total tangential induced velocity of crap is the superposition of those of fp and rp without considering the effect of pu owing to the fact that the pu is static and the tangential induced velocity of pu can be neglected compared with those of fp and rp on disc c it can be found from fig 15 that the tangential induced velocities produced by crap are obviously smaller than those generated by cp in other words the slipstream rotational energy of crap is recovered efficiently to some extent compared with cp 4 2 results at different inflow velocities the hydrodynamic performances of crap at design condition have been analyzed systematically however marine propellers encounter different working conditions during their lifetime and experience different off design scenarios therefore it is of great significance to study the performances of propulsor at different working conditions in this section the hydrodynamic performances of crap at different inflow velocities are calculated and the rotational speed is always 4 464 rps firstly the hydrodynamic performances of fp rp and pu alone in open water condition are calculated respectively and the results are compared with those of fp rp and pu in crap system the calculations are carried out for a range of advance coefficients from j 0 4 to 1 0 and the results are given in figs 16 18 it can be seen in fig 16 that the hydrodynamic forces and propulsive efficiency of fp in crap system are greater than those of fp alone and the discrepancies increase with the increase of advance coefficient this mainly because that the existences of pu and rp improve the flow field around fp although the thrust and torque of fp in crap system are increased the growth degree of thrust is greater than that of torque therefore the propulsive efficiency of fp in crap system is increased in addition the effects of pu and rp on fp get more significant with the increase of advance coefficient unlike fp the hydrodynamic forces of rp in crap system are decreased obviously compared with those of rp alone however rp in crap system has higher propulsive efficiency when j 0 8 it can be known from the analysis in section 3 that fp and pu have significant effect on the hydrodynamic performance of rp as rp works in the wake fields of fp and pu the effective axial inflow velocity of rp is increased obviously considering the induced velocity from fp thus the thrust and torque of rp in crap system are decreased compared with that of rp alone fig 18 shows that the resistance of pu in crap system has a significant increase compared with that of pu alone under all calculating conditions in general the resistances of pu in crap system and pu alone increase with the increase of advance coefficient the increment rate of the resistance of pu alone increases gradually with the advance coefficient however the increment rate of the resistance of pu in crap system firstly increase and then decrease the resistance of pu in crap system can be divided into the open water resistance and the induced resistance generated by fp and rp the open water resistance is the resistance generated by the uniform inflow the induced velocities of fp on the afterbody of pu are greater than those on the forebody of pu what s more the suction role of rp accelerates the flow velocity on the afterbody of pu the pressure is inversely proportional to the local velocity magnitude according to the bernoulli s equation therefore fp and rp induce lower pressure on the afterbody of pu and bring out pressure difference between the afterbody and forebody of pu it can be known from fig 18 that the induced resistance is dominant at low advance conditions the effect of fp and rp on the resistance of pu increases with the advance coefficient when the advance coefficient is less than 0 7 i e j 0 7 and weakens gradually when j 0 7 in general the systematic effects of crap on the hydrodynamic performances of fp rp and pu are obvious fig 19 gives the total thrusts and delivered powers of crap at different advance coefficients under open water condition it can be seen that both the thrust and delivered power decrease with the increase of advance coefficient the decrease rate of the thrust of crap increases slightly while that of the delivered power is essentially a constant at design condition the ratio between the thrusts of fp and rp is 1 25 however the ratio is different when the inflow velocity changes the ratio between the hydrodynamic forces of fp and rp is a very important matching degree indicator of motors fig 20 gives the ratio between the thrusts of fp and rp as well as the ratio of torques both the thrust and torque ratios increase with the advance coefficient and the ratios increase sharply when j 0 9 the hydrodynamic force ratios are in a reasonable range when j 0 9 what s more the thrust ratio and torque ratio are basically the same when j 0 9 while the thrust ratio is much higher than the torque ratio when j 0 9 the resistance of pu is detrimental to the propulsive efficiency of crap therefore it s of significance to know the change trend of the resistance of pu with the advance coefficient as the net thrust of crap is adopted by deducted the resistance of pu from the total thrust of fp and rp the ratio of the resistance of pu to the total thrust of fp and rp versus advance coefficient is plotted in fig 21 as the resistance of pu increases with the increase of advance coefficient while the thrusts of fp and rp decrease therefore the ratio increases with the advance coefficient this means that the side effect of pu on the propulsive performance gets more obvious with the increase of advance coefficient especially for the situation when j 0 9 5 conclusions in the present work an iterative numerical method for the design and hydrodynamic performance prediction of contra rotating azimuth propulsor crap is proposed through case study the conclusions can be summarized as follows for the crap designed through the method proposed in this study the geometric pitch angles of the rear propeller rp are obviously larger than those of the forward propeller fp as the effective inflow velocity of rp is significantly greater than that of fp the pod unit pu has approximately equal effects on fp and rp and fp has strong influence on rp which in turn has weak effect on fp at design condition the designed crap has a decrease in delivered power by approximately 8 compared with the designed cp on the condition that the same thrust is supplied the existence of pu makes the inflow fields of fp and rp not uniform any more and the blades of fp and rp experience unsteady hydrodynamic loads the overall amplitudes of the thrust and torque of the key blade of rp are significantly smaller than those of the key blade of fp what s more the thrust and torque of rp have obvious local oscillations because of the effect from fp the tangential induced velocities produced by crap are obviously smaller than those generated by cp and the slipstream rotational energy of crap is recovered effectively owing to the interferences among the three components of crap the hydrodynamic forces and propulsive efficiency of fp in crap system are greater than those of fp alone and the discrepancies increase with the increase of advance coefficient unlike fp the hydrodynamic forces of rp in crap system are obviously smaller than those of rp alone and rp in crap system has higher propulsive efficiency at low advance coefficient the resistance of pu in crap system has a significant increase compared with that of pu alone at all calculating conditions for the designed crap in this paper fp and rp have better hydrodynamic matching degree at low inflow velocity and the matching degree deteriorates when j 0 9 what s more the side effect of pu on the propulsive performance gets more obvious with the increase of advance coefficient in the context of energy saving and emission reduction this paper has great application value

ghadimi 2008 korsström et al 2015 gierusz 2015 tuulio 2016 however the achievements of present researches show that azipod just has limited increase in propulsive efficiency compared with conventional propellers because of the resistance of the pod body and strut at present the contra rotating propellers or crp s are commonly accepted as the propulsor having the highest propulsive efficiency in marine industry and have been widely used by underwater vehicles however the complex shafting and expensive installation cost make crp not suitable for large scale vessels lee et al 2014 the contra rotating azimuth propulsor crap consists of the forward propeller fp rear propeller rp and pod unit pu which includes the pod body and the strut in this paper the two propellers driven by two independent motor modules in pu ensure enough redundancy in all situations fp and rp rotating in opposite directions can achieve the energy saving effect of crp therefore crap offers the benefit of high propulsive efficiency and operational safety kuuskoski and holmsten 2001 the layout of crap at ship stern is given in fig 1 in which the x axis points downstream z axis points upward and the y axis is determined through right hand rule at present steerprop ltd from finland has designed crap systems which have been successfully applied to several kinds of ships however we have not found research literature about crap in order to obtain crap systems with higher propulsive efficiency it is indeed imperative that we use reliable procedures in the design and performance analysis of crap in an attempt to meet these needs the lifting line theory and lifting surface theory improved by koichi 2013 are adopted for crap design and the low order potential based panel method is used for the hydrodynamic performance analysis the energy saving performance of crap is studied through comparing the delivered power of the designed crap with that of a corresponding conventional propeller at design condition at last the open water performance of crap is analyzed 2 theoretical methods 2 1 vortex theory for propeller design the optimum forward and rear propellers of crap are designed through vortex theory with the pod unit being given first the vortex theory includes the lifting line theory and lifting surface theory the lifting line method is generally used for the preliminary design of propellers and the lifting surface theory used for the designed propeller modification as the determination of circulation distribution is the key point of propeller design the calculation of circulation distribution is presented in general the velocity induced by a vortex filament can be computed via the biot savard law 1 u 1 4 π d γ d r 0 d r 0 l ρ d l ρ 3 where γ is the circulation distribution of the bound vortex which is arranged in the radial direction other parameters of eq 1 are identified in fig 2 d l is a segment of the trailing vortex and ρ is the vector from the vortex

trailing vortex shed from each radius r 0 eq 1 can be recast as 2 u a t r 1 4 π r h r p d γ d r 0 i a t r r 0 d r 0 where u a and u t are the axial and tangential velocities induced at r r h and r p are the radius of the propeller hub and tip respectively the induction factors i a and i t follow from the equations for the velocities induced by constant pitch and constant radius helical vortices kawada 1936 hardin 1982 the circulation distribution form ψ r is known a priori and the circulation distribution γ r can be written as 3 γ r k ψ r where k is an unknown constant eq 2 can be rearranged as follow 4 u a t r k 4 π r h r p d ψ r d r 0 i a t r r 0 d r 0 the designed propeller needs to generate the thrust t demanded under the design condition the ideal thrust coefficient c t i can be defined as 5 c t i t 1 2 ρ v 0 2 π r p 2 4 z k v 0 r p r h r p ψ r 2 π n r u t d r substituting eq 4 into eq 5 the following quadratic equation in k can be obtained 6 2 z r h r p ψ r r h r p d ψ r 0 d

arctan v 0 1 ω x r u a r 2 π n r u t r where v 0 ω x r denote the undisturbed axial inflow velocity and axial wake fraction at the radius r respectively n is the rotational speed of propeller the circulation distribution γ r is determined through iterative calculation at the first iteration the hydrodynamic pitch angle ε i 1 r takes the approximate value a r c t a n 1 ω x r v 0 2 π n r and i a and i t are calculated then k 1 is obtained using eq 6 the new hydrodynamic pitch angle ε i 2 r can be obtained by pluging k 1 i a and i t into eqs 4 and 7 repeat the above calculation until the results converge the circulation distribution the hydrodynamic pitch angle and the induced velocities u a and u t can be determined through above calculation then calculating the thickness chamber and the chord length of blade the geometry of propeller blade can be determined considering the blade stress and cavitation with the aid of lifting surface corrections fig 3 gives the detailed design procedure for a single propeller 2 2 panel method description we consider a lifting body whose boundary is ω b in a single closed fluid domain ω with outside boundary ω as shown in fig 4 ω w ω w denote the upper face and lower face of the wake boundary respectively the total boundary ω is defined as the union of ω b ω ω w and ω w the undisturbed inflow velocity is v 0 the unit normal vectors n on ω b and ω are oriented into ω the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid and the flow is considered to be irrotational define p as a variable point within ω and q as a fixed point located on ω the perturbation velocity potential ϕ at point p is the solution of the following laplace equation 8 2 ϕ p 0 applying green s theorem the perturbation velocity potential can be expressed as follows 9 4 π ς φ p ω φ q g p q n q g p q φ q n q d s where g denotes the green s function in the case of unbounded three dimensional fluid domain g is given as 10 g g p q 1 r p q with r p q being the distance between points p and q ς in equation 9 has values as follows ς 1 if p lies in the flow field but not on ω ς 1 2 if p lies on ω ς 0 if p lies outside ω taking into account the boundary

surface and wake sheet is discretized with hyperboloidal panels a constant source and a constant dipole are then distributed on each panel for unsteady calculation the integral eq 15 is solved at each time step and time dependent terms are updated at the next time step eq 8 can be discretized as follows 16 j 1 n p a i j φ j n m 1 n r w i m 1 δ φ m 1 n r h s i n i 1 2 n p r h s i n z 1 n b j 1 n p b

the number of chordwise panels n r is the number of spanwise panels n p 2 n c n r is the total number of panels of a blade and n w is the number of chordwise panels in the wake the influence coefficients a i j z and b i j z are defined as the potentials induced at panel i by unit constant strength dipole and source distributions respectively located at panel j on blade z the wake influence coefficients w i m l z are defined similarly the specific definitions of the influence coefficients are given in the dissertation of hsin 1990 and the influence coefficients are calculated through morino s method morino et al 1975 the velocity potential ϕ of the key blade of propeller is calculated through eq 16 at time step n the left terms of eq 16 are unknown and the right terms are given through iteration and assignment the detailed process of iteration and assignment is given by hsin 1990 the induced velocities can be obtained by differentiating the resulting velocity potential and the pressure distribution is calculated through bernoulli s equation for the hydrodynamic performance calculation of pu the strut is a lifting body while the pod body is treated as a nonlifting body the hydrodynamic performance of the strut is calculated using the same method with propeller as the pod body is nonlifting the dipoles on the panels of pod body are set to zero so just a constant source is distributed on each panel of the pod body the strut and the pod body are treated as an integral in the process of hydrodynamic performance prediction of crap the interferences among the different components of crap are considered through induced velocities the induced velocities from propellers are calculated at each time step during unsteady hydrodynamic performance predictions as pu is at rest the induced velocities of fp and rp at the panel centroids of pu are averaged over one propeller revolution what s more since the relative positions of fp and rp are specified at any time step the induced velocities between fp and rp are calculated at the corresponding panel centroids at each time step therefore the induced velocities of fp at the panel centroids of rp are different at different time steps and those of rp at the panel centroids of fp have the same situation as the pod unit is up down asymmetric the induced velocities from the pod unit are considered as the non uniform wake in which the unsteady hydrodynamic performance predictions of propellers are carried out the hydrodynamic performance coefficients of crap can be defined as follows j v 0 n d f k t f t f ρ n 2 d f 4 k q f q f ρ n 2 d f 5 η f k t f k q f j 2 π k t r t r ρ n 2 d f 4 k q r q r ρ n 2 d f 5 η r k t r k q r j 2 π t s t f t r r p o d where t q k t k q and η represent thrust torque thrust coefficient torque coefficient and propulsive efficiency respectively d is the propeller diameter the subscript f denote the forward propeller and r the rear propeller r p o d is the resistance of pu n is the rotational speed of crap t s is the total thrust of crap j is the advance coefficient the delivered power representing the fuel directly consumed by a propeller is used to indicate the energy consumption level of propellers in this paper the delivered powers of the forward and rear propellers of crap as well as that of cp can be calculated as follows d p f 2 π q f n d p r 2 π q r n d p z d p f d p r d p c 2 π q c n c where d p f d p r represent the delivered powers of the forward and rear propellers of crap d p z denotes the total delivered power of crap d p c is the delivered power of cp n c and q c represent the rotational speed and the torque of cp respectively 3 crap design 3 1 design procedure the design system of crap is established by combining the vortex theory and panel method fig 5 gives the detailed design procedure the pod unit pu is given first and the forward propeller fp and rear propeller rp are designed theoretically in step a of fig 5 the induced velocities from pu and rp are not considered in the first design process and performance prediction of fp the induced velocities of rp and pu in step f include the induced velocities used for fp design at the design points of fp and those used for the hydrodynamic performance prediction at the panel centroids of the newest designed fp the induced velocities of rp at the panel centroids of pu are also calculated in step f the rear propeller diameter d r is determined through analyzing the fp slipstream and the tip radius of rear propeller is set equal to the radius of the contracted slipstream of fp at the rear propeller disk in step c the contraction ratio of the fp slipstream at the rp disc is δ the rp diameter can be determined as d r δ d f in step d the induced velocities from fp are considered during the performance prediction and induced velocity calculation of pu while those from rp are not considered in the first design iteration during the design and hydrodynamic performance prediction of rp the induced velocities from fp and pu are considered in step e the initial input data of propellers is adjusted until the total thrust t s of crap reach the required thrust 3 2 design results the crap is designed in uniform flow with the inflow velocity v 0 being 10 m s the forward propeller fp diameter d f is 3 2 m and the rotational speeds of fp and the rear propeller rp are both 4 464 rps therefore the design advance coefficient is j 0 7 fp has 3 blades and rp 4 blades the shaft depth is 4 0 m the designed crap is aimed for a thrust of 590 kn the thrust ratio of fp and rp is t f t r 1 25 at design condition fp is a right handed propeller and rp a left handed propeller this paper has theoretical designs about fp and rp with the pod unit pu being given first table 1 gives the main parameters of pu whose strut adopts symmetric aerofoil naca0012 study of boswell 1971 shows that a propeller with skew can have better cavitation performance and smaller force fluctuating amplitude however the propeller skew ought not to be too large considering the blade strength especially for a large scale propeller in order to strike a balance between the propeller strength and the propulsive performance the designed propellers both have a maximum skew of 12 in addition the existence of rear rake can effectively restrain the blade tip vortices which can have severe impingement on the devices behind the propeller the propellers designed in this paper both have a rear rake of 15 both fp and rp adopt the modified naca66 section with a 0 8 for the determinations of the chord and thickness distributions along the radial direction the non cavitating condition is considered the slipstream contraction ratio δ of fp at the rp disc is 0 91 so the rp diameter d r is 2 912 m the design result is given in fig 6 the slipstreams of the key blade of fp and the strut are displayed the slipstream of fp is arranged clinging to the pod body as pu and rp are installed within the slipstream of fp the influence coefficients of fp slipstream may have singularity when the panel centroids of fp slipstream get too close to those of pu and rp what s more the singularity occurs when the panel centroids of strut slipstream and rp get too close as shown in fig 6 b it is assumed that the singular influence coefficient appears when the distance between two panel centroids is less than one hundredth of the length of relevant blade or strut panel diagonal this paper ignores the singular influence coefficients of fp slipstream and strut slipstream directly as skimming individual singular influence coefficient has little effect on the hydrodynamic performance calculation liu 2013 what s more the influence from the slipstream panels are not considered when the panel centroids of slipstream are inside the strut or rp for better understanding about the energy saving performance of the designed crap this paper designs a conventional propeller cp which can generate the same thrust with the integrated propulsion system at the same design condition using the design procedure given in fig 3 as the propeller diameter is limited cp has the same diameter and rotational speed with fp fig 7 gives the designed cp and table 2 gives the main parameters of cp as well as those of fp and rp it can be known that cp has significantly lager disc ratio compared with fp and rp in order to have a better understanding about the effect of pu on fp and rp as well as the mutual perturbations between fp and rp fig 8 gives the induced velocities of pu at fp and rp discs the induced velocities of fp at rp disc and those of rp at fp disc v i x and v i p denote the axial and cross induced velocities respectively the velocities are divided by the inflow velocity v 0 to express them in non dimensional forms the arrows represent the non dimensional cross induced velocities and the axial induced velocity components along the propeller axis are represented by contour plots it can be known from fig 8 a and b that the existence of pu changes the inflow velocity of fp and rp to some extent the pu produces axial induced velocities in the direction opposite to the inflow velocity v 0 as pu impedes water flow the induced velocities are left and right symmetrical the strut of pod has a significant influence on the velocity field the cross induced velocities of pu at rp disc direct inward with respect to the hub from the external flow field while those at fp disc have totally opposite direction in the process of design and hydrodynamic performance calculation of propellers the induced velocities between fp and rp are calculated at the design points and panel centroids of propellers in order to have a more intuitive understanding about the mutual perturbation between fp and rp fig 8 c and d briefly give the induced velocity of fp at rp disc and that of rp at fp disc as rp works in the slipstream of fp fp has strong disturbance at rp disc given that fp is a right handed propeller the cross induced velocities of fp at rp disc are in clockwise direction viewing from downstream the induced velocities of fp at rp firstly increase and then decrease with the radius increasing as fp located upstream rp fp is less affected by rp the cross induced velocities of rp at fp disc direct inward with respect to the hub from the external flow field as the rp rotation effect doesn t work at fp disc it can be known from the above analysis that the effective inflow velocity superposition of initial inflow velocity and induced velocities given in fig 8 of rp is significantly larger than that of fp therefore the geometric pitch angles of rp are obviously larger than those of fp as shown in fig 9 4 performance analysis 4 1 results at design condition the combined propulsor crap and the corresponding cp are both designed to produce 590 kn at j 0 7 this section has hydrodynamic performance predictions of the designed crap and cp at design condition respectively and the hydrodynamic performance of crap is predicted considering the interferences among fp rp and pu table 3 gives the time averaged hydrodynamic forces and delivered powers of cp and the three components of crap over one revolution the total thrust of crap is the summation of the thrusts of fp rp and pu and the total delivered power of crap is the summation of the delivered powers of fp and rp it can be known that the designed crap has a decrease in delivered power by 8 03 compared with the designed cp what s more the electrical transmission efficiency of crap is much higher than the energy transmission efficiency of combustion engine therefore the designed crap has more potential for fuel saving compared with cp according to fig 8 pu generates non uniform induced velocities at fp and rp discs in order to investigate the effect of this non uniformity on the hydrodynamic performances of fp and rp this paper gives the thrust and torque coefficients of the key blades of fp and rp as shown in fig 10 the key blade of fp rotates clockwise from y axis and that of rp rotates anticlockwise from y axis viewing from downstream it can be known from fig 10 that the hydrodynamic coefficients of the key blades of fp and rp change with the angular position in uniform flow owing to the mutual interferences among the three components fp rp and pu of crap the maximum values occur at φ 270 12 o clock position the overall amplitudes of the thrust and torque of rp are significantly smaller than those of the thrust and torque of fp what s more the thrust and torque of rp have obvious local oscillations while those of fp are much smoother this can be explained that the existence of pu causes a reduction in the axial inflow velocity see fig 8 a b the induced velocities from pu in the upper parts of fp and rp discs are significantly smaller than those in the lower parts and the minimum values appear at 12 o clock positions in fig 8 a b this means that the effective axial inflow velocities of propellers are reduced under the effect of pu especially at 12 o clock positions therefore the maximum hydrodynamic force values occur at 12 o clock positions for fp and rp it can be known from fig 8 that the unsteadiness of the hydrodynamic performance of fp is mainly attributed by pu as rp has weak influence on fp therefore the thrust and torque of fp are much smooth on the contrary besides the influence from pu the hydrodynamic performance of rp is also intensely affected by fp as rp works in the slipstream of fp see fig 8 c the local non uniformity of the induced velocities of fp at the panel centroids of rp causes local oscillations what s more the intense influence of fp on rp weakens the unsteady effect of pu on the hydrodynamic performance of rp thus the overall amplitudes of the thrust and torque of rp are obviously smaller than those of fp in order to get a better insight into the nature of the hydrodynamic forces generated by the blades of the forward and rear propellers of crap over one revolution figs 11 and 12 give the contour plots of the pressure distributions on the key blades of fp and rp at design condition j 0 7 the pressure distributions of the key blades at four different angular positions i e φ 0 90 180 270 are presented the pressure is non dimensionalized by p p 0 0 5 ρ v 0 2 where p 0 0 is the reference pressure it can be known that the pressure intensities on the blade surfaces of fp and rp change with the angular position overall the key blades of fp and rp have similar pressure distribution trend and the pressure on the key blade of fp is somewhat higher than that of rp this is mainly because that the effective inflow velocity of rp is greater than that of fp and the loads on the surface of rp are lower owing to the effect of pu the pressure intensities on the pressure sides at φ 270 are highest and those on the suction sides at φ 270 are lowest therefore the key blade at φ 270 has the maximum thrust and torque for both fp and rp the differences among the pressures of the key blade at φ 0 90 180 are not obvious for fp the pressures on the pressure side and suction side at φ 90 are slightly higher than those at φ 0 180 but the pressure difference between the pressure side and suction side at φ 90 is smaller therefore the key blade of fp has minimum hydrodynamic forces at near 90 compared with fp the pressure distributions of rp key blade at φ 0 90 180 are basically the same overall the pressure distributions experienced by the key blades over one revolution are consistent with the forces generated by the key blades given in fig 10 the induced velocities from fp and rp on the surface of pu are averaged over one propeller revolution and the effective inflow velocity of pu is the summation of the initial inflow velocity and the induced velocities from fp and rp fig 13 gives the pressure distribution on the surface of pu the x axis points downstream and z axis upward it can be seen that the pressure on the forebody of pu is significantly greater than that on the afterbody therefore the resistance is generated by pu what s more the pressure distribution is not symmetrical left and right for the strut the pressure at the starboard side is lower than that at the port side while the pressures on the surface of pu at the starboard and the port sides are almost the same this phenomenon can be explained as follows as pu is allocated in the slipstream of fp fp has stronger influence on pu what s more considering that fp is a right handed propeller and the strut is a lifting body the port side of the strut is the pressure side and the starboard side is the suction side therefore the pressure on the surface of the strut at the port side is higher than that at the starboard side the axial induced velocity generated by a propeller is necessary for generating thrust while the tangential induced velocity is a by product in other words the rotational energy in the propeller slipstream is a net energy loss therefore having further calculation about the tangential induced velocity in the slipstream can give us a better understanding about the slipstream rotational energy of the propeller this paper calculates the time averaged tangential induced velocity of crap on disc c which is 2 5 d f downstream from the fp disc the disc c is parallel to the fp disc and has the same diameter with fp as shown in fig 14 for simplicity the time averaged tangential induced velocity of crap is further averaged circumferentially in order to have a better understand of the energy saving performance of crap the tangential induced velocity of cp on disc c is also calculated and further averaged circumferentially fig 15 gives the calculated tangential induced velocities of fp rp and cp the total tangential induced velocity of crap is the superposition of those of fp and rp without considering the effect of pu owing to the fact that the pu is static and the tangential induced velocity of pu can be neglected compared with those of fp and rp on disc c it can be found from fig 15 that the tangential induced velocities produced by crap are obviously smaller than those generated by cp in other words the slipstream rotational energy of crap is recovered efficiently to some extent compared with cp 4 2 results at different inflow velocities the hydrodynamic performances of crap at design condition have been analyzed systematically however marine propellers encounter different working conditions during their lifetime and experience different off design scenarios therefore it is of great significance to study the performances of propulsor at different working conditions in this section the hydrodynamic performances of crap at different inflow velocities are calculated and the rotational speed is always 4 464 rps firstly the hydrodynamic performances of fp rp and pu alone in open water condition are calculated respectively and the results are compared with those of fp rp and pu in crap system the calculations are carried out for a range of advance coefficients from j 0 4 to 1 0 and the results are given in figs 16 18 it can be seen in fig 16 that the hydrodynamic forces and propulsive efficiency of fp in crap system are greater than those of fp alone and the discrepancies increase with the increase of advance coefficient this mainly because that the existences of pu and rp improve the flow field around fp although the thrust and torque of fp in crap system are increased the growth degree of thrust is greater than that of torque therefore the propulsive efficiency of fp in crap system is increased in addition the effects of pu and rp on fp get more significant with the increase of advance coefficient unlike fp the hydrodynamic forces of rp in crap system are decreased obviously compared with those of rp alone however rp in crap system has higher propulsive efficiency when j 0 8 it can be known from the analysis in section 3 that fp and pu have significant effect on the hydrodynamic performance of rp as rp works in the wake fields of fp and pu the effective axial inflow velocity of rp is increased obviously considering the induced velocity from fp thus the thrust and torque of rp in crap system are decreased compared with that of rp alone fig 18 shows that the resistance of pu in crap system has a significant increase compared with that of pu alone under all calculating conditions in general the resistances of pu in crap system and pu alone increase with the increase of advance coefficient the increment rate of the resistance of pu alone increases gradually with the advance coefficient however the increment rate of the resistance of pu in crap system firstly increase and then decrease the resistance of pu in crap system can be divided into the open water resistance and the induced resistance generated by fp and rp the open water resistance is the resistance generated by the uniform inflow the induced velocities of fp on the afterbody of pu are greater than those on the forebody of pu what s more the suction role of rp accelerates the flow velocity on the afterbody of pu the pressure is inversely proportional to the local velocity magnitude according to the bernoulli s equation therefore fp and rp induce lower pressure on the afterbody of pu and bring out pressure difference between the afterbody and forebody of pu it can be known from fig 18 that the induced resistance is dominant at low advance conditions the effect of fp and rp on the resistance of pu increases with the advance coefficient when the advance coefficient is less than 0 7 i e j 0 7 and weakens gradually when j 0 7 in general the systematic effects of crap on the hydrodynamic performances of fp rp and pu are obvious fig 19 gives the total thrusts and delivered powers of crap at different advance coefficients under open water condition it can be seen that both the thrust and delivered power decrease with the increase of advance coefficient the decrease rate of the thrust of crap increases slightly while that of the delivered power is essentially a constant at design condition the ratio between the thrusts of fp and rp is 1 25 however the ratio is different when the inflow velocity changes the ratio between the hydrodynamic forces of fp and rp is a very important matching degree indicator of motors fig 20 gives the ratio between the thrusts of fp and rp as well as the ratio of torques both the thrust and torque ratios increase with the advance coefficient and the ratios increase sharply when j 0 9 the hydrodynamic force ratios are in a reasonable range when j 0 9 what s more the thrust ratio and torque ratio are basically the same when j 0 9 while the thrust ratio is much higher than the torque ratio when j 0 9 the resistance of pu is detrimental to the propulsive efficiency of crap therefore it s of significance to know the change trend of the resistance of pu with the advance coefficient as the net thrust of crap is adopted by deducted the resistance of pu from the total thrust of fp and rp the ratio of the resistance of pu to the total thrust of fp and rp versus advance coefficient is plotted in fig 21 as the resistance of pu increases with the increase of advance coefficient while the thrusts of fp and rp decrease therefore the ratio increases with the advance coefficient this means that the side effect of pu on the propulsive performance gets more obvious with the increase of advance coefficient especially for the situation when j 0 9 5 conclusions in the present work an iterative numerical method for the design and hydrodynamic performance prediction of contra rotating azimuth propulsor crap is proposed through case study the conclusions can be summarized as follows for the crap designed through the method proposed in this study the geometric pitch angles of the rear propeller rp are obviously larger than those of the forward propeller fp as the effective inflow velocity of rp is significantly greater than that of fp the pod unit pu has approximately equal effects on fp and rp and fp has strong influence on rp which in turn has weak effect on fp at design condition the designed crap has a decrease in delivered power by approximately 8 compared with the designed cp on the condition that the same thrust is supplied the existence of pu makes the inflow fields of fp and rp not uniform any more and the blades of fp and rp experience unsteady hydrodynamic loads the overall amplitudes of the thrust and torque of the key blade of rp are significantly smaller than those of the key blade of fp what s more the thrust and torque of rp have obvious local oscillations because of the effect from fp the tangential induced velocities produced by crap are obviously smaller than those generated by cp and the slipstream rotational energy of crap is recovered effectively owing to the interferences among the three components of crap the hydrodynamic forces and propulsive efficiency of fp in crap system are greater than those of fp alone and the discrepancies increase with the increase of advance coefficient unlike fp the hydrodynamic forces of rp in crap system are obviously smaller than those of rp alone and rp in crap system has higher propulsive efficiency at low advance coefficient the resistance of pu in crap system has a significant increase compared with that of pu alone at all calculating conditions for the designed crap in this paper fp and rp have better hydrodynamic matching degree at low inflow velocity and the matching degree deteriorates when j 0 9 what s more the side effect of pu on the propulsive performance gets more obvious with the increase of advance coefficient in the context of energy saving and emission reduction this paper has great application value 
23476,in this study we present the inter comparison of regional swan hindcasts using boundary conditions bc from the third generation wave models wam and wwiii implemented globally here swan inter comparison studies with outputs of both global models as well as swan results using bc from both wam and wwiii were carried out for selected months of the year 2000 2008 2009 and for the full year 2011 using era 40 quikscat ncep blended and oscat winds the results of this experimental simulations hindcasts suggests that swan hindcasts for both the northwest coast as well as northeast coastal model domains in the present model setups were found to be different and can be considered better than the deep water model outputs such as wam and wwiii implemented globally the comparison between swan hindcasts using wam bc and swan hindcasts using wwiii bc revealed high correlations however the percentage error in the hindcast results of swan using wam bc were found to be generally higher by 5 15 by considering most of the case studies presented in this investigation further the validation results using in situ and altimeter measurements suggest that swan using wam bc can be an effective

the ocean or wind waves have been a focus of study for many decades prediction of wind waves is relevant to the undertaking of air sea interaction process of the coupled ocean atmosphere system and many ocean based activities the knowledge on sea state in the nearshore region is extremely important for navigation nearshore and coastal applications forecasting surface waves in the ocean is a problem of great practical interest as the sea state conditions influence almost all aspects of naval operations at sea as well as a variety of commercial and maritime activities accurate ocean wave forecasting is a key prerequisite for enabling optimum tracking of ship routes and ensuring the safety of lives and property at sea onboard various fixed and floating platforms thus ocean wave forecasting has been a priority for all research and maritime organizations those who have pioneered the application of operational ocean wave models dating all the way back to the 1960s numerical models of different types for coastal wave processes have been developed waves in the deep ocean can be well predicted by third generation wave models based on the energy or action balance equation such as the wave model wam wamdi group 1988 komen et al 1994 wavewatch model of tolman 1997 1999 2009 the model of li and mao 1992 the program for hindcasting of waves in deep intermediate and shallow water phidias model of van vledder et al 1994 and the telemac based operational model addressing wave action computation tomawac model of benoit et al 1996 most of these models cannot be realistically applied to coastal regions with horizontal scales less than 20 30 km and water depth less than 20 30 m with estuaries tidal inlets barrier islands tidal flats or channels because shallow water effects of depth induced wave breaking and triad wave wave interaction are not included in these models booij et al 1999 also the explicit numerical schemes for propagation used in these models require an impracticably short time step for high spatial resolution for coastal applications booij et al 1999 developed a similar model called swan acronym for simulating waves nearshore to adapt the shallow water formulations from deep to shallow waters based on the wave action balance equation with sources and sinks the shallow water wave model swan is an extension of the deep water third generation wave models early in 1979 a group of wave researchers proposed a wave model inter comparison study to clarify the interrelations existing among the various wave models which have been developed in

group 1985 the main purpose of this inter comparison study was to test the current understanding of the physics of wind generated surface waves from the viewpoint of wave modelling the study clarified the basic interdependence between understanding the physics of surface waves representing the physics numerically and predicting quantitatively the detailed space time evolution of a two dimensional wave spectrum for a given time varying wind field all wave models that were taken for inter comparison could claim specific strong points but all displayed weaknesses in some of the areas some problems were common to all models these were particularly useful in pointing out the directions which would be required for future experimental theoretical or numerical aspects and it could provide insight to the individual modelling groups basically into the various internal intricacies of their own models the inter comparison study revealed peculiar response characteristics of the individual models which had remained undetected under normal operating conditions the immediate motivation of the inter comparison study was the marked expansion in the operational application of wave models in recent years since then many wave model inter comparison studies have been reported across the globe by various researchers to date tolman et al 2002 padilla hernandez et al 2007 ortiz royero and mercado irizarry 2008 hanson et al 2009 korres et al 2011 performance evaluation studies of the third generation wave model swan were carried out both in operational forecast as well as hindcast modes by various authors and the results have been documented swan is a state of the art shallow water model booij et al 1999 and ris et al 1999 developed for accurate wave simulation in high resolution coastal regions an unstructured grid option zijlema 2010 allows high coastal resolution to be embedded within a large domain for efficient computations without the need for model nesting swan has been used successfully in hindcast applications ris et al 1999 and in real time wave prediction systems for coastal areas dykes et al 2009 evaluations of three third generation ocean wave models by padilla hernandez et al 2007 revealed that swan nested in wavewatch iii hereafter wwiii performed better than swan nested in wam the swan model is being updated continuously with newer modifications for accuracy as well as improvements in model physics zijlema et al 2012 fumin et al 2013 the skill of these models has been demonstrated in numerous validation exercises validation of swan model was done by several researchers such as rogers et al 2000 allard et al 2004 hsu et al 2005 saremi 2010 inghilesi et al 2012 prasad et al 2013 nayak et al 2013 sandhya et al 2014 umesh 2015 amrutha et al 2016 umesh et al 2017 and parvathy et al 2017 ortiz royero and mercado irizarry 2008 carried out the simulation of wind wave activity in the north atlantic basin from june to august of 2002 using the swan model the results of the simulations were compared with data obtained from ndbc national data buoy centre and the results from noaa s wwiii model this study tested the applicability of swan model at oceanic scales and hence concluded that swan model is a good option for simulations all the way from deep water up to the nearshore montoya et al 2013 carried out a comparison between wwiii and swan using data from hurricane katrina in the gulf of mexico the simulated data were compared with in situ noaa buoy data wherein for most of the buoys wwiii presented the best statistical comparisons for the main wave parameters such as significant wave height hereafter hs and peak period the swan model tends to overestimate the maximum values for hs for some buoy locations and the peak period for almost all locations in a study by dietrich et al 2011 one can find a comprehensive validation of coupled model swan adcirc performance for energetic events like hurricanes katrina and rita 2005 studied for the atlantic ocean the comprehensive validation study with wave and water level measurements showed that coupled swan adcirc simulated accurately the evolution of waves and surges the swan model has been used in the east china sea with typhoon forcing by feng et al 2012 brown 2010 implemented a 1 way coupled model using wam and swan to assess the effects of tide surge wave interaction in the irish sea zhang et al 2003 reported the use of swan to simulate waves induced by a tropical storm swan was used to simulate the hs at the upper gulf of thailand and the change of hs at bangkhuntien shoreline ekphisutsuntorn et al 2010 the findings of the study were useful for the coastal erosive calculation shoreline protection and coastal zone management activities in the indian context the predictability of ocean waves over the indian ocean has been improved by assimilating simulated wave spectra into coastal wave model swan by raj kumar et al 2009 similar studies to improve the wave forecast were done by bhowmick et al 2009 nested set up of wam and swan for nearshore wave hindcasting has been reported by breivik et al 2009 and nayak et al 2013 nesting of wwiii and swan has been reported by anselmi molina et al 2012 bhowmick et al 2011 compared swan simulated hs using janssen option janssen et al 1994 with the jason 1 altimeter data which gave a correlation of 0 81 for the indian ocean region panigrahi et al 2012 has reported that a one way coupling approach using pom and swan is quite promising in predicting the extreme wave height due to the complex cyclonic wind fields murty et al 2014 has reported application of a parallel coupled adcirc swan model to simulate extreme waves alongshore wave induced setup and storm surge associated with a very severe cyclonic storm vscs phailin that occurred in the bay of bengal during october 2013 prasad et al 2013 reported on the performance and validation of coupled adcirc swan model for the thane cyclone in the bay of bengal during december 2011 in a recent study and extension of the previous work prasad et al 2014 performed a comprehensive analysis on the coastal inundation potential for the tamil nadu coast sandhya et al 2014 integrated the two modelling systems namely wwiii and swan to provide a very high resolution forecast for puducherry region amrutha et al 2016 have examined the sensitivity of the numerical model swan nested in wwiii for a location in the eastern arabian sea in recent times a multi scale modelling approach using nested wam swan for puducherry coastal location has been reported by umesh et al 2017 to assess the sensitivity of surface wind forcing on wave modeland to validate the coastal wave spectra with buoy measurements all the above mentioned studies using swan revealed a high level of confidence for using this model for operational prediction and short term long term wave hindcasting purposes for the coastal north indian ocean although a number of studies have explored the capability of the models in one way or another none has so far performed a rigorous comprehensive and quantitative inter comparison assessment for the indian ocean it is clearly evident from the literature that studies pertaining to inter comparison of model by computing wave parameters for the north indian ocean region is however missing here in this study the third generation wave models such as wam wwiii and swan have been chosen for numerical simulations umesh et al 2013 umesh 2015 the novelty of this work is the inter comparison of swan outputs using boundary conditions hereafter bc of wam and wwiii in the selected coastal regions model domains of the north indian ocean such as the northwest and northeast coastal regions 7 7 longitude latitude model grids of india from a wave climate point of view january and june july being the peak of northeast and southwest monsoon periods over the north indian ocean wave hindcast case studies for the study region have been chosen for these selected months moreover the wave hindcast parameters obtained from the individual simulations total five are analyzed to inter compare and understand the quality and variability associated with the wave model outputs in the coastal domains regions considered in this investigation the study suggests the suitability and capabilities of the models for their future utilization and exploitation in predicting the sea state information required for various practical applications in an operational scenario to verify the reliability of model computed parameters systematic validation studies with long term observational data is an essential pre requisite to improve the prediction capability and enhancement of wave model performances the inter comparison study gives reasonably good results with low rms error and high correlation coefficients the present study is the first to inter compare swan hindcasts using bc from each of the models such as wam c4 5 3 and wwiii v3 14 for selected locations in the north indian ocean region by conducting a few carefully chosen case studies for selected months to evaluate its usefulness on sea state information 2 the wave models a brief theoretical background of swan wam and wwiii are given under the following sub headings 2 1 wam cycle 4 5 3 the wam model solves the spectral energy balance equation for describing the two dimensional wave evolution as shown in the equation 1 f t c g f s i n s n l s d s where f f θ x t is the spectral wave energy density depending on wave frequency f wave direction θ position x time t and group velocity cg cg f θ equation 1 describes the loss gain and shifting of energy and the equation is valid for deep waters with no refraction and no significant current the so called source functions on the right hand side in equation 1 describe the wind input sin nonlinear transfer snl and dissipation due to white capping sds wam cycle 4 5 is an update of the wam cycle 4 wave model which is described in komen et al 1994 and gunther et al 1992 the basic physics and numerics have been kept in the new release the source function integration scheme made by hersbach and janssen 1999 and the updates bidlot et al 2005 are incorporated a number of additional options are added in the new model release wam cycle 4 5 3 gunther and behrens 2011 the new method is semi implicit and based on the developments at ecmwf janssen personal communication it is 2 f n 1 f n δ t s 1 δ t g where s s u n 1 f n is the source function of spectrum computed at time n and wind speed u at time level n 1 the term g is the functional derivative of the source function given by g g u n 1 f n the wave model dissipation source function has been reformulated in terms of a mean steepness parameter and the mean frequency that gives more emphasis on the high frequency part of the spectrum and results in a more realistic interaction between windsea and swell waves this has allowed the relaxation of the prognostic frequency range over which the model equations are integrated a few other small adjustments were also incorporated for wam cycle 4 5 3 to take advantage of the increased dynamic range of the model bidlot et al 2005 2 2 wavewatch iii v3 14 the wavewatch iii wwiii wave model version 3 14 is a wam type wave model developed at noaa ncep tolman 1997 1999 2009 wwiii is a discrete spectral and phase averaged model battjes 1994 which is successfully applied in global and regional scale studies in many areas including the north atlantic and is proven to be an effective tool to study wave spectral evolution air sea interactions and nonlinear wave wave interactions for regional and global applications the directional wave spectrum is resolved at each model grid point in terms of wave number direction bands and the evolution of the wave field is found by numerically solving the spectral wave action balance equation which is usually written as 3 n t 1 cos φ φ φ n cos θ λ λ n k k n θ θ g n s σ where λ is longitude φ is latitude θ is wave propagation direction k is wave number t is time and σ is the intrinsic angular frequency wwiii evaluates the balance equation for the wave action spectrum n k θ x t expressed in spherical coordinates komen et al 1994 the derivatives in equation 3 are the propagation velocities in physical and spectral domains where 4 φ c g cos θ u φ r λ c g sin θ u λ r cos φ θ g θ c g tan φ cos θ r where r is the radius of the earth uφ and uλ are current components in φ and λ directions the left side of equation 4 represents the local rate of change of wave action density propagation in physical space action density shifting in frequency and direction due to the spatial and temporal variations in depth and current in deep waters the net source term s is generally considered to consist of three parts a wind wave interaction term sin a nonlinear wave wave interactions term snl and a dissipation whitecapping term sds the input term sin is dominated by the exponential growth term and the source term generally describes this dominant process only for model initialization and to provide more realistic initial wave growth a linear input term sln is also considered in wwiii in nearshore waters additional processes are mostly notably wave bottom interactions sbot shemdin et al 1978 while depth induced breaking sdb and triad wave wave interactions str may also be considered important wwiii also caters for the source terms for scattering of waves by bottom features ssc and a general purpose slot for additional user defined source terms sxx this defines the general source terms used in wwiii as 5 s sln sin snl sds sbot sdb str ssc sxx two combinations of the source terms sin and sds input and dissipation due to whitecapping are available in wwiii the default set up of wwiii corresponds to the wave boundary layer formulation for sin and sds by tolman and chalikov 1996 tolman chalikov physics the alternate combination corresponds to wam cycle 3 physics wamc3 physics in which sin and sds are based on wamdi group 1988 snyder et al 1981 and komen et al 1994 in both cases the source terms are integrated in time using a dynamically adjusted time stepping algorithm which concentrates computational efforts on conditions with rapid spectral changes tolman 1999 2 3 swan model swan is the third generation near shore wave action model designed to overcome traditional difficulties of using global wave models such as wam and wwiii in coastal regions it uses typical formulations for wave growth by wind wave dissipation by white capping and four wave nonlinear interactions quadruplets or quads it also includes physical processes associated with intermediate depth and shallow water e g bottom friction depth limited breaking the governing equation of swan and other third generation wave action models is the action balance equation in cartesian coordinates it is hasselmann et al 1973 given by 6 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s σ where n σ θ x y t is the action density as a function of intrinsic frequency σ direction θ horizontal coordinates x and y and time t the first term on the left hand side of equation 6 represents the local rate of change of action density in time the second and third terms represent propagation in geographical x y space respectively with velocities cx and cy the fourth term represents shifting of the relative frequency due to variations in depth and currents with velocity cσ in σ space the fifth term represents depth and current induced refraction with velocity cθ in θ space here s is the total of source sink terms expressed as wave energy density in deep waters the right hand side of equation 6 is dominated by three terms s sin snl sds input by wind four wave nonlinear interactions and dissipation respectively whereas in shallow waters six processes contribute to stot 7 stot sin snl3 snl4 sds w sds b sds br where sin wave growth by the wind snl3 snl4 nonlinear transfer of wave energy through three wave and four wave interactions sds w sds b sds br energy dissipation due to white capping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking as explained before wam is a predecessor of both swan and wwiiii tolman 1991 2002 and as in the case of swan wwiii is also governed by the action balance equation the deep water models wam and wwiii tend to be more efficient in global scales due to numerical schemes whereas swan holds the advantage at smaller scales all the three models wam wwiii and swan can be solved in either cartesian or spherical coordinates and all are finite difference models because of their similarities all the three complement each other from various considerations the prediction of wave conditions in shallow water has received increased emphasis in both the scientific and engineering communities in recent years the scientific interest in the problem of shallow water wave prediction has increased because of generally increased knowledge about wave generation improved meteorological and oceanographic databases and the availability of bigger and better computer facilities to handle the mathematical and numerical aspects of the problem increased marine activities particularly in areas of offshore exploration and coastal development have created a need for improved knowledge of sea state conditions in the nearshore regions hence research and development on shallow water wave modelling and prediction is significantly important the performance of deep water wave models in the north indian ocean region has been well studied by various investigators in comparison to shallow nearshore wave models the performance of a shallow nearshore wave model like swan taking boundary input from two different deep water wave models such as wam and wwiii developed in the spirit of the wam model needs to be addressed in shallow and nearshore regions where the deep water models are likely to overlook or grossly address the processes relating to shallow waters the computing power becomes a limitation for deep water models if we increase grid resolution towards shore regions for a model which generally deal with a large scale domain a shallow nearshore model becomes handy and less computation intensive if we address a smaller domain and higher resolution by taking the boundary inputs from a coarse grid model 3 data used 3 1 wind forcings wave models are extremely sensitive to details of the wind input and using high quality winds and knowledge of the wave physics can reproduce the real sea state and wave climate high quality analyzed wind fields provided by ecmwf era 40 oscat winds and blended winds such as quikscat ncep winds were used in the present study it may be noted that ecmwf janssen et al 1997 cavaleri and bertotti 2006 caires and sterl 2005 moeini et al 2010 and qscat ncep milliff et al 2004 wu and chiang 2007 were the most commonly used wind fields in wave modelling studies ecmwf 40 year reanalysis era 40 is a reanalysis of meteorological observations from september 1957 to august 2002 45 years released by ecmwf uppala et al 2005 sterl and caires 2005 caires et al 2005 one of the products of era 40 consists of 6 hourly global fields of wind speed at 10 m height u10 with a 1 5 1 5 grid resolution besides atmospheric variables it also includes wave parameters era 40 was produced using the ecmwf integrated forecasting system a two way coupled atmosphere wave model system and a three dimensional variational data assimilation scheme 3dvar in this study the wind speed and the stresses τx and τy for the months january and july 2000 were extracted fromera 40 and the same were used to estimate wind direction and the winds were further interpolated to 1 1 grid resolution swain et al 2017 the processed six hourly winds for january and july 2000 were then used to force the wave models wam wwiii for the globe and swan for the coastal locations quikscat ncep blended ocean winds from colorado research associates version5 0 covers from july 1999 to july 2009 6 hourly with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 latitude longitude quikscat ncep blended wind products were derived through a spatial blending of the high resolution scatterometer quikscat wind observations with the ncep ncar reanalysis winds chin et al 1998 and milliff et al 1999 the blending scheme retains the quikscat wind measurements in its swath regions and enhances the ncep ncar fields kalnay et al 1996 in quikscat sampling gaps through imposition of high wave number content that is based on monthly local quikscat statistics it is important to note that the quality of ncep winds is considerably enhanced by blending quickscat measurements quikscat ncep blended winds six hourly for july 2008 and january 2009 have been averaged to 1 1 model grid resolution for the purpose of wave hindcasting apart from these the study also used oceansat ii winds available for the global oceans the availability of scatterometer winds has provided the best opportunity and challenge in evaluating the performance of swan using the satellite measured winds both speed and direction exclusively as input the resolution of global wind vector data provided by the national remote sensing centre nrsc is 50 km and 25 km with a repetitive period of 2 days sudha and prasada rao 2013 the oscat mission goals were to provide wind data between 4 and 24 m s 1 with an accuracy of 2 m s 1 and directional accuracy of 20 rani and gupta 2013 hence the models were executed using the 6 hourly spatio temporal interpolated oscat winds for the year 2011 3 2 wave buoy data in the indian ocean region several deep sea and shallow water moored buoys buoy type discus have been deployed by the national institute of ocean technology chennai since 1997 premkumar et al 2000 under the national data buoy program ndbp to measure several near surface meteorological and oceanic variables jossia et al 2010a 2010b the buoys are equipped with global positioning system beacon light and satellite transceiver these buoys are operable from 20 m water depths to full ocean depth excepting a few buoys which function in slightly lower depths the sensor used in the measurement of wave parameters is an inertial altitude heading reference system with dynamic linear motion measurement capability the waves are measured in the buoy by a motion reference unit which measures absolute roll pitch yaw and relative heave these data are recorded at a rate of 1 hz for 17min every 3 h hence it measures the full spectrum of the waves for 17 min the hs is estimated as four times the square root of the area under the non directional wave spectrum it has an accuracy 10 cm for wave height up to 20 m and 5 for wave direction in this study wave data measured at locations such as sw1 off pipavav port and sw2 off bombay during january and july 2000 are utilized for the validation of wave model swan hindcasts the locations of these buoys are shown in fig 1 a the details on deployment locations water depth and duration of data are listed in table 1 apart from the above two buoys the study also uses the datawell waverider dwr buoy situated off gopalpur to validate the hindcast wave parameters along the northeast coast of india 3 3 satellite altimeter data radar altimeters onboard satellites are an excellent tool to study global hs of reasonably high quality because hs can be inferred directly from the shape of the returned radar pulse barrick 1968 thus altimeter derived hs data are commonly used for model validation and data assimilation procedures vethamony et al 2006 many studies have been carried out validating hs from altimeters against in situ observations from buoys and ships ebuchi and kawamura 1994 hwang et al 1998 durrant et al 2009 the results of these studies suggest that the measurement of hs from radar altimeters is fairly accurate the accuracy being at par with the observations from buoys 3 3 1 aviso near real time data radar altimeters are active microwave sensors which operate during all weather conditions the hs is inferred from the shape of the pulse returning to nadir looking altimeter assuming gaussian surface elevations aviso archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data cnes france provides global merged daily averaged hs data based on observations from different satellite missions jason 1 and 2 envisat gfo and ers 2 data from a number of altimeter missions are merged to provide consistent and homogeneous products sea level currents wind modulus hs for varied applications both for near real time applications and offline studies by aviso the aviso live access server las provides nrt merged gridded wind wave products ftp ftp aviso oceanobs com pub oceano aviso wind wave nrt mswh which are used for the present study a merged data set is generated using measurements from individual altimeter missions with the additional criterion that at least two missions should be available for a particular grid point this criterion for preparing the gridded product will keep the wave heights in the same range as the daily averages the gridding and averaging involves all the available altimeter missions over a particular day which ensures sufficient spatial coverage the data is cross calibrated using ocean surface topography mission ostm jason 2 as reference mission in two steps first backscatter coefficient sigma0 computed from the power of the return pulse of the altimeter and wave s histograms are calibrated then the ostm jason 2 wind algorithm applied to cross calibrated sigma0 finally the multimission arrays are averaged to 1 1 boxes in this study validation was done january to december 2011 against the aviso gridded daily averaged data the details of validation location using altimeter aviso measurements is indicated in table 2 even though the merging of several satellite observations and its averaging degrade the quality of altimeter observations the comparison will give insight as to what extent these products are reliable for real applications such as climatological studies and forecast validations 4 methodology wam cycle 4 5 3 has been implemented for wave hindcast in deep waters and during the execution of wam outputs included bc generated for swan applications in the nearshore regions d1 as shown in fig 1 similarly wwiii version 3 14 is also implemented to inter compare swan results using bc from both these global models the wave model descriptions and setup is described in table 3 the global domains of wam and wwiii cover the geographical extents 0 to 360 e and 77 s to 77 n with resolutions of 1 1 the wam model uses 25 frequencies ranging from 0 04177 hz to 0 41145 hz and 24 directions constant increment to represent the wave spectral distribution similarly wwiii model uses 25 frequencies ranging from 0 0412 hz to 0 4056 hz with a logarithmic distribution with increment factor 1 1 and 24 directions constant increment in the present study analyzed winds such as era 40 and quikscat ncep blended wind products and oscat winds have been used for driving the wave models the surface current data required as input for wave models were obtained from the ocean surface current analyses real time oscar database bonjean and lagerloef 2002 the water level was generated using the tpxo7 1 global inverse tide model egbert and erofeeva 2002 the era interim daily fields from ecmwf were used for extracting the air sea temperature difference data used as input by wwiii model the global model bathymetries have been constructed from etopo2 data swan v40 85 the swan team 2011 has been implemented for wave hindcasting using the above mentioned era 40 quikscat ncep blended wind products and oscat winds for selected coastal domains off northwest d2 as shown in fig 1 67 e to 74 e and 17 n to 24 n and northeast d3 as shown in fig 1 80 e to 87 e and 14 n to 21 n coasts of india each covering an area of 7 7 longitude latitude grid domains d2 and d3 also the regional intermediate grid system implemented for swan covers the geographical extend 55 e to 95 e and 0 n to 30 n as shown in fig 1 domain d1 with a resolution 0 25 0 25 north indian ocean region the number of bins in the frequency and directional space are 50 and 36 respectively the frequency band used for swan ranges between 0 05 hz and 0 5 hz the swan model bathymetry has been constructed from c map data the formulations of the available physical processes and their coefficients included in the swan model is as shown in table 4 during the global execution of wam and wwiii bc have been generated and subsequently used to execute swan over 0 25 0 25 grid resolution for the north indian ocean region domain d1 as shown fig 1 further swan booij et al 1999 is executed for the two selected coastal model domains sites as indicated above each with resolutions of 0 1 0 1 here it may also be noted that the domain boundaries either for model execution or analysis of wind and wave variability have been chosen based on the prevailing wind and wave conditions for the past several years swain et al 2004 without taking into account the actual geographical boundaries of the regions under study the time step for model computations for the intermediate grid was set to 20 min for north indian ocean domain and 10 min the swan team 2011 for northwest as well as northeast coastal domains the wave models were uniformly driven with six hourly winds oscar surface currents and water level tide the swan model outputs for various wave parameters were stored every 6 hourly altimeter observations in comparison with swan simulated hs at the selected locations were obtained by interpolating the gridded altimeter hs data using the natural neighbor interpolation method which is particularly effective for dealing with a variety of spatial data exhibiting clustered or highly linear distributions sibson 1981 the weights used in natural neighbor interpolation are based on amount of influence any grid point will have on the computed value at the interpolation point this amount of influence is entirely dependent on the area of influence of the surrounding scatter points to the interpolation point nearest four grid points are considered since aviso provides gridded altimeter hs as a daily average hs six hourly swan outputs were averaged over the day this daily averaged swan outputs and the interpolated altimeter observations to the selected location comprises the collocation in this study swan hindcasts have been carried out using bc from wam and wwiii for five different cases such as january and july 2000 july 2008 january 2009 and june 2011 using era 40 quikscat ncep blended and oscat winds all these case studies were primarily chosen as these typical months are to be studied from wind and wave climate point of view young 1991 sterl and caires 2005 and for the purpose of hindcast wave analysis in different wind conditions considering the importance of monsoon winds over the study region the months of january and june july were chosen with the consideration that january and june july are the peaks of northeast and southwest monsoon periods respectively over north indian ocean the significant wave parameters considered for this inter comparison study are hs mean wave period tm02 denoted as tm hereafter and swell wave height hereafter hsw 4 1 statistical error estimates to evaluate the relative model performance based on the inter comparison studies statistical error analysis was carried out for the corresponding months of wave hindcasts the statistical measures such as coefficient of correlation r scatter index si bias b or mean deviation root mean square error rmse percentage error pe and model performance index mpi between the model outputs have been computed the main assumption for the computation of statistical parameters is that the measured data are error free although this assumption is not realistic it is necessary for computation when a set of n model predicted m and observed obs scalar values are given the bias b is a statistical quantity that signifies the average difference between in situ measurement and model output padilla hernandez et al 2007 it is also known as mean error and can be given by 8 b i a s 1 n o b s m the bias value reveals the general trends in the model performance remya et al 2012 and allows to conclude whether the model consistently over or under predicts the measurements it can nevertheless be misleading in cases where both over and under estimations occur rmse is a generalized form of standard deviation however the overall residual variation can be deducted from the information about the spread of data and their inter relationships hence the rmse is an absolute measure of the fit between the model data and buoy measurement it is inferred that the lower the value of rmse better the fit of data between model and observations root mean square error is defined as 9 r m s e 1 n m o b s 2 for an ideal forecast the root mean square error is zero korres et al 2011 by definition the scatter index si is the standard deviation of the difference normalized by the mean of the observations romeiser 1993 the si is expressed in percentage as a measure and indicates how close the results of computation model and experiments are the si does not reveal general trends but evaluates the average model performance as follows 10 s i r m s e o b s where o b s is the mean of observations the correlation coefficient is yet another frequently used parameter to quantify the relation between m and obs here the correlation coefficient r is used to measure the strength and direction of relationship between two variables observed predicted the resulting sign represents the directionality of the estimate the correlation coefficient has numerical value if a consistent linear relation exists between m and obs and 0 if m and obs are independent if the correlation coefficient is close to one this suggests that there is good positive correlation between model and observed data low random error but it does not mean that there is no systematic error correlation coefficient r is defined as 11 r m m o b s o b s m m 2 o b s o b s 2 here m is the mean value of the model derived wave parameter to better diagnose the model performance from a modelling point of view the percentage error pe brown 2010 and model performance index mpi are also calculated ris et al 1999 percentage error pe is defined as the difference between measured and hindcast parameters as a percentage of the observed value 12 p e 100 i 1 n m i o b s i o b s i however it is essential to note here that the estimates such as rmse and pe etc between the two hindcasts using bc from wam and wwiii are relative measures assuming that one of the models is the benchmark reference say wam in this case therefore the interpretation of rmse pe and b bias etc are to be treated accordingly the mpi is a test of how well the model performs relative to a perfect model run minus the ratio of rms error of the model to rms value of the modeled changes in wave parameters from the up wave boundary rms changes is the difference between the measured value replaced with value observed at the incoming incident wave boundary the diagnostic model performance index indicates the degree to which the model reproduces the observed changes of the waves like the scatter index it is defined in terms of root mean square values 13 m p i 1 r m s e r r o r r m s c h a n g e s for a perfect model rms error 0 the value of the mpi would obviously be 1 whereas it would be 0 for a model that erroneously predicts no changes rms error rms changes 5 results and discussion 5 1 inter comparison of swan hindcast fields with wam and wwiii in this study attempts were first made to compare the spatial distributions of wave hindcasts simulated by i wam and swan using wam bc and ii wwiii and swan using wwiii bc fig 2 shows inter comparison of wam and swan using wam bc hindcast fields such as the spatial distributions of hs mean wave direction tm and hsw for 20 july 2000 1200 h in the northwest coastal domain using only era 40wind fields for all the model runs the contour plot of hs fig 2 a based on wam hindcasts reveal more or less a similar distribution variation ranging from 0 6 to 2 0 m as compared with swan simulated hs using wam bc as shown in fig 2 d it may also be noted that the waves are propagating from offshore to nearshore waters and significant variation between the two models may only be expected in areas below 15 m of water depth the spatial distributions of hs with mean wave direction fig 2 a d tm fig 2 b e and hsw fig 2 c and f of wam and swan also appear to be more or less similar while swan predicted parameters are expected to be more accurate because of higher spatial and directional resolutions besides the theoretical as well as numerical soundness of a shallow water model compared with the deep water global models similarly the contour plots of hs tm and hsw for the northeast coast of india d3 are also shown for their inter comparisons in fig 3 for 20 july 2000 1200 h the spatial distribution for hs fig 3 d predicted by swan using wam bc varied between 1 4 and 2 1 m and shows differences with that of wam simulated wave field as shown in fig 3 a here unlike northwest coastal domain of india the locally generated waves propagating offshore were found to be driven by westerly winds whereas swells were also propagating from open sea around southerly driven by distant southwest monsoon winds as seen from fig 3 b and e the hindcast tm both by wam and swan ranged between 6 3 and 7 7s and it is seen that there are some differences in their spatial distributions similar is the case for hsw as shown in fig 3 c and f therefore figs 2 and 3 suggest that in case of onshore winds as in the northwest coastal domain both wam and swan could simulate the sea state comparably however in the case of waves propagating offshore and primarily influenced also by the offshore winds the hindcast results of wam and swan based on the spatial distributions as shown in fig 3 show significant differences fig 4 shows the spatial inter comparisons of wwiii and swan using wwiii bc hindcasts for hs with mean wave direction tm and hsw for the northwest coastal domain for 20 july 2000 1200 h using era 40 winds the contour plot of hs varying from 0 7 to 1 7 m as shown in fig 4 a simulated by wwiii reveals a significant difference in its distribution as compared with swan wave field using wwiii bc as shown in fig 4 d this reveals that from the multiscale model set up swan hindcast should be better than wwiii deep water model although it is implemented over a resolution of 0 1 0 1 similarly the spatial distribution of tm 4 3 5 5s as shown in fig 4 b predicted by wwiii also appear qualitatively different if compared with swan using wwiii bc as shown in fig 4 e fig 4 c and f show wwiii and swan simulated hsw ranging from 0 7 to 1 3 m which also indicatethat swan hindcast show differences as compared with wwiii fig 5 shows the spatial distributions of wwiii and swan using wwiii bc hindcasts such as hs with direction tm and hsw for 20 july 2000 1200 h in the northeast coastal domain of india also using era 40 winds the contour plot of hs ranged between 1 4 and 2 0 m as shown in fig 5 a by wwiii also reveal certain differences in its distribution as compared with the swan simulated hs using wwiii bc as shown in fig 5 d similarly the spatial distribution of tm which ranged between 5 8 and 7 6s as in fig 5 b for wwiii appear also to be different from tm simulated by swan using wwiii bc as shown in fig 5 e the spatial distribution of hsw 1 3 1 8 m by swan using wwiii bc as shown in fig 5 f for the northeast coastal domain appears to be marginally different from wwiii shown in fig 5 c the above qualitative comparison of the results of wam and wwiii with swan using bc of wam and wwiii reveals their similarities and differences with higher expectations on swan to be better in the selected coastal domains than that of wam and wwiii deep water hindcasts however the following sections below presents a detailed analysis on their inter comparisons quantitatively 5 2 inter comparison of swan hindcast fields using wam wwiii boundary conditions besides the above inter comparison of the spatial distributions for a few sample model outputs detailed inter comparisons have been carried out further for swan model outputs using wam and wwiii bc for the selected months such as january 2000 and july 2000 using era 40 winds july 2008 and january 2009 using quikscat ncep blended winds and june 2011 using oscat winds for the selected northwest and northeast coastal domains of india which are discussed using their respective scatter plots of selected output parameters 5 3 northwest and northeast coast hindcasts with wam wwiii boundary input and era 40 winds the scatter plots of swan hindcast parameters using wam and wwiii bc such as hs tm and hsw in the month of january 2000 for the northwest coastal domain are plotted in fig 6 italso shows the statistical estimates of the inter comparison between swan output parameters during january 2000 for all the model grid points common to global and the northwest and northeast coastal domains total 3720 and 3472 table 5 a shows the detailed statistical

hindcast hs tm and hsw for the northwest coast revealed higher correlation with r values 0 96 0 98 and 0 97 respectively the inter comparison of swan outputs using wam and wwiii bc for hs reveal si of 0 04 bias of 0 21 m rmse of 0 06 m and pe of 17 5 assuming swan using wam bc as the standard reference which may be interpreted either way between swan outputs using wam and wwiii bc the lower values of si rmse and pe reveal a better fit between swan hs hindcast using wam and wwiii bc for the northwest coastal domain during january 2000 tm indicates a bias of 0 36s si of 0 03 rmse of 0 22s and pe of 6 1 the inter comparison for hsw shows si of 0 02 bias of 0 15 m rmse of 0 03 m and pe 12 7 the values of mpi are 0 96 for hs 0 97 for tm and 0 98 for hsw which suggests good agreement between swan outputs using wam and wwiii bc the pe values are higher for both hs 17 5 and hsw 12 7 while tm revealed low pe of 6 1 fig 6 reveals that swan outputs such as hs tm and hsw using wam bc are higher compared to swan outputs using wwiii bc by 17 5 6 1 and 12 7 respectively these are significant differences surely not due to swan but due to the difference in the boundary inputs from wam and wwiii as we have seen from the spatial distributions figs 2 5 discussed earlier as in fig 6 fig 7 shows the inter comparison of swan model parameters using wam and wwiii bc for the northeast coastal domain of india during january 2000 using era 40 winds the hindcast wave parameters of swan using wam and wwiii bc such as hs tm and hsw also show high correlation coefficient r of 0 95 0 99 and 0 95 respectively table 5 a however the inter comparison for hs reveals si of 0 02 bias of 0 12 m rmse of 0 03 m and pe of 12 1 the hindcast tm as shown in fig 7 b has varied from 3 6 to 11 7s and shows bias of 0 03s si of 0 01 rmse of 0 06s and pe of 2 4 between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc similarly hsw shows si of 0 02 bias of 0 09 m rmse is 0 02 m and pe of 10 6 the values of mpi are 0 98 for hs 0 99 for tm and 0 98 for hsw which suggests very good agreements between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc for the northeast coastal domain the inter comparison clearly indicate good agreement for tm predicted by swan using wam and wwiii bc however swan predicted hs and hsw using wam bc were higher by 12 1 and 10 6 respectively as compared to swan using wwiii bc fig 8 shows the inter comparison of swan output parameters using wam and wwiii bc for northwest coastal domain of india during 01 31 july 2000 using era 40 winds table 5 b shows the statistical estimates of the inter comparison between swan output parameters during july 2000 the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw for the northwest coast show high correlations of 0 98 r 0 98 and 0 96 respectively the comparison for hs predicted by swan using both bc for northwest coast of india reveals si of 0 04 bias of 0 19 m rmse of 0 05 m and pe of 15 7 similarly the inter comparison for tm shows bias of 0 29s si of 0 03 rmse of 0 18s and pe of 5 6 which reveal a very good agreement between swan hindcasts using bc of both the global models hsw which varied from 0 2 to 1 9 m during july 2000 show si of 0 02 and bias of 0 06 m the rmse for hsw is 0 01 m and pe is 8 5 the estimated values of mpi are 0 96 for hs 0 97 for tmand 0 98 for hsw which clearly indicate good agreement between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii

rmse of 0 07s and pe of 3 0 between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc similarly hsw shows si of 0 01 bias of 0 04 m rmse is 0 02 m and pe of 6 8 the values of mpi are same 0 99 for hs tm and hsw which suggest a very good agreement between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc for the northeast coastal domain however swan predicted hs tm and hsw using wam bc are higher by 8 5 3 0 and 6 8 respectively as compared to swan using wwiii bc 5 4 northwest and northeast coast hindcasts with wam wwiii boundary input and quikscat ncep blended winds here inter comparisons have been carried out for swan model hindcast outputs using wam and wwiii bc and quikscat ncep blended winds for two selected months such as july 2008 and january 2009 for the northwest and northeast coastal domains of india the scatter plots of swan hindcast parameters using wam and wwiii bc such as hs tm and hsw for the month of july 2008 are shown in fig 10 for the northwest coastal domain table 6 a b shows the detailed statistical estimates of the inter comparison between swan output parameters during july 2008 and january 2009 respectively during july 2008 hs varied from 0 3 to 3 5 m with mean hs 1 9 m for this model domain in this case the hindcast hs tm and hsw reveal very high correlations with r values 0 97 0 99 and 0 97 respectively between the two hindcasts the inter comparison for hs reveals si of 0 07 bias of 0 31 m rmse of 0 13 m and pe of 19 2 similarly the comparison for tm shows a bias of 0 53s si of 0 07 rmse of 0 46s and pe of 7 8 the hsw within the model domain varied from 0 2 to 2 6 m and show si of 0 03 and bias of 0 14 m rmse of 0 04 m and pe of 12 1 the estimated values of mpi is 0 93 both for hs and tm and 0 97 for hsw which indicate a relatively good agreement between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc the pe reveals that hindcast wave parameters for swan using wam bc are higher by 19 2 for hs 12 1 for hsw and 7 8 for tm fig 11 shows the inter comparison of swan model parameters using wam and wwiii bc for the northeast coastal domain of india during july 2008 using quikscat ncep blended winds the inter comparisons for hs tm and hsw show higher correlations of 0 98 r 0 98 and 0 95 respectively hs reveal si of 0 02 bias of 0 13 m rmse of 0 04 m and pe of 9 3 the hindcast tm as shown in fig 11 b varied from 3 9 to 9 8s and shows bias of 0 22s si of 0 01 rmse of 0 10s and pe of 3 5 between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc similarly hsw shows si of 0 01 bias of 0 04 m rmse of 0 02 m and pe of 7 7 the values of mpi is 0 98 both for hs and tm and 0 99 for hsw however swan predicted hs tm and hsw using wam bc are higher by 9 3 3 5 and 7 7 as compared to swan nested in wwiii fig 12 shows the inter comparison of swan hindcast parameters using wam and wwiii bc for the northwest coast of india during 01 31 january 2009 in this case hs tm and hsw reveal higher correlations of 0 96 r 0 98 and 0 97 respectively table 6 b the inter comparison for hs reveals si of 0 03 bias of 0 19 m rmse of 0 05 m and pe of 15 4 similarly tm shows bias of 0 39s si of 0 04 rmse of 0 25s and pe of 6 1 which reveal a good agreement between swan hindcasts using both

both models the inter comparison of tm also reveals significant agreement for swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc hindcast hs and hsw using wam bc are higher by 12 7 and 10 6 respectively as compared to swan using wwiii bc it may be noted that fig 13 shows a very distinct behavior more prominently for hs and hsw and less prominent in case of tm which indicates a decoupled scenario between locally generated waves and waves propagating from south a similar hindcast study by padilla hernandez et al 2007 for two selected storms january 2000 and january 2002 in atlantic ocean using mc2 canadian mesoscale compressible community model winds which are comparable with quickscat ncep merged winds suggested that swan results hs were competitive using bc of wam and wwiii in nested mode 5 5 northwest and northeast coast hindcasts with wam wwiii boundary input and oscat winds in this case inter comparisons have been carried out for swan model outputs using wam and wwiii bc and oscat winds for a selected month of june 2011 for northwest and northeast coastal domains considered fig 14 shows the inter comparison of swan output parameters such as hs tm and hsw for the northwest coastal domain for june 2011 table 7 shows the detailed statistical estimates of the inter comparison between swan output parameters during june 2011 here hs varied from 0 3 to 3 5 m over the model domain with mean hs 1 9 m the hindcast hs tm and hsw reveal higher correlations with r values 0 98 0 94 and 0 98 respectively the inter comparison of swan outputs using wam and wwiii bc for hs reveal si of 0 05 bias of 0 24 m rmse of 0 09 m and pe of 15 0 the lower values of si rmse and pe reveal a better fit between swan hs hindcast using wam and wwiii bc for the northwest coastal domain during june 2011 tm reveals bias of 0 02s si of 0 01 rmse of 0 08s and pe of 3 6 the inter comparison for hsw shows si of 0 01 bias of 0 07 m rmse of 0 02 m and pe of 6 5 the values of mpi are 0 95 for hs and 0 99 both for tm and hsw which suggests significant agreements between swan outputs using wam and wwiii bc pe suggests that swan outputs such as hs tm and hsw using wam bc are higher compared to swan outputs using wwiii bc by 15 0 3 6 and 6 5 respectively fig 15 shows the inter comparison of swan model parameters using wam and wwiii bc for the northeast coastal domain of india during june 2011 using oscat winds the hindcast wave parameters such as hs tm and hsw show significantly higher correlations of 0 99 r 0 96 and 0 99 respectively the inter comparisons for hs reveal si of 0 01 bias of 0 11 m rmse of 0 02 m and pe of 6 7 the hindcast tm as shown in fig 15 b varied from 3 7 to 9 6s and shows bias of 0 23s si of 0 02 rmse of 0 11s and pe of 4 3 between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc similarly hsw shows si of 0 01 bias of 0 07 m rmse of 0 01 m and pe of 4 6 the values of mpi are 0 98 both for hs and tm and 0 99 for hsw which suggests very good agreement between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc in the northeast coastal domain the inter comparisons for the wave parameters clearly indicate very good agreement for tm predicted by swan pe 4 3 however swan predicted hs and hsw using wam bc are higher by 6 7 and 4 6 respectively as compared to swan using wwiii bc the inter comparisons and overall evaluation based on statistical measures using different wind forcings show that swan model performs moderately well during all periods using era 40 oscat and blended winds the deviations in the performance of the model can be due to varied reasons most importantly during the fair weather season the study area would be dominated by long swells and the different representation of swell propagation in model physics in wam and wwiii could be a possible reason hence it can be concluded that apart from wind forcing wave model physics numeric and model grid resolution are major factors which affect the model performances using bc of wam and wwiii these studies indicate that use of higher frequency winds to force the wave model yields positive output impact particularly in the case of hs in short without high quality wind forcing fields wave model results may suffer even given the correct physics furthermore one can speculate that the quality of wind forcing fields becomes even more critical when considering higher order wave spectral moments because these terms are more directly associated with shorter waves and hence tied more strongly to the wind forcing 5 6 validation of swan hindcasts using buoy measurements in the previous discussions sections 5 2 5 5 we attempted to compare the swan hindcasts using bc from the deep water models wam and wwiii it is well known that validation of significant wave parameters at any coastal location is an important aspect in numerical wave prediction and it forms an important step in the operational forecasting centers the major limitation of this study is the lack of potential measured data to validate the swan simulated parameters off the northwest and northeast coasts of india hence this study utilized the available buoy data and data from other sources to validate the significant wave parameters the swan simulated hs and tmwere compared for the months of january and july 2000 at two moored buoy locations sw1 20 88 n 71 49 e and sw2 18 59 n 71 04 e as shown in fig 1 a located in the northwest coast of india along the northeast coast of india the comparisons were carried out for the period july 2008 and january 2009 using a dwr buoy located off gopalpur 19 28 n 84 25 e fig 1 a the statistical estimates for the validation of swan model using wam wwiii bc with buoy measurements sw1 sw2 in the northwest coast of india during january and july 2000 is shown in table 8 fig 16 a and b c d shows the comparison of simulated swan hs and tmusing wam and wwiii bc with sw1 buoy measurements for the months of january and july 2000 respectively during january 2000 fig 16 a the comparison of hs indicated high correlations r 0 95 with low si 0 16 and rmse 0 05 m using wam bc the negative bias indicated a very slight underestimation b 0 02 m of the wave height at the sw1 buoy location at the same time using wwiii bc the correlations were comparatively lower r 0 84 with high si 0 42 and rmse 0 39 m it is noted that the wave heights were overestimated at the sw1 buoy location using b 0 29 m wwiii bc and this can be attributed to the quality of wind inputs and the physics driving the different representation of swell propagations in both the models the pe and mpi using wam bc were 6 7 and 0 97 while with wwiii bc it was 18 4 and 0 83 respectively similarly the comparison of tm fig 16 b revealed very high correlations r 0 9 using wam and wwiii bc at the sw1 location the wam bc could fairly reproduce tm at the buoy location with very low si 0 08 and rmse 0 05s a slight overestimation of tm was noted at the buoy location using wwiii bc with si 0 31 and rmse 0 29s the pe and mpi using wam bc for tm are 5 2 and 0 96 respectively similarly using wwiii bc tm revealed pe and mpi of 15 5 and 0 86 respectively fig 16 c and d shows the comparison of simulated swan outputs at the sw1 buoy location for the period july 2000 it is noted that during july 2000 swan hs is overestimated using wwiii bc with high deviations while only a slight underestimation is observed using wam bc the comparison revealed correlations of the order r 0 8 in both cases the si 0 52 and rmse 0 41 m were high in the case of hindcasts using wwiii bc in comparison to wam bc si 0 02 rmse 0 11 m the pe and mpi using wam bc are 9 3 and 0 96 similarly using wwiii bc hs showed pe and mpi such as 20 6 and 0 87 respectively similarly tm gave a good comparison at the buoy location with slight overestimation using wwiii bc and slight underestimation using wam bc the comparison of tm at the buoy location was promising enough with high correlations r 0 9 swan hindcasts using wam bc revealed very low si 0 03 and rmse 0 13s similarly using wwiii bc the hindcast tm showed low si 0 12 and rmse 0 19s hence the swan model could fairly reproduce tm at the sw1 buoy location with minimum deviations overall the comparisons at the sw1 buoy location for january and july 2000 reveals that swan using wam bc could reproduce hs and tm at the buoy location with lesser deviations as compared to swan nested in wwiii in the northwest coast of the india the swan hindcasts were also validated at a buoy location sw2 off bombay for the months of january and july 2000 fig 17 a and b shows the comparison between the sw2 measurements hs and tm and swan hindcast parameters for january 2000 using era 40 winds with bc from wam and wwiii the model predicted parameters as shown in fig 17 a and b shows higher correlation with the observations using wam bc the correlation coefficients are 0 97 and 0 92 for hs and tm respectively with si values 0 06 and 0 09 which are low the bias is also low and positive such as 0 12 m and 0 18sfor hs and tm respectively indicating a good match with observed values the rmse is low 0 07 m and 0 14s for hs and tm respectively which also show a strong fit between the model and observations the pe is too low 5 8 and 7 9 respectively for hs and tm which shows a good match between the model and observations therefore the estimated mpi is quite high for both hs 0 97 and tm 0 95 which reveals that the swan hindcasts could reproduce the significant wave parameters at the buoy location with higher accuracy similarly the model predicted parameters using wwii bc for january 2000 as shown in fig 17 a and b shows slightly lesser correlation with the observations the correlation coefficients are 0 86 and 0 81 for hs and tm respectively with si values 0 38 and 0 42 which are high the values of bias are 0 21 m and 0 19sfor hs and tm respectively indicating overestimation and underestimation from the observed values the rmse values are of the order 0 48 m and 0 37s for hs and tm respectively which show a weak fit between the model and observations the pe is 17 8 and 15 6 respectively for hs and tm which show a higher deviation between the model and observations hence mpi is less than 0 87 indicating only a moderate performance using wwiii bc at the buoy location fig 17 c d shows the comparison between the observed sw2 and predicted wave parameters hs and tm using era 40 winds at 6 hourly intervals for the period 01 31 july 2000 for the selected location off bombay west coast of india the model predicted parameters using wam bc as shown in fig 17 c and d reveal higher correlations with the sw2 observations the correlation coefficients are 0 97 and 0 93 for hs and tm respectively with si values 0 03 and 0 07 the values of bias are 0 04 m and 0 06s respectively for hs and tm the rmse is low such as 0 08 m and 0 05s for hs and tm respectively which indicate a strong fit between the model and observations pe is 4 6 for hs and 5 9 for tm which also reveal a good match between swan and the observations mpi values are 0 98 and 0 96 respectively for hs and tm swan predicted parameters as shown in fig 17 c and d also reveal correlations of the order r 0 9 with sw2 observations using wwiii bc the correlation coefficients are 0 86 and 0 82 for hs and tm respectively with si values 0 43 and 0 31 the bias values are 0 39 m and 0 42s for hs and tm respectively as the predicted values are seen to be higher the rmse values are also high such as 0 54 m and 0 43s for hs and tm respectively which suggests weak fit between the model and observations as compared to wam bc the pe is 16 2 and 12 3 respectively for hs and tm indicating deviations between the model and observations with mpi 0 81 and 0 87 in the northeast coast of india swan hindcasts were validated for the period july 2008 and january 2009 using a dwr buoy located off gopalpur the statistical estimates for the validation of wave model swan with buoy measurements in the bay of bengal during july 2008 and january 2009 using bc of both wam and wwiii is shown in table 9 fig 18 a b shows the comparison between the observed and predicted wave parameters hs and tm at 6 hourly intervals for the period 01 31 july 2008 using wam and wwiii bc swan predicted parameters hs and tm as shown in fig 18 a and b respectively compare with the observation using wam bc the buoy versus model hindcasts for hs indicate a strong correlation coefficient of 0 83 using wam bc the value of si is 0 02 which is lower indicating a better fit between the model and buoy hs bias is positive such as 0 04 m rmse is 0 04 m and pe is lower 9 4 the value of mpi is very strong 0 97 for hs similarly using wwiii bc the model predicted parameter hs reveal a good correlation with the observations r 0 88 the value of si is 0 03 which is lower indicating a better fit between the model and buoy hs the bias is positive 0 14 m and considerably a lower value rmse is 0 05 m and pe is also lower 10 5 the mpi is higher enough 0 97 indicating better performance of swan for hs the tm also show good correlation r 0 74 with the buoy measurements as shown in fig 18 b using wam bc estimated si indicate a better fit with a lower value of 0 05 bias is negative and lower such as 0 01s the rmse is 0 34s which also show good agreement the pe is 7 2 which shows a best performance of the swan model mpi is also very high 0 95 indicating strong agreement between the model and the measured tm similarly tm also shows a good correlation of 0 80 between hindcast and buoy measurements using wwiii bc si is as low as 0 04 and bias is positive such as 0 27s rmse is 0 31s showing a good agreement and pe is considerably less 7 0 which reveal better performance of swan mpi is also higher enough such as 0 95 indicating a strong agreement between the model and measured tm a similar study of swan bc from wwiii using in situ wave rider buoy data off puducherry southeast coast of india was performed for the period from june 2007 until july 2009 by sandhya et al 2014 it was evident from both model and observations that there was an overall trend in wave heights showing a reasonable match with buoy observations the deviations can be attributed to the differences in the wind input parameterization in the models which shows varied response to relatively fast changes in wind speed the swan model validations using wam and wwiii bc with observations of the same wave rider buoy was also executed for the month of january 2009 fig 18 c and d shows the comparison between the buoy off gopalpur and predicted wave parameters hs and tm at 6 hourly intervals for the period 01 31 january 2009 the swan model predicted parameters hs and tm as shown in fig 18 c and d reveal poor correlation with the observations for hs while it demonstrates good correlation with observations for tm the estimated mean and ranges of hs for the buoy and swan hindcast deviate by 0 2 m january 2009 while the measured hs ranged between 0 3 and 0 9 m the buoy and hindcast hs show a correlation coefficient of 0 57 and si of 0 10 estimated bias and rmse are 0 19 m and 0 05 m respectively this being the northeast monsoon period pe is somewhat higher 25 2 for hs the mpi is 0 90 which indicate a reasonable agreement between the model and measurements compared to hs tm shows a better correlation r 0 91 between the buoy and swan hindcast using wam bc the si of 0 13 indicates a good fit between the observed tm and swan hindcast tm shows a lower bias of 0 59s while the observed tm varied from 3 4 to 10 2s the values of rmse pe and mpi are 0 83s 11 3 and 0 87 respectively all of these estimated statistics reveal very good agreement between swan and buoy observations tm using wam bc as seen from fig 18 d the comparison of swan hindcast wave parameters using quikscat ncep blended winds and wwiii bc with buoy measurements in the bay of bengal during january 2009 show considerable correlation with the observations the estimated means and ranges of hs for the buoy and swan hindcasts using wwiii bc deviate by 0 2 and 0 1 m respectively january 2009 which are low and acceptable the buoy and hindcast hs show a correlation coefficient of 0 71 r 0 94 for tm and si of 0 05 estimated bias and rmse are 0 13 m and 0 02mrespectively which reveal a moderate agreement between the model and observations with pe of 19 7 the mpi is higher enough 0 95 indicating that the model could simulate hs well at buoy location compared with hs tm shows a better correlation r 0 94 between buoy and swan hindcast the si value of 0 09 indicates a good fit between the observed tm and swan hindcast while it shows a bias of 0 44s the values of rmse pe and mpi are 0 57s 9 7 and 0 91 respectively all of them reveal a good agreement between the model and buoy observations as seen from fig 18 d the deviations in hs and tm at the buoy locations can be due to many reasons the quality of the wind forcing is essential for the good performance of the wave model it also determines to a large extent the evolution of the forecast errors janssen 1998 it is known that wave spectral directional spreads have a tendency to be too broad partly due to the limited number of directional bins used by the numerical models an increase in angular resolution has a positive impact on the quality of the modeled waves it also illustrates the benefit of an increase in angular resolution of the discretized wave spectrum the accuracy of swell propagation over large distances in models is critically controlled by angular resolution and hence it is likely that significant improvements can be produced when angular resolution is improved a systematic bias might be present in the wind analysis which in turn could explain some of the analyzed wave height underestimation in deep water models wam wwiii some of these underestimations when linked to local wave growth might in part be explained by this systematic negative bias in analyzed wind speed further the different parametrization of the source terms responsible for the wind input and dissipation in the wave energy balance equation of the wave models is also a major factor 5 7 validation of swan hindcasts using satellite measurements apart from buoy measurements attempts were also made to validate the swan hindcasts using satellite altimeter measurements in this study to validate the swan simulated hs the multimission product of aviso was used for a period of one year january to december 2011 the swan simulated hs was compared at three locations fig 1 b such as w1 21 6 n 72 4 e w2 21 1 n 72 4 e and w3 20 0 n 72 2 e with depths less than 10 m 20 m and 40 m respectively similarly the predicted wave heights were also compared at three fig 1 c locations e1 19 28 n 84 8 e e2 17 62 n 83 25 e and e3 17 2 n 82 8 e in the northeast coasts of india at depths less than 10 m 20 m and 40 m respectively the estimated statistics for the comparison of swan hs with aviso measurements during january to december 2011 is shown in table 10 fig 19 shows the comparison of simulated swan hs with altimeter measurements for the three locations w1 w2 and w3 respectively comparison of model and altimeter hs shows good agreement corresponding r of 0 94 0 91 0 92 0 89 and 0 90 0 87 using wam wwiii bc during 2011off the northwest coast of india at locations w1 w2 and w3 respectively fig 19 a b c at all three locations w1 w2 w3 it is noted an underestimation of the hs by the model in comparison to altimeter data during the southwest monsoon june to september the altimeter data shows that the bias obtained indicates that the predicted swan outputs underestimates the hs compared with the altimeter the bias values obtained are 0 35 0 40 m 0 38 0 46 m and 0 31 0 39 m using wam wwiii bc for the locations w1 w2 and w3 respectively for the year 2011 a positive bias indicates underestimation of the hs by the swan model with respect to altimeter high values of rmse 0 45 0 59 m 0 33 0 40 m and 0 43 0 57 m also indicate the underestimation by the model in comparison to altimeter data the si values obtained are 0 48 0 51 0 31 0 35 and 0 50 0 55 for w1 w2 and w3 locations using wam wwiii bc respectively pe and mpi varied in the range of 15 9 21 3 and 0 80 to 0 93 respectively for all three locations it is indicated from fig 19 that in three locations the wam bc proved to give a better performance as compared with wwiii bc in a study reported by shanas et al 2014 revealed that the comparisons between hs data from the multi mission product of aviso and buoy data at two stations ratnagiri and honnavar off west coast of india showed good agreement r of 0 97 and 0 94 during 2011 similar analysis to quantify the performance of the model was also executed in the northeast coast of india for selected locations e1 e2 and e3 at depths less than 10 m 20 m and 40 m respectively fig 20 shows the comparison of predicted swan hs and altimeter measurements at the three selected locations in general the altimeter observations show that the maximum hs values are in the range of 1 56 2 03 for all three locations the high correlation coefficients greater than 0 8 suggest that both swan and altimeter hs follow a similar annual march it is seen that the swan hs are under estimated with a bias of 0 35 0 41 m 0 51 0 59 m and 0 29 0 36 m using wam wwiii bc at the locations e1 e2 and e3 respectively the rmse varies from 0 45 to 0 62 m for all three locations considered with higher deviations in location e1 the si ranged from 0 30 to 0 64 and the correlation coefficient is greater than 0 82 for all the locations these results are comparable with studies carried out by kshatriya et al 2001 durrant et al 2009 for mono missions the pe ranged from 17 5 to 23 6 for all three locations considered suggesting that within the accuracy provided by this merged altimeter hs it can be used for qualitative validation open ocean wave forecasting and for understanding the wave climate over the indian ocean the high correlation together with low si at all locations considered suggests that the altimeter hs is of reasonably good quality and can be used for long term qualitative validation of model outputs the results obtained in this study are comparable with the study reported by shanas et al 2014 which revealed an overestimation of hs r of 0 68 by the altimeter data at the puducherry location in the east coast during the southwest monsoon june to september 2011 in the same study the visakhapatnam location shanas et al 2014 also shows good agreement r of 0 9 in another study by sabique et al 2013 it is reported that the basin scale validations for arabian sea and bay of bengal using aviso measurements suggest that there is no regional dependency for the altimeter derived hs even though bay of bengal is known to be a swell dominated region throughout the year the underestimation of merged altimeter observations may be due to the smoothening of the actual data recorded by the altimeter during the process of gridding and averaging the altimeter and buoy measured hs show good agreement even during the high wave conditions that prevail during the southwest monsoon june september season altimeter hs is underestimated by 0 20 m the root mean square error rmse is less than 0 30 m the scatter index is less than 20 and the correlation coefficient is greater than 0 90 the merged data sets are not suitable for applications during extreme conditions sabique et al 2013 because of heavy distortion due to averaging and interpolating in the above study for the comparison of swan hindcasts using bc from wam and wwiii it is clearly evident that the swan hindcasts in comparison with altimeter aviso measurements were understimated at all three locations both along the northwest and northeast coasts of india although this can be partly attributed to the quality of wind inputs physics numeric and model grid resolution issues with the accuracy of altimeter data is also reported in earlier studies sabique et al 2013 shanas et al 2014 the higher hs values of altimeter data can be due to many reasons mainly it can be attributed to the smoothening of the actual data recorded by the altimeter during the process of gridding and averaging of pass data the land influence will have a significant effect on the grid averaging can be one of the possible reasons the errors arising from different sampling methods is approximately 8 of the mean hs monaldo 1988 further the earlier studies in other parts of the globe also reported over estimation of altimeter data over buoy data abdalla 2006 greenslade 2001 the hwang et al 1998 and durrant et al 2009 bring out the short comings of altimeter data averaged over time or space through the temporal and spatial de correlation analyses hence merged altimeter hs from different satellite missions cannot be taken as a measure of true sea state for validation of wave models for the cyclone period it is concluded from this study that performance using altimeter data shows good correlation with moderate bias the altimeter measurements demonstrates a good source of data to study the wave variability in the nearshore waters in future development in filtering control can lead to removal of high errors caused due to land contamination and other complicated processes further improvements can be implemented by applying nesting facilities of the swan with unstructured grids with varying spatial resolution to get very high accuracy in the prediction in addition validation and calibration of wind fields is recommended as well as applying wind fields with a finer spatial and temporal resolution to further improve the quality of the nearshore model 6 conclusions based on the work presented above the following summary and conclusions are presented we summarize here the main findings of our research for the selected locations off northwest and northeast coast of india this study uses analyzed winds blended products and satellite measurements for inter comparison of hindcast results so as to explore and exploit the suitability and capabilities of these state of the art third generation wave models to their full potential the study encompassed in this paper is the first in respect to north indian ocean purposely to find acceptance and project its usefulness on sea state information such that hindcast results will be acceptable with better confidence in this inter comparison exercise we have focused more on a multi scale modelling approach to inter compare wave hindcasts along selected locations over the northwest and northeast coasts of india three different third generation wave models were implemented and wave hindcasts numerical simulations were carried out successfully for the global domain regional domain north indian ocean and local model domains northwest and northeast coastal sites of india for january 2000 and july 2000 using era 40 winds july 2008 and january 2009 using quikscat ncep blended winds and june 2011 using oscat winds the global implementation of wam and wwiii 77 s to 77 n and 0 to 360 e over 1 1 resolution could successfully provide boundary inputs to the intermediate regional model domain of swan d1 0 n to 30 n 55 e to 95 e north indian ocean over 0 25 0 25 grid resolution the wave hindcasts of swan in deep water mode also could successfully provide boundary input to the northwest d2 17 n to 24 n and 67 e to 74 e and northeast d3 14 n to 21 n and 80 e to 87 e coastal domains of india over a grid resolution of 0 1 0 1 without any boundary or numerical problems the inter comparison of swan hindcast parameters such as hs tm and hsw off northwest coastal domain of india using wam and wwiii bc for january 2000 and 2009 showed percentage error varying from 2 4 to 17 5 similarly off northeast coastal domain revealed percentage error from 2 4 to 12 7 for hs tm and hsw suggesting better agreements compared to northwest coastal domain during june and july 2000 2008 and 2011 inter comparison of swan hindcasts such as hs tm and hsw off northwest and northeast coastal domains revealed percentage error ranging from 3 6 to 19 2 and 3 0 9 3 respectively one of the important indications is that the variation in swan wave heights in comparison to the deep water models wam and wwiii clearly reveal that it is due to the wave transformation in the shallow waters as expected from a shallow nearshore model with higher grid resolution basedon both qualitative as well as quantitative assessment of the model results through inter comparisons the case studies clearly indicate that all the three models wam wwiii and swan performed well in their respective model domains using era 40 quikscat ncep blended and oscat winds the validation of swan hindcasts using moored and dwr buoy measurements proved promising enough at the coastal locations off northwest coast and off gopalpur during the study period the percentage error in the northwest and northeast coast for hs and tm for all buoys considered varied in the range 4 6 25 2 and 5 2 15 6 respectively although underestimation and overestimation of hs and tm were noted at the buoy locations it is demonstrated that swan hindcasts using wam bc were able to reproduce the wave characteristics at the buoy location with lesser pe as compared to swan using wwiii bc the comparison between the hs data from the multimission product of aviso and the swan hindcast at selected locations at depth less than 10 m 20 m and 40 m off the northwest and northeast coast of india shows that the altimeter data showed fairly good correlation of the order 0 83 to 0 94 the pe was less than 24 in all locations considered the higher hs of merged altimeter observations in comparison with swan hs observed during the year 2011 along the northwest and northeast coasts of india may be due to the smoothening of the actual data recorded by the altimeter during the process of gridding and averaging and the effect of land influence on the grid averaging overall the inter comparisons and validation results of this experimental simulations hindcasts suggests that swan hindcasts for both the northwest coast as well as northeast coastal model domains can be considered better than the deep water model outputs it is also seen that the hindcast results of swan using wam bc are found to be generally higher by 5 15 by considering the cases numerical simulations only presented in this paper whereas it may be noted that wwiii is the latest model which uses most recent physics of wave generation wave current interaction and air sea temperature difference as an additional input and its numerical approaches are superior to wam although computationally expensive therefore it would be wise to have long term measurements both in deep and coastal waters of north indian ocean to validate using sea truth data and inter compare wam and wwiii further coupled with swan in the nearshore

23476,in this study we present the inter comparison of regional swan hindcasts using boundary conditions bc from the third generation wave models wam and wwiii implemented globally here swan inter comparison studies with outputs of both global models as well as swan results using bc from both wam and wwiii were carried out for selected months of the year 2000 2008 2009 and for the full year 2011 using era 40 quikscat ncep blended and oscat winds the results of this experimental simulations hindcasts suggests that swan hindcasts for both the northwest coast as well as northeast coastal model domains in the present model setups were found to be different and can be considered better than the deep water model outputs such as wam and wwiii implemented globally the comparison between swan hindcasts using wam bc and swan hindcasts using wwiii bc revealed high correlations however the percentage error in the hindcast results of swan using wam bc were found to be generally higher by 5 15 by considering most of the case studies presented in this investigation further the validation results using in situ and altimeter measurements suggest that swan using wam bc can be an effective means of obtaining more accurate nearshore wave predictions keywords swan wam wwiii wave hindcasts sea state prediction wave model inter comparisons 1 introduction wind driven waves on the surface of the ocean or wind waves have been a focus of study for many decades prediction of wind waves is relevant to the undertaking of air sea interaction process of the coupled ocean atmosphere system and many ocean based activities the knowledge on sea state in the nearshore region is extremely important for navigation nearshore and coastal applications forecasting surface waves in the ocean is a problem of great practical interest as the sea state conditions influence almost all aspects of naval operations at sea as well as a variety of commercial and maritime activities accurate ocean wave forecasting is a key prerequisite for enabling optimum tracking of ship routes and ensuring the safety of lives and property at sea onboard various fixed and floating platforms thus ocean wave forecasting has been a priority for all research and maritime organizations those who have pioneered the application of operational ocean wave models dating all the way back to the 1960s numerical models of different types for coastal wave processes have been developed waves in the deep ocean can be well predicted by third generation wave models based on the energy or action balance equation such as the wave model wam wamdi group 1988 komen et al 1994 wavewatch model of tolman 1997 1999 2009 the model of li and mao 1992 the program for hindcasting of waves in deep intermediate and shallow water phidias model of van vledder et al 1994 and the telemac based operational model addressing wave action computation tomawac model of benoit et al 1996 most of these models cannot be realistically applied to coastal regions with horizontal scales less than 20 30 km and water depth less than 20 30 m with estuaries tidal inlets barrier islands tidal flats or channels because shallow water effects of depth induced wave breaking and triad wave wave interaction are not included in these models booij et al 1999 also the explicit numerical schemes for propagation used in these models require an impracticably short time step for high spatial resolution for coastal applications booij et al 1999 developed a similar model called swan acronym for simulating waves nearshore to adapt the shallow water formulations from deep to shallow waters based on the wave action balance equation with sources and sinks the shallow water wave model swan is an extension of the deep water third generation wave models early in 1979 a group of wave researchers proposed a wave model inter comparison study to clarify the interrelations existing among the various wave models which have been developed in past for real time wave forecasting compilations of wave statistics or wave hindcast studies the wave modelling community results were documented by the sea wave modelling project swamp group swamp group 1985 the main purpose of this inter comparison study was to test the current understanding of the physics of wind generated surface waves from the viewpoint of wave modelling the study clarified the basic interdependence between understanding the physics of surface waves representing the physics numerically and predicting quantitatively the detailed space time evolution of a two dimensional wave spectrum for a given time varying wind field all wave models that were taken for inter comparison could claim specific strong points but all displayed weaknesses in some of the areas some problems were common to all models these were particularly useful in pointing out the directions which would be required for future experimental theoretical or numerical aspects and it could provide insight to the individual modelling groups basically into the various internal intricacies of their own models the inter comparison study revealed peculiar response characteristics of the individual models which had remained undetected under normal operating conditions the immediate motivation of the inter comparison study was the marked expansion in the operational application of wave models in recent years since then many wave model inter comparison studies have been reported across the globe by various researchers to date tolman et al 2002 padilla hernandez et al 2007 ortiz royero and mercado irizarry 2008 hanson et al 2009 korres et al 2011 performance evaluation studies of the third generation wave model swan were carried out both in operational forecast as well as hindcast modes by various authors and the results have been documented swan is a state of the art shallow water model booij et al 1999 and ris et al 1999 developed for accurate wave simulation in high resolution coastal regions an unstructured grid option zijlema 2010 allows high coastal resolution to be embedded within a large domain for efficient computations without the need for model nesting swan has been used successfully in hindcast applications ris et al 1999 and in real time wave prediction systems for coastal areas dykes et al 2009 evaluations of three third generation ocean wave models by padilla hernandez et al 2007 revealed that swan nested in wavewatch iii hereafter wwiii performed better than swan nested in wam the swan model is being updated continuously with newer modifications for accuracy as well as improvements in model physics zijlema et al 2012 fumin et al 2013 the skill of these models has been demonstrated in numerous validation exercises validation of swan model was done by several researchers such as rogers et al 2000 allard et al 2004 hsu et al 2005 saremi 2010 inghilesi et al 2012 prasad et al 2013 nayak et al 2013 sandhya et al 2014 umesh 2015 amrutha et al 2016 umesh et al 2017 and parvathy et al 2017 ortiz royero and mercado irizarry 2008 carried out the simulation of wind wave activity in the north atlantic basin from june to august of 2002 using the swan model the results of the simulations were compared with data obtained from ndbc national data buoy centre and the results from noaa s wwiii model this study tested the applicability of swan model at oceanic scales and hence concluded that swan model is a good option for simulations all the way from deep water up to the nearshore montoya et al 2013 carried out a comparison between wwiii and swan using data from hurricane katrina in the gulf of mexico the simulated data were compared with in situ noaa buoy data wherein for most of the buoys wwiii presented the best statistical comparisons for the main wave parameters such as significant wave height hereafter hs and peak period the swan model tends to overestimate the maximum values for hs for some buoy locations and the peak period for almost all locations in a study by dietrich et al 2011 one can find a comprehensive validation of coupled model swan adcirc performance for energetic events like hurricanes katrina and rita 2005 studied for the atlantic ocean the comprehensive validation study with wave and water level measurements showed that coupled swan adcirc simulated accurately the evolution of waves and surges the swan model has been used in the east china sea with typhoon forcing by feng et al 2012 brown 2010 implemented a 1 way coupled model using wam and swan to assess the effects of tide surge wave interaction in the irish sea zhang et al 2003 reported the use of swan to simulate waves induced by a tropical storm swan was used to simulate the hs at the upper gulf of thailand and the change of hs at bangkhuntien shoreline ekphisutsuntorn et al 2010 the findings of the study were useful for the coastal erosive calculation shoreline protection and coastal zone management activities in the indian context the predictability of ocean waves over the indian ocean has been improved by assimilating simulated wave spectra into coastal wave model swan by raj kumar et al 2009 similar studies to improve the wave forecast were done by bhowmick et al 2009 nested set up of wam and swan for nearshore wave hindcasting has been reported by breivik et al 2009 and nayak et al 2013 nesting of wwiii and swan has been reported by anselmi molina et al 2012 bhowmick et al 2011 compared swan simulated hs using janssen option janssen et al 1994 with the jason 1 altimeter data which gave a correlation of 0 81 for the indian ocean region panigrahi et al 2012 has reported that a one way coupling approach using pom and swan is quite promising in predicting the extreme wave height due to the complex cyclonic wind fields murty et al 2014 has reported application of a parallel coupled adcirc swan model to simulate extreme waves alongshore wave induced setup and storm surge associated with a very severe cyclonic storm vscs phailin that occurred in the bay of bengal during october 2013 prasad et al 2013 reported on the performance and validation of coupled adcirc swan model for the thane cyclone in the bay of bengal during december 2011 in a recent study and extension of the previous work prasad et al 2014 performed a comprehensive analysis on the coastal inundation potential for the tamil nadu coast sandhya et al 2014 integrated the two modelling systems namely wwiii and swan to provide a very high resolution forecast for puducherry region amrutha et al 2016 have examined the sensitivity of the numerical model swan nested in wwiii for a location in the eastern arabian sea in recent times a multi scale modelling approach using nested wam swan for puducherry coastal location has been reported by umesh et al 2017 to assess the sensitivity of surface wind forcing on wave modeland to validate the coastal wave spectra with buoy measurements all the above mentioned studies using swan revealed a high level of confidence for using this model for operational prediction and short term long term wave hindcasting purposes for the coastal north indian ocean although a number of studies have explored the capability of the models in one way or another none has so far performed a rigorous comprehensive and quantitative inter comparison assessment for the indian ocean it is clearly evident from the literature that studies pertaining to inter comparison of model by computing wave parameters for the north indian ocean region is however missing here in this study the third generation wave models such as wam wwiii and swan have been chosen for numerical simulations umesh et al 2013 umesh 2015 the novelty of this work is the inter comparison of swan outputs using boundary conditions hereafter bc of wam and wwiii in the selected coastal regions model domains of the north indian ocean such as the northwest and northeast coastal regions 7 7 longitude latitude model grids of india from a wave climate point of view january and june july being the peak of northeast and southwest monsoon periods over the north indian ocean wave hindcast case studies for the study region have been chosen for these selected months moreover the wave hindcast parameters obtained from the individual simulations total five are analyzed to inter compare and understand the quality and variability associated with the wave model outputs in the coastal domains regions considered in this investigation the study suggests the suitability and capabilities of the models for their future utilization and exploitation in predicting the sea state information required for various practical applications in an operational scenario to verify the reliability of model computed parameters systematic validation studies with long term observational data is an essential pre requisite to improve the prediction capability and enhancement of wave model performances the inter comparison study gives reasonably good results with low rms error and high correlation coefficients the present study is the first to inter compare swan hindcasts using bc from each of the models such as wam c4 5 3 and wwiii v3 14 for selected locations in the north indian ocean region by conducting a few carefully chosen case studies for selected months to evaluate its usefulness on sea state information 2 the wave models a brief theoretical background of swan wam and wwiii are given under the following sub headings 2 1 wam cycle 4 5 3 the wam model solves the spectral energy balance equation for describing the two dimensional wave evolution as shown in the equation 1 f t c g f s i n s n l s d s where f f θ x t is the spectral wave energy density depending on wave frequency f wave direction θ position x time t and group velocity cg cg f θ equation 1 describes the loss gain and shifting of energy and the equation is valid for deep waters with no refraction and no significant current the so called source functions on the right hand side in equation 1 describe the wind input sin nonlinear transfer snl and dissipation due to white capping sds wam cycle 4 5 is an update of the wam cycle 4 wave model which is described in komen et al 1994 and gunther et al 1992 the basic physics and numerics have been kept in the new release the source function integration scheme made by hersbach and janssen 1999 and the updates bidlot et al 2005 are incorporated a number of additional options are added in the new model release wam cycle 4 5 3 gunther and behrens 2011 the new method is semi implicit and based on the developments at ecmwf janssen personal communication it is 2 f n 1 f n δ t s 1 δ t g where s s u n 1 f n is the source function of spectrum computed at time n and wind speed u at time level n 1 the term g is the functional derivative of the source function given by g g u n 1 f n the wave model dissipation source function has been reformulated in terms of a mean steepness parameter and the mean frequency that gives more emphasis on the high frequency part of the spectrum and results in a more realistic interaction between windsea and swell waves this has allowed the relaxation of the prognostic frequency range over which the model equations are integrated a few other small adjustments were also incorporated for wam cycle 4 5 3 to take advantage of the increased dynamic range of the model bidlot et al 2005 2 2 wavewatch iii v3 14 the wavewatch iii wwiii wave model version 3 14 is a wam type wave model developed at noaa ncep tolman 1997 1999 2009 wwiii is a discrete spectral and phase averaged model battjes 1994 which is successfully applied in global and regional scale studies in many areas including the north atlantic and is proven to be an effective tool to study wave spectral evolution air sea interactions and nonlinear wave wave interactions for regional and global applications the directional wave spectrum is resolved at each model grid point in terms of wave number direction bands and the evolution of the wave field is found by numerically solving the spectral wave action balance equation which is usually written as 3 n t 1 cos φ φ φ n cos θ λ λ n k k n θ θ g n s σ where λ is longitude φ is latitude θ is wave propagation direction k is wave number t is time and σ is the intrinsic angular frequency wwiii evaluates the balance equation for the wave action spectrum n k θ x t expressed in spherical coordinates komen et al 1994 the derivatives in equation 3 are the propagation velocities in physical and spectral domains where 4 φ c g cos θ u φ r λ c g sin θ u λ r cos φ θ g θ c g tan φ cos θ r where r is the radius of the earth uφ and uλ are current components in φ and λ directions the left side of equation 4 represents the local rate of change of wave action density propagation in physical space action density shifting in frequency and direction due to the spatial and temporal variations in depth and current in deep waters the net source term s is generally considered to consist of three parts a wind wave interaction term sin a nonlinear wave wave interactions term snl and a dissipation whitecapping term sds the input term sin is dominated by the exponential growth term and the source term generally describes this dominant process only for model initialization and to provide more realistic initial wave growth a linear input term sln is also considered in wwiii in nearshore waters additional processes are mostly notably wave bottom interactions sbot shemdin et al 1978 while depth induced breaking sdb and triad wave wave interactions str may also be considered important wwiii also caters for the source terms for scattering of waves by bottom features ssc and a general purpose slot for additional user defined source terms sxx this defines the general source terms used in wwiii as 5 s sln sin snl sds sbot sdb str ssc sxx two combinations of the source terms sin and sds input and dissipation due to whitecapping are available in wwiii the default set up of wwiii corresponds to the wave boundary layer formulation for sin and sds by tolman and chalikov 1996 tolman chalikov physics the alternate combination corresponds to wam cycle 3 physics wamc3 physics in which sin and sds are based on wamdi group 1988 snyder et al 1981 and komen et al 1994 in both cases the source terms are integrated in time using a dynamically adjusted time stepping algorithm which concentrates computational efforts on conditions with rapid spectral changes tolman 1999 2 3 swan model swan is the third generation near shore wave action model designed to overcome traditional difficulties of using global wave models such as wam and wwiii in coastal regions it uses typical formulations for wave growth by wind wave dissipation by white capping and four wave nonlinear interactions quadruplets or quads it also includes physical processes associated with intermediate depth and shallow water e g bottom friction depth limited breaking the governing equation of swan and other third generation wave action models is the action balance equation in cartesian coordinates it is hasselmann et al 1973 given by 6 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s σ where n σ θ x y t is the action density as a function of intrinsic frequency σ direction θ horizontal coordinates x and y and time t the first term on the left hand side of equation 6 represents the local rate of change of action density in time the second and third terms represent propagation in geographical x y space respectively with velocities cx and cy the fourth term represents shifting of the relative frequency due to variations in depth and currents with velocity cσ in σ space the fifth term represents depth and current induced refraction with velocity cθ in θ space here s is the total of source sink terms expressed as wave energy density in deep waters the right hand side of equation 6 is dominated by three terms s sin snl sds input by wind four wave nonlinear interactions and dissipation respectively whereas in shallow waters six processes contribute to stot 7 stot sin snl3 snl4 sds w sds b sds br where sin wave growth by the wind snl3 snl4 nonlinear transfer of wave energy through three wave and four wave interactions sds w sds b sds br energy dissipation due to white capping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking as explained before wam is a predecessor of both swan and wwiiii tolman 1991 2002 and as in the case of swan wwiii is also governed by the action balance equation the deep water models wam and wwiii tend to be more efficient in global scales due to numerical schemes whereas swan holds the advantage at smaller scales all the three models wam wwiii and swan can be solved in either cartesian or spherical coordinates and all are finite difference models because of their similarities all the three complement each other from various considerations the prediction of wave conditions in shallow water has received increased emphasis in both the scientific and engineering communities in recent years the scientific interest in the problem of shallow water wave prediction has increased because of generally increased knowledge about wave generation improved meteorological and oceanographic databases and the availability of bigger and better computer facilities to handle the mathematical and numerical aspects of the problem increased marine activities particularly in areas of offshore exploration and coastal development have created a need for improved knowledge of sea state conditions in the nearshore regions hence research and development on shallow water wave modelling and prediction is significantly important the performance of deep water wave models in the north indian ocean region has been well studied by various investigators in comparison to shallow nearshore wave models the performance of a shallow nearshore wave model like swan taking boundary input from two different deep water wave models such as wam and wwiii developed in the spirit of the wam model needs to be addressed in shallow and nearshore regions where the deep water models are likely to overlook or grossly address the processes relating to shallow waters the computing power becomes a limitation for deep water models if we increase grid resolution towards shore regions for a model which generally deal with a large scale domain a shallow nearshore model becomes handy and less computation intensive if we address a smaller domain and higher resolution by taking the boundary inputs from a coarse grid model 3 data used 3 1 wind forcings wave models are extremely sensitive to details of the wind input and using high quality winds and knowledge of the wave physics can reproduce the real sea state and wave climate high quality analyzed wind fields provided by ecmwf era 40 oscat winds and blended winds such as quikscat ncep winds were used in the present study it may be noted that ecmwf janssen et al 1997 cavaleri and bertotti 2006 caires and sterl 2005 moeini et al 2010 and qscat ncep milliff et al 2004 wu and chiang 2007 were the most commonly used wind fields in wave modelling studies ecmwf 40 year reanalysis era 40 is a reanalysis of meteorological observations from september 1957 to august 2002 45 years released by ecmwf uppala et al 2005 sterl and caires 2005 caires et al 2005 one of the products of era 40 consists of 6 hourly global fields of wind speed at 10 m height u10 with a 1 5 1 5 grid resolution besides atmospheric variables it also includes wave parameters era 40 was produced using the ecmwf integrated forecasting system a two way coupled atmosphere wave model system and a three dimensional variational data assimilation scheme 3dvar in this study the wind speed and the stresses τx and τy for the months january and july 2000 were extracted fromera 40 and the same were used to estimate wind direction and the winds were further interpolated to 1 1 grid resolution swain et al 2017 the processed six hourly winds for january and july 2000 were then used to force the wave models wam wwiii for the globe and swan for the coastal locations quikscat ncep blended ocean winds from colorado research associates version5 0 covers from july 1999 to july 2009 6 hourly with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 latitude longitude quikscat ncep blended wind products were derived through a spatial blending of the high resolution scatterometer quikscat wind observations with the ncep ncar reanalysis winds chin et al 1998 and milliff et al 1999 the blending scheme retains the quikscat wind measurements in its swath regions and enhances the ncep ncar fields kalnay et al 1996 in quikscat sampling gaps through imposition of high wave number content that is based on monthly local quikscat statistics it is important to note that the quality of ncep winds is considerably enhanced by blending quickscat measurements quikscat ncep blended winds six hourly for july 2008 and january 2009 have been averaged to 1 1 model grid resolution for the purpose of wave hindcasting apart from these the study also used oceansat ii winds available for the global oceans the availability of scatterometer winds has provided the best opportunity and challenge in evaluating the performance of swan using the satellite measured winds both speed and direction exclusively as input the resolution of global wind vector data provided by the national remote sensing centre nrsc is 50 km and 25 km with a repetitive period of 2 days sudha and prasada rao 2013 the oscat mission goals were to provide wind data between 4 and 24 m s 1 with an accuracy of 2 m s 1 and directional accuracy of 20 rani and gupta 2013 hence the models were executed using the 6 hourly spatio temporal interpolated oscat winds for the year 2011 3 2 wave buoy data in the indian ocean region several deep sea and shallow water moored buoys buoy type discus have been deployed by the national institute of ocean technology chennai since 1997 premkumar et al 2000 under the national data buoy program ndbp to measure several near surface meteorological and oceanic variables jossia et al 2010a 2010b the buoys are equipped with global positioning system beacon light and satellite transceiver these buoys are operable from 20 m water depths to full ocean depth excepting a few buoys which function in slightly lower depths the sensor used in the measurement of wave parameters is an inertial altitude heading reference system with dynamic linear motion measurement capability the waves are measured in the buoy by a motion reference unit which measures absolute roll pitch yaw and relative heave these data are recorded at a rate of 1 hz for 17min every 3 h hence it measures the full spectrum of the waves for 17 min the hs is estimated as four times the square root of the area under the non directional wave spectrum it has an accuracy 10 cm for wave height up to 20 m and 5 for wave direction in this study wave data measured at locations such as sw1 off pipavav port and sw2 off bombay during january and july 2000 are utilized for the validation of wave model swan hindcasts the locations of these buoys are shown in fig 1 a the details on deployment locations water depth and duration of data are listed in table 1 apart from the above two buoys the study also uses the datawell waverider dwr buoy situated off gopalpur to validate the hindcast wave parameters along the northeast coast of india 3 3 satellite altimeter data radar altimeters onboard satellites are an excellent tool to study global hs of reasonably high quality because hs can be inferred directly from the shape of the returned radar pulse barrick 1968 thus altimeter derived hs data are commonly used for model validation and data assimilation procedures vethamony et al 2006 many studies have been carried out validating hs from altimeters against in situ observations from buoys and ships ebuchi and kawamura 1994 hwang et al 1998 durrant et al 2009 the results of these studies suggest that the measurement of hs from radar altimeters is fairly accurate the accuracy being at par with the observations from buoys 3 3 1 aviso near real time data radar altimeters are active microwave sensors which operate during all weather conditions the hs is inferred from the shape of the pulse returning to nadir looking altimeter assuming gaussian surface elevations aviso archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data cnes france provides global merged daily averaged hs data based on observations from different satellite missions jason 1 and 2 envisat gfo and ers 2 data from a number of altimeter missions are merged to provide consistent and homogeneous products sea level currents wind modulus hs for varied applications both for near real time applications and offline studies by aviso the aviso live access server las provides nrt merged gridded wind wave products ftp ftp aviso oceanobs com pub oceano aviso wind wave nrt mswh which are used for the present study a merged data set is generated using measurements from individual altimeter missions with the additional criterion that at least two missions should be available for a particular grid point this criterion for preparing the gridded product will keep the wave heights in the same range as the daily averages the gridding and averaging involves all the available altimeter missions over a particular day which ensures sufficient spatial coverage the data is cross calibrated using ocean surface topography mission ostm jason 2 as reference mission in two steps first backscatter coefficient sigma0 computed from the power of the return pulse of the altimeter and wave s histograms are calibrated then the ostm jason 2 wind algorithm applied to cross calibrated sigma0 finally the multimission arrays are averaged to 1 1 boxes in this study validation was done january to december 2011 against the aviso gridded daily averaged data the details of validation location using altimeter aviso measurements is indicated in table 2 even though the merging of several satellite observations and its averaging degrade the quality of altimeter observations the comparison will give insight as to what extent these products are reliable for real applications such as climatological studies and forecast validations 4 methodology wam cycle 4 5 3 has been implemented for wave hindcast in deep waters and during the execution of wam outputs included bc generated for swan applications in the nearshore regions d1 as shown in fig 1 similarly wwiii version 3 14 is also implemented to inter compare swan results using bc from both these global models the wave model descriptions and setup is described in table 3 the global domains of wam and wwiii cover the geographical extents 0 to 360 e and 77 s to 77 n with resolutions of 1 1 the wam model uses 25 frequencies ranging from 0 04177 hz to 0 41145 hz and 24 directions constant increment to represent the wave spectral distribution similarly wwiii model uses 25 frequencies ranging from 0 0412 hz to 0 4056 hz with a logarithmic distribution with increment factor 1 1 and 24 directions constant increment in the present study analyzed winds such as era 40 and quikscat ncep blended wind products and oscat winds have been used for driving the wave models the surface current data required as input for wave models were obtained from the ocean surface current analyses real time oscar database bonjean and lagerloef 2002 the water level was generated using the tpxo7 1 global inverse tide model egbert and erofeeva 2002 the era interim daily fields from ecmwf were used for extracting the air sea temperature difference data used as input by wwiii model the global model bathymetries have been constructed from etopo2 data swan v40 85 the swan team 2011 has been implemented for wave hindcasting using the above mentioned era 40 quikscat ncep blended wind products and oscat winds for selected coastal domains off northwest d2 as shown in fig 1 67 e to 74 e and 17 n to 24 n and northeast d3 as shown in fig 1 80 e to 87 e and 14 n to 21 n coasts of india each covering an area of 7 7 longitude latitude grid domains d2 and d3 also the regional intermediate grid system implemented for swan covers the geographical extend 55 e to 95 e and 0 n to 30 n as shown in fig 1 domain d1 with a resolution 0 25 0 25 north indian ocean region the number of bins in the frequency and directional space are 50 and 36 respectively the frequency band used for swan ranges between 0 05 hz and 0 5 hz the swan model bathymetry has been constructed from c map data the formulations of the available physical processes and their coefficients included in the swan model is as shown in table 4 during the global execution of wam and wwiii bc have been generated and subsequently used to execute swan over 0 25 0 25 grid resolution for the north indian ocean region domain d1 as shown fig 1 further swan booij et al 1999 is executed for the two selected coastal model domains sites as indicated above each with resolutions of 0 1 0 1 here it may also be noted that the domain boundaries either for model execution or analysis of wind and wave variability have been chosen based on the prevailing wind and wave conditions for the past several years swain et al 2004 without taking into account the actual geographical boundaries of the regions under study the time step for model computations for the intermediate grid was set to 20 min for north indian ocean domain and 10 min the swan team 2011 for northwest as well as northeast coastal domains the wave models were uniformly driven with six hourly winds oscar surface currents and water level tide the swan model outputs for various wave parameters were stored every 6 hourly altimeter observations in comparison with swan simulated hs at the selected locations were obtained by interpolating the gridded altimeter hs data using the natural neighbor interpolation method which is particularly effective for dealing with a variety of spatial data exhibiting clustered or highly linear distributions sibson 1981 the weights used in natural neighbor interpolation are based on amount of influence any grid point will have on the computed value at the interpolation point this amount of influence is entirely dependent on the area of influence of the surrounding scatter points to the interpolation point nearest four grid points are considered since aviso provides gridded altimeter hs as a daily average hs six hourly swan outputs were averaged over the day this daily averaged swan outputs and the interpolated altimeter observations to the selected location comprises the collocation in this study swan hindcasts have been carried out using bc from wam and wwiii for five different cases such as january and july 2000 july 2008 january 2009 and june 2011 using era 40 quikscat ncep blended and oscat winds all these case studies were primarily chosen as these typical months are to be studied from wind and wave climate point of view young 1991 sterl and caires 2005 and for the purpose of hindcast wave analysis in different wind conditions considering the importance of monsoon winds over the study region the months of january and june july were chosen with the consideration that january and june july are the peaks of northeast and southwest monsoon periods respectively over north indian ocean the significant wave parameters considered for this inter comparison study are hs mean wave period tm02 denoted as tm hereafter and swell wave height hereafter hsw 4 1 statistical error estimates to evaluate the relative model performance based on the inter comparison studies statistical error analysis was carried out for the corresponding months of wave hindcasts the statistical measures such as coefficient of correlation r scatter index si bias b or mean deviation root mean square error rmse percentage error pe and model performance index mpi between the model outputs have been computed the main assumption for the computation of statistical parameters is that the measured data are error free although this assumption is not realistic it is necessary for computation when a set of n model predicted m and observed obs scalar values are given the bias b is a statistical quantity that signifies the average difference between in situ measurement and model output padilla hernandez et al 2007 it is also known as mean error and can be given by 8 b i a s 1 n o b s m the bias value reveals the general trends in the model performance remya et al 2012 and allows to conclude whether the model consistently over or under predicts the measurements it can nevertheless be misleading in cases where both over and under estimations occur rmse is a generalized form of standard deviation however the overall residual variation can be deducted from the information about the spread of data and their inter relationships hence the rmse is an absolute measure of the fit between the model data and buoy measurement it is inferred that the lower the value of rmse better the fit of data between model and observations root mean square error is defined as 9 r m s e 1 n m o b s 2 for an ideal forecast the root mean square error is zero korres et al 2011 by definition the scatter index si is the standard deviation of the difference normalized by the mean of the observations romeiser 1993 the si is expressed in percentage as a measure and indicates how close the results of computation model and experiments are the si does not reveal general trends but evaluates the average model performance as follows 10 s i r m s e o b s where o b s is the mean of observations the correlation coefficient is yet another frequently used parameter to quantify the relation between m and obs here the correlation coefficient r is used to measure the strength and direction of relationship between two variables observed predicted the resulting sign represents the directionality of the estimate the correlation coefficient has numerical value if a consistent linear relation exists between m and obs and 0 if m and obs are independent if the correlation coefficient is close to one this suggests that there is good positive correlation between model and observed data low random error but it does not mean that there is no systematic error correlation coefficient r is defined as 11 r m m o b s o b s m m 2 o b s o b s 2 here m is the mean value of the model derived wave parameter to better diagnose the model performance from a modelling point of view the percentage error pe brown 2010 and model performance index mpi are also calculated ris et al 1999 percentage error pe is defined as the difference between measured and hindcast parameters as a percentage of the observed value 12 p e 100 i 1 n m i o b s i o b s i however it is essential to note here that the estimates such as rmse and pe etc between the two hindcasts using bc from wam and wwiii are relative measures assuming that one of the models is the benchmark reference say wam in this case therefore the interpretation of rmse pe and b bias etc are to be treated accordingly the mpi is a test of how well the model performs relative to a perfect model run minus the ratio of rms error of the model to rms value of the modeled changes in wave parameters from the up wave boundary rms changes is the difference between the measured value replaced with value observed at the incoming incident wave boundary the diagnostic model performance index indicates the degree to which the model reproduces the observed changes of the waves like the scatter index it is defined in terms of root mean square values 13 m p i 1 r m s e r r o r r m s c h a n g e s for a perfect model rms error 0 the value of the mpi would obviously be 1 whereas it would be 0 for a model that erroneously predicts no changes rms error rms changes 5 results and discussion 5 1 inter comparison of swan hindcast fields with wam and wwiii in this study attempts were first made to compare the spatial distributions of wave hindcasts simulated by i wam and swan using wam bc and ii wwiii and swan using wwiii bc fig 2 shows inter comparison of wam and swan using wam bc hindcast fields such as the spatial distributions of hs mean wave direction tm and hsw for 20 july 2000 1200 h in the northwest coastal domain using only era 40wind fields for all the model runs the contour plot of hs fig 2 a based on wam hindcasts reveal more or less a similar distribution variation ranging from 0 6 to 2 0 m as compared with swan simulated hs using wam bc as shown in fig 2 d it may also be noted that the waves are propagating from offshore to nearshore waters and significant variation between the two models may only be expected in areas below 15 m of water depth the spatial distributions of hs with mean wave direction fig 2 a d tm fig 2 b e and hsw fig 2 c and f of wam and swan also appear to be more or less similar while swan predicted parameters are expected to be more accurate because of higher spatial and directional resolutions besides the theoretical as well as numerical soundness of a shallow water model compared with the deep water global models similarly the contour plots of hs tm and hsw for the northeast coast of india d3 are also shown for their inter comparisons in fig 3 for 20 july 2000 1200 h the spatial distribution for hs fig 3 d predicted by swan using wam bc varied between 1 4 and 2 1 m and shows differences with that of wam simulated wave field as shown in fig 3 a here unlike northwest coastal domain of india the locally generated waves propagating offshore were found to be driven by westerly winds whereas swells were also propagating from open sea around southerly driven by distant southwest monsoon winds as seen from fig 3 b and e the hindcast tm both by wam and swan ranged between 6 3 and 7 7s and it is seen that there are some differences in their spatial distributions similar is the case for hsw as shown in fig 3 c and f therefore figs 2 and 3 suggest that in case of onshore winds as in the northwest coastal domain both wam and swan could simulate the sea state comparably however in the case of waves propagating offshore and primarily influenced also by the offshore winds the hindcast results of wam and swan based on the spatial distributions as shown in fig 3 show significant differences fig 4 shows the spatial inter comparisons of wwiii and swan using wwiii bc hindcasts for hs with mean wave direction tm and hsw for the northwest coastal domain for 20 july 2000 1200 h using era 40 winds the contour plot of hs varying from 0 7 to 1 7 m as shown in fig 4 a simulated by wwiii reveals a significant difference in its distribution as compared with swan wave field using wwiii bc as shown in fig 4 d this reveals that from the multiscale model set up swan hindcast should be better than wwiii deep water model although it is implemented over a resolution of 0 1 0 1 similarly the spatial distribution of tm 4 3 5 5s as shown in fig 4 b predicted by wwiii also appear qualitatively different if compared with swan using wwiii bc as shown in fig 4 e fig 4 c and f show wwiii and swan simulated hsw ranging from 0 7 to 1 3 m which also indicatethat swan hindcast show differences as compared with wwiii fig 5 shows the spatial distributions of wwiii and swan using wwiii bc hindcasts such as hs with direction tm and hsw for 20 july 2000 1200 h in the northeast coastal domain of india also using era 40 winds the contour plot of hs ranged between 1 4 and 2 0 m as shown in fig 5 a by wwiii also reveal certain differences in its distribution as compared with the swan simulated hs using wwiii bc as shown in fig 5 d similarly the spatial distribution of tm which ranged between 5 8 and 7 6s as in fig 5 b for wwiii appear also to be different from tm simulated by swan using wwiii bc as shown in fig 5 e the spatial distribution of hsw 1 3 1 8 m by swan using wwiii bc as shown in fig 5 f for the northeast coastal domain appears to be marginally different from wwiii shown in fig 5 c the above qualitative comparison of the results of wam and wwiii with swan using bc of wam and wwiii reveals their similarities and differences with higher expectations on swan to be better in the selected coastal domains than that of wam and wwiii deep water hindcasts however the following sections below presents a detailed analysis on their inter comparisons quantitatively 5 2 inter comparison of swan hindcast fields using wam wwiii boundary conditions besides the above inter comparison of the spatial distributions for a few sample model outputs detailed inter comparisons have been carried out further for swan model outputs using wam and wwiii bc for the selected months such as january 2000 and july 2000 using era 40 winds july 2008 and january 2009 using quikscat ncep blended winds and june 2011 using oscat winds for the selected northwest and northeast coastal domains of india which are discussed using their respective scatter plots of selected output parameters 5 3 northwest and northeast coast hindcasts with wam wwiii boundary input and era 40 winds the scatter plots of swan hindcast parameters using wam and wwiii bc such as hs tm and hsw in the month of january 2000 for the northwest coastal domain are plotted in fig 6 italso shows the statistical estimates of the inter comparison between swan output parameters during january 2000 for all the model grid points common to global and the northwest and northeast coastal domains total 3720 and 3472 table 5 a shows the detailed statistical estimates of the inter comparison between swan output parameters during january 2000 during the month of january 2000 hs varied from 0 5 to 2 2 m over the northwest coastal domain mean hs 1 4 m the hindcast hs tm and hsw for the northwest coast revealed higher correlation with r values 0 96 0 98 and 0 97 respectively the inter comparison of swan outputs using wam and wwiii bc for hs reveal si of 0 04 bias of 0 21 m rmse of 0 06 m and pe of 17 5 assuming swan using wam bc as the standard reference which may be interpreted either way between swan outputs using wam and wwiii bc the lower values of si rmse and pe reveal a better fit between swan hs hindcast using wam and wwiii bc for the northwest coastal domain during january 2000 tm indicates a bias of 0 36s si of 0 03 rmse of 0 22s and pe of 6 1 the inter comparison for hsw shows si of 0 02 bias of 0 15 m rmse of 0 03 m and pe 12 7 the values of mpi are 0 96 for hs 0 97 for tm and 0 98 for hsw which suggests good agreement between swan outputs using wam and wwiii bc the pe values are higher for both hs 17 5 and hsw 12 7 while tm revealed low pe of 6 1 fig 6 reveals that swan outputs such as hs tm and hsw using wam bc are higher compared to swan outputs using wwiii bc by 17 5 6 1 and 12 7 respectively these are significant differences surely not due to swan but due to the difference in the boundary inputs from wam and wwiii as we have seen from the spatial distributions figs 2 5 discussed earlier as in fig 6 fig 7 shows the inter comparison of swan model parameters using wam and wwiii bc for the northeast coastal domain of india during january 2000 using era 40 winds the hindcast wave parameters of swan using wam and wwiii bc such as hs tm and hsw also show high correlation coefficient r of 0 95 0 99 and 0 95 respectively table 5 a however the inter comparison for hs reveals si of 0 02 bias of 0 12 m rmse of 0 03 m and pe of 12 1 the hindcast tm as shown in fig 7 b has varied from 3 6 to 11 7s and shows bias of 0 03s si of 0 01 rmse of 0 06s and pe of 2 4 between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc similarly hsw shows si of 0 02 bias of 0 09 m rmse is 0 02 m and pe of 10 6 the values of mpi are 0 98 for hs 0 99 for tm and 0 98 for hsw which suggests very good agreements between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc for the northeast coastal domain the inter comparison clearly indicate good agreement for tm predicted by swan using wam and wwiii bc however swan predicted hs and hsw using wam bc were higher by 12 1 and 10 6 respectively as compared to swan using wwiii bc fig 8 shows the

comparison between swan output parameters during july 2000 the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw for the northwest coast show high correlations of 0 98 r 0 98 and 0 96 respectively the comparison for hs predicted by swan using both bc for northwest coast of india reveals si of 0 04 bias of 0 19 m rmse of 0 05 m and pe of 15 7 similarly the inter comparison for tm shows bias of 0 29s si of 0 03 rmse of 0 18s and pe of 5 6 which reveal a very good agreement between swan hindcasts using bc of both the global models hsw which varied from 0 2 to 1 9 m during july 2000 show si of 0 02 and bias of 0 06 m the rmse for hsw is 0 01 m and pe is 8 5 the estimated values of mpi are 0 96 for hs 0 97 for tmand 0 98 for hsw which clearly indicate good agreement between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii

and 0 98 respectively table 5 b the hs shows si of 0 01 bias of 0 08 m rmse of 0 01 m and pe of 8 5 the hindcast tm as shown in fig 9 b has varied from 2 6 to 10 0s and shows bias of 0 02s si of 0 01 rmse of 0 07s and pe of 3 0 between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc similarly hsw shows si of 0 01 bias of 0 04 m rmse is 0 02 m and pe of 6 8 the values of mpi are same 0 99 for hs tm and hsw which suggest a very good agreement between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc for the northeast coastal domain however swan predicted hs tm and hsw using wam bc are higher by 8 5 3 0 and 6 8 respectively as compared to swan using wwiii bc 5 4 northwest and northeast coast hindcasts with wam wwiii boundary input and quikscat ncep blended winds here inter comparisons have been carried out

this model domain in this case the hindcast hs tm and hsw reveal very high correlations with r values 0 97 0 99 and 0 97 respectively between the two hindcasts the inter comparison for hs reveals si of 0 07 bias of 0 31 m rmse of 0 13 m and pe of 19 2 similarly the comparison for tm shows a bias of 0 53s si of 0 07 rmse of 0 46s and pe of 7 8 the hsw within the model domain varied from 0 2 to 2 6

both models the inter comparison of tm also reveals significant agreement for swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc hindcast hs and hsw using wam bc are higher by 12 7 and 10 6 respectively as compared to swan using wwiii bc it may be noted that fig 13 shows a very distinct behavior more prominently for hs and hsw and less prominent in case of tm which indicates a decoupled scenario between locally generated waves and waves propagating from south a similar hindcast study by padilla hernandez et al 2007 for two selected storms january 2000 and january 2002 in atlantic ocean using mc2 canadian mesoscale compressible community model winds which are comparable with quickscat ncep merged winds suggested that swan results hs were competitive using bc of wam and wwiii in nested mode 5 5 northwest and northeast coast hindcasts with wam wwiii boundary input and oscat winds in this case inter comparisons have been carried out for swan model outputs using wam and wwiii bc and oscat winds for a selected month of june 2011 for northwest and northeast coastal domains considered fig 14 shows the inter comparison of swan output parameters such as hs tm and hsw for the northwest coastal domain for june 2011 table 7 shows the detailed statistical estimates of the inter comparison between swan output parameters during june 2011 here hs varied from 0 3 to 3 5 m over the model domain with mean hs 1 9 m the hindcast hs tm and hsw reveal higher correlations with r values 0 98 0 94 and 0 98 respectively the inter comparison of swan outputs using wam and wwiii bc for hs reveal si of 0 05 bias of 0 24 m rmse of 0 09 m and pe of 15 0 the lower values of si rmse and pe reveal a better fit between swan hs hindcast using wam and wwiii bc for the northwest coastal domain during june 2011 tm reveals bias of 0 02s si of 0 01 rmse of 0 08s and pe of 3 6 the inter comparison for hsw shows si of 0 01 bias of 0 07 m rmse of 0 02 m and pe of 6 5 the values of mpi are 0 95 for hs and 0 99 both for tm and hsw which suggests significant agreements between swan outputs using wam and wwiii bc pe suggests that swan outputs such as hs tm and hsw using wam bc are higher compared to swan outputs using wwiii bc by 15 0 3 6 and 6 5 respectively fig 15 shows the inter comparison of swan model parameters using wam and wwiii bc for the northeast coastal domain of india during june 2011 using oscat winds the hindcast wave parameters such as hs tm and hsw show significantly higher correlations of 0 99 r 0 96 and 0 99 respectively the inter comparisons for hs reveal si of 0 01 bias of 0 11 m rmse of 0 02 m and pe of 6 7 the hindcast tm as shown in fig 15 b varied from 3 7 to 9 6s and shows bias of 0 23s si of 0 02 rmse of 0 11s and pe of 4 3 between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc similarly hsw shows si of 0 01 bias of 0 07 m rmse of 0 01 m and pe of 4 6 the values of mpi are 0 98 both for hs and tm and 0 99 for hsw which suggests very good agreement between swan hindcasts using wam and wwiii bc in the northeast coastal domain the inter comparisons for the wave parameters clearly indicate very good agreement for tm predicted by swan pe 4 3 however swan predicted hs and hsw using wam bc are higher by 6 7 and 4 6 respectively as compared to swan using wwiii bc the inter comparisons and overall evaluation based on statistical measures using different wind forcings show that swan model performs moderately well during all periods using era 40 oscat and blended winds the deviations in the performance of the model can be due to varied reasons most importantly during the fair weather season the study area would be dominated by long swells and the different representation of swell propagation in model physics in wam and wwiii could be a possible reason hence it can be concluded that apart from wind forcing wave model physics numeric and model grid resolution are major factors which affect the model performances using bc of wam and wwiii these studies indicate that use of higher frequency winds to force the wave model yields positive output impact particularly in the case of hs in short without high quality wind forcing fields wave model results may suffer even given the correct physics furthermore one can speculate that the quality of wind forcing fields becomes even more critical when considering higher order wave spectral moments because these terms are more directly associated with shorter waves and hence tied more strongly to the wind forcing 5 6 validation of swan hindcasts using buoy measurements in the previous discussions sections 5 2 5 5 we attempted to compare the swan hindcasts using bc from the deep water models wam and wwiii it is well known that validation of significant wave parameters at any coastal location is an important aspect in numerical wave prediction and it forms an important step in the operational forecasting centers the major limitation of this study is the lack of potential measured data to validate the swan simulated parameters off the northwest and northeast coasts of india hence this study utilized the available buoy data and data from other sources to validate the significant wave parameters the swan simulated hs and tmwere compared for the months of january and july 2000 at two moored buoy locations sw1 20 88 n 71 49 e and sw2 18 59 n 71 04 e as shown in fig 1 a located in the northwest coast of india along the northeast coast of india the comparisons were carried out for the period july 2008 and january 2009 using a dwr buoy located off gopalpur 19 28 n 84 25 e fig 1 a the statistical estimates for the validation of swan model using wam wwiii bc with buoy measurements sw1 sw2 in the northwest coast of india during january and july 2000 is shown in table 8 fig 16 a and b c d shows the comparison of simulated swan hs and tmusing wam and wwiii bc with sw1 buoy measurements for the months of january and july 2000 respectively during january 2000 fig 16 a the comparison of hs indicated high correlations r 0 95 with low si 0 16 and rmse 0 05 m using wam bc the negative bias indicated a very slight underestimation b 0 02 m of the wave height at the sw1 buoy location at the same time using wwiii bc the correlations were comparatively lower r 0 84 with high si 0 42 and rmse 0 39 m it is noted that the wave heights were overestimated at the sw1 buoy location using b 0 29 m wwiii bc and this can be attributed to the quality of wind inputs and the physics driving the different representation of swell propagations in both the models the pe and mpi using wam bc were 6 7 and 0 97 while with wwiii bc it was 18 4 and 0 83 respectively similarly the comparison of tm fig 16 b revealed very high correlations r 0 9 using wam and wwiii bc at the sw1 location the wam bc could fairly reproduce tm at the buoy location with very low si 0 08 and rmse 0 05s a slight overestimation of tm was noted at the buoy location using wwiii bc with si 0 31 and rmse 0 29s the pe and mpi using wam bc for tm are 5 2 and 0 96 respectively similarly using wwiii bc tm revealed pe and mpi of 15 5 and 0 86 respectively fig 16 c and d shows the comparison of simulated swan outputs at the sw1 buoy location for the period july 2000 it is noted that during july 2000 swan hs is overestimated using wwiii bc with high deviations while only a slight underestimation is observed using wam bc the comparison revealed correlations of the order r 0 8 in both cases the si 0 52 and rmse 0 41 m were high in the case of hindcasts using wwiii bc in comparison to wam bc si 0 02 rmse 0 11 m the pe and mpi using wam bc are 9 3 and 0 96 similarly using wwiii bc hs showed pe and mpi such as 20 6 and 0 87 respectively similarly tm gave a good comparison at the buoy location with slight overestimation using wwiii bc and slight underestimation using wam bc the comparison of tm at the buoy location was promising enough with high correlations r 0 9 swan hindcasts using wam bc revealed very low si 0 03 and rmse 0 13s similarly using wwiii bc the hindcast tm showed low si 0 12 and rmse 0 19s hence the swan model could fairly reproduce tm at the sw1 buoy location with minimum deviations overall the comparisons at the sw1 buoy location for january and july 2000 reveals that swan using wam bc could reproduce hs and tm at the buoy location with lesser deviations as compared to swan nested in wwiii in the northwest coast of the india the swan hindcasts were also validated at a buoy location sw2 off bombay for the months of january and july 2000 fig 17 a and b shows the comparison between the sw2 measurements hs and tm and swan hindcast parameters for january 2000 using era 40 winds with bc from wam and wwiii the model predicted parameters as shown in fig 17 a and b shows higher correlation with the observations using wam bc the correlation coefficients are 0 97 and 0 92 for hs and tm respectively with si values 0 06 and 0 09 which are low the bias is also low and positive such as 0 12 m and 0 18sfor hs and tm respectively indicating a good match with observed values the rmse is low 0 07 m and 0 14s for hs and tm respectively which also show a strong fit between the model and observations the pe is too low 5 8 and 7 9 respectively for hs and tm which shows a good match between the model and observations therefore the estimated mpi is quite high for both hs 0 97 and tm 0 95 which reveals that the swan hindcasts could reproduce the significant wave parameters at the buoy location with higher accuracy similarly the model predicted parameters using wwii bc for january 2000 as shown in fig 17 a and b shows slightly lesser correlation with the observations the correlation coefficients are 0 86 and 0 81 for hs and tm respectively with si values 0 38 and 0 42 which are high the values of bias are 0 21 m and 0 19sfor hs and tm respectively indicating overestimation and underestimation from the observed values the rmse values are of the order 0 48 m and 0 37s for hs and tm respectively which show a weak fit between the model and observations the pe is 17 8 and 15 6 respectively for hs and tm which show a higher deviation between the model and observations hence mpi is less than 0 87 indicating only a moderate performance using wwiii bc at the buoy location fig 17 c d shows the comparison between the observed sw2 and predicted wave parameters hs and tm using era 40 winds at 6 hourly intervals for the period 01 31 july 2000 for the selected location off bombay west coast of india the model predicted parameters using wam bc as shown in fig 17 c and d reveal higher correlations with the sw2 observations the correlation coefficients are 0 97 and 0 93 for hs and tm respectively with si values 0 03 and 0 07 the values of bias are 0 04 m and 0 06s respectively for hs and tm the rmse is low such as 0 08 m and 0 05s for hs and tm respectively which indicate a strong fit between the model and observations pe is 4 6 for hs and 5 9 for tm which also reveal a good match between swan and the observations mpi values are 0 98 and 0 96 respectively for hs and tm swan predicted parameters as shown in fig 17 c and d also reveal correlations of the order r 0 9 with sw2 observations using wwiii bc the correlation coefficients are 0 86 and 0 82 for hs and tm respectively with si values 0 43 and 0 31 the bias values are 0 39 m and 0 42s for hs and tm respectively as the predicted values are seen to be higher the rmse values are also high such as 0 54 m and 0 43s for hs and tm respectively which suggests weak fit between the model and observations as compared to wam bc the pe is 16 2 and 12 3 respectively for hs and tm indicating deviations between the model and observations with mpi 0 81 and 0 87 in the northeast coast of india swan hindcasts were validated for the period july 2008 and january 2009 using a dwr buoy located off gopalpur the statistical estimates for the validation of wave model swan with buoy measurements in the bay of bengal during july 2008 and january 2009 using bc of both wam and wwiii is shown in table 9 fig 18 a b shows the comparison between the observed and predicted wave parameters hs and tm at 6 hourly intervals for the period 01 31 july 2008 using wam and wwiii bc swan predicted parameters hs and tm as shown in fig 18 a and b respectively compare with the observation using wam bc the buoy versus model hindcasts for hs indicate a strong correlation coefficient of 0 83 using wam bc the value of si is 0 02 which is lower indicating a better fit between the model and buoy hs bias is positive such as 0 04 m rmse is 0 04 m and pe is lower 9 4 the value of mpi is very strong 0 97 for hs similarly using wwiii bc the model predicted parameter hs reveal a good correlation with the observations r 0 88 the value of si is 0 03 which is lower indicating a better fit between the model and buoy hs the bias is positive 0 14 m and considerably a lower value rmse is 0 05 m and pe is also lower 10 5 the mpi is higher enough 0 97 indicating better performance of swan for hs the tm also show good correlation r 0 74 with the buoy measurements as shown in fig 18 b using wam bc estimated si indicate a better fit with a lower value of 0 05 bias is negative and lower such as 0 01s the rmse is 0 34s which also show good agreement the pe is 7 2 which shows a best performance of the swan model mpi is also very high 0 95 indicating strong agreement between the model and the measured tm similarly tm also shows a good correlation of 0 80 between hindcast and buoy measurements using wwiii bc si is as low as 0 04 and bias is positive such as 0 27s rmse is 0 31s showing a good agreement and pe is considerably less 7 0 which reveal better performance of swan mpi is also higher enough such as 0 95 indicating a strong agreement between the model and measured tm a similar study of swan bc from wwiii using in situ wave rider buoy data off puducherry southeast coast of india was performed for the period from june 2007 until july 2009 by sandhya et al 2014 it was evident from both model and observations that there was an overall trend in wave heights showing a reasonable match with buoy observations the deviations can be attributed to the differences in the wind input parameterization in the models which shows varied response to relatively fast changes in wind speed the swan model validations using wam and wwiii bc with observations of the same wave rider buoy was also executed for the month of january 2009 fig 18 c and d shows the comparison between the buoy off gopalpur and predicted wave parameters hs and tm at 6 hourly intervals for the period 01 31 january 2009 the swan model predicted parameters hs and tm as shown in fig 18 c and d reveal poor correlation with the observations for hs while it demonstrates good correlation with observations for tm the estimated mean and ranges of hs for the buoy and swan hindcast deviate by 0 2 m january 2009 while the measured hs ranged between 0 3 and 0 9 m the buoy and hindcast hs show a correlation coefficient of 0 57 and si of 0 10 estimated bias and rmse are 0 19 m and 0 05 m respectively this being the northeast monsoon period pe is somewhat higher 25 2 for hs the mpi is 0 90 which indicate a reasonable agreement between the model and measurements compared to hs tm shows a better correlation r 0 91 between the buoy and swan hindcast using wam bc the si of 0 13 indicates a good fit between the observed tm and swan hindcast tm shows a lower bias of 0 59s while the observed tm varied from 3 4 to 10 2s the values of rmse pe and mpi are 0 83s 11 3 and 0 87 respectively all of these estimated statistics reveal very good agreement between swan and buoy observations tm using wam bc as seen from fig 18 d the comparison of swan hindcast wave parameters using quikscat ncep blended winds and wwiii bc with buoy measurements in the bay of bengal during january 2009 show considerable correlation with the observations the estimated means and ranges of hs for the buoy and swan hindcasts using wwiii bc deviate by 0 2 and 0 1 m respectively january 2009 which are low and acceptable the buoy and hindcast hs show a correlation coefficient of 0 71 r 0 94 for tm and si of 0 05 estimated bias and rmse are 0 13 m and 0 02mrespectively which reveal a moderate agreement between the model and observations with pe of 19 7 the mpi is higher enough 0 95 indicating that the model could simulate hs well at buoy location compared with hs tm shows a better correlation r 0 94 between buoy and swan hindcast the si value of 0 09 indicates a good fit between the observed tm and swan hindcast while it shows a bias of 0 44s the values of rmse pe and mpi are 0 57s 9 7 and 0 91 respectively all of them reveal a good agreement between the model and buoy observations as seen from fig 18 d the deviations in hs and tm at the buoy locations can be due to many reasons the quality of the wind forcing is essential for the good performance of the wave model it also determines to a large extent the evolution of the forecast errors janssen 1998 it is known that wave spectral directional spreads have a tendency to be too broad partly due to the limited number of directional bins used by the numerical models an increase in angular resolution has a positive impact on the quality of the modeled waves it also illustrates the benefit of an increase in angular resolution of the discretized wave spectrum the accuracy of swell propagation over large distances in models is critically controlled by angular resolution and hence it is likely that significant improvements can be produced when angular resolution is improved a systematic bias might be present in the wind analysis which in turn could explain some of the analyzed wave height underestimation in deep water models wam wwiii some of these underestimations when linked to local wave growth might in part be explained by this systematic negative bias in analyzed wind speed further the different parametrization of the source terms responsible for the wind input and dissipation in the wave energy balance equation of the wave models is also a major factor 5 7 validation of swan hindcasts using satellite measurements apart from buoy measurements attempts were also made to validate the swan hindcasts using satellite altimeter measurements in this study to validate the swan simulated hs the multimission product of aviso was used for a period of one year january to december 2011 the swan simulated hs was compared at three locations fig 1 b such as w1 21 6 n 72 4 e w2 21 1 n 72 4 e and w3 20 0 n 72 2 e with depths less than 10 m 20 m and 40 m respectively similarly the predicted wave heights were also compared at three fig 1 c locations e1 19 28 n 84 8 e e2 17 62 n 83 25 e and e3 17 2 n 82 8 e in the northeast coasts of india at depths less than 10 m 20 m and 40 m respectively the estimated statistics for the comparison of swan hs with aviso measurements during january to december 2011 is shown in table 10 fig 19 shows the comparison of simulated swan hs with altimeter measurements for the three locations w1 w2 and w3 respectively comparison of model and altimeter hs shows good agreement corresponding r of 0 94 0 91 0 92 0 89 and 0 90 0 87 using wam wwiii bc during 2011off the northwest coast of india at locations w1 w2 and w3 respectively fig 19 a b c at all three locations w1 w2 w3 it is noted an underestimation of the hs by the model in comparison to altimeter data during the southwest monsoon june to september the altimeter data shows that the bias obtained indicates that the predicted swan outputs underestimates the hs compared with the altimeter the bias values obtained are 0 35 0 40 m 0 38 0 46 m and 0 31 0 39 m using wam wwiii bc for the locations w1 w2 and w3 respectively for the year 2011 a positive bias indicates underestimation of the hs by the swan model with respect to altimeter high values of rmse 0 45 0 59 m 0 33 0 40 m and 0 43 0 57 m also indicate the underestimation by the model in comparison to altimeter data the si values obtained are 0 48 0 51 0 31 0 35 and 0 50 0 55 for w1 w2 and w3 locations using wam wwiii bc respectively pe and mpi varied in the range of 15 9 21 3 and 0 80 to 0 93 respectively for all three locations it is indicated from fig 19 that in three locations the wam bc proved to give a better performance as compared with wwiii bc in a study reported by shanas et al 2014 revealed that the comparisons between hs data from the multi mission product of aviso and buoy data at two stations ratnagiri and honnavar off west coast of india showed good agreement r of 0 97 and 0 94 during 2011 similar analysis to quantify the performance of the model was also executed in the northeast coast of india for selected locations e1 e2 and e3 at depths less than 10 m 20 m and 40 m respectively fig 20 shows the comparison of predicted swan hs and altimeter measurements at the three selected locations in general the altimeter observations show that the maximum hs values are in the range of 1 56 2 03 for all three locations the high correlation coefficients greater than 0 8 suggest that both swan and altimeter hs follow a similar annual march it is seen that the swan hs are under estimated with a bias of 0 35 0 41 m 0 51 0 59 m and 0 29 0 36 m using wam wwiii bc at the locations e1 e2 and e3 respectively the rmse varies from 0 45 to 0 62 m for all three locations considered with higher deviations in location e1 the si ranged from 0 30 to 0 64 and the correlation coefficient is greater than 0 82 for all the locations these results are comparable with studies carried out by kshatriya et al 2001 durrant et al 2009 for mono missions the pe ranged from 17 5 to 23 6 for all three locations considered suggesting that within the accuracy provided by this merged altimeter hs it can be used for qualitative validation open ocean wave forecasting and for understanding the wave climate over the indian ocean the high correlation together with low si at all locations considered suggests that the altimeter hs is of reasonably good quality and can be used for long term qualitative validation of model outputs the results obtained in this study are comparable with the study reported by shanas et al 2014 which revealed an overestimation of hs r of 0 68 by the altimeter data at the puducherry location in the east coast during the southwest monsoon june to september 2011 in the same study the visakhapatnam location shanas et al 2014 also shows good agreement r of 0 9 in another study by sabique et al 2013 it is reported that the basin scale validations for arabian sea and bay of bengal using aviso measurements suggest that there is no regional dependency for the altimeter derived hs even though bay of bengal is known to be a swell dominated region throughout the year the underestimation of merged altimeter observations may be due to the smoothening of the actual data recorded by the altimeter during the process of gridding and averaging the altimeter and buoy measured hs show good agreement even during the high wave conditions that prevail during the southwest monsoon june september season altimeter hs is underestimated by 0 20 m the root mean square error rmse is less than 0 30 m the scatter index is less than 20 and the correlation coefficient is greater than 0 90 the merged data sets are not suitable for applications during extreme conditions sabique et al 2013 because of heavy distortion due to averaging and interpolating in the above study for the comparison of swan hindcasts using bc from wam and wwiii it is clearly evident that the swan hindcasts in comparison with altimeter aviso measurements were understimated at all three locations both along the northwest and northeast coasts of india although this can be partly attributed to the quality of wind inputs physics numeric and model grid resolution issues with the accuracy of altimeter data is also reported in earlier studies sabique et al 2013 shanas et al 2014 the higher hs values of altimeter data can be due to many reasons mainly it can be attributed to the smoothening of the actual data recorded by the altimeter during the process of gridding and averaging of pass data the land influence will have a significant effect on the grid averaging can be one of the possible reasons the errors arising from different sampling methods is approximately 8 of the mean hs monaldo 1988 further the earlier studies in other parts of the globe also reported over estimation of altimeter data over buoy data abdalla 2006 greenslade 2001 the hwang et al 1998 and durrant et al 2009 bring out the short comings of altimeter data averaged over time or space through the temporal and spatial de correlation analyses hence merged altimeter hs from different satellite missions cannot be taken as a measure of true sea state for validation of wave models for the cyclone period it is concluded from this study that performance using altimeter data shows good correlation with moderate bias the altimeter measurements demonstrates a good source of data to study the wave variability in the nearshore waters in future development in filtering control can lead to removal of high errors caused due to land contamination and other complicated processes further improvements can be implemented by applying nesting facilities of the swan with unstructured grids with varying spatial resolution to get very high accuracy in the prediction in addition validation and calibration of wind fields is recommended as well as applying wind fields with a finer spatial and temporal resolution to further improve the quality of the nearshore model 6 conclusions based on the work presented above the following summary and conclusions are presented we summarize here the main findings of our research for the selected locations off northwest and northeast coast of india this study uses analyzed winds blended products and satellite measurements for inter comparison of hindcast results so as to explore and exploit the suitability and capabilities of these state of the art third generation wave models to their full potential the study encompassed in this paper is the first in respect to north indian ocean purposely to find acceptance and project its usefulness on sea state information such that hindcast results will be acceptable with better confidence in this inter comparison exercise we have focused more on a multi scale modelling approach to inter compare wave hindcasts along selected locations over the northwest and northeast coasts of india three different third generation wave models were implemented and wave hindcasts numerical simulations were carried out successfully for the global domain regional domain north indian ocean and local model domains northwest and northeast coastal sites of india for january 2000 and july 2000 using era 40 winds july 2008 and january 2009 using quikscat ncep blended winds and june 2011 using oscat winds the global implementation of wam and wwiii 77 s to 77 n and 0 to 360 e over 1 1 resolution could successfully provide boundary inputs to the intermediate regional model domain of swan d1 0 n to 30 n 55 e to 95 e north indian ocean over 0 25 0 25 grid resolution the wave hindcasts of swan in deep water mode also could successfully provide boundary input to the northwest d2 17 n to 24 n and 67 e to 74 e and northeast d3 14 n to 21 n and 80 e to 87 e coastal domains of india over a grid resolution of 0 1 0 1 without any boundary or numerical problems the inter comparison of swan hindcast parameters such as hs tm and hsw off northwest coastal domain of india using wam and wwiii bc for january 2000 and 2009 showed percentage error varying from 2 4 to 17 5 similarly off northeast coastal domain revealed percentage error from 2 4 to 12 7 for hs tm and hsw suggesting better agreements compared to northwest coastal domain during june and july 2000 2008 and 2011 inter comparison of swan hindcasts such as hs tm and hsw off northwest and northeast coastal domains revealed percentage error ranging from 3 6 to 19 2 and 3 0 9 3 respectively one of the important indications is that the variation in swan wave heights in comparison to the deep water models wam and wwiii clearly reveal that it is due to the wave transformation in the shallow waters as expected from a shallow nearshore model with higher grid resolution basedon both qualitative as well as quantitative assessment of the model results through inter comparisons the case studies clearly indicate that all the three models wam wwiii and swan performed well in their respective model domains using era 40 quikscat ncep blended and oscat winds the validation of swan hindcasts using moored and dwr buoy measurements proved promising enough at the coastal locations off northwest coast and off gopalpur during the study period the percentage error in the northwest and northeast coast for hs and tm for all buoys considered varied in the range 4 6 25 2 and 5 2 15 6 respectively although underestimation and overestimation of hs and tm were noted at the buoy locations it is demonstrated that swan hindcasts using wam bc were able to reproduce the wave characteristics at the buoy location with lesser pe as compared to swan using wwiii bc the comparison between the hs data from the multimission product of aviso and the swan hindcast at selected locations at depth less than 10 m 20 m and 40 m off the northwest and northeast coast of india shows that the altimeter data showed fairly good correlation of the order 0 83 to 0 94 the pe was less than 24 in all locations considered the higher hs of merged altimeter observations in comparison with swan hs observed during the year 2011 along the northwest and northeast coasts of india may be due to the smoothening of the actual data recorded by the altimeter during the process of gridding and averaging and the effect of land influence on the grid averaging overall the inter comparisons and validation results of this experimental simulations hindcasts suggests that swan hindcasts for both the northwest coast as well as northeast coastal model domains can be considered better than the deep water model outputs it is also seen that the hindcast results of swan using wam bc are found to be generally higher by 5 15 by considering the cases numerical simulations only presented in this paper whereas it may be noted that wwiii is the latest model which uses most recent physics of wave generation wave current interaction and air sea temperature difference as an additional input and its numerical approaches are superior to wam although computationally expensive therefore it would be wise to have long term measurements both in deep and coastal waters of north indian ocean to validate using sea truth data and inter compare wam and wwiii further coupled with swan in the nearshore

an existing auv irdl rsm 4 fixed thrusters under actuated robot but searching for new thrusters directions and controller parameters to perform successive tasks graphical abstract image 1 keywords auv rov propulsion design autonomous underwater robots genetic algorithms task based design model based mobile robot control 1 introduction in the second half of the 20th century thanks to marine technology maturity marine robotics made its appearance in ocean exploration namely unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs started being developed and since then as noted in antonelli 2006 advancements in technology allowed to have a rapid progression in their capabilities nowadays uuvs have become increasingly prevalent and are used for scientific military and industrial purposes current uuvs capabilities allow to perform tasks not even imaginable fifty years ago see mcphail 2009 ribas et al 2015 and bruno et al 2015 a type of uuv used to perform missions without human intervention is called autonomous underwater vehicles auvs which after decades of development have proven the ability to achieve increasingly complex missions even if great advances have been accomplished in terms of autonomy nowadays auvs have reduced maneuverability as noted in djapic et al 2007 nguyen et al 2009 barngrover et al 2011 chen et al 2015 and li et al 2015 enhanced auv agility maneuverability and speed brings increased autonomy indeed current computing processing and sensor technologies allow implementing sophisticated model based control methods these advances added to developments in propulsion technology would increase auvs agility if coupled with efficient control in this work we focus on the design of propulsion system itself and its efficiency in order to achieve higher agility for autonomous vehicles we determine here the most suited propulsive configuration for a given task or subtask this search includes in part the topology orientation of the thrusters and the control system control gains and tracking point position but not the reconfigurable thrusters technology nor the issue of transition between configurations we call this technique dynamic reconfiguration of propulsion system since it can be operated in mission the method is applied here to a 4 thrusters auv namely rsm robot but is not limited to it vectored thrust technology is not discussed in this work but we have based our models and our method on real vector thrusters that can actually and independently orient their thrust hence their propeller as proposed in vega et al 2016 classical design consists in solving all sub system design problems independently in a preconceived order see d souza 1998 this method is not adapted for complex robotic systems where no definitive design method is proven we propose then to adopt a task based design method in order to drive the auv propulsion design process using evaluation from simulation including control taking into account the complexity of designing a robot propulsion it is clear that such a difficult task would greatly benefit from a computer based search method namely the design problem discussed in this research work can be formulated as a global optimization problem similarly as for kinematic design of robotic arms shown in chocron and bidaud 1997 our optimization problem is then the minimization of an objective function calculated taking into account the robot global performances while performing a mission in simulation giving the astronomical number of available possible solutions and the lack of uniformity in the design parameters we can not use classical optimization techniques gradient based search in order to solve this optimization problem we use evolutionary algorithms holland 1975 which operates the power of artificial evolution to find suitable solutions to our problem given that auvs have an on board power storage system it is important that improvements in agility do not increase power consumption beyond measure this trade off agility vs power efficiency will guide us during the optimization process based on their ease of use the simplicity of their implementation and their applicability genetic algorithms will be used to solve the design problem in this work indeed task based propulsive solutions will be created taking the auv design as an optimization solved with genetic algorithms as in chocron 2008 this work is organized in five additional sections prior to conclusion section 2 presents dynamic models of our reference rsm like auv rsm robot but with vectored thrusters and its propulsion systems section 3 proposes a nonlinear model based control method namely computed torque control section 4 deals with the thrust generation applied to any rsm like auv section 5 details our original application of genetic algorithms to the dynamic reconfiguration of auv propulsion problem section 6 shows the results of the genetic optimization applied to a three fold realistic mission consisting of a marine tidal turbine inspection 2 auv dynamics modeling in order to evaluate the pertinence of the found solutions the genetic algorithm needs an evaluation method in our case the evaluation will be done by dynamic simulation even if other methods exist see koos et al 2013 our choice is based on the fact that our simulator eauvive 1 1 enib auv in virtuo experiment irdl enib 2007 2017 introduced in vega et al 2014 even if approximated lacking of fluid mechanics and experimental validation of added mass terms offers an acceptable degree of relevancy considering our goal finding solutions that could aid to the design of underwater robots propulsion the eauvive simulator described in vega et al 2014 includes a model of the auv rigid body dynamics hydrodynamic effects a model based control method a thrust allocation method and a nonlinear model of the force generated by the thrusters 2 1 kinematic model to model the auv two orthogonal coordinate systems are used r 0 o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 is the earth fixed frame and r b o b x b y b z b is auv body fixed in fig 1 body fixed and earth fixed coordinate systems are shown together with a diagram of the auv the vectors describing the motion of the auv in 6 dof are 1 η η 1 η 2 η 1 x y z η 2 ϕ θ ψ ν ν 1 ν 2 ν 1 u v w ν 2 p q r τ τ 1 τ 2 τ 1 x y z τ 2 k m n here η is the vector of position and orientation in r 0 the orientation η 2 is defined using an euler zyx ψ θ ϕ convention as described in fossen 1994 ν is the linear and angular absolute velocity vector in r b τ is the external forces and moments vector in the body fixed frame which accounts for propulsion forces applied on the auv precisely this vector will allow modeling thrust forces from different propulsion architectures to change the auv velocity vector from one to another coordinate system we use a velocity transformation matrix as given in fossen 1994 2 j η 2 j 1 η 2 0 3 3 0 3 3 j 2 η 2 where 3 j 1 η

transformation matrix we can obtain the auv absolute velocity vector expressed in r 0 from its expression in r b see fossen 1994 4 η d η d t r 0 j η 2 ν 2 2 dynamic model the nonlinear rigid body dynamic equations of the underwater robot can be formulated as in antonelli 2006 and fossen 1994 5 m ν c ν d ν g τ where m i r 6 6 c i r 6 6 and d i r 6 6 are the matrices of mass coriolis and centripetal terms and damping respectively including added mass terms g is the vector of gravitational forces and moments lastly τ is the wrench of external forces and moments the wrench τ accounts for the propulsive forces generated by the thrusters it is calculated as follows 6 τ b p u p where b p is the thrust control matrix tcm which depends on the propulsive configuration number position and orientation of the actuators u p is the vector of the actuators forces i e thrust output these matrices are constructed using rigid body and hydrodynamic considerations the rigid body dynamic part is based on the fact that the underwater vehicle is nothing more than a solid so the well known rigid body dynamics applies given that these kind of vehicles operate solely under water we need to add a hydrodynamic component or layer to the dynamic model in order to completely describe the robot the hydrodynamic matrices described in this section account each one for a specific dynamic effect of the water over the robot said effects are added mass drag forces and gravitational forces and moments all of which are described as follows 2 3 rigid body and added mas dynamics during its motion underwater vehicles displace the water in its surroundings since the auv applies a force and a moment on the neighboring fluid reaction forces are applied to the auv see fossen 1994 we take into account this reactive force with the concept of added mass added mass is not a finite amount of fluid to add to the auv mass but a function of the robot geometry see antonelli 2006 and motion velocities the global mass matrix m in the general nonlinear dynamic model eq 5 accounts not only for the mass and inertia of the underwater robot but also for the added mass contribution namely 7 m m b m a where m b ℝ 6 6 is the mass matrix of the robot rigid body m b m i 3 3 m s p b g m s p b g ℑ with m mass of the auv i 3 3 3 3 identity matrix p b g position vector of auv cog in r b ℑ inertia matrix of auv in r b s x cross pre product matrix of x s p q r t 0 r q r 0 p q p 0 and m a ℝ 6 6 is the added mass contribution which can be defined in an abbreviated form fossen 1994 m a a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 where a 11 a 12 a 21 and a 22 ℝ 3 3 represent the added mass terms this matrix can be simplified for certain conditions and auv structures for a robot completely submerged in the water with a three plane of symmetry structure and working at low speed we can neglect the contribution of the non diagonal terms in m a 8 m a d i a g x u y v z w k p m q n r added mass also contributes with coriolis and centripetal terms in the general nonlinear dynamic equation eq 5 the coriolis and centripetal terms are included in the c matrix 9 c c b c a where c b ℝ 6 6 is the coriolis and centripetal matrix of the rigid body c b m s ν 2 m s ν 2 s p b g m s p b g s ν 2 s ℑ ν 2 and c a ℝ 6 6 is the contribution due to the added mass c a 0 3 3 s a 11 ν 1 a 12 ν 2 s a 11 ν 1 a 12 ν 2 s a 21 ν 1 a 22 ν 2 the general form of the added mass contribution to the coriolis and centripetal effects matrix can be simplified as follows for three planes of symmetry robots 10 c a 0 0 0 0 z w w y v

dissipative effects drag forces due to shape and friction and is called the damping matrix as for the added mass matrix we can make simplifications for three plane of symmetry structures which leads to neglect the contribution of the non diagonal terms giving the nature of dissipative effects this matrix is positive the cylindrical geometry of the auv allows to simplify the damping matrix only the linear and quadratic diagonal terms are considered in antonelli 2006 d ν 0 d d i a g x u y v z w k p m q n r d i a g x u u u y v v v z w w w k p p p m q q q n r r r furthermore another simplification can be made if we consider that the auv speed is high enough to neglect linear terms with respect to the quadratic ones see ferreira et al 2009 while the robot speed is very low none of these effects are significant w r t other dynamic terms anyway since free drift is not a control method in this case only quadratic terms are included in matrix d 11 d d i a g x u u u y v v v z w w w k p p p m q q q n r r r 2 5 gravitational forces and moments these are gravitational and buoyancy forces which act respectively through the center of gravity p g b and the center of buoyancy p b b restoring force and moment can be calculated in r b as follows 12 g f b g η 2 f b b η 2 p b g f b g η 2 p b b f b b η 2 with f b g η 2 j 1 1 η 2 0 0 w the weight of the robot f b b η 2 j 1 1 η 2 0 0 b the buoyancy force w m g is the robot weight b ρ g is the buoyancy force g 9 81 m s 2 is earth gravity acceleration ρ 998 k g m 3 water density displaced volume of water in our simulations an auv with cylindrical hull will be used which is meant to approximate the shape of the rsm robot fig 2 an irdl 2 2 institut de recherche dupuy de lôme developed experimental platform this will allow calculating the added mass and damping terms using the simplifications proposed by fossen 1994 and antonelli 2006 the calculation of the hydrodynamic parameters and simplifications in the model for this vehicle are available in vega et al 2014 here we only present a summary of the parameters in tables 1 and 2 these values are used in the dynamic simulator introduced in sec 2 as well as in the controller see sec 3 3 model based nonlinear control after having modeled the robot the next steps in the study of the underwater vehicle are the control technique and the estimation methods used on it these are the key elements to simulate the behavior of the robot given that we have a very precise model of the robot it seems logical to make intensive use of it the chosen method is the computed torque or feedback linearization it is a nonlinear control method that explicitly uses the kinematic and dynamic models of the robot to cancel out the intrinsic nonlinearities this control method is broadly used to design feedback controllers for auvs see millán et al 2014 and yang et al 2013 it is also used to control robots with complicated mechanisms as seen in boyer et al 2006 the idea behind this method is to algebraically transform nonlinear systems into fully or partly linear ones so that simple linear control techniques can be applied the method straightforwardly computes the inverse kinematic and dynamic models of the robot the control is split in two layers kinematic and dynamic that are executed sequentially at each time step fig 3 this characteristic offers a clear view of the internal workings of the controller that allows us to draw conclusions about the controllability and learn about the robot in general 3 1 kinematic control the kinematic level is in charge of the calculation of the correct robot velocity ν in auv body fixed frame r b in order to make the tracking point e follow the reference trajectory η e d in the earth fixed frame r 0 the point e is an arbitrary point of the auv but since it has an impact on the controlability of the auv is will be part of the configuration optimization in sec 6 to calculate the kinematic control law we start with the velocities of the tracking point e 13 ν 1 e ν 1 ν 2 r e ν 2 e ν 2 in r b 14 η 1 e j 1 η 2 ν 1 e η 2 e j 2 η 2 ν 2 in r 0 where the position vector of e in r b is 15 r e ε x ε y ε z t indeed in eq 13 we calculate the velocity of e using rigid body kinematics we can re write eq 13 in the following way ν e ν 1 ν 2 r e ν 2 1 0 0 0 ε z ε y 0 1 0 ε z 0 ε x 0 0 1 ε y ε x 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 t u v w p q r ν from the previous equation we can see that matrix t is the link between the robot velocity and the tracking point one taking into account eq 16 we can turn eq 14 into 16 η e j η 2 ν e j η 2 t ν allowing us to determine the relation between the point e velocity η e and the robot velocity ν 17 ν t 1 j η 2 1 η e based on this relation and using the desired trajectory η e d and its derivative η e d we can develop the following kinematic velocity control law see alonge et al 2001 18 ν a d t 1 j 1 η e d λ e k i n with λ 0 the gain matrix of the proportional kinematic controller diagonal and e k i n η e d η e the kinematic position orientation error when the kinematic error e k i n is zero we see that eq 18 turns into eq 17 indeed when the controller manages to cancel the error the feedforward control alone drives the robot in order to continue in the tracked trajectory additionally if we replace ν in eq 16 for the expression of ν a d from eq 18 we obtain the following dynamic equation for the kinematic error 19 e k i n λ e k i n 0 which shows that the kinematic control law makes the robot converge exponentially toward the desired trajectory 3 2 dynamic control law obviously the desired velocity of the robot ν a d can not be correctly achieved with only kinematic control indeed the robot needs to fight against the dynamic effects acting on itself in order to precisely generate this velocity as seen in the previous section these dynamic effects are a consequence of the rigid body dynamics and caused by the water surrounding the vehicle the dynamic layer of the controller takes in charge the compensation of all the dynamic effects on the robot it generates the needed torque τ a that will make the auv body fixed frame r b to follow ν a d which via the kinematic control will lead the point e to follow the reference trajectory η e d in r 0 based on the dynamic model of the robot described before eq 5 the following dynamic acceleration control law is created in r b see alonge et al 2001 20 τ a m ν a d k p e d y n c ν ν d ν ν g with e d y n ν a d ν the dynamic error from the previous equation we see how all the terms of the dynamic model of the robot are present plus a proportional k p 0 term for error correction if applied the calculated torque τ a will compensate the hydrodynamic and rigid body dynamic effects on the robot and steer the velocity ν towards the desired velocity ν a d if we replace τ from eq 5 for its expression from eq 20 we obtain the dynamic equation for the dynamic error 21 e d y n k p e d y n 0 which shows that the non linearities compensation make the auv converge exponentially toward the desired robot velocity ν a d given that both e k i n and e d y n converge exponentially the controller as a whole kinematic and dynamic layers is able to make an arbitrary point of the auv to track a bounded space trajectory 4 thrust generation torque computation method is capable of calculating the needed τ a to apply on the robot in order to make the tracking point e follow a desired trajectory η e d however it has no information about how to create said wrench 4 1 thrust allocation in order to calculate the force on each thruster to generate τ a we use the thrust allocation method presented in fossen and johansen 2006 the thrust allocation method solves the following equation τ a b p u p where b p is the thrust configuration matrix tcm as seen in section 2 given τ a we can calculate the needed force on each thruster calculating 22 u ˆ p b p 1 τ a this equation is only valid if b p is a square matrix when this matrix is not square its pseudo inverse is used see siciliano bruno and khatib 2008 23 u ˆ p b p t b p 1 b p t τ a for m n under actuated 24 u ˆ p b p t b p b p t 1 τ a for m n redundant where m and n are the number of lines and columns of b p respectively eq 23 is used for the irdl enib under actuated rsm robot see fig 2 in vega et al 2015 a method to adapt this technique to different propulsive configurations different b p matrices is proposed this technique will be used here as well to apply the concepts discussed in this section to a specific robot which is presented in the next section the simulator needs to know the propulsive topology of the robot here we are going to focus on widely used fixed propulsion topology robots with this type of propulsion are powered by several thrusters placed and directed along different axes in order to combine their thrust and provide six or less actuated dof to the robot various architectures within this group can be found by the optimization process each one with advantages and drawbacks but they share the same principle which is multi directional propulsion based on thrust combination an example of this type of topology is the rsm robot which has a four thrusters fixed propulsive topology as shown in fig 4 two horizontal thrusters are placed at the rear of the auv and two vertical thrusters are centered symmetrically on the sides of the robot this configuration provides actuation over the following dof surge linear motion along the x b axis heave linear motion along the z b axis yaw rotation along the y b axis roll rotation along the x b axis conversely due to the location of the four thrusters the following dof can not be actuated pitch rotation along y b axis sway linear motion along y b axis roll and pitch motion are mechanically stabilized thanks to the relative position of the buoyancy and gravity centers the sway is not controlled nor stabilized thus free motion on y b axis drift is expected to occur the position of each thruster is given with regard to r b by the following vectors in meters based on a real auv p b 1 p 1 x p 1 y p 1 z 0 21 0 12 0 p b 2 p 2 x p 2 y p 2 z 0 21 0 12 0 p b 3 p 3 x p 3 y p 3 z 0 0 105 0 p b 4 p 4 x p 4 y p 4 z 0 0 105 0 the tcm can then be calculated as b p 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 p 3 y p 4 y p 1 z p 2 z p 3 x p 4 x p 1 y p 2 y 0 0 and taking into account the alignments b p 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 p 3 y p 4 y 0 0 0 0 p 1 y p 2 y 0 0 with the input thrust vector u p u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 where u 1 u 2 u 3 and u 4 are the four thruster propulsion forces even if it is extensively used and accepted among auv designers it is clear that this propulsive configuration is not optimally suited for every kind of mission in this work we will keep the rsm robot number of thrusters and positions and try to find the best fitted orientations in order to perform a specific set of tasks given that optimizing the orientation of the four thrusters of the rsm robot topology results in the modification of the b p matrix we need first to understand and define how the forces are represented in this matrix depending on the thruster orientation 4 2 thrust configuration matrix and under actuation the b p matrix is a key factor in the success of the controller it is in charge of determining how the τ a control wrench could be created obviously for a given τ a that the robot is not capable to generate the controller will not be able to make e converge toward the desired trajectory the thrust allocation method is the stage of the control wrench generation this means that even if the controller correctly calculates τ a a faulty thrust allocation can produce a failing control as seen in section 3 the thrust allocation method uses the inverse or pseudo inverse of the b p matrix in order to calculate the force that each thruster must generate this establishes a constraint on this matrix it must be invertible a non invertible matrix means that the robot is not capable of creating with its propulsive topology the demanded wrench τ a the b p matrix when multiplied by the u p vector must generate the elements of τ a needed to follow the trajectory if the product b p u p fails to do so the controller will not be able to achieve its mission as explained before this matrix represents the propulsive configuration of the robot each column corresponds to the contribution of a thruster to the creation of τ a the number of columns of this matrix is therefore the number of thrusters each thruster has its own coordinate frame r i p i x i y i z i the angles convention used to define the orientation of this frame with regard to r b is the same euler zyx convention as to define the orientation of r b with regard to r 0 in fossen 1994 this convention uses three successive rotations around successive axes ψ i around z b θ i around y b and ϕ i around x b the position of each thruster origin p i in r b is given by a vector p i b p i x p i y p i z t with these elements we can determine the homogeneous transformation matrix t i b 25 t b i c θ i c ψ i s ψ i c ϕ i c ψ i s θ i s ϕ i s ψ i s ϕ i c ψ i c ϕ i s θ i p i x c θ i s ψ i c ψ i c ϕ i s θ i s θ i s ψ i c ψ i s ϕ i s θ i s ψ i c ϕ i p i y s θ i c θ i s ϕ i c θ i c ϕ i p i z 0 0 0 1 where c and s represent trigonometric functions cos and sin respectively the force of each thruster follows by convention the x axis of its frame this means that when using the rotation matrix eq 25 to calculate the components of this force in r b only the first column of the rotation matrix is used the orientation of the thrust vector is then independent of ϕ i taking this into account each thruster is represented in b p as follows 26 x y z t b i u i 0 0 0 m n k p b i u i 0 0 27 x y z m n k τ a c θ i c ψ i c θ i s ψ i s θ i s θ i p i y c θ i s ψ i p i z c θ i c ψ i p i z s θ i p i x c θ i s ψ i p i x c θ i c ψ i p i y b p u i u p from the above equation we see that if for some reason one of the lines of the thrusters contributions is zero the propulsion system will not be able to actuate the corresponding degree of freedom such a situation may arise when the orientation of the thruster is orthogonal to the degree of freedom in question or when the moment arm is non existent the genetic algorithm will search among the possibilities given by the combination of orientation angles and will try to find an optimal way of generating the needed τ a 4 3 thruster model according to auv simulations including thrusters dynamics in vega et al 2014 we can conclude that the use of the thruster model in the simulation is useful in this situation indeed in a real vehicle the thrust generation process does not stop in thrust allocation the desired thrust has to be effectively generated by the actuators the process of thrust generation is shown in fig 5 as we can see the thrust allocation method calculates only the desired thrust on each actuator u ˆ p an open loop controller needs to be used in order to determine what is the voltage v to apply on each thruster after this step the calculated voltage is applied to the electrodynamic model of the thruster which gives us the response of this actuator u p the open loop controller and the electrodynamic model of the thruster are given next 4 3 1 open loop controller the hydrodynamic thruster model is as follows koh et al 2006 2002 28 u k t 0 ω k t ω ω where u is the thrust force and ω is the rotational velocity of the propeller shaft k t 0 and k t are propeller transient and stationary thrust coefficients the relation between the voltage v and the thrust force u is given by the motor electromechanical model adapted for propulsion 29 v r i l i κ ω u k m i where r is the motor wiring resistance l the inductance i the current κ the back emf or speed constant and k m is the modified motor constant related to thrust force considering only the steady state components of the model from eq 28 and eq 29 i 0 and ω 0 eq 28 and eq 29 can be reformulated as 30 v r i κ ω u k t ω ω combining equations 29 and 30 we obtain the thruster steady state model 31 v r k m u κ u k t eq 31 is used to calculate the thruster control input for a desired thrust u 4 3 2 thruster electro dynamical model the thrusters dc brushed motor can be mechanically modeled as follows 32 j m ω γ f γ l λ i where j m is the motor shaft inertia γ f is the resistive torque and γ l is the load torque κ and λ the torque constant are considered equal if expressed in si units the resistive torque can be calculated as 33 γ f k f v ω k f s ω ω with k f s and k f v the dry and viscous friction coefficients respectively the load torque can be calculated as in whitcomb and yoerger 1995 34 γ l k l ω ω where k l is the load coefficient using eq 29 and eq 32 we get an electro mechanical model of the thruster the state space system equations are ω i k f v j m λ j m κ l r l ω i 0 1 l v 1 j m k l ω ω k f s ω ω 0 this last set of equations are important since they allow calculating the propeller angular speed ω and thus the generated dynamical thrust u for the dynamic simulation to be able to apply the proposed models a further step is needed the thruster parameters identification 4 3 3 thrusters parameters our thruster model is the seabotix btd 150 and has been identified in vega et al 2014 electromechanical parameters of the brushed dc motor are identified by measuring motor voltage current and propeller angular speed these measurements took place outside the water in order to neglect the influence of the unknown resistive torque and to allow speed measurement all identified parameters are gathered in table 3 5 dynamic reconfiguration of propulsion an underwater robot regardless of its category is a complex system affected by various and heterogeneous parameters indeed a small change in these parameters can greatly influence the overall performance of the robot this is due to the strong nonlinearities in kinematic and dynamic auv models considering this the use of analytic or deductive methods to find appropriate parameters to create a suitable robot for a given task is hardly conceivable the global optimization of an underwater robot propulsion modifying for instance number position and orientation of thrusters could allow finding a suitable design for a given task however searching an optimal configuration for all mission tasks requirements could generate impractical solutions indeed the same robot performing several tasks in the same mission this would require finding a single propulsion topology suitable for a number of situations which seems unlikely the other option presented here is to reconfigure dynamically the robot which means that it will change its propulsion configuration during the mission according to changing task specifications nowadays reconfiguration of the thrust direction seems to be giving its first steps out of infancy as it can be seen in cavallo et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 jin et al 2014 xin et al 2013 and vega et al 2016 these technologies allow achieving greater maneuverability as needed for autonomous mobility unfortunately a complete reconfiguration of the propulsion system including the thrusters positions in the auv is not technologically feasible today taking into account these restrictions we perform the optimization in a more realistic scenario to achieve this we will look for solutions adapted to a multitasking mission but with neither changing thrusters positions nor by changing their number we keep the rsm robot main features that is to say 4 fixed thrusters only the thrusters orientation and control parameters will be optimized this approach is realistic because it can be implemented using vectorial thrusters such as the rmct studied in vega et al 2016 before applying genetic algorithms we explain here the principles of this stochastic optimization method and its adaptation to our specific problem 5 1 genetic algorithms ga principle being a type of evolutionary algorithms ga are based on the evolution theory of darwin genetic algorithms use emulated natural evolution mechanisms to evolve a population of individuals representing solutions of an optimization problem according to an objective function fitness as seen in goldberg 1989 a typical genetic algorithm follows these steps fig 6 1 a population of individuals is created this population can be created randomly or using previous information 2 the individuals of the population are evaluated and given a fitness according to their performance based on the objective function 3 using the fitness of each individual as genetic information genetic operators are applied to create new individuals a selection the best individuals best fitnesses are selected from the population to serve as reproducers this selection can be deterministic or partly stochastic b crossover two individuals parents mix their genes in order to create two new individuals children c mutation a change of value of the genes allele of the individuals is done the change from 0 to 1 or conversely is decided randomly each gene has a tiny probability of being mutated d population replacement the new generation created by the previous operators replaces completely the old generation completely or partially 4 go to step 2 if solutions are not yet satisfactory otherwise finish the algorithm 5 2 optimization problem our optimization problem create a suitable robot propulsion system capable of performing a given mission is not very well defined a mathematical and concise definition of our problem will allow correctly designing and implementing the genetic algorithm the controller calculates the force to generate on the thrusters of a specific robot in order to make it follow a desired trajectory we can also consider that a high level mission is a succession of properly tuned trajectories chained one after the other taking into account these two statements we can conclude that our controller by making the robot follow the desired trajectory also makes the robot comply with a given complex mission the optimal robot for the optimization problem must be the one that follows precisely the desired trajectory given to the controller this means that the distance from the tracking point to the desired trajectory must reach to zero and stay like that we can rephrase the last statement saying that the integral of the trajectory error must be as close to zero as possible moreover the thruster voltage is limited to a fixed value our optimization problem is then the minimization of an objective function under constraint defined as the integral of the kinematic error ε k i n of the controller this can be put mathematically as follows find x i r 1 1 2 n 3 x i r 1 1 2 n 3 g x g x v i 1 n v 0 with x the most suitable individual formed by 2 n 3 parameters its is searched in a discrete subspace of i r 1 1 2 n 3 g x the objective function to minimize defined as the integral of the kinematic error of the

parameters θ p i ψ p i defined with regard to the robot frame since the robot has only one main controller we have 3 parameters to optimize the parameters of the controller are 2 gains for the kinematic and dynamic control layers and a position coordinate x e for the position of the tracking point e the objective function g x is calculated here as the simple addition with equal weights of

towards the trajectory in any case the fitness function based on eq 35 is then 38 f x 100 1 g x 5 3 mission the mission in question will be the inspection of a marine tidal current turbine the reason to chose such a mission is based on the fact that these devices in addition to their installation costs induce extra maintenance costs these turbines as with any other underwater structures installed at sea are exposed to aggressive degradation factors such as corrosion and bio fouling among others in order to verify the turbine condition divers check for signs of deterioration which increases maintenance time and cost based on the current trends for this type of operation the use of underwater robots seems appropriate and inevitable obviously given the complexity of this mission a good control performance is required to avoid nearby obstacles since tidal turbines are always close to the coastline in our work the mission performance comes as a compromise between trajectory control accuracy and energy efficiency the marine tidal turbine inspection mission fig 7 can be divided in three phases scanning of the seabed for the turbine after activating this phase the robot follows a survey trajectory in order to find the position of the tidal turbine by scanning the seabed the underwater vehicle can use multi beam sonar information to scan the seabed from near surface depth until it detects the wanted target diving toward the turbine once the robot has found its target it starts a diving phase in this phase the robot will try to approach but not too close the turbine as fast as possible trying to minimize the energy consumption at the same time tomography inspection of the tidal turbine when the robot reaches its target it starts the inspection of the energy generator this phase is usually executed using a camera to record images of the turbine from all azimuths in order to correctly capture images the robot needs to encircle the device ensuring that it keeps a constant distance from the target and its x b axis always points the center of the circle 6 genetic optimization application 6 1 design parameters this optimization focuses on specific design elements of an auv linked to propulsion and control namely propulsion parameters thruster orientation θ i ψ i controller parameters tracking point p e x control gains λ k p where i 1 4 represents the i t h thruster in the propulsion topology 6 1 1 propulsion parameters propulsion parameters have a deep influence on the operation of underwater robots the propulsion parameters listed above will determine the controllability of the underwater vehicle indeed as seen in section 3 each new propeller will contribute to the robot controllability with a propulsive wrench the wrench contribution depends for this optimization on the orientation of the thruster since these parameters will dictate what dof will be actuated by the thruster if the thrusters of the robot are misdirected the creation of the propulsive wrench will not be optimal a defective propulsion topology needs to generate a greater propulsive wrench in order to follow a defined trajectory since our simulation saturates the force on the thrusters by using the electro dynamical thruster model with bounded voltage a poorly configured robot could not be as effective to follow said trajectory than a properly configured one this will translate on bigger tracking errors and energy consumption throughout the evaluation 6 1 2 controller parameters controller parameters also play an important role on the performance of the robot these parameters have to be precisely tuned in order to make the robot efficiently follow the desired trajectory the first parameter the tracking point e intervenes in the kinematic part of the controller since ultimately it is the tracking point that follows the desired trajectory its position will determine the convergence seed indeed a tracking point far from the origin of the mobile frame will need less thrust power to correct its trajectory this is due to the fact that small changes on the robot angular velocity result in big changes on the tracking point linear velocities the position of this point relatively to the robot may be dictated as well by the task itself lastly the gain parameters of both the kinematic and dynamic control layers will also influence the robot ability to follow the desired trajectory a fine tuning of these values is necessary to obtain a rapid and efficient convergence to the reference trajectory on one hand both gains need to be sufficiently large to guarantee a rapid convergence to the followed path on the other hand the kinematic gain also needs to be small enough to create a reachable reference velocity for the dynamic control layer because of acceleration limitations moreover the dynamic gain must be small enough to avoid creating chattering on the propellers input added by the dynamic controller correction 6 2 representation of solutions to properly implement the genetic algorithm we need to precisely define the design parameters these parameters are the building blocks used by the genetic algorithm to find adequate solutions to our problem and they will become the solution at the end of the evolution process the parameters being of different nature we have parameters of position orientation and others representing controller gains we need to determine each one on its own domain 6 2 1 thruster orientation thruster orientation is a design parameter that contains two sub parameters pitch angle θ i and yaw angle ψ i which were defined in section 4 2 these angles can variate within a π 2 π 2 interval the variation interval have been shortened since we consider the thruster capable of generating the same forces forward and backwards we can make these sub parameters dimensionless 39 o i θ i ψ i i r 1 1 2 θ i θ i π 2 ψ i ψ i π 2 the encoding of these sub parameters are made using 7 bits which allows us to identify 128 possible orientations for each angle as shown in fig 8 the encoding with a resolution of 0 79 of the range is a trade off between accuracy and time of calculation indeed a small resolution gives a good precision but also increases the search space m increasing the time necessary to solve the problem 6 2 2 control gains the control method uses two gains λ for kinematic layer and k p for the dynamic one for the implementation of the ga we have decided to limit the values of these two sub parameters to an interval 0 63 75 this choice was made based on previous knowledge about the values of λ and k p and because it is practical to encode each parameter with 8 bits which allow us discretizing the variation range in segments of 0 25 the definition of these two sub parameters is the following 40 g λ k p i r 0 63 75 6 2 3 tracking point position the tracking point is the point that the controller will steer to follow the desired trajectory typically it must be located within the boundaries of the robot cylinder plus its metallic frame because it should correspond to the position of one of the robot equipment imu sonar sensors or camera given that for some applications it is convenient to place e over the positive sector of x b here the tracking point position parameter contains only one coordinate expressed in the robot frame p e x 0 to encode this sub parameter we will use 5 bits which will allow us to obtain good precision resolution of 32 3 on each axis on the location of the tracking point mathematically this design parameters is defined as 41 p e x e i r 0 1 x e p e x l table 4 sums up the design parameters and their configuration 6 3 results we will apply our optimization algorithm to each one of the three phases of the mission in order to determine a suitable propulsive configuration and controller for these optimizations the evolution parameters were adopted according to methods defined in chocron 2000 to maintain good performances of the artificial evolution and are shown in table 5 6 3 1 seabed scanning in this part of the inspection mission the robot goes from idle or from a different mission to scanning the seabed in order to find the marine tidal turbine the scan phase also called survey mission consists of exhaustively sweeping an area until the robot is capable of determining were the target is located to perform such a task the robot needs to control its position in space surge sway and heave in addition the detection process could benefit from a stabilized roll motion so this degree of freedom will be also required although not included in the fitness calculation finally since this task usually involves going across great distances the robot must consume the least amount of energy possible despite the constraints imposed by the optimization problem only changing orientations and control parameters the algorithms finds a solution performing a fair trajectory control fig 10 the final fitness value is 35 52 as seen in fig 9 the ascension phase of the curve is fast in the beginning but it decelerates rapidly as well after one hundred generations the genetic algorithm keeps looking for suitable solutions but with a small pay off per generation however this small increment adds up to the evolution fitness and represents around 15 of the first stage fitness this behavior is expected since the genetic algorithm is trying to evolve very complex from the control point of view individuals fig 10 shows the simulation and the evolution of the kinematic error the complexity of the tasks is observed in the evolution of the error indeed we can see how despite being small throughout the simulation the error has strong variations during the turning phases of the task fig 11 shows the configuration of the robot we can see that thrusters one two and four are able to create yaw which is important to be able to steer the vehicle during the turning phases we see as well how surge is now created by thrusters two and four even if they are on the same side the yaw perturbation gets compensated by the orientation of thruster two additionally thruster three gets to act over y b in order to strengthen the lateral trajectory control all four thrusters have a component over z b allowing them to intervene in the control of heave and roll the lack of dedicated thrusters in order to fulfill this duty is due to the small control effort needed to correct these two degrees of freedom for this robot the position of e is not surprising the main movement of the robot is forward so the point e is expected to be located in the front of the robot this position takes advantage of the distance to the point of application of the propulsive forces i e thrusters to create an effective steering moment the ga has found a somehow loose kinematic gain λ 1 and a tighter control over the dynamic effects on the robot k p 1 5 fig 12 shows that as in the global optimization for this task all thrusters have a very active participation in the control of the vehicle indeed we can see how the thrust forces are constantly varying specially during the turning phase which creates a noticeable increment in the consumed power 6 3 2 diving after finding the location of the tidal turbine the robot needs to reach it to start the inspection to do so it will start a diving phase in which the main goal is to get closer to the target at a given relative position let say 1 m before it the diving task consists simply on following a descending straight line all the resources of the robot are devoted to correctly following this trajectory the task relies on the control of three degrees of freedom surge sway and heave knowing that the drag forces are greater while diving horizontally we will also ask the controller to keep a pitch angle equal to the diving angle since this could improve the overall performance of the robot however since we want to give the ga the freedom of choosing the diving method this factor will be controlled but not included in the performance and fitness calculation lastly the power consumption will also be included in the performance calculation fig 13 shows the fitness of the optimization despite the added difficulty of the problem recreating the same movements than before but with less parameters to modify we see that the algorithm does not take longer until it begins to consistently improve the individuals of the population simulation and the evolution of the kinematic error are shown in fig 14 from the kinematic error evolution we can note how the task is straightforwardly executed with minimal variations in the error after the desired trajectory is reached additionally we can also observe that this time the ga has found a solution using pitch during the diving in fig 15 we see the solution found by the ga the four degrees of freedom needed to perform this task are surge heave pitch and yaw from the figure we can deduce how the motions are created the surge and yaw motions are created mainly by thrusters one and four these thrusters take in charge the advancement and lateral correction of the trajectory of e for their part thrusters two and three are in charge of the remaining degrees of freedom heave and pitch following a similar arrangement as the other two actuators the inverted configuration of the thrusters gives stability while correctly controlling the degrees of freedom the point e is positioned in the front of the robot this gives thrusters one and four a better moment arm to create yaw this position also helps thrusters two and three creating pitch controller gains are λ 0 5 and k p 2 76 this means that the kinematic controller slowly reacts to the error but makes the dynamic controller rapidly compensating the dynamic effects thrust forces during the simulation and the evolution of the consumed power are shown in fig 16 we can see how the creation of pitch by thruster number two and heave by thruster number three are very demanding in terms of force indeed in order to create pitch thruster number two needs to fight against the restoring forces while thruster three needs to create the diving force thrusters one and four are used to give small lateral corrections on the trajectory 6 3 3 tomography in the last stage of the mission the robot arrives to the tidal turbine at this point it begins the phase of inspection of the energy generator in order to detect signs of deterioration it needs to turn around the turbine making sure that the camera is constantly pointing toward the center of the circle target position and its distance from the target is constant for this specific phase not only the position of the robot is important but also its yaw orientation ψ if the robot does not head toward the turbine the inspection could be unfruitful this is why we have added a term related to the yaw orientation of the robot in the fitness function now the performance of the robot will be calculated taking into account the position and yaw angle error of the robot mathematically it means that the objective function now will add a term with the normalized integration of the yaw angle 42 g x 0 t e k d t n e k i n 0 t e ψ d t n ψ 0 t p d t n e n e r g where e ψ is the yaw error and n ψ the normalizing factor this factor is calculated as the integral of the yaw error for a static robot starting position for the last part of the mission the rsm robot needs to adapt its thrusters to perform a task that as seen in the global evolution section involves mostly sway and yaw fig 17 shows the fitness throughout the evolution we can see how the ga smoothly converged to a solution despite the difficulty of the problem we can see that despite the new added constraint yaw angle error the algorithm effectively finds a suitable individual for this task however it is also true that this time the ascending phase of the best fitness curve has been enlarged with smaller increments per generation fig 18 shows a snapshot of the simulation and the evolution of the kinematic error as for the global optimization of this task the robot converges slowly but with a steady pace once the auv has reached the desired trajectory the kinematic and yaw errors remain small e k i n 0 1 m and e ψ 1 4 the configuration found by the ga is shown in fig 19 the necessary degrees of freedom to control in order to perform this trajectory are surge sway heave and yaw in the figure we see how all thrusters have a force component over the y b axis which is understandable since it is the main direction of the motion thrusters one and two are like in the rsm robot in charge of the yaw movements however we see that only thruster two contributes to the surge motion while thruster one generates heave and pitch for its part thruster three generates mainly a lateral force controlling sway lastly heave is generated by a composition of the forces over the z b from thrusters one and four the main movements being sway and yaw so the position of e was to be expected the position of the tracking point close to the r b origin favors the control over yaw it gives the thrusters in charge of this degree of freedom a long enough lever arm which is also short enough to limit the overshoot due to propeller dynamics the ga found a small kinematic gain λ 0 25 making the robot slowly converge to the task however it rapidly compensates the dynamic effects on the robot thanks to its dynamic gain value k p 9 28 fig 20 shows thruster forces and power consumption throughout the task as for the global optimization of this task the strong dynamic compensation of the controller demands full force from the thrusters voltage saturation on thruster three reaching the peak bollard thrust generating in the force peaks of short duration once the robot has reached the desired trajectory we see how thruster number three generates the higher force in order to move the auv laterally thruster number two is the second biggest force contributor taking in charge the creation of yaw thrusters one and four have a small contribution they are mostly in charge of controlling depth 6 4 discussion a power peak exists in all three phases beginnings and it is normal this is because we ask the controller to keep on with a speeding tracked trajectory point while the robot starts still no speed therefore the controller pushed the thrusters to maximum power or so until the auv tracking point catches up with the tracked point then it converges to the lower power required to keep the desired speed on the trajectory the configuration in the diving phase is not symmetric because the ga found that it was more profitable for fitness value to use more thrusters in the direction of diving towards auv bottom to fight the buoyancy force than in the forward direction in fact the buoyancy force is high compared to the hydrodynamic drag since the roll and pitch are mechanically stabilized it does not need to stabilize the roll and need to fight against the restoring moment pitch from a technological point of view dynamic configuration seems to be a promising approach indeed even if the performances of this approach are not outstanding mostly due to the fixed number of thrusters and position constraint the fact that they are technically feasible makes the dynamic configuration more useful in this section the rsm robot propulsion system with predefined thruster number and positions was optimized to follow three different tasks included in a robotic mission the three optimized configurations maximize the performance of the robot in each task a version of the rsm robot capable of dynamically changing its propulsive configuration vectorial thrusters would be able to achieve the three tasks in a row i e the mission with the best performance given the current state of thrust configuration technology this idea seems applicable in the medium term the advantages of dynamic configuration are clear it can make under actuated auvs capable of performing complex and demanding tasks in an optimal way enhancing the propulsive capabilities of these vehicles indeed auvs with dynamically reconfigurable thrusters using propulsion configurations determined by this method would be able to perform tasks with good trajectory tracking convergence and reduced power consumption this would result in improving auvs capabilities and therefore expanding their autonomy 7 conclusion the design of autonomous underwater vehicles supposes the definition of a myriad of design parameters said parameters must be selected and properly configured in order to obtain enhanced performance and autonomy a way of achieving autonomy in an auv is increasing its propulsive capabilities adapting the robot to the tasks it is expected to perform nowadays auvs are exposed to increasingly demanding tasks and missions far from the survey style missions that made these vehicles popular the new missions demand the auvs to have greater autonomy and efficiency most of auv design methods rely heavily on designers experience and rules of thumb taking well known designs and adopting classical approaches while capable of performing difficult tasks these robots are not optimized to perform these missions causing a decrease in their overall performance and autonomy also their efficiency is not as high as it could be using too many thrusters this work proposes a way of improving the design of auvs through the optimization of its propulsive configuration increasing their performances and therefore enhancing their autonomy indeed mission adapted propulsive configurations allow the auv performing otherwise difficult tasks making them less depending of human intervention the optimization technique used in this work uses an auv simulator in order to evaluate the candidate solutions this simulator contains the hydrodynamic model of the robot which includes rigid body dynamics and hydrodynamic effects such as added mass and damping the eauvive simulator also includes the electrodynamic model of a real thruster which parameters have been identified and validated using a test rig the approach presented in this work called dynamic configuration proposes to apply the optimization method to a robot in which the position of its thrusters are predefined restricting the ga possibilities of research by imposing some of the design parameters can result in less efficient topologies however as a compensation for the performance loss the found solutions are technically viable applying the dynamic configuration method with the same constrained parameters but for different tasks allows the auv designer to calculate the optimal topology configuration for each task with this information and taking into account the advances in reconfigurable thruster technology the creation of a dynamically reconfigurable robot is possible in a near future a robot designed using this technique could be optimally adapted to a mission including any number of different tasks future work should focus on the improvement of the genetic algorithm this can be done by increasing its efficiency using more advanced techniques or by narrowing down the search space based on previous experience this could allow expanding the number of design parameters without increasing the calculation time the genetic algorithm would benefit as well by using improved models in the control technique for instance including the thruster dynamics in computed torque method indeed a more precise definition of the hydrodynamic terms in the auv model and a fully dynamic model of the thrusters would help to reduce the reality gap making the solutions found by the optimization easier to apply in the real world lastly real experiments using the rsm robot with the found propulsive topologies should be carried out in order to validate and tune the solutions found by the artificial evolution 
23477,in this work a method for the dynamic reconfiguration of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs propulsion system is developed and tested in simulation global optimization is used to find suitable propulsive configurations and control parameters in order to achieve successive robotic tasks this is done using a genetic algorithm used here as a task based design method evaluation of the auv configuration is made using a dynamic simulation of the robot performing its mission involving a non linear control computed torque method the objective function minimizes the trajectory tracking error and the energy consumption the results of this optimization could be used as a preliminary design step for a specialized auv finding the fittest propulsive configuration here we propose the dynamic reconfiguration of a multitasking auv that adapts its propulsion configuration to the changing task specifications during its mission the method implementation is based on the dynamic model of an existing auv irdl rsm 4 fixed thrusters under actuated robot but searching for new thrusters directions and controller parameters to perform successive tasks graphical abstract image 1 keywords auv rov propulsion design autonomous underwater robots genetic algorithms task based design model based mobile robot control 1 introduction in the second half of the 20th century thanks to marine technology maturity marine robotics made its appearance in ocean exploration namely unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs started being developed and since then as noted in antonelli 2006 advancements in technology allowed to have a rapid progression in their capabilities nowadays uuvs have become increasingly prevalent and are used for scientific military and industrial purposes current uuvs capabilities allow to perform tasks not even imaginable fifty years ago see mcphail 2009 ribas et al 2015 and bruno et al 2015 a type of uuv used to perform missions without human intervention is called autonomous underwater vehicles auvs which after decades of development have proven the ability to achieve increasingly complex missions even if great advances have been accomplished in terms of autonomy nowadays auvs have reduced maneuverability as noted in djapic et al 2007 nguyen et al 2009 barngrover et al 2011 chen et al 2015 and li et al 2015 enhanced auv agility maneuverability and speed brings increased autonomy indeed current computing processing and sensor technologies allow implementing sophisticated model based control methods these advances added to developments in propulsion technology would increase auvs agility if coupled with efficient control in this work we focus on the design of propulsion system itself and its efficiency in order to achieve higher agility for autonomous vehicles we determine here the most suited propulsive configuration for a given task or subtask this search includes in part the topology orientation of the thrusters and the control system control gains and tracking point position but not the reconfigurable thrusters technology nor the issue of transition between configurations we call this technique dynamic reconfiguration of propulsion system since it can be operated in mission the method is applied here to a 4 thrusters auv namely rsm robot but is not limited to it vectored thrust technology is not discussed in this work but we have based our models and our method on real vector thrusters that can actually and independently orient their thrust hence their propeller as proposed in vega et al 2016 classical design consists in solving all sub system design problems independently in a preconceived order see d souza 1998 this method is not adapted for complex robotic systems where no definitive design method is proven we propose then to adopt a task based design method in order to drive the auv propulsion design process using evaluation from simulation including control taking into account the complexity of designing a robot propulsion it is clear that such a difficult task would greatly benefit from a computer based search method namely the design problem discussed in this research work can be formulated as a global optimization problem similarly as for kinematic design of robotic arms shown in chocron and bidaud 1997 our optimization problem is then the minimization of an objective function calculated taking into account the robot global performances while performing a mission in simulation giving the astronomical number of available possible solutions and the lack of uniformity in the design parameters we can not use classical optimization techniques gradient based search in order to solve this optimization problem we use evolutionary algorithms holland 1975 which operates the power of artificial evolution to find suitable solutions to our problem given that auvs have an on board power storage system it is important that improvements in agility do not increase power consumption beyond measure this trade off agility vs power efficiency will guide us during the optimization process based on their ease of use the simplicity of their implementation and their applicability genetic algorithms will be used to solve the design problem in this work indeed task based propulsive solutions will be created taking the auv design as an optimization solved with genetic algorithms as in chocron 2008 this work is organized in five additional sections prior to conclusion section 2 presents dynamic models of our reference rsm like auv rsm robot but with vectored thrusters and its propulsion systems section 3 proposes a nonlinear model based control method namely computed torque control section 4 deals with the thrust generation applied to any rsm like auv section 5 details our original application of genetic algorithms to the dynamic reconfiguration of auv propulsion problem section 6 shows the results of the genetic optimization applied to a three fold realistic mission consisting of a marine tidal turbine inspection 2 auv dynamics modeling in order to evaluate the pertinence of the found solutions the genetic algorithm needs an evaluation method in our case the evaluation will be done by dynamic simulation even if other methods exist see koos et al 2013 our choice is based on the fact that our simulator eauvive 1 1 enib auv in virtuo experiment irdl enib 2007 2017 introduced in vega et al 2014 even if approximated lacking of fluid mechanics and experimental validation of added mass terms offers an acceptable degree of relevancy considering our goal finding solutions that could aid to the design of underwater robots propulsion the eauvive simulator described in vega et al 2014 includes a model of the auv rigid body dynamics hydrodynamic effects a model based control method a thrust allocation method and a nonlinear model of the force generated by the thrusters 2 1 kinematic model to model the auv two orthogonal coordinate systems are used r 0 o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 is the earth fixed frame and r b o b x b y b z b is auv body fixed in fig 1 body fixed and earth fixed coordinate systems are shown together with a diagram of the auv the vectors describing the motion of the auv in 6 dof are 1 η η 1 η 2 η 1 x y z η 2 ϕ θ ψ ν ν 1 ν 2 ν 1 u v w ν 2 p q r τ τ 1 τ 2 τ 1 x y z τ 2 k m n here η is the vector of position and orientation in r 0 the orientation η 2 is defined using an euler zyx ψ θ ϕ convention as described in fossen 1994 ν is the linear and angular absolute velocity vector in r b τ is the external forces and moments vector in the body fixed frame which accounts for propulsion forces applied on the auv precisely this vector will allow modeling thrust forces from different propulsion architectures to change the auv velocity vector from one to another coordinate system we use a velocity transformation matrix as given in fossen 1994 2 j η 2 j 1 η 2 0 3 3 0 3 3 j 2 η 2 where 3 j 1 η

transformation matrix we can obtain the auv absolute velocity vector expressed in r 0 from its expression in r b see fossen 1994 4 η d η d t r 0 j η 2 ν 2 2 dynamic model the nonlinear rigid body dynamic equations of the underwater robot can be formulated as in antonelli 2006 and fossen 1994 5 m ν c ν d ν g τ where m i r 6 6 c i r 6 6 and d i r 6 6 are the matrices of mass coriolis and centripetal terms and damping respectively including added mass terms g is the vector of gravitational forces and moments lastly τ is the wrench of external forces and moments the wrench τ accounts for the propulsive forces generated by the thrusters it is calculated as follows 6 τ b p u p where b p is the thrust control matrix tcm which depends on the propulsive configuration number position and orientation of the actuators u p is the vector of the actuators forces i e thrust output these matrices are constructed using rigid body and hydrodynamic considerations the rigid body dynamic part is based on the fact that the underwater vehicle is nothing more than a solid so the well known rigid body dynamics applies given that these kind of vehicles operate solely under water we need to add a hydrodynamic component or layer to the dynamic model in order to completely describe the robot the hydrodynamic matrices described in this section account each one for a specific dynamic effect of the water over the robot said effects are added mass drag forces and gravitational forces and moments all of which are described as follows 2 3 rigid body and added mas dynamics during its motion underwater vehicles displace the water in its surroundings since the auv applies a force and a moment on the neighboring fluid reaction forces are applied to the auv see fossen 1994 we take into account this reactive force with the concept of added mass added mass is not a finite amount of fluid to add to the auv mass but a function of the robot geometry see antonelli 2006 and motion velocities the global mass matrix m in the general nonlinear dynamic model eq 5 accounts not only for the mass and inertia of the underwater robot but also for the added mass contribution namely 7 m m b m a where m b ℝ 6 6 is the mass matrix of the robot rigid body m b m i 3 3 m s p b g m s p b g ℑ with m mass of the auv i 3 3 3 3 identity matrix p b g position vector of auv cog in r b ℑ inertia matrix of auv in r b s x cross pre product matrix of x s p q r t 0 r q r 0 p q p 0 and m a ℝ 6 6 is the added mass contribution which can be defined in an abbreviated form fossen 1994 m a a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 where a 11 a 12 a 21 and a 22 ℝ 3 3 represent the added mass terms this matrix can be simplified for certain conditions and auv structures for a robot completely submerged in the water with a three plane of symmetry structure and working at low speed we can neglect the contribution of the non diagonal terms in m a 8 m a d i a g x u y v z w k p m q n r added mass also contributes with coriolis and centripetal terms in the general nonlinear dynamic equation eq 5 the coriolis and centripetal terms are included in the c matrix 9 c c b c a where c b ℝ 6 6 is the coriolis and centripetal matrix of the rigid body c b m s ν 2 m s ν 2 s p b g m s p b g s ν 2 s ℑ ν 2 and c a ℝ 6 6 is the contribution due to the added mass c a 0 3 3 s a 11 ν 1 a 12 ν 2 s a 11 ν 1 a 12 ν 2 s a 21 ν 1 a 22 ν 2 the general form of the added mass contribution to the coriolis and centripetal effects matrix can be simplified as follows for three planes of symmetry robots 10 c a 0 0 0 0 z w w y v v 0 0 0 z w w 0 x u u 0 0 0 y v v x u u 0 0 z w w y v v 0 n r r m q q z w w 0 x u u n r r 0 k p p y v v x u u 0 m q q k p p 0 2 4 drag forces matrix d ℝ 6 6 in the dynamic equation accounts for dissipative effects drag forces due to shape and friction and is called the damping matrix as for the added mass matrix we can make simplifications for three plane of symmetry structures which leads to neglect the contribution of the non diagonal terms giving the nature of dissipative effects this matrix is positive the cylindrical geometry of the auv allows to simplify the damping matrix only the linear and quadratic diagonal terms are considered in antonelli 2006 d ν 0 d d i a g x u y v z w k p m q n r d i a g x u u u y v v v z w w w k p p p m q q q n r r r furthermore another simplification can be made if we consider that the auv speed is high enough to neglect linear terms with respect to the quadratic ones see ferreira et al 2009 while the robot speed is very low none of

cylindrical hull will be used which is meant to approximate the shape of the rsm robot fig 2 an irdl 2 2 institut de recherche dupuy de lôme developed experimental platform this will allow calculating the added mass and damping terms using the simplifications proposed by fossen 1994 and antonelli 2006 the calculation of the hydrodynamic parameters and simplifications in the model for this vehicle are available in vega et al 2014 here we only present a summary of the parameters in tables 1 and 2 these values are used in the dynamic simulator introduced in sec 2 as well as in the controller see sec 3 3 model based nonlinear control after having modeled the robot the next steps in the study of the underwater vehicle are the control technique and the estimation methods used on it these are the key elements to simulate the behavior of the robot given that we have a very precise model of the robot it seems logical to make intensive use of it the chosen method is the computed torque or feedback linearization it is a nonlinear control method that explicitly uses the kinematic and dynamic models of the robot to cancel out the intrinsic nonlinearities this control method is broadly used to design feedback controllers for auvs see millán et al 2014 and yang et al 2013 it is also used to control robots with complicated mechanisms as seen in boyer et al 2006 the idea behind this method is to algebraically transform nonlinear systems into fully or partly linear ones so that simple linear control techniques can be applied the method straightforwardly computes the inverse kinematic and dynamic models of the robot the control is split in two layers kinematic and dynamic that are executed sequentially at each time step fig 3 this characteristic offers a clear view of the internal workings of the controller that allows us to draw conclusions about the controllability and learn about the robot in general 3 1 kinematic control the kinematic level is in charge of the calculation of the correct robot velocity ν in auv body fixed frame r b in order to make the tracking point e follow the reference trajectory η e d in the earth fixed frame r 0 the point e is an arbitrary point of the auv but since it has an impact on the controlability of the auv is will be part of the configuration optimization in sec 6 to calculate the kinematic control law we start with the velocities of the tracking point e 13 ν 1 e ν 1 ν 2 r e ν 2 e ν 2 in r b 14 η 1 e j 1 η 2 ν 1 e η 2 e j 2 η 2 ν 2 in r 0 where the position vector of e in r b is 15 r e ε x ε y ε z t indeed in eq 13 we calculate the velocity of e using rigid body kinematics we can re write eq 13 in the following way ν e ν 1 ν 2 r e ν 2 1 0 0 0 ε z ε y 0 1 0 ε z 0 ε x 0 0 1 ε y ε x 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 t u v w p q r ν from the previous equation we can see that matrix t is the link between the robot velocity and the tracking point one taking into account eq 16 we can turn eq 14 into 16 η e j η 2 ν e j η 2 t ν allowing us to determine the relation between the point e velocity η e and the robot velocity ν 17 ν t 1 j η 2 1 η e based on this relation and using the desired trajectory η e d and its derivative η e d we can develop the following kinematic velocity control law see alonge et al 2001 18 ν a d t 1 j 1 η e d λ e k i n with λ 0 the gain matrix of the proportional kinematic controller diagonal and e k i n η e d η e the kinematic position orientation error when the kinematic error e k i n is zero we see that eq 18 turns into eq 17 indeed when the controller manages to cancel the error the feedforward control alone drives the robot in order to continue in the tracked trajectory additionally if we replace ν in eq 16 for the expression of ν a d from eq 18 we obtain the following dynamic equation for the kinematic error 19 e k i n λ e k i n 0 which shows that the kinematic control law makes the robot converge exponentially toward the desired trajectory 3 2 dynamic control law obviously the desired velocity of the robot ν a d can not be correctly achieved with only kinematic control indeed the robot needs to fight against the dynamic effects acting on itself in order to precisely generate this velocity as seen in the previous section these dynamic effects are a consequence of the rigid body dynamics and caused by the water surrounding the vehicle the dynamic layer of the controller takes in charge the compensation of all the dynamic effects on the robot it generates the needed torque τ a that will make the auv body fixed frame r b to follow ν a d which via the kinematic control will lead the point e to follow the reference trajectory η e d in r 0 based on the dynamic model of the robot described before eq 5 the following dynamic acceleration control law is created in r b see alonge et al 2001 20 τ a m ν a d k p e d y n c ν ν d ν ν g with e d y n ν a d ν the dynamic error from the previous equation we see how all the terms of the dynamic model of the robot are present plus a proportional k p 0 term for error correction if applied the calculated torque τ a will compensate the hydrodynamic and rigid body dynamic effects on the robot and steer the velocity ν towards the desired velocity ν a d if we replace τ from eq 5 for its expression from eq 20 we obtain the dynamic equation for the dynamic error 21 e d y n k p e d y n 0 which shows that the non linearities compensation make the auv converge exponentially toward the desired robot velocity ν a d given that both e k i n and e d y n converge exponentially the controller as a whole kinematic and dynamic layers is able to make an arbitrary point of the auv to track a bounded space trajectory 4 thrust generation torque computation method is capable of calculating the needed τ a to apply on the robot in order to make the tracking point e follow a desired trajectory η e d however it has no information about how to create said wrench 4 1 thrust allocation in order to calculate the force on each thruster to generate τ a we use the thrust allocation method presented in fossen and johansen 2006 the thrust allocation method solves the following equation τ a b p u p where b p is the thrust configuration matrix tcm as seen in section 2 given τ a we can calculate the needed force on each thruster calculating 22 u ˆ p b p 1 τ a this equation is only valid if b p is a square matrix when this matrix is not square its pseudo inverse is used see siciliano bruno and khatib 2008 23 u ˆ p b p t b p 1 b p t τ a for m n under actuated 24 u ˆ p b p t b p b p t 1 τ a for m n redundant where m and n are the number of lines and columns of b p respectively eq 23 is used for the irdl enib under actuated rsm robot see fig 2 in vega et al 2015 a method to adapt this technique to different propulsive configurations different b p matrices is proposed this technique will be used here as well to apply the concepts discussed in this section to a specific robot which is presented in the next section the simulator needs to know the propulsive topology of the robot here we are going to focus on widely used fixed propulsion topology robots with this type of propulsion are powered by several thrusters placed and directed along different axes in order to combine their thrust and provide six or less actuated dof to the robot various architectures within this group can be found by the optimization process each one with advantages and drawbacks but they share the same principle which is multi directional propulsion based on thrust combination an example of this type of topology is the rsm robot which has a four thrusters fixed propulsive topology as shown in fig 4 two horizontal thrusters are placed at the rear of the auv and two vertical thrusters are centered symmetrically on the sides of the robot this configuration provides actuation over the following dof surge linear motion along the x b axis heave linear motion along the z b axis yaw rotation along the y b axis roll rotation along the x b axis conversely due to the location of the four thrusters the following dof can not be actuated pitch rotation along y b axis sway linear motion along y b axis roll and pitch motion are mechanically stabilized thanks to the relative position of the buoyancy and gravity centers the sway is not controlled nor stabilized thus free motion on y b axis drift is expected to occur the position of each thruster is given with regard to r b by the following vectors in meters based on a real auv p b 1 p 1 x p 1 y p 1 z 0 21 0 12 0 p b 2 p 2 x p 2 y p 2 z 0 21 0 12 0 p b 3 p 3 x p 3 y p 3 z 0 0 105 0 p b 4 p 4 x p 4 y p 4 z 0 0 105 0 the tcm can then be calculated as b p 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 p 3 y p 4 y p 1 z p 2 z p 3 x p 4 x p 1 y p 2 y 0 0 and taking into account the alignments b p 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 p 3 y p 4 y 0 0 0 0 p 1 y p 2 y 0 0 with the input thrust vector u p u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 where u 1 u 2 u 3 and u 4 are the four thruster propulsion forces even if it is extensively used and accepted among auv designers it is clear that this propulsive configuration is not optimally suited for every kind of mission in this work we will keep the rsm robot number of thrusters and positions and try to find the best fitted orientations in order to perform a specific set of tasks given that optimizing the orientation of the four thrusters of the rsm robot topology results in the modification of the b p matrix we need first to understand and define how the forces are represented in this matrix depending on the thruster orientation 4 2 thrust configuration matrix and under actuation the b p matrix is a key factor in the success of the controller it is in charge of determining how the τ a control wrench could be created obviously for a given τ a that the robot is not capable to generate the controller will not be able to make e converge toward the desired trajectory the thrust allocation method is the stage of the control wrench generation this means that even if the controller correctly calculates τ a a faulty thrust allocation can produce a failing control as seen in section 3 the thrust allocation method uses the inverse or pseudo inverse of the b p matrix in order to calculate the force that each thruster must generate this establishes a constraint on this matrix it must be invertible a non invertible matrix means that the robot is not capable of creating with its propulsive topology the demanded wrench τ a the b p matrix when multiplied by the u p vector must generate the elements of τ a needed to follow the trajectory if the product b p u p fails to do so the controller will not be able to achieve its mission as explained before this matrix represents the propulsive configuration of the robot each column corresponds to the contribution of a thruster to the creation of τ a the number of columns of this matrix is therefore the number of thrusters each thruster has its own coordinate frame r i p i x i y i z i the angles convention used to define the orientation of this frame with regard to r b is the same euler zyx convention as to define the orientation of r b with regard to r 0 in fossen 1994 this convention uses three successive rotations around successive axes ψ i around z b θ i around y b and ϕ i around x b the position of each thruster origin p i in r b is given by a vector p i b p i x p i y p i z t with these elements we can determine the homogeneous transformation matrix t i b 25 t b i c θ i c ψ i s ψ i c ϕ i c ψ i s θ i s ϕ i s ψ i s ϕ i c ψ i c ϕ i s θ i p i x c θ i s ψ i c ψ i c ϕ i s θ i s θ i s ψ i c ψ i s ϕ i s θ i s ψ i c ϕ i p i y s θ i c θ i s ϕ i c θ i c ϕ i p i z 0 0 0 1 where c and s represent trigonometric functions cos and sin respectively the force of each thruster follows by convention the x axis of its frame this means that when using the rotation matrix eq 25 to calculate the components of this force in r b only the first column of the rotation matrix is used the orientation of the thrust vector is then independent of ϕ i taking this into account each thruster is represented in b p as follows 26 x y z t b i u i 0 0 0 m n k p b i u i 0 0 27 x y z m n k τ a c θ i c ψ i c θ i s ψ i s θ i s θ i p i y c θ i s ψ i p i z c θ i c ψ i p i z s θ i p i x c θ i s ψ i p i x c θ i c ψ i p i y b p u i u p from the above equation we see that if for some reason one of the lines of the thrusters contributions is zero the propulsion system will not be able to actuate the corresponding degree of freedom such a situation may arise when the orientation of the thruster is orthogonal to the degree of freedom in question or when the moment arm is non existent the genetic algorithm will search among the possibilities given by the combination of orientation angles and will try to find an optimal way of generating the needed τ a 4 3 thruster model according to auv simulations including thrusters dynamics in vega et al 2014 we can conclude that the use of the thruster model in the simulation is useful in this situation indeed in a real vehicle the thrust generation process does not stop in thrust allocation the desired thrust has to be effectively generated by the actuators the process of thrust generation is shown in fig 5 as we can see the thrust allocation method calculates only the desired thrust on each actuator u ˆ p an open loop controller needs to be used in order to determine what is the voltage v to apply on each thruster after this step the calculated voltage is applied to the electrodynamic model of the thruster which gives us the response of this actuator u p the open loop controller and the electrodynamic model of the thruster are given next 4 3 1 open loop controller the hydrodynamic thruster model is as follows koh et al 2006 2002 28 u k t 0 ω k t ω ω where u is the thrust force and ω is the rotational velocity of the propeller shaft k t 0 and k t are propeller transient and stationary thrust coefficients the relation between the voltage v and the thrust force u is given by the motor electromechanical model adapted for propulsion 29 v r i l i κ ω u k m i where r is the motor wiring resistance l the inductance i the current κ the back emf or speed constant and k m is the modified motor constant related to thrust force considering only the steady state components of the model from eq 28 and eq 29 i 0 and ω 0 eq 28 and eq 29 can be reformulated as 30 v r i κ ω u k t ω ω combining equations 29 and 30 we obtain the thruster steady state model 31 v r k m u κ u k t eq 31 is used to calculate the thruster control input for a desired thrust u 4 3 2 thruster electro dynamical model the thrusters dc brushed motor can be mechanically modeled as follows 32 j m ω γ f γ l λ i where j m is the motor shaft inertia γ f is the resistive torque and γ l is the load torque κ and λ the torque constant are considered equal if expressed in si units the resistive torque can be calculated as 33 γ f k f v ω k f s ω ω with k f s and k f v the dry and viscous friction coefficients respectively the load torque can be calculated as in whitcomb and yoerger 1995 34 γ l k l ω ω where k l is the load coefficient using eq 29 and eq 32 we get an electro mechanical model of the thruster the state space system equations are ω i k f v j m λ j m κ l r l ω i 0 1 l v 1 j m k l ω ω k f s ω ω 0 this last set of equations are important since they allow calculating the propeller angular speed ω and thus the generated dynamical thrust u for the dynamic simulation to be able to apply the proposed models a further step is needed the thruster parameters identification 4 3 3 thrusters parameters our thruster model is the seabotix btd 150 and has been identified in vega et al 2014 electromechanical parameters of the brushed dc motor are identified by measuring motor voltage current and propeller angular speed these measurements took place outside the water in order to neglect the influence of the unknown resistive torque and to allow speed measurement all identified parameters are gathered in table 3 5 dynamic reconfiguration of propulsion an underwater robot regardless of its category is a complex system affected by various and heterogeneous parameters indeed a small change in these parameters can greatly influence the overall performance of the robot this is due to the strong nonlinearities in kinematic and dynamic auv models considering this the use of analytic or deductive methods to find appropriate parameters to create a suitable robot for a given task is hardly conceivable the global optimization of an underwater robot propulsion modifying for instance number position and orientation of thrusters could allow finding a suitable design for a given task however searching an optimal configuration for all mission tasks requirements could generate impractical solutions indeed the same robot performing several tasks in the same mission this would require finding a single propulsion topology suitable for a number of situations which seems unlikely the other option presented here is to reconfigure dynamically the robot which means that it will change its propulsion configuration during the mission according to changing task specifications nowadays reconfiguration of the thrust direction seems to be giving its first steps out of infancy as it can be seen in cavallo et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 jin et al 2014 xin et al 2013 and vega et al 2016 these technologies allow achieving greater maneuverability as needed for autonomous mobility unfortunately a complete reconfiguration of the propulsion system including the thrusters positions in the auv is not technologically feasible today taking into account these restrictions we perform the optimization in a more realistic scenario to achieve this we will look for solutions adapted to a multitasking mission but with neither changing thrusters positions nor by changing their number we keep the rsm robot main features that is to say 4 fixed thrusters only the thrusters orientation and control parameters will be optimized this approach is realistic because it can be implemented using vectorial thrusters such as the rmct studied in vega et al 2016 before applying genetic algorithms we explain here the principles of this stochastic optimization method and its adaptation to our specific problem 5 1 genetic algorithms ga principle being a type of evolutionary algorithms ga are based on the evolution theory of darwin genetic algorithms use emulated natural evolution mechanisms to evolve a population of individuals representing solutions of an optimization problem according to an objective function fitness as seen in goldberg 1989 a typical genetic algorithm follows these steps fig 6 1 a population of individuals is created this population can be created randomly or using previous information 2 the individuals of the population are evaluated and given a fitness according to their performance based on the objective function 3 using the fitness of each individual as genetic information genetic operators are applied to create new individuals a selection the best individuals best fitnesses are selected from the population to serve as reproducers this selection can be deterministic or partly stochastic b crossover two individuals parents mix their genes in order to create two new individuals children c mutation a change of value of the genes allele of the individuals is done the change from 0 to 1 or conversely is decided randomly each gene has a tiny probability of being mutated d population replacement the new generation created by the previous operators replaces completely the old generation completely or partially 4 go to step 2 if solutions are not yet satisfactory otherwise finish the algorithm 5 2 optimization problem our optimization problem create a suitable robot propulsion system capable of performing a given mission is not very well defined a mathematical and concise definition of our problem will allow correctly designing and implementing the genetic algorithm the controller calculates the force to generate on the thrusters of a specific robot in order to make it follow a desired trajectory we can also consider that a high level mission is a succession of properly tuned trajectories chained one after the other taking into account these two statements we can conclude that our controller by making the robot follow the desired trajectory also makes the robot comply with a given complex mission the optimal robot for the optimization problem must be the one that follows precisely the desired trajectory given to the controller this means that the distance from the tracking point to the desired trajectory must reach to zero and stay like that we can rephrase the last statement saying that the integral of the trajectory error must be as close to zero as possible moreover the thruster voltage is limited to a fixed value our optimization problem is then the minimization of an objective function under constraint defined as the integral of the kinematic error ε k i n of the controller this can be put mathematically as follows find x i r 1 1 2 n 3 x i r 1 1 2 n 3 g x g x v i 1 n v 0 with x the most suitable individual formed by 2 n 3 parameters its is searched in a discrete subspace of i r 1 1 2 n 3 g x the objective function to minimize defined as the integral of the kinematic error of the controller over the time of the mission v i thruster voltage saturation v 0 24 v as seen in the previous equation the number of parameters forming an individual can change each propeller has 2 parameters θ p i ψ p i defined with regard to the robot frame since the robot has only one main controller we have 3 parameters to optimize the parameters of the controller are 2 gains for the kinematic and dynamic control layers and a position coordinate x e for the position of the tracking point e the objective function g x is calculated here as the simple addition with equal weights of the normalized integral over time of the kinematic error e k i n position and the normalized energy consumption power p w over time 35 g x 0 t e k i n d t n e k i n 0 t p d t n e n e r g 0 with n e k i n and n e n e r g the normalizing factors corresponding to respectively the kinematic error integral and the energy consumption for primitive robots the first primitive robot is immobile and not using its thrusters dead auv so n e k i n is equal to the integral of the distance from the starting point to the tracked point depending on the trajectory 36 n e k i n 0 t m a x η e d t d t η e d t m a x with η e d the mean value of η e d over the task time t m a x n e n e r g uses the second primitive robot which feeds all its thrusters to the maximum power mad auv throughout the task time so its value is 37 n e n e r g 0 t m a x p m a x d t p m a x t m a x note that these robots are just imaginary and cannot be a solution in our problem because the controller will force the robot to move towards the trajectory in any case the fitness function based on eq 35 is then 38 f x 100 1 g x 5 3 mission the mission in question will be the inspection of a marine tidal current turbine the reason to chose such a mission is based on the fact that these devices in addition to their installation costs induce extra maintenance costs these turbines as with any other underwater structures installed at sea are exposed to aggressive degradation factors such as corrosion and bio fouling among others in order to verify the turbine condition divers check for signs of deterioration which increases maintenance time and cost based on the current trends for this type of operation the use of underwater robots seems appropriate and inevitable obviously given the complexity of this mission a good control performance is required to avoid nearby obstacles since tidal turbines are always close to the coastline in our work the mission performance comes as a compromise between trajectory control accuracy and energy efficiency the marine tidal turbine inspection mission fig 7 can be divided in three phases scanning of the seabed for the turbine after activating this phase the robot follows a survey trajectory in order to find the position of the tidal turbine by scanning the seabed the underwater vehicle can use multi beam sonar information to scan the seabed from near surface depth until it detects the wanted target diving toward the turbine once the robot has found its target it starts a diving phase in this phase the robot will try to approach but not too close the turbine as fast as possible trying to minimize the energy consumption at the same time tomography inspection of the tidal turbine when the robot reaches its target it starts the inspection of the energy generator this phase is usually executed using a camera to record images of the turbine from all azimuths in order to correctly capture images the robot needs to encircle the device ensuring that it keeps a constant distance from the target and its x b axis always points the center of the circle 6 genetic optimization application 6 1 design parameters this optimization focuses on specific design elements of an auv linked to propulsion and control namely propulsion parameters thruster orientation θ i ψ i controller parameters tracking point p e x control gains λ k p where i 1 4 represents the i t h thruster in the propulsion topology 6 1 1 propulsion parameters propulsion parameters have a deep influence on the operation of underwater robots the propulsion parameters listed above will determine the controllability of the underwater vehicle indeed as seen in section 3 each new propeller will contribute to the robot controllability with a propulsive wrench the wrench contribution depends for this optimization on the orientation of the thruster since these parameters will dictate what dof will be actuated by the thruster if the thrusters of the robot are misdirected the creation of the propulsive wrench will not be optimal a defective propulsion topology needs to generate a greater propulsive wrench in order to follow a defined trajectory since our simulation saturates the force on the thrusters by using the electro dynamical thruster model with bounded voltage a poorly configured robot could not be as effective to follow said trajectory than a properly configured one this will translate on bigger tracking errors and energy consumption throughout the evaluation 6 1 2 controller parameters controller parameters also play an important role on the performance of the robot these parameters have to be precisely tuned in order to make the robot efficiently follow the desired trajectory the first parameter the tracking point e intervenes in the kinematic part of the controller since ultimately it is the tracking point that follows the desired trajectory its position will determine the convergence seed indeed a tracking point far from the origin of the mobile frame will need less thrust power to correct its trajectory this is due to the fact that small changes on the robot angular velocity result in big changes on the tracking point linear velocities the position of this point relatively to the robot may be dictated as well by the task itself lastly the gain parameters of both the kinematic and dynamic control layers will also influence the robot ability to follow the desired trajectory a fine tuning of these values is necessary to obtain a rapid and efficient convergence to the reference trajectory on one hand both gains need to be sufficiently large to guarantee a rapid convergence to the followed path on the other hand the kinematic gain also needs to be small enough to create a reachable reference velocity for the dynamic control layer because of acceleration limitations moreover the dynamic gain must be small enough to avoid creating chattering on the propellers input added by the dynamic controller correction 6 2 representation of solutions to properly implement the genetic algorithm we need to precisely define the design parameters these parameters are the building blocks used by the genetic algorithm to find adequate solutions to our problem and they will become the solution at the end of the evolution process the parameters being of different nature we have parameters of position orientation and others representing controller gains we need to determine each one on its own domain 6 2 1 thruster orientation thruster orientation is a design parameter that contains two sub parameters pitch angle θ i and yaw angle ψ i which were defined in section 4 2 these angles can variate within a π 2 π 2 interval the variation interval have been shortened since we consider the thruster capable of generating the same forces forward and backwards we can make these sub parameters dimensionless 39 o i θ i ψ i i r 1 1 2 θ i θ i π 2 ψ i ψ i π 2 the encoding of these sub parameters are made using 7 bits which allows us to identify 128 possible orientations for each angle as shown in fig 8 the encoding with a resolution of 0 79 of the range is a trade off between accuracy and time of calculation indeed a small resolution gives a good precision but also increases the search space m increasing the time necessary to solve the problem 6 2 2 control gains the control method uses two gains λ for kinematic layer and k p for the dynamic one for the implementation of the ga we have decided to limit the values of these two sub parameters to an interval 0 63 75 this choice was made based on previous knowledge about the values of λ and k p and because it is practical to encode each parameter with 8 bits which allow us discretizing the variation range in segments of 0 25 the definition of these two sub parameters is the following 40 g λ k p i r 0 63 75 6 2 3 tracking point position the tracking point is the point that the controller will steer to follow the desired trajectory typically it must be located within the boundaries of the robot cylinder plus its metallic frame because it should correspond to the position of one of the robot equipment imu sonar sensors or camera given that for some applications it is convenient to place e over the positive sector of x b here the tracking point position parameter contains only one coordinate expressed in the robot frame p e x 0 to encode this sub parameter we will use 5 bits which will allow us to obtain good precision resolution of 32 3 on each axis on the location of the tracking point mathematically this design parameters is defined as 41 p e x e i r 0 1 x e p e x l table 4 sums up the design parameters and their configuration 6 3 results we will apply our optimization algorithm to each one of the three phases of the mission in order to determine a suitable propulsive configuration and controller for these optimizations the evolution parameters were adopted according to methods defined in chocron 2000 to maintain good performances of the artificial evolution and are shown in table 5 6 3 1 seabed scanning in this part of the inspection mission the robot goes from idle or from a different mission to scanning the seabed in order to find the marine tidal turbine the scan phase also called survey mission consists of exhaustively sweeping an area until the robot is capable of determining were the target is located to perform such a task the robot needs to control its position in space surge sway and heave in addition the detection process could benefit from a stabilized roll motion so this degree of freedom will be also required although not included in the fitness calculation finally since this task usually involves going across great distances the robot must consume the least amount of energy possible despite the constraints imposed by the optimization problem only changing orientations and control parameters the algorithms finds a solution performing a fair trajectory control fig 10 the final fitness value is 35 52 as seen in fig 9 the ascension phase of the curve is fast in the beginning but it decelerates rapidly as well after one hundred generations the genetic algorithm keeps looking for suitable solutions but with a small pay off per generation however this small increment adds up to the evolution fitness and represents around 15 of the first stage fitness this behavior is expected since the genetic algorithm is trying to evolve very complex from the control point of view individuals fig 10 shows the simulation and the evolution of the kinematic error the complexity of the tasks is observed in the evolution of the error indeed we can see how despite being small throughout the simulation the error has strong variations during the turning phases of the task fig 11 shows the configuration of the robot we can see that thrusters one two and four are able to create yaw which is important to be able to steer the vehicle during the turning phases we see as well how surge is now created by thrusters two and four even if they are on the same side the yaw perturbation gets compensated by the orientation of thruster two additionally thruster three gets to act over y b in order to strengthen the lateral trajectory control all four thrusters have a component over z b allowing them to intervene in the control of heave and roll the lack of dedicated thrusters in order to fulfill this duty is due to the small control effort needed to correct these two degrees of freedom for this robot the position of e is not surprising the main movement of the robot is forward so the point e is expected to be located in the front of the robot this position takes advantage of the distance to the point of application of the propulsive forces i e thrusters to create an effective steering moment the ga has found a somehow loose kinematic gain λ 1 and a tighter control over the dynamic effects on the robot k p 1 5 fig 12 shows that as in the global optimization for this task all thrusters have a very active participation in the control of the vehicle indeed we can see how the thrust forces are constantly varying specially during the turning phase which creates a noticeable increment in the consumed power 6 3 2 diving after finding the location of the tidal turbine the robot needs to reach it to start the inspection to do so it will start a diving phase in which the main goal is to get closer to the target at a given relative position let say 1 m before it the diving task consists simply on following a descending straight line all the resources of the robot are devoted to correctly following this trajectory the task relies on the control of three degrees of freedom surge sway and heave knowing that the drag forces are greater while diving horizontally we will also ask the controller to keep a pitch angle equal to the diving angle since this could improve the overall performance of the robot however since we want to give the ga the freedom of choosing the diving method this factor will be controlled but not included in the performance and fitness calculation lastly the power consumption will also be included in the performance calculation fig 13 shows the fitness of the optimization despite the added difficulty of the problem recreating the same movements than before but with less parameters to modify we see that the algorithm does not take longer until it begins to consistently improve the individuals of the population simulation and the evolution of the kinematic error are shown in fig 14 from the kinematic error evolution we can note how the task is straightforwardly executed with minimal variations in the error after the desired trajectory is reached additionally we can also observe that this time the ga has found a solution using pitch during the diving in fig 15 we see the solution found by the ga the four degrees of freedom needed to perform this task are surge heave pitch and yaw from the figure we can deduce how the motions are created the surge and yaw motions are created mainly by thrusters one and four these thrusters take in charge the advancement and lateral correction of the trajectory of e for their part thrusters two and three are in charge of the remaining degrees of freedom heave and pitch following a similar arrangement as the other two actuators the inverted configuration of the thrusters gives stability while correctly controlling the degrees of freedom the point e is positioned in the front of the robot this gives thrusters one and four a better moment arm to create yaw this position also helps thrusters two and three creating pitch controller gains are λ 0 5 and k p 2 76 this means that the kinematic controller slowly reacts to the error but makes the dynamic controller rapidly compensating the dynamic effects thrust forces during the simulation and the evolution of the consumed power are shown in fig 16 we can see how the creation of pitch by thruster number two and heave by thruster number three are very demanding in terms of force indeed in order to create pitch thruster number two needs to fight against the restoring forces while thruster three needs to create the diving force thrusters one and four are used to give small lateral corrections on the trajectory 6 3 3 tomography in the last stage of the mission the robot arrives to the tidal turbine at this point it begins the phase of inspection of the energy generator in order to detect signs of deterioration it needs to turn around the turbine making sure that the camera is constantly pointing toward the center of the circle target position and its distance from the target is constant for this specific phase not only the position of the robot is important but also its yaw orientation ψ if the robot does not head toward the turbine the inspection could be unfruitful this is why we have added a term related to the yaw orientation of the robot in the fitness function now the performance of the robot will be calculated taking into account the position and yaw angle error of the robot mathematically it means that the objective function now will add a term with the normalized integration of the yaw angle 42 g x 0 t e k d t n e k i n 0 t e ψ d t n ψ 0 t p d t n e n e r g where e ψ is the yaw error and n ψ the normalizing factor this factor is calculated as the integral of the yaw error for a static robot starting position for the last part of the mission the rsm robot needs to adapt its thrusters to perform a task that as seen in the global evolution section involves mostly sway and yaw fig 17 shows the fitness throughout the evolution we can see how the ga smoothly converged to a solution despite the difficulty of the problem we can see that despite the new added constraint yaw angle error the algorithm effectively finds a suitable individual for this task however it is also true that this time the ascending phase of the best fitness curve has been enlarged with smaller increments per generation fig 18 shows a snapshot of the simulation and the evolution of the kinematic error as for the global optimization of this task the robot converges slowly but with a steady pace once the auv has reached the desired trajectory the kinematic and yaw errors remain small e k i n 0 1 m and e ψ 1 4 the configuration found by the ga is shown in fig 19 the necessary degrees of freedom to control in order to perform this trajectory are surge sway heave and yaw in the figure we see how all thrusters have a force component over the y b axis which is understandable since it is the main direction of the motion thrusters one and two are like in the rsm robot in charge of the yaw movements however we see that only thruster two contributes to the surge motion while thruster one generates heave and pitch for its part thruster three generates mainly a lateral force controlling sway lastly heave is generated by a composition of the forces over the z b from thrusters one and four the main movements being sway and yaw so the position of e was to be expected the position of the tracking point close to the r b origin favors the control over yaw it gives the thrusters in charge of this degree of freedom a long enough lever arm which is also short enough to limit the overshoot due to propeller dynamics the ga found a small kinematic gain λ 0 25 making the robot slowly converge to the task however it rapidly compensates the dynamic effects on the robot thanks to its dynamic gain value k p 9 28 fig 20 shows thruster forces and power consumption throughout the task as for the global optimization of this task the strong dynamic compensation of the controller demands full force from the thrusters voltage saturation on thruster three reaching the peak bollard thrust generating in the force peaks of short duration once the robot has reached the desired trajectory we see how thruster number three generates the higher force in order to move the auv laterally thruster number two is the second biggest force contributor taking in charge the creation of yaw thrusters one and four have a small contribution they are mostly in charge of controlling depth 6 4 discussion a power peak exists in all three phases beginnings and it is normal this is because we ask the controller to keep on with a speeding tracked trajectory point while the robot starts still no speed therefore the controller pushed the thrusters to maximum power or so until the auv tracking point catches up with the tracked point then it converges to the lower power required to keep the desired speed on the trajectory the configuration in the diving phase is not symmetric because the ga found that it was more profitable for fitness value to use more thrusters in the direction of diving towards auv bottom to fight the buoyancy force than in the forward direction in fact the buoyancy force is high compared to the hydrodynamic drag since the roll and pitch are mechanically stabilized it does not need to stabilize the roll and need to fight against the restoring moment pitch from a technological point of view dynamic configuration seems to be a promising approach indeed even if the performances of this approach are not outstanding mostly due to the fixed number of thrusters and position constraint the fact that they are technically feasible makes the dynamic configuration more useful in this section the rsm robot propulsion system with predefined thruster number and positions was optimized to follow three different tasks included in a robotic mission the three optimized configurations maximize the performance of the robot in each task a version of the rsm robot capable of dynamically changing its propulsive configuration vectorial thrusters would be able to achieve the three tasks in a row i e the mission with the best performance given the current state of thrust configuration technology this idea seems applicable in the medium term the advantages of dynamic configuration are clear it can make under actuated auvs capable of performing complex and demanding tasks in an optimal way enhancing the propulsive capabilities of these vehicles indeed auvs with dynamically reconfigurable thrusters using propulsion configurations determined by this method would be able to perform tasks with good trajectory tracking convergence and reduced power consumption this would result in improving auvs capabilities and therefore expanding their autonomy 7 conclusion the design of autonomous underwater vehicles supposes the definition of a myriad of design parameters said parameters must be selected and properly configured in order to obtain enhanced performance and autonomy a way of achieving autonomy in an auv is increasing its propulsive capabilities adapting the robot to the tasks it is expected to perform nowadays auvs are exposed to increasingly demanding tasks and missions far from the survey style missions that made these vehicles popular the new missions demand the auvs to have greater autonomy and efficiency most of auv design methods rely heavily on designers experience and rules of thumb taking well known designs and adopting classical approaches while capable of performing difficult tasks these robots are not optimized to perform these missions causing a decrease in their overall performance and autonomy also their efficiency is not as high as it could be using too many thrusters this work proposes a way of improving the design of auvs through the optimization of its propulsive configuration increasing their performances and therefore enhancing their autonomy indeed mission adapted propulsive configurations allow the auv performing otherwise difficult tasks making them less depending of human intervention the optimization technique used in this work uses an auv simulator in order to evaluate the candidate solutions this simulator contains the hydrodynamic model of the robot which includes rigid body dynamics and hydrodynamic effects such as added mass and damping the eauvive simulator also includes the electrodynamic model of a real thruster which parameters have been identified and validated using a test rig the approach presented in this work called dynamic configuration proposes to apply the optimization method to a robot in which the position of its thrusters are predefined restricting the ga possibilities of research by imposing some of the design parameters can result in less efficient topologies however as a compensation for the performance loss the found solutions are technically viable applying the dynamic configuration method with the same constrained parameters but for different tasks allows the auv designer to calculate the optimal topology configuration for each task with this information and taking into account the advances in reconfigurable thruster technology the creation of a dynamically reconfigurable robot is possible in a near future a robot designed using this technique could be optimally adapted to a mission including any number of different tasks future work should focus on the improvement of the genetic algorithm this can be done by increasing its efficiency using more advanced techniques or by narrowing down the search space based on previous experience this could allow expanding the number of design parameters without increasing the calculation time the genetic algorithm would benefit as well by using improved models in the control technique for instance including the thruster dynamics in computed torque method indeed a more precise definition of the hydrodynamic terms in the auv model and a fully dynamic model of the thrusters would help to reduce the reality gap making the solutions found by the optimization easier to apply in the real world lastly real experiments using the rsm robot with the found propulsive topologies should be carried out in order to validate and tune the solutions found by the artificial evolution 
23478,exact calculation of stiffness matrix of tlp is important for investigation of its behavior in intact and tendon damage conditions and it is necessary to design a reliable tlp a serious attention has been concentrated on this problem in api rp 2t and various aspects of that such as dynamic and static behavior of tlp tendon tensions after one tether failure also it has introduced safety factors in different loads and healthy conditions this paper deals with effect of damage tendon condition of tlp on behavior and tensions of tendons in wave frequency range equilibrium of tlp is studied and stiffness matrix of tlp is derived in tendon damage condition wave loads and hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated by boundary element method then motion equations are solved for 48 load and healthy conditions and wave frequency portion of tensions and motions are extracted from time history of them it is shown that although damage tendon condition has no extreme influence on response amplitude magnification it has a relatively major effect on tension of tendons which are close to failed tendon in addition roll and pitch magnifications have major effect on increase in tension of tendons also it is seen that critical wave heading occurs in direction of diagonal of group of failed tendon keywords tlp tendon damage condition tendon 1 introduction tlp is a floating platform which is moored to the seabed by tendons this platform consisted of buoyant hull deck and mooring system buoyant hull sustains deck sufficiently above water level and anchored to the seabed by a complex mooring system buoyancy of tlp is more than weight therefore it needs stiff and strong pre tensioned tendons to support additional buoyancy tendons mostly connect hull to the seabed by suction anchors although tendon mooring system allows lateral wave wind and current loads to move platform compliantly it keeps that strongly restricted vertically therefore it has high stability and is a good alternative for the deep seas damage condition is an important analysis case that must be took into account in design process there are general three damage types that can be occurred for hull and mooring system in various scenarios the general first damage type is flooding of tanks and then sinking of platform that can be occurred due to ship collision the second damage type is a structural damage without any flooding that can be occurred by an explosion or hurricane and the third damage type is mooring or tether system failure that can be occurred by a hurricane or fatigue the damage types are shown schematically in fig 1 moan 2004 as mentioned in api rp 2t environmental actions such as wave wind current and tide cause steady and unsteady loads and hence responses of tlp performance of several subsystems including foundations tendons risers hull and deck equipment must be investigated in both normal and extreme environmental conditions normal environmental conditions frequently occur in the floater service life and construction period whereas extreme environmental conditions has low probability of occurrence in service life all key subsystems such as mooring system must withstand in this condition api rp 2t 2010 extreme responses are considered to be those responses that are commonly produced by extreme environmental condition they generally include maximum surge sway and yaw offset minimum and maximum tendon tension ringing springing etc api rp 2t 2010 the tendon axial tension arises from pretension wave frequency difference frequency and sum frequency motions of tlp wave drift and wind induced offset wave and or ice impact on hull ringing and springing current drag on tendon viv foundation mispositioning etc maximum and minimum tension may be estimated as superposition of all tension components induced by various phenomena loss of tendon tension could result in tendon buckling and or damage to flex elements loading condition for tendon design includes extreme events survival condition normal condition installation duration seismic condition and damage condition last loading condition addresses tendon damage and compartment flooding missing a tendon can cause increase in static tension of remaining tendon and dynamic one too flooding one or more compartments may lead to tension reduction even below minimum allowable tension reliability of floater must be analyzed both in intact and damaged condition these analyses help designers to understand degree of reliability in intact and various damage scenarios theses analyses can help assess different degree of reliability of mooring system among designs utilizing different numbers of tendons different types of connectors such as threaded welded and merlin connectors and or end terminations etc stability is one of major parts in tlp design criteria schedule of api rp 2t stability of floater in case of damage condition must be satisfied in addition of free floating inplace and intact condition flooding of a compartment below water line or tendon damage must be analyzed in damage condition stability tendon may be failed because of buckling in tension and compression low and high cycle fatigue and extreme tensions in storms there are 12 recommended load cases for in place condition in api rp 2t that 4 of these are for damaged condition and 2 are for tendon removed planned condition api rp 2t 2010 tendon removal must be considered in mooring system design tendons might be permanently install or be removable stress change must be in an acceptable range if one tendon is removed a tendon has certain design life that must be match with platform design life some factors affect tendon design life such as initial tendon cost the cost of tendon replacement tendon in place inspect ability and the risks associated with tendon retrieval and reinstallation several design requirements should be met during design process initial tendon design containing pretension response analysis tendon bending load and response calculation minimum tension calculation initial stress analysis containing check of preliminary maximum stress level fatigue life and hydrostatic local buckling floater offsets and tendon displacement margins and fatigue life calculation are some design quantities in tendon design process bachynski and moan bachynski and moan 2012 made effort to optimize design of a tensioned leg platform wind turbine tlpwt to minimize fatigue damage and hence extend fatigue life time they focused on pitch motion of tlpwt and investigated ratio of standard deviation of some parameters such as tension of legs pitch motion base moment and surge motion to assess fatigue behavior of floater yan et al gongwei et al 2009 solved nonlinear dynamic equation of motion of tendon subjected to current field and floater motions their study contained effect of tendon pretension on viv behavior of that a finite element code was developed to model nonlinear tendon the cfd program fluent was used to solve 2d modeling of fluid move around tendon tao and jun tao and jun 2006 investigated hydrodynamic aspects of tendon design such as mathieu instability ringing and springing bottom tension slacking and vortex induced vibrations and then coupled hull tendon riser dynamic analysis of tlp in this study a fem approach is used to analyze tendons and risers and eventually they carried out an experimental study to verify viv calculations kim and zhang kim and zhang 2009 had a concentrate look on dynamic stability and survivability of a damaged tlp in moderate hurricane condition when one or more tendons are failed they developed a be fem computer code to model coupled dynamic behavior of hull tendon riser in time domain as shown in their study snap like transient effect of tendon disconnection cause significant increase in neighboring tendon tension and may lead to general failure of system because of continuous failure of tendons tabeshpour et al tabeshpour et al 2006 had a comprehensive interpretation on responses of tlp in random sea according to environmental and structural characteristics they had a brief review on hydrodynamic loadings based on morison equation and effective parameters in equations of motions they took into account nonlinearities in these equations and time and frequency domain behavior of particular tlp subjected to irregular wave loading was interpreted comprehensively geometrical nonlinearities of mooring system were considered also second order hydrodynamic effects such as difference and sum frequency effects were considered because of using morison equation in calculating wave loads tabeshpour and malayjerdi tabeshpour and malayjerdi 2016 took a precise look on pitch motion portion in vertical displacement of tlp columns and then tendon tension they carried out both frequency and time domain analyses and concluded that pitch motion can affect tendon tension severely in some wave periods they represented the rao of heave and pitch of platform and vertical motion of tendon top end and discussed about pitch portion in that senjanović et al senjanović et al 2013 represented a new formulation for stiffness of surge sway and yaw motions they developed formulations by both static force equilibrium and energy balance approaches for large and small surge sway and yaw degrees of freedom they compared the results by fem analysis and a good agreement has been seen with those results only diagonal elements of stiffness matrix of horizontal plane motions are extracted in this study malayjerdi and tabeshpour malayjerdi and tabeshpour 2016 investigated rao of diffraction and froude krylov forces that are induced by wave and studied theory behind them three wave period range is specified and importance of each force components are discussed phase lag between diffraction and froude krylov forces is considered in determining total wave force on issc tlp all forces are determined in all degrees of freedom expect yaw motion yang and kim 2010 reported the results of a research about tendon disconnection effect on tlp response and tension of tendons and risers an expanded tlp etlp with coupled tendons and risers was studied in their research first and second order diffraction wave loads and morison viscous forces on hull have been considered added mass matrix of infinite frequency been added with mass matrix and radiation damping loads are applied tendons and risers are modeled using finite element method and morison inertia and viscous forces are considered in analysis they developed a software based on fully nonlinear equation of motion of tlp and tendons providing time history of motions and tension of tendons and risers also top disconnection or bottom unlatches effect studied in their research mansour et al mansour et al 2006 were analyses survivability of typical tlp in gom against 100 1 000 and 10 000 years return period hurricanes in case of intact tendon removed and tendon breakage also they investigated effect of column spacing on tension of tendons barranco et al barranco et al 2008 represent a reliability based methodology to perform a lrfd criterion for the design of tendon of tlp the proposed design criterion considers the ultimate limit state uls for the tendon sections expressed in terms of the expected value of the extreme interaction ratio considering long term storm sea states and takes into account the dynamic load effects interaction and the statistics of its associated extreme response morandi et al morandi et al 2004 took a look on tlp tendon tension during lili hurricane it was 2002 and hit several offshore units near track one of them was a tlp that there is a sufficient measurement of wind motion and tendon tension from that time and frequency analyses performed on tension sensor data and in service behavior compared with design situation other relevant comparisons included natural period and damping estimates moan and amdahl moan and amdahl 1989 were investigated catastrophic failure modes of marine structures including progressive failure sinking and capsizing also they described probabilistic and mechanical aspects of failure modes in case of tension leg platforms they mentioned to tendon progressive failure as one of catastrophic failure modes even tlp is stable in free floating condition mansour et al mansour et al 2013 were investigated survivability of an installed tlp in offshore western australia against progressive failure of tendons and foundation in harsh environment they carried out an experimental model test in addition of numerical simulation tendons were broken progressively and tlp became float finally behavior of tlp and tensions in tendons were investigated during progressive events all offshore structures are designed based on specific probability of failure considering various source of uncertainties one may consider acceptable increase of probability of failure in tendon damage condition ten times probability of failure in intact condition based on engineering judgment it is important to know do the responses and tensions oversteps this margin in various load cases after one tendon damage or not there is no worry if these are below or a bit more than considered safe margin and it is worrying event if these are considerably above safe margin in this paper influences of disconnection of one tendon on response of motions and tension of tendons in wave frequency range are investigated and they are compared to intact condition equilibrium of tlp in tendon damage condition has been studied and static offsets estimated in addition since stiffness matrix play a key role in behavior of tlp it is derived when one tether is disconnected and compared with intact condition then motion equations are solved and response of surge heave and pitch motions obtained for 48 load conditions that are combination of various healthy condition regular wave periods and wave headings steady state wave frequency portion of motions of tlp is extracted from time history of that in intact and tendon damage

displacement vector of tlp 2 equilibrium of tlp tendon damage condition 2 1 heave equilibrium equilibrium of tlp for on site condition with tendon legs system connected is not governed by a metacentric approach the equilibrium is typically provided by the pretension and stiffness of the mooring system rather than by water plan area and moments fig 2 shows tlp plan and its tendons in intact and damaged conditions it can be seen that lateral load enforce tlp to offsets in x y and θ z in order to equilibrium after tendon disconnection it is noted that the most important offsets occur in soft degrees of freedom assuming no angular offsets generally disconnection of tendon causes draft and buoyancy reduction δ b and tension in rest of tendons t a equally increases due to increase of tension of tendon elongation in tendon δ z b occurs equations of vertical equilibrium are as follow xu 2009 1 t a t 0 δ t δ b n t n d 2 t 0 b w n t 3 δ t k δ z b t 0 n t n d 4 δ b ρ g a w δ z b 5 δ z b t 0 k n t n d where t a will be defined later t 0 is pretension of tendon in intact condition δ t represents the additional tension applied to a tendon related to the additional elongation k e a t l is axial stiffness of tendon that a t is cross section area of tendon l is length of tendon a w is water plane area n t is total number of tendons in intact condition n d is number of damaged tendons and w is weight of tlp equation 4 buoyancy reduction of tlp and can be rewritten as follow 6 δ b ρ g a w t 0 k n t n d then using equations 1 3 and 6 t a is calculated as follows 7 t a t 0 1 1 n t n d ρ g a w k n t n d 2 it is necessary to mention that effect of buoyance reduction is negligible because of low ratio of hydrostatic stiffness to tendon stiffness and inverse relation of square of number remaining tendons with buoyancy loss generally it s effect is less than 0 1 percent if one tendon is failed 2 2 vertical plan angular equilibrium around neutral axis tlp will rise up and rotate after tendon disconnection but these are not sensible because of very small elongation of tendons when transient vibrations finished tlp rests in equilibrium condition in calm water we can assume that tlp is raised up at first and then rotate platform rise up was studied in previous section and rotation will be discussed in this section when a tendon from group no 4 is damaged the platform will be inclined around neutral axis fig 3 neutral axis is a set of points that are not affected by tendon remove inclination and keep their vertical position after that so tlp inclination will affect tendon groups no 4 and no 1 considerably and tendon groups no 3 and no 2 much lesser since these are close to inclination neutral axis assuming tendon groups no 2 and no 1 on neutral axis moment and tension equilibrium equations for mooring system with 12 tendons can be written as follows 8 3 n d δ t 4 3 δ t 1 0 9 2 p 2 3 n d δ t 4 2 p 2 3 δ t 1 2 p 2 n d t a where we assume that the tlp is a square and p is column spacing of tlp and δ t 4 and δ t 1 are the change in tension of tendon groups 4 and 1 from t a respectively and expressed as follow 10 δ t 4 n d t a 2 3 n d δ t 1 n d t a 6 according to 10 and considering axial stiffness of tendon k inclination angle θ i n c and trim and heel angles θ t r i m θ h e e l can be derived as 11 fig 4 11 θ i n c n d t a 1 2 3 n d k 1 6 k 2 p θ t r i m θ h e e l 2 2 θ i n c 3 motion equations of tlp the equations of motion of tlp in frequency domain can be written as follow 12 ω 2 m j a j ω i ω c j ω k j q j ω e i ω t f j ω e i ω t where m j ω a j ω c j ω k j q j ω and f j ω are mass matrix wave frequency added mass matrix damping matrix stiffness matrix displacement amplitude and wave force for every degree of freedom this equation is solved for six degrees of freedom to calculate traditional rao and phase lag also subscript j denotes jth degree of freedom furthermore time history of motions are extracted by modified euler method mem to calculate real coupled magnitude of motions and tendon tensions against wave loads matrix form of this method can be represented as 13 to 15 13 q j n t m j a j ω 1 f j t c

t is time increment 3 1 stiffness matrix of tlp in tendon damage condition stiffness matrix of tlp in tendon damage condition differs with intact condition the coefficients of matrix of stiffness k i j are derived as the reaction in the degree of freedom i due to unit displacement in the degree of freedom j keeping all other degrees of freedom restrained when tlp move purely in vertical plan as heave roll and pitch motions there is no horizontal component for resulting restoring tensions therefore pure vertical plan motions affect just vertical degrees of freedom while horizontal plan motions of tlp results in both vertical and horizontal components of restoring tensions therefore horizontal plan motions influence both vertical and horizontal plan degrees of freedom in derivation of stiffness matrix elements it can be important to consider that tendon is removed from which group according to fig 2 it is assumed that tendon is removed from group 4 following that surge motion induced stiffness of tlp in tendon damage condition can be expressed as below 16 k 11 x 12 n d t a δ t x sin θ x 17 k 31 x 12 n d t a δ t x cos θ x t a 18 k 41 x n d t a δ t x cos θ x p 2 19 k 51 x k

tendon and θ x is the angle between the pure vertical and inclined tendon heave motion induced stiffness for tlp in tendon damage condition can be written as below 24 k 33 12 n d a t e l 25 k 43 n d a

coefficients of surge heave and pitch stiffness of tlp in intact and tendon damage condition is presented in table 1 it is worth to note that stiffness depends on variation of tlp position against various external loads and do not cover static offsets caused by tendon damage in calm water 4 case study the studied platform is a tension leg platform named issc tlp with specifications given in table 2 kim et al 1994 5 tendon damage effects 5 1 static and transient effect time histories of tensions of a tendon in adjacent to disconnected tendon is shown in fig 6 when a tendon is failed two general phenomena can be seen in time history of tlp motions and tensions of tendons overshoot is major reaction of tlp against tendon damage as shown in fig 6 this contains two separate terms permanent static offset and transient shock reaction or free vibration suppose that tendon damage is occurred in calm water static offset is final disposition of tlp in calm water respect to intact condition this was explained in section 2 by detail and shown in fig 6 clearly free vibrations in mechanical systems are simply occurred due to impact excitation that can be provided for example by a hammer in a reverse manner tlp vibrates freely after offloading a pre stressed tendon in a moment when a tendon is failed the dynamic nature of tlp system changes and condition of tlp in failure moment is initial condition for new system that will oscillate freely since this is not rest in the condition same as new equilibrium condition so maximum shock overshoot is depending on natural frequency of system and initial condition of damaged tlp as shown in fig 6 maximum overshoot tension in the sea waves is more than calm water condition when tendon disconnection time dt is equal to 150 s and become less than calm water condition when disconnection time is equal to 155 s what make this difference are position velocity and acceleration vectors of tlp in disconnection moment overshoot is not investigated in this paper since it deals only with wave frequency portion of tensions of tendons and motions of tlp in intact and tendon damage conditions 5 2 steady state effect the second phenomenon is dynamic amplification of motion dynamic behavior of marine structures is determined by some dynamic parameters an important parameter that usually is used in these structures called dynamic amplification factor daf the daf is relevant to steady state response due to forced vibration of a system mass spring and damper and defined as follow 31 d a f δ d δ s t 1 1 β 2 2 2 ξ β 2 δ s t p 0 k β n a t u r a l p e r i o d o f s y s t e m w a v e e x i t a t i o n p e r i o d where δ d is dynamic response displacement stress or strain δ s t is static response displacement stress or strain ξ is damping ratio from above equation it can be seen that daf shows the portion of dynamic response in different periods and is plotted as follow as shown in fig 7 the practical range of β is approximately between 0 1 and 0 2 that is ratio of natural period of vertical plan heave roll and pitch degrees of freedom 1 2 s to period of prevalent sea waves 5 10 s 5 3 short term safe margin it is a probabilistic problem to determine tendon s capacity exceedance because of uncertainties in environmental loading material characteristics temperature variations corrosion effects engineering calculations etc it is calculated based on acceptable annual probability of failure p f that is one of important issues in design of offshore structures which is addressed in various marine standards such as api dnv norsok iso etc a brief comparison between their requirements for acceptable annual p f can be found in technical report no ep034373 2011 01 2012 iso 19906 iso 19906 2010 has conservative requirements for p f and a maximum acceptable annual probability of failure equal to 10 5 is established for a high consequence manned non evacuated offshore platform one may consider acceptable increase of probability of failure in tendon damage condition ten times probability of failure in intact condition based on engineering judgment and considering safety situation become one level lower dnvgl rp 0002 2014 it is a temporary p f until failed tendon is replaced with healthy one one can assume tendon tension and strength distribution as gaussian normal probability distribution function with a mean equal to design value and standard deviation equal to 10 percent of mean value the failure were occurred when tendon strength become less than tension and as shown in fig 8 it is highly probable where probability distribution functions of tension and strength overlay on each other zhang et al 2017 each probability of failure is inversely proportional to a safety factor λ and lead to a reliability index r i reliability index is defined according to probability distribution of tension of tendon and strength of that considering gaussian distribution for both tension and strength with mean values of μ t and μ s and standard deviation of σ t and σ s respectively reliability index becomes as equation 32 it is related to probability of failure by equation 33 in this equation ϕ is the standard normal distribution function leira 2013 defining safety factor as λ μ s μ t and standard deviation equal to 10 percent of mean value reliability index can be rewritten as equation 33 safety factor and reliability index reduce when probability of failure increases when a tendon is failed oscillating portion of motions and tendons tension is varied maximum safe margin of these variations is depending on acceptable p f in intact and tendon damage conditions and is equal to inverse of ratio of safety factor in tendon damage condition to safety factor in intact condition according to assumptions mentioned ago and principals of reliability analysis safety factor in intact λ i and damage λ d and safe margin of variations are derived as follow 32 r i μ s μ t σ s 2 σ t 2 33 p f ϕ r i 34 r i λ 1 0 1 λ 2 1 p f 10 5 r i 4 25 λ i 1 92 p f 10 4 r i 3 72 λ d 1 75 35 s m 1 λ d λ i λ i λ d 1 92 1 75 1 1 so a safe margin equal to 1 1 is considered in continue 6 numerical study and discussion motion equations that presented in the section 3 are solved in this section and response of surge heave and pitch motions in addition to tendon tensions are obtained in this study lateral excitation that incident to tlp is regular wave the characteristics of load cases are presented in table 3 fig 9 shows schematic view of tlp and wave approach angles wave loads on tlp and hydrodynamic added mass and damping are calculated using a computer code developed based on boundary element method bem gie and boom gie and boom 1981 took an experimental test on issc tlp by a model at a scale of 1 75 and represent various results in time and frequency domain fig 10 represents a comparison between surge rao that is calculated by developed bem code in this study and the result that was achieved experimentally by gie and boom gie and boom 1981 above mentioned loading scenarios are analyzed numerically and some parameters extracted to investigate behavior of tlp and tendon tensions after tendon damage mass and added mass of tendon and risers become a considerable fraction of total mass for water depth over 900 m api rp 2t 2010 in this paper water depth is 230 m and this is not considerable to account mass of tendon so tendons are considered as mass less linear spring radiation added masse and damping and wave loads are calculated by developed bem code and structural damping with ξ 0 05 added to radiation damping term α is defined as ratio of motion or tension amplitude of tlp in tendon damage condition to intact condition and known as ratio operator ro and shown by α in continue and defined as follows 36 r o α a damage a intact where a damage and a intact defined as response tension amplitude in tendon damage and intact conditions respectively response amplitude operators rao of motions and tendon tensions are extracted from steady behavior of tlp in regular waves in both intact and tendon damage conditions as shown in fig 11 rao phase and ro of motions in addition to rao and ro of tensions of tendons 1 and 4 were presented in figs 12 15 water wave period range varies in different sea basins because of wind strength fetch length depth and bathymetry condition etc however in this paper studied wave periods do not cover entire range of wave frequency but cover significant range of common sea waves according to section 5 3 a range up to 1 1 is defined as safe margin for α as shown in figures α shows the effect of tendon damage on amplification of oscillating part of desired parameters so static offset of parameters after failure is subtracted from total response tlp behavior and tendon tensions in some periods and headings will be interpreted in this section the attention is concentrated on wave frequency motions and tensions in this section these are affected by some phenomena such as stiffness reduction resonance enrichment and asymmetry in tendon configuration and cg natural period of heave and pitch are 1 32s and 1 26s respectively grayed range in fig 7 covers the ratios of these natural periods to common range of sea wave periods heave and pitch natural periods become 1 38 and 1 32 respectively after tendon disconnection tendon disconnection cause static angular offsets in pitch and roll wave frequency pitch motion will rotate on this new position fig 16 and translational motion of cg has vertical component zai in new position and this problem cause increase or reduction of vertical motion depending on phase lag between different degrees of freedom rao of motions and tensions are small in periods in the range of 2 6 s and may not be important in hydrodynamic or tendon damage consequence investigation of tlp but it can help to understand motion or tension amplification or reduction mechanism because of small amplitude of all degrees of freedom and large distance of cg from center of stiffness symmetry of tendons connection points in intact condition guarantees upright standing of hull without inclination when the pitch moment m 5 acts on cg tension increases in half of tendons in one side and decrease with same magnitude in other side and tlp resist against body rotation by resulting couple in comparison with free float tlp subjected to only pitch moment in cg the cg moves from initial position because of tendons action in tethered tlp as shown in fig 17 in other word the pure rotation is not occurred around cg but in the tendons center of stiffness so pure pitch moment causes very small surge motion in cg this problem is obviously seen in numerically damaged tlp configuration of tendons connection points is not symmetrical after tendon damage and center of stiffness moves away from failure point when the same pitch moment acts on cg in tendon damage condition pitch motion is magnified because of stiffness reduction of tendons group and cg moves around new equilibrium position and pitch caused trajectory of cg has horizontal and vertical components so there is some additional linear motions because of rotational reactions will referred as geometrical effects in continue that has small magnitude and is detectable in some periods that rao of linear motion has small quantity so a considerable variation can be seen in heave motion in periods 2 6 s and all headings where heave motion rao is very small in addition to geometrical effects the phase lag between degrees of freedom has an important role in amplification or reduction of motions or tendons tension phase lag between different degrees of freedom are presented in figs 18 21 red band shows the region that phase lag between respective degrees of freedom is about 180 and has reductive effect green band shows the region that phase lag between respective degrees of freedom is about 0 and has additive effect and yellow band is the region that phase lag between respective degrees of freedom is about 90 or 270 and has no effect on each other moreover another phenomenon affects pitch rotation except pitch loading pitch moment because of horizontal component of tendon tension cause additional pitch rotation that may has additive or reductive effect on pitch rotation as shown in fig 18 surge and pitch are in phase and are 90 out of phase respect to heave in period 2s so maximum value of heave is a result of heave excited or couple surge and pitch excited motions heave motion is three times magnified in this condition according to fig 11 heave excited motion can not be magnified three times since heave load is same as intact condition and stiffness reduction because of one tendon damage is only 8 percent and it can not be the reason of significant heave magnification also new natural period of heave is closely near intact condition and resonance enrichment has no significant effect on heave magnification so one just look at coupled in phase surge and pitch motion to find the reason tlp moves just by wave frequency loads after initial rise up and transient motion damping set down and geometry effect because of pitch motion are reasons of vertical motion of cg except heave excitation surge motion is very small and then set down is not an effective phenomenon however vertical component of pitch induced motion of cg is approximately three times greater than heave excited motion and α coefficient for period 2s and heading 0 become about 2 8 cg heave decreases in some periods because of phase lag between degrees of freedom for example α is equal to 0 5 for heave motion in period 6s and heading 0 fig 11 as previous condition set down is independent of tendon damage also surge motion is small and set down becomes as small as heave excited and pitch induced vertical motions and has no effect on heave motion of cg phase lag between heave and pitch motions is equal to zero and pitch induced vertical motion decreases when heave excited motion increases considering positive directions shown in fig 16 however α is equal to 0 5 since heave excited motion is two times greater than pitch induced vertical motion roll motion in heading 90 is 180 out of phase respect to pitch in heading0 so roll induced vertical motion magnify total vertical motion of cg and α is more than 1 for heave motion pitch is increased in period 8s and heading 0 and roll is decreased in same period and heading 90 as shown in figs 12 and 13 surge and sway raos have major quantity and pitch and roll rao diagrams has a trough in this period surge and pitch are in phase in this period and heading zero as shown in fig 18 in addition sway and roll are 180 out of phase according to fig 19 the coupling between surge and pitch causes an additional rotation for pitch that is independent of pitch loading but directly depended on global pitch stiffness of tlp although pitch moment in period 8s and heading 0 and roll moment in same period and heading 90 are weak but surge and sway motion amplitude is high enough to produce the additional coupled pitch component and stiffness loss leads to increases of this component so this component has additive effect on pitch excited rotational motion considering phase lag between surge and pitch and α is greater than 1 for pitch in the same manner sway has decreasing effect on roll motion and finally α becomes less than 1 increase in pitch can be seen in this period and headings 45 and 45 as shown in figs 14 and 15 coefficient α is close to 1 in all periods and headings for surge motion it has two main reasons pitch induced horizontal motion is produced before tendon damage as it produce after that so it is not a new additive term after tendon damage also surge motion amplitude is high enough to prevent high or low α quantity because of pitch induced additional terms however it can be seen some variations in surge motion before and after disconnection in headings 45 and 45 for example surge rao is low in the period 10s and considerable pitch motion is occurred simultaneously surge motion is low and pitch motion is high enough to make a bit variation in α zero phase lag between surge and pitch figs 20 and 21 ensures additive effect on total cg surge motion ros for cg motions has major variations in heading 0 90 and 45 and are close to 1 in wider band of periods in heading 45 it is because of both hydrodynamic pressure distribution and tendon configuration after tendon damage heave and horizontal load bearing condition is same in both heading 45 and 45 therefore the wave moment bearing is matter wave direction is oriented along neutral axis in heading 45 and tendons group 1 and 4 are not in subjection of wave moment and tlp sustained rotationally by intact tendons group 2 and 3 and rotational induced linear movements has been neglected in this situation however there are some variations in the motions and tensions in this heading that can be interpreted as done ago it can be seen that global major variations are occurred when the wave hint the tlp in heading 45 in a similar manner wave direction is perpendicular to neutral axis and all wave moment must be tolerated by tendons groups 1 and 4 and tendon damage effectively affect motions of cg and tensions of tendons therefore an engineering judgment is that pitch and roll are critical points in tendon damage investigation and tendon overload because of pitch and roll is probable variation of tensions in tendons is a most important problem in such investigations as seen in figs 12 15 raos of tensions are following raos of pitch and roll in all headings except heading 45 that tension raos are following heave rao the reason was discussed ago when the wave hits the tlp in heading 45 approximately all wave moment will tolerate by groups 2 and 3 and tendons groups 1 and 4 are not excited by wave moment so approximately all tensions are because of heave load extreme tensions are seen in heading 45 that tendon groups 1 and 4 approximately tolerate all wave moment coefficient α is lower than 1 for tension of tendon 1 in some periods and headings while tendon disconnection is occurred and it is important to understand the reasons tension of tendon is because of connection point vertical movement that comprises three components heave and pitch excited vertical motion and vertical motion because of surge induced pitch rotation are main source of tension variations it must be mentioned that pitch induced vertical motion of connection point is equal to pitch rotation multiplied by pitching lever of that so pitch and roll induced rotation has major effect on tension of tendon so that tension rao follow pitch rao as explained ago pitch induced vertical motion of tendon connection point is 60 times more than heave motion in some periods coefficient α for tendon 1 is equal to 0 78 in heading 90 fig 13 and period 8s while it is equal to 0 95 in heading 0 fig 12 and same period global stiffness of motions reduces after tendon damage and all components of motions are magnified various components of motions have different magnitudes because of wave load magnitude difference in various degrees of freedom although there is large pitching and rolling lever the tension is actually affected by heave motion and surge coupling because of very low pitch amplitude as shown in fig 12 and phase values are same for surge and sway and also for heave in both headings while roll and pitch are 180 out of phase sway and roll are 180 and heave and roll are approximately 120 out of phase therefore magnification of theme will decrease total vertical fluctuation of tendon connection point surge and heave are in phase and 60 out of phase respect to pitch so magnification of surge induced pitch has additive effect and amplification of heave has reductive effect on tension of tendon tension fluctuation increase in tendon 4 and decrease in tendon 1 to satisfy moment equilibrium around center of stiffness this effect can be seen clearly in ro of tension of tendon 1 in heading 45 fig 13 there is no wave moment by wave to tolerate by tendons 1 and 4 nevertheless heave or horizontal loads cause some rotation perpendicular to wave direction because of tendon configuration asymmetry center of stiffness reach tendon 1 after tendon damage and pitching arm decrease for tendon 1 and increase for tendon 4 so that equilibrium of moments satisfies so fluctuation of tension of tendon 1decrease and increase for tendon 4 7 conclusion equilibrium position and tether system stiffness of a conventional tlp is formulated a numerical simulation of hydrodynamics and dynamics of issc tlp is carried out in this paper raos of motions and tension of tendons 1 and 4 are extracted from steady time history to cover all couplings also phase of all motions that are extracted from bem code as well as presented and considered in interpretations a new parameter is introduced to clarify effects of one tendon damaged on behavior and tendon tensions of tlp compared to intact condition the parameter ros α is defined as proportion of amplitude of parameter in tendon damage condition to intact condition in each wave period tendon damage may increase or decrease the motions or tensions according to magnitude of each motion or tension components and phase lag between various degrees of freedom coefficient α is close to 1 for surge motion in all periods and close to 1 3 for tension of tendons near removed tendon for periods more than 4s while α not exceed 1 2 for oscillating component of tension of diagonal pair of disconnected tendon and this occurred just in period 2s ro is close to 1 1 or less for tension of diagonal pair of disconnected tendon that ensure not sever magnification in oscillating part of tension so major effect is concentrated on magnification of tensions of tendons of damaged group roll and pitch are most important degrees of freedom that affect tensions of tlp and it can be clearly seen from results that magnification of them has a remarkable influence on change of tensions of tendons for further clarification it can be deduced since tension rao is similar to pitch or roll rao consequently it can be concluded that pitch and roll are critical degrees of freedom in investigation of tendon tensions in tendon damage scenarios and critical heading is in direction of diagonal of failed tendon such studies can give a deep perception to understand the philosophy of some regulations presented in standards such as api rp 2t about engineering design of tension leg platforms although various studies were presented to address higher order dynamic and hydrodynamic effects on tlp and tendon performance in irregular waves further works are necessary to investigate coupled effects of tendon disconnections and higher order long term and transient phenomena such as tendon ringing and springing sum and difference frequency responses and response overshoot these phenomena affect tlp motion and tendon tension in both intact and damage condition but these may play more important role in damage condition respect to intact condition this relation may be true about regular and irregular waves too also mentioned effects may be capable to lead tendons to progressive failure so that is important to be investigated for real event fatigue and extreme response assessments 
23478,exact calculation of stiffness matrix of tlp is important for investigation of its behavior in intact and tendon damage conditions and it is necessary to design a reliable tlp a serious attention has been concentrated on this problem in api rp 2t and various aspects of that such as dynamic and static behavior of tlp tendon tensions after one tether failure also it has introduced safety factors in different loads and healthy conditions this paper deals with effect of damage tendon condition of tlp on behavior and tensions of tendons in wave frequency range equilibrium of tlp is studied and stiffness matrix of tlp is derived in tendon damage condition wave loads and hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated by boundary element method then motion equations are solved for 48 load and healthy conditions and wave frequency portion of tensions and motions are extracted from time history of them it is shown that although damage tendon condition has no extreme influence on response amplitude magnification it has a relatively major effect on tension of tendons which are close to failed tendon in addition roll and pitch magnifications have major effect on increase in tension of tendons also it is seen that critical wave heading occurs in direction of diagonal of group of failed tendon keywords tlp tendon damage condition tendon 1 introduction tlp is a floating platform which is moored to the seabed by tendons this platform consisted of buoyant hull deck and mooring system buoyant hull sustains deck sufficiently above water level and anchored to the seabed by a complex mooring system buoyancy of tlp is more than weight therefore it needs stiff and strong pre tensioned tendons to support additional buoyancy tendons mostly connect hull to the seabed by suction anchors although tendon mooring system allows lateral wave wind and current loads to move platform compliantly it keeps that strongly restricted vertically therefore it has high stability and is a good alternative for the deep seas damage condition is an important analysis case that must be took into account in design process there are general three damage types that can be occurred for hull and mooring system in various scenarios the general first damage type is flooding of tanks and then sinking of platform that can be occurred due to ship collision the second damage type is a structural damage without any flooding that can be occurred by an explosion or hurricane and the third damage type is mooring or tether system failure that can be occurred by a hurricane or fatigue the damage types are shown schematically in fig 1 moan 2004 as mentioned in api rp 2t environmental actions such as wave wind current and tide cause steady and unsteady loads and hence responses of tlp performance of several subsystems including foundations tendons risers hull and deck equipment must be investigated in both normal and extreme environmental conditions normal environmental conditions frequently occur in the floater service life and construction period whereas extreme environmental conditions has low probability of occurrence in service life all key subsystems such as mooring system must withstand in this condition api rp 2t 2010 extreme responses are considered to be those responses that are commonly produced by extreme environmental condition they generally include maximum surge sway and yaw offset minimum and maximum tendon tension ringing springing etc api rp 2t 2010 the tendon axial tension arises from pretension wave frequency difference frequency and sum frequency motions of tlp wave drift and wind induced offset wave and or ice impact on hull ringing and springing current drag on tendon viv foundation mispositioning etc maximum and minimum tension may be estimated as superposition of all tension components induced by various phenomena loss of tendon tension could result in tendon buckling and or damage to flex elements loading condition for tendon design includes extreme events survival condition normal condition installation duration seismic condition and damage condition last loading condition addresses tendon damage and compartment flooding missing a tendon can cause increase in static tension of remaining tendon and dynamic one too flooding one or more compartments may lead to tension reduction even below minimum allowable tension reliability of floater must be analyzed both in intact and damaged condition these analyses help designers to understand degree of reliability in intact and various damage scenarios theses analyses can help assess different degree of reliability of mooring system among designs utilizing different numbers of tendons different types of connectors such as threaded welded and merlin connectors and or end terminations etc stability is one of major parts in tlp design criteria schedule of api rp 2t stability of floater in case of damage condition must be satisfied in addition of free floating inplace and intact condition flooding of a compartment below water line or tendon damage must be analyzed in damage condition stability tendon may be failed because of buckling in tension and compression low and high cycle fatigue and extreme tensions in storms there are 12 recommended load cases for in place condition in api rp 2t that 4 of these are for damaged condition and 2 are for tendon removed planned condition api rp 2t 2010 tendon removal must be considered in mooring system design tendons might be permanently install or be removable stress change must be in an acceptable range if one tendon is removed a tendon has certain design life that must be match with platform design life some factors affect tendon design life such as initial tendon cost the cost of tendon replacement tendon in place inspect ability and the risks associated with tendon retrieval and reinstallation several design requirements should be met during design process initial tendon design containing pretension response analysis tendon bending load and response calculation minimum tension calculation initial stress analysis containing check of preliminary maximum stress level fatigue life and hydrostatic local buckling floater offsets and tendon displacement margins and fatigue life calculation are some design quantities in tendon design process bachynski and moan bachynski and moan 2012 made effort to optimize design of a tensioned leg platform wind turbine tlpwt to minimize fatigue damage and hence extend fatigue life time they focused on pitch motion of tlpwt and investigated ratio of standard deviation of some parameters such as tension of legs pitch motion base moment and surge motion to assess fatigue behavior of floater yan et al gongwei et al 2009 solved nonlinear dynamic equation of motion of tendon subjected to current field and floater motions their study contained effect of tendon pretension on viv behavior of that a finite element code was developed to model nonlinear tendon the cfd program fluent was used to solve 2d modeling of fluid move around tendon tao and jun tao and jun 2006 investigated hydrodynamic aspects of tendon design such as mathieu instability ringing and springing bottom tension slacking and vortex induced vibrations and then coupled hull tendon riser dynamic analysis of tlp in this study a fem approach is used to analyze tendons and risers and eventually they carried out an experimental study to verify viv calculations kim and zhang kim and zhang 2009 had a concentrate look on dynamic stability and survivability of a damaged tlp in moderate hurricane condition when one or more tendons are failed they developed a be fem computer code to model coupled dynamic behavior of hull tendon riser in time domain as shown in their study snap like transient effect of tendon disconnection cause significant increase in neighboring tendon tension and may lead to general failure of system because of continuous failure of tendons tabeshpour et al tabeshpour et al 2006 had a comprehensive interpretation on responses of tlp in random sea according to environmental and structural characteristics they had a brief review on hydrodynamic loadings based on morison equation and effective parameters in equations of motions they took into account nonlinearities in these equations and time and frequency domain behavior of particular tlp subjected to irregular wave loading was interpreted comprehensively geometrical nonlinearities of mooring system were considered also second order hydrodynamic effects such as difference and sum frequency effects were considered because of using morison equation in calculating wave loads tabeshpour and malayjerdi tabeshpour and malayjerdi 2016 took a precise look on pitch motion portion in vertical displacement of tlp columns and then tendon tension they carried out both frequency and time domain analyses and concluded that pitch motion can affect tendon tension severely in some wave periods they represented the rao of heave and pitch of platform and vertical motion of tendon top end and discussed about pitch portion in that senjanović et al senjanović et al 2013 represented a new formulation for stiffness of surge sway and yaw motions they developed formulations by both static force equilibrium and energy balance approaches for large and small surge sway and yaw degrees of freedom they compared the results by fem analysis and a good agreement has been seen with those results only diagonal elements of stiffness matrix of horizontal plane motions are extracted in this study malayjerdi and tabeshpour malayjerdi and tabeshpour 2016 investigated rao of diffraction and froude krylov forces that are induced by wave and studied theory behind them three wave period range is specified and importance of each force components are discussed phase lag between diffraction and froude krylov forces is considered in determining total wave force on issc tlp all forces are determined in all degrees of freedom expect yaw motion yang and kim 2010 reported the results of a research about tendon disconnection effect on tlp response and tension of tendons and risers an expanded tlp etlp with coupled tendons and risers was studied in their research first and second order diffraction wave loads and morison viscous forces on hull have been considered added mass matrix of infinite frequency been added with mass matrix and radiation damping loads are applied tendons and risers are modeled using finite element method and morison inertia and viscous forces are considered in analysis they developed a software based on fully nonlinear equation of motion of tlp and tendons providing time history of motions and tension of tendons and risers also top disconnection or bottom unlatches effect studied in their research mansour et al mansour et al 2006 were analyses survivability of typical tlp in gom against 100 1 000 and 10 000 years return period hurricanes in case of intact tendon removed and tendon breakage also they investigated effect of column spacing on tension of tendons barranco et al barranco et al 2008 represent a reliability based methodology to perform a lrfd criterion for the design of tendon of tlp the proposed design criterion considers the ultimate limit state uls for the tendon sections expressed in terms of the expected value of the extreme interaction ratio considering long term storm sea states and takes into account the dynamic load effects interaction and the statistics of its associated extreme response morandi et al morandi et al 2004 took a look on tlp tendon tension during lili hurricane it was 2002 and hit several offshore units near track one of them was a tlp that there is a sufficient measurement of wind motion and tendon tension from that time and frequency analyses performed on tension sensor data and in service behavior compared with design situation other relevant comparisons included natural period and damping estimates moan and amdahl moan and amdahl 1989 were investigated catastrophic failure modes of marine structures including progressive failure sinking and capsizing also they described probabilistic and mechanical aspects of failure modes in case of tension leg platforms they mentioned to tendon progressive failure as one of catastrophic failure modes even tlp is stable in free floating condition mansour et al mansour et al 2013 were investigated survivability of an installed tlp in offshore western australia against progressive failure of tendons and foundation in harsh environment they carried out an experimental model test in addition of numerical simulation tendons were broken progressively and tlp became float finally behavior of tlp and tensions in tendons were investigated during progressive events all offshore structures are designed based on specific probability of failure considering various source of uncertainties one may consider acceptable increase of probability of failure in tendon damage condition ten times probability of failure in intact condition based on engineering judgment it is important to know do the responses and tensions oversteps this margin in various load cases after one tendon damage or not there is no worry if these are below or a bit more than considered safe margin and it is worrying event if these are considerably above safe margin in this paper influences of disconnection of one tendon on response of motions and tension of tendons in wave frequency range are investigated and they are compared to intact condition equilibrium of tlp in tendon damage condition has been studied and static offsets estimated in addition since stiffness matrix play a key role in behavior of tlp it is derived when one tether is disconnected and compared with intact condition then motion equations are solved and response of surge heave and pitch motions obtained for 48 load conditions that are combination of various healthy condition regular wave periods and wave headings steady state wave frequency portion of motions of tlp is extracted from time history of that in intact and tendon damage

displacement vector of tlp 2 equilibrium of tlp tendon damage condition 2 1 heave equilibrium equilibrium of tlp for on site condition with tendon legs system connected is not governed by a metacentric approach the equilibrium is typically provided by the pretension and stiffness of the mooring system rather than by water plan area and moments fig 2 shows tlp plan and its tendons in intact and damaged conditions it can be seen that lateral load enforce tlp to offsets in x y and θ z in order to equilibrium after tendon disconnection it is noted that the most important offsets occur in soft degrees of freedom assuming no angular offsets generally disconnection of tendon causes draft and buoyancy reduction δ b and tension in rest of tendons t a equally increases due to increase of tension of tendon elongation in tendon δ z b occurs equations of vertical equilibrium are as follow xu 2009 1 t a t 0 δ t δ b n t n d 2 t 0 b w n t 3 δ t k δ z b t 0 n t n d 4 δ b ρ g a w δ z b 5 δ z b t 0 k n t n d where t a will be defined later t 0 is pretension of tendon in intact condition δ t represents the additional tension applied to a tendon related to the additional elongation k e a t l is axial stiffness of tendon that a t is cross section area of tendon l is length of tendon a w is water plane area n t is total number of tendons in intact condition n d is number of damaged tendons and w is weight of tlp equation 4 buoyancy reduction of tlp and can be rewritten as follow 6 δ b ρ g a w t 0 k n t n d then using equations 1 3 and 6 t a is calculated as follows 7 t a t 0 1 1 n t n d ρ g a w k n t n d 2 it is necessary to mention that effect of buoyance reduction is negligible because of low ratio of hydrostatic stiffness to tendon stiffness and inverse relation of square of number remaining tendons with buoyancy loss generally it s effect is less than 0 1 percent if one tendon is failed 2 2 vertical plan angular equilibrium around neutral axis tlp will rise up and rotate after tendon disconnection but these are not sensible because of very small elongation of tendons when transient vibrations finished tlp rests in equilibrium condition in calm water we can assume that tlp is raised up at first and then rotate platform rise up was studied in previous section and rotation will be discussed in this section when a tendon from group no 4 is damaged the platform will be inclined around neutral axis fig 3 neutral axis is a set of points that are not affected by tendon remove inclination and keep their vertical position after that so tlp inclination will affect tendon groups no 4 and no 1 considerably and tendon groups no 3 and no 2 much lesser since these are close to inclination neutral axis assuming tendon groups no 2 and no 1 on neutral axis moment and tension equilibrium equations for mooring system with 12 tendons can be written as follows 8 3 n d δ t 4 3 δ t 1 0 9 2 p 2 3 n d δ t 4 2 p 2 3 δ t 1 2 p 2 n d t a where we assume that the tlp is a square and p is column spacing of tlp and δ t 4 and δ t 1 are the change in tension of tendon groups 4 and 1 from t a respectively and expressed as follow 10 δ t 4 n d t a 2 3 n d δ t 1 n d t a 6 according to 10 and considering axial stiffness of tendon k inclination angle θ i n c and trim and heel angles θ t r i m θ h e e l can be derived as 11 fig 4 11 θ i n c n d t a 1 2 3 n d k 1 6 k 2 p θ t r i m θ h e e l 2 2 θ i n c 3 motion equations of tlp the equations of motion of tlp in frequency domain can be written as follow 12 ω 2 m j a j ω i ω c j ω k j q j ω e i ω t f j

this equation is solved for six degrees of freedom to calculate traditional rao and phase lag also subscript j denotes jth degree of freedom furthermore time history of motions are extracted by modified euler method mem to calculate real coupled magnitude of motions and tendon tensions against wave loads matrix form of this method can be represented as 13 to 15 13 q j n t m j a j ω 1 f j t c

t is time increment 3 1 stiffness matrix of tlp in tendon damage condition stiffness matrix of tlp in tendon damage condition differs with intact condition the coefficients of matrix of stiffness k i j are derived as the reaction in the degree of freedom i due to unit displacement in the degree of freedom j keeping all other degrees of freedom restrained when tlp move purely in vertical plan as heave roll and pitch motions there is no horizontal component for resulting restoring tensions therefore pure vertical plan motions affect just vertical degrees of freedom while horizontal plan motions of tlp results in both vertical and horizontal components of restoring tensions therefore horizontal plan motions influence both vertical and horizontal plan degrees of freedom in derivation of stiffness matrix elements it can be important to consider that tendon is removed from which group according to fig 2 it is assumed that tendon is removed from group 4 following that surge motion induced stiffness of tlp in tendon damage condition can be expressed as below 16 k 11 x 12 n d t a δ t x sin θ x 17 k 31 x 12 n d t a δ t x cos θ x t a 18 k 41 x n d t a δ t x cos θ x p 2 19 k 51 x k

coefficients of surge heave and pitch stiffness of tlp in intact and tendon damage condition is presented in table 1 it is worth to note that stiffness depends on variation of tlp position against various external loads and do not cover static offsets caused by tendon damage in calm water 4 case study the studied platform is a tension leg platform named issc tlp with specifications given in table 2 kim et al 1994 5 tendon damage effects 5 1 static and transient effect time histories of tensions of a tendon in adjacent to disconnected tendon is shown in fig 6 when a tendon is failed two general phenomena can be seen in time history of tlp motions and tensions of tendons overshoot is major reaction of tlp against tendon damage as shown in fig 6 this contains two separate terms permanent static offset and transient shock reaction or free vibration suppose that tendon damage is occurred in calm water static offset is final disposition of tlp in calm water respect to intact condition this was explained in section 2 by detail and shown in fig 6 clearly free vibrations in mechanical systems are simply occurred due to impact excitation that can be provided for example by a hammer in a reverse manner tlp vibrates freely after offloading a pre stressed tendon in a moment when a tendon is failed the dynamic nature of tlp system changes and condition of tlp in failure moment is initial condition for new system that will oscillate freely since this is not rest in the condition same as new equilibrium condition so maximum shock overshoot is depending on natural frequency of system and initial condition of damaged tlp as shown in fig 6 maximum overshoot tension in the sea waves is more than calm water condition when tendon disconnection time dt is equal to 150 s and become less than calm water condition when disconnection time is equal to 155 s what make this difference are position velocity and acceleration vectors of tlp in disconnection moment overshoot is not investigated in this paper since it deals only with wave frequency portion of tensions of tendons and motions of tlp in intact and tendon damage conditions 5 2 steady state effect the second phenomenon is dynamic amplification of motion dynamic behavior of marine structures is determined by some dynamic parameters an important parameter that usually is used in these structures called dynamic amplification factor daf the daf is relevant to steady state response due to forced vibration of a system mass spring and damper and defined as follow 31 d a f δ d δ s t 1 1 β 2 2 2 ξ β 2 δ s t p 0 k β n a t u r a l p e r i o d o f s y s t e m w a v e e x i t a t i o n p e r i o d where δ d is dynamic response displacement stress or strain δ s t is static response displacement stress or strain ξ is damping ratio from above equation it can be seen that daf shows the portion of dynamic response in different periods and is plotted as follow as shown in fig 7 the practical range of β is approximately between 0 1 and 0 2 that is ratio of natural period of vertical plan heave roll and pitch degrees of freedom 1 2 s to period of prevalent sea waves 5 10 s 5 3 short term safe margin it is a probabilistic problem to determine tendon s capacity exceedance because of uncertainties in environmental loading material characteristics temperature variations corrosion effects engineering calculations etc it is calculated based on acceptable annual probability of failure p f that is one of important issues in design of offshore structures which is addressed in various marine standards such as api dnv norsok iso etc a brief comparison between their requirements for acceptable annual p f can be found in technical report no ep034373 2011 01 2012 iso 19906 iso 19906 2010 has conservative requirements for p f and a maximum acceptable annual probability of failure equal to 10 5 is established for a high consequence manned non evacuated offshore platform one may consider acceptable increase of probability of failure in tendon damage condition ten times probability of failure in intact condition based on engineering judgment and considering safety situation become one level lower dnvgl rp 0002 2014 it is a temporary p f until failed tendon is replaced with healthy one one can assume tendon tension and strength distribution as gaussian normal probability distribution function with a mean equal to design value and standard deviation equal to 10 percent of mean value the failure were occurred when tendon strength become less than tension and as shown in fig 8 it is highly probable where probability distribution functions of tension and strength overlay on each other zhang et al 2017 each probability of failure is inversely proportional to a safety factor λ and lead to a reliability index r i reliability index is defined according to probability distribution of tension of tendon and strength of that considering gaussian distribution for both tension and strength with mean values of μ t and μ s and standard deviation of σ t and σ s respectively reliability index becomes as equation 32 it is related to probability of failure by equation 33 in this equation ϕ is the standard normal distribution function leira 2013 defining safety factor as λ μ s μ t and standard deviation equal to 10 percent of mean value reliability index can be rewritten as equation 33 safety factor and reliability index reduce when probability of failure increases when a tendon is failed oscillating portion of motions and tendons tension is varied maximum safe margin of these variations is depending on acceptable p f in intact and tendon damage conditions and is equal to inverse of ratio of safety factor in tendon damage condition to safety factor in intact condition according to assumptions mentioned ago and principals of reliability analysis safety factor in intact λ i and damage λ d and safe margin of variations are derived as follow 32 r i μ s μ t σ s 2 σ t 2 33 p f ϕ r i 34 r i λ 1 0 1 λ 2 1 p f 10 5 r i 4 25 λ i 1 92 p f 10 4 r i 3 72 λ d 1 75 35 s m 1 λ d λ i λ i λ d 1 92 1 75 1 1 so a safe margin equal to 1 1 is considered in continue 6 numerical study and discussion motion equations that presented in the section 3 are solved in this section and response of surge heave and pitch motions in addition to tendon tensions are obtained in this study lateral excitation that incident to tlp is regular wave the characteristics of load cases are presented in table 3 fig 9 shows schematic view of tlp and wave approach angles wave loads on tlp and hydrodynamic added mass and damping are calculated using a computer code developed based on boundary element method bem gie and boom gie and boom 1981 took an experimental test on issc tlp by a model at a scale of 1 75 and represent various results in time and frequency domain fig 10 represents a comparison between surge rao that is calculated by developed bem code in this study and the result that was achieved experimentally by gie and boom gie and boom 1981 above mentioned loading scenarios are analyzed numerically and some parameters extracted to investigate behavior of tlp and tendon tensions after tendon damage mass and added mass of tendon and risers become a considerable fraction of total mass for water depth over 900 m api rp 2t 2010 in this paper water depth is 230 m and this is not considerable to account mass of tendon so tendons are considered as mass less linear spring radiation added masse and damping and wave loads are calculated by developed bem code and structural damping with ξ 0 05 added to radiation damping term α is defined as ratio of motion or tension amplitude of tlp in tendon damage condition to intact condition and known as ratio operator ro and shown by α in continue and defined as follows 36 r o α a damage a intact where a damage and a intact defined as response tension amplitude in tendon damage and intact conditions respectively response amplitude operators rao of motions and tendon tensions are extracted from steady behavior of tlp in regular waves in both intact and tendon damage conditions as shown in fig 11 rao phase and ro of motions in addition to rao and ro of tensions of tendons 1 and 4 were presented in figs 12 15 water wave period range varies in different sea basins because of wind strength fetch length depth and bathymetry condition etc however in this paper studied wave periods do not cover entire range of wave frequency but cover significant range of common sea waves according to section 5 3 a range up to 1 1 is defined as safe margin for α as shown in figures α shows the effect of tendon damage on amplification of oscillating part of desired parameters so static offset of parameters after failure is subtracted from total response tlp behavior and tendon tensions in some periods and headings will be interpreted in this section the attention is concentrated on wave frequency motions and tensions in this section these are affected by some phenomena such as stiffness reduction resonance enrichment and asymmetry in tendon configuration and cg natural period of heave and pitch are 1 32s and 1 26s respectively grayed range in fig 7 covers the ratios of these natural periods to common range of sea wave periods heave and pitch natural periods become 1 38 and 1 32 respectively after tendon disconnection tendon disconnection cause static angular offsets in pitch and roll wave frequency pitch motion will rotate on this new position fig 16 and translational motion of cg has vertical component zai in new position and this problem cause increase or reduction of vertical motion depending on phase lag between different degrees of freedom rao of motions and tensions are small in periods in the range of 2 6 s and may not be important in hydrodynamic or tendon damage consequence investigation of tlp but it can help to understand motion or tension amplification or reduction mechanism because of small amplitude of all degrees of freedom and large distance of cg from center of stiffness symmetry of tendons connection points in intact condition guarantees upright standing of hull without inclination when the pitch moment m 5 acts on cg tension increases in half of tendons in one side and decrease with same magnitude in other side and tlp resist against body rotation by resulting couple in comparison with free float tlp subjected to only pitch moment in cg the cg moves from initial position because of tendons action in tethered tlp as shown in fig 17 in other word the pure rotation is not occurred around cg but in the tendons center of stiffness so pure pitch moment causes very small surge motion in cg this problem is obviously seen in numerically damaged tlp configuration of tendons connection points is not symmetrical after tendon damage and center of stiffness moves away from failure point when the same pitch moment acts on cg in tendon damage condition pitch motion is magnified because of stiffness reduction of tendons group and cg moves around new equilibrium position and pitch caused trajectory of cg has horizontal and vertical components so there is some additional linear motions because of rotational reactions will referred as geometrical effects in continue that has small magnitude and is detectable in some periods that rao of linear motion has small quantity so a considerable variation can be seen in heave motion in periods 2 6 s and all headings where heave motion rao is very small in addition to geometrical effects the phase lag between degrees of freedom has an important role in amplification or reduction of motions or tendons tension phase lag between different degrees of freedom are presented in figs 18 21 red band shows the region that phase lag between respective degrees of freedom is about 180 and has reductive effect green band shows the region that phase lag between respective degrees of freedom is about 0 and has additive effect and yellow band is the region that phase lag between respective degrees of freedom is about 90 or 270 and has no effect on each other moreover another phenomenon affects pitch rotation except pitch loading pitch moment because of horizontal component of tendon tension cause additional pitch rotation that may has additive or reductive effect on pitch rotation as shown in fig 18 surge and pitch are in phase and are 90 out of phase respect to heave in period 2s so maximum value of heave is a result of heave excited or couple surge and pitch excited motions heave motion is three times magnified in this condition according to fig 11 heave excited motion can not be magnified three times since heave load is same as intact condition and stiffness reduction because of one tendon damage is only 8 percent and it can not be the reason of significant heave magnification also new natural period of heave is closely near intact condition and resonance enrichment has no significant effect on heave magnification so one just look at coupled in phase surge and pitch motion to find the reason tlp moves just by wave frequency loads after initial rise up and transient motion damping set down and geometry effect because of pitch motion are reasons of vertical motion of cg except heave excitation surge motion is very small and then set down is not an effective phenomenon however vertical component of pitch induced motion of cg is approximately three times greater than heave excited motion and α coefficient for period 2s and heading 0 become about 2 8 cg heave decreases in some periods because of phase lag between degrees of freedom for example α is equal to 0 5 for heave motion in period 6s and heading 0 fig 11 as previous condition set down is independent of tendon damage also surge motion is small and set down becomes as small as heave excited and pitch induced vertical motions and has no effect on heave motion of cg phase lag between heave and pitch motions is equal to zero and pitch induced vertical motion decreases when heave excited motion increases considering positive directions shown in fig 16 however α is equal to 0 5 since heave excited motion is two times greater than pitch induced vertical motion roll motion in heading 90 is 180 out of phase respect to pitch in heading0 so roll induced vertical motion magnify total vertical motion of cg and α is more than 1 for heave motion pitch is increased in period 8s and heading 0 and roll is decreased in same period and heading 90 as shown in figs 12 and 13 surge and sway raos have major quantity and pitch and roll rao diagrams has a trough in this period surge and pitch are in phase in this period and heading zero as shown in fig 18 in addition sway and roll are 180 out of phase according to fig 19 the coupling between surge and pitch causes an additional rotation for pitch that is independent of pitch loading but directly depended on global pitch stiffness of tlp although pitch moment in period 8s and heading 0 and roll moment in same period and heading 90 are weak but surge and sway motion amplitude is high enough to produce the additional coupled pitch component and stiffness loss leads to increases of this component so this component has additive effect on pitch excited rotational motion considering phase lag between surge and pitch and α is greater than 1 for pitch in the same manner sway has decreasing effect on roll motion and finally α becomes less than 1 increase in pitch can be seen in this period and headings 45 and 45 as shown in figs 14 and 15 coefficient α is close to 1 in all periods and headings for surge motion it has two main reasons pitch induced horizontal motion is produced before tendon damage as it produce after that so it is not a new additive term after tendon damage also surge motion amplitude is high enough to prevent high or low α quantity because of pitch induced additional terms however it can be seen some variations in surge motion before and after disconnection in headings 45 and 45 for example surge rao is low in the period 10s and considerable pitch motion is occurred simultaneously surge motion is low and pitch motion is high enough to make a bit variation in α zero phase lag between surge and pitch figs 20 and 21 ensures additive effect on total cg surge motion ros for cg motions has major variations in heading 0 90 and 45 and are close to 1 in wider band of periods in heading 45 it is because of both hydrodynamic pressure distribution and tendon configuration after tendon damage heave and horizontal load bearing condition is same in both heading 45 and 45 therefore the wave moment bearing is matter wave direction is oriented along neutral axis in heading 45 and tendons group 1 and 4 are not in subjection of wave moment and tlp sustained rotationally by intact tendons group 2 and 3 and rotational induced linear movements has been neglected in this situation however there are some variations in the motions and tensions in this heading that can be interpreted as done ago it can be seen that global major variations are occurred when the wave hint the tlp in heading 45 in a similar manner wave direction is perpendicular to neutral axis and all wave moment must be tolerated by tendons groups 1 and 4 and tendon damage effectively affect motions of cg and tensions of tendons therefore an engineering judgment is that pitch and roll are critical points in tendon damage investigation and tendon overload because of pitch and roll is probable variation of tensions in tendons is a most important problem in such investigations as seen in figs 12 15 raos of tensions are following raos of pitch and roll in all headings except heading 45 that tension raos are following heave rao the reason was discussed ago when the wave hits the tlp in heading 45 approximately all wave moment will tolerate by groups 2 and 3 and tendons groups 1 and 4 are not excited by wave moment so approximately all tensions are because of heave load extreme tensions are seen in heading 45 that tendon groups 1 and 4 approximately tolerate all wave moment coefficient α is lower than 1 for tension of tendon 1 in some periods and headings while tendon disconnection is occurred and it is important to understand the reasons tension of tendon is because of connection point vertical movement that comprises three components heave and pitch excited vertical motion and vertical motion because of surge induced pitch rotation are main source of tension variations it must be mentioned that pitch induced vertical motion of connection point is equal to pitch rotation multiplied by pitching lever of that so pitch and roll induced rotation has major effect on tension of tendon so that tension rao follow pitch rao as explained ago pitch induced vertical motion of tendon connection point is 60 times more than heave motion in some periods coefficient α for tendon 1 is equal to 0 78 in heading 90 fig 13 and period 8s while it is equal to 0 95 in heading 0 fig 12 and same period global stiffness of motions reduces after tendon damage and all components of motions are magnified various components of motions have different magnitudes because of wave load magnitude difference in various degrees of freedom although there is large pitching and rolling lever the tension is actually affected by heave motion and surge coupling because of very low pitch amplitude as shown in fig 12 and phase values are same for surge and sway and also for heave in both headings while roll and pitch are 180 out of phase sway and roll are 180 and heave and roll are approximately 120 out of phase therefore magnification of theme will decrease total vertical fluctuation of tendon connection point surge and heave are in phase and 60 out of phase respect to pitch so magnification of surge induced pitch has additive effect and amplification of heave has reductive effect on tension of tendon tension fluctuation increase in tendon 4 and decrease in tendon 1 to satisfy moment equilibrium around center of stiffness this effect can be seen clearly in ro of tension of tendon 1 in heading 45 fig 13 there is no wave moment by wave to tolerate by tendons 1 and 4 nevertheless heave or horizontal loads cause some rotation perpendicular to wave direction because of tendon configuration asymmetry center of stiffness reach tendon 1 after tendon damage and pitching arm decrease for tendon 1 and increase for tendon 4 so that equilibrium of moments satisfies so fluctuation of tension of tendon 1decrease and increase for tendon 4 7 conclusion equilibrium position and tether system stiffness of a conventional tlp is formulated a numerical simulation of hydrodynamics and dynamics of issc tlp is carried out in this paper raos of motions and tension of tendons 1 and 4 are extracted from steady time history to cover all couplings also phase of all motions that are extracted from bem code as well as presented and considered in interpretations a new parameter is introduced to clarify effects of one tendon damaged on behavior and tendon tensions of tlp compared to intact condition the parameter ros α is defined as proportion of amplitude of parameter in tendon damage condition to intact condition in each wave period tendon damage may increase or decrease the motions or tensions according to magnitude of each motion or tension components and phase lag between various degrees of freedom coefficient α is close to 1 for surge motion in all periods and close to 1 3 for tension of tendons near removed tendon for periods more than 4s while α not exceed 1 2 for oscillating component of tension of diagonal pair of disconnected tendon and this occurred just in period 2s ro is close to 1 1 or less for tension of diagonal pair of disconnected tendon that ensure not sever magnification in oscillating part of tension so major effect is concentrated on magnification of tensions of tendons of damaged group roll and pitch are most important degrees of freedom that affect tensions of tlp and it can be clearly seen from results that magnification of them has a remarkable influence on change of tensions of tendons for further clarification it can be deduced since tension rao is similar to pitch or roll rao consequently it can be concluded that pitch and roll are critical degrees of freedom in investigation of tendon tensions in tendon damage scenarios and critical heading is in direction of diagonal of failed tendon such studies can give a deep perception to understand the philosophy of some regulations presented in standards such as api rp 2t about engineering design of tension leg platforms although various studies were presented to address higher order dynamic and hydrodynamic effects on tlp and tendon performance in irregular waves further works are necessary to investigate coupled effects of tendon disconnections and higher order long term and transient phenomena such as tendon ringing and springing sum and difference frequency responses and response overshoot these phenomena affect tlp motion and tendon tension in both intact and damage condition but these may play more important role in damage condition respect to intact condition this relation may be true about regular and irregular waves too also mentioned effects may be capable to lead tendons to progressive failure so that is important to be investigated for real event fatigue and extreme response assessments

university of tokyo japan 2 formerly at lmo university of são paulo an experimental investigation of concomitant vortex induced vibration viv and top motion excitation with a long and vertical flexible cylinder is presented underwater optical instrumentation allows to directly measure the cartesian coordinates of 43 targets placed along the model standard analyses based on statistical evaluation of local displacement time histories and on spectral analysis are carried out additionally to the standard approach modal decomposition is adopted allowing to obtain modal amplitude time

frequency twice the first natural frequency in still water f t f n 1 2 1 parametric instability of the first vibration mode occurs concomitant to viv phenomenon such instability leads to a marked increase in the oscillation amplitudes for the whole range of towing speed tested keywords vortex induced vibrations vertical flexible cylinder top motion effect experiments modal analysis 1 introduction viv is a fluid structure interaction phenomenon that has received attention from both academic and industrial communities comprehensive reviews regarding viv can be found for example in the papers by bearman 1984 2011 sarpkaya 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 and gabbai and benaroya 2005 up to the 2000 s viv was mostly investigated for rigid cylinders mounted on elastic supports allowing displacements only in the cross wise direction i e the direction transverse to the free stream direction for low values of the combined mass damping parameter m ζ m is the ratio between the oscillating mass and the mass of fluid displaced by the cylinder and ζ is the damping ratio khalak and williamson 1999 emphasized the existence of three distinct branches initial upper and lower branches in the oscillation amplitude curve versus reduced velocity v r u f n d u is the free stream velocity f n is the natural frequency in still water and d is the diameter other aspects investigated for the one degree of freedom 1 dof system with low mass parameter are the effects of the reynolds number on the amplitude peak govardhan and williamson 2006 and the amplification of the force coefficients within the lock in range sarpkaya 1995 khalak and williamson 1999 and franzini et al 2012a motivated by new technological demands especially those from the offshore industry the problem of a rigid cylinder elastically mounted on two degrees of freedom 2 dof apparatuses has received attention from several research groups considering a system with m 6 jauvtis and williamson 2004 pointed out that the in line oscillations strongly affect the vortex shedding pattern and also increase the maximum cross wise oscillation amplitude additionally the parametric experimental investigations described in stappenbelt and lalji 2008 showed that the in line oscillations become negligible for the conditions in which the combined parameter m ζ 0 066 particularly in the risers dynamics scenario the investigations on viv of flexible cylinders are crucial matters in structural design a comprehensive literature review concerning viv on long and flexible cylinders can be found in wu et al 2012 considering firstly the experimental approach pesce and fujarra 2000 studied viv on a cantilevered cylinder and observed that the peak of the first mode amplitude response was shifted to a higher value of v r when compared to the 1 dof results a few years latter pesce and fujarra 2005 replotted those results onto jauvtis and williamson 2004 obtained with a 2 dof rigid cylinder revealing a remarkable similarity in fujarra et al 2001 experiments with a cantilevered cylinder with distinct stiffness in the in line and cross wise directions were analyzed among other aspects the authors reported the existence of a high speed mode of response outside the principal synchronization regime this high speed mode is associated to the in line cross wise coupling combined to bending torsional responses chaplin et al 2005a b present experimental results of a long flexible cylinder subjected to a stepped current and comparisons with numerical codes developed by several researches groups in these papers only the lower segment of the model was subjected to the free stream whereas the upper part was kept immersed inside a vacuum tank similar experiments are described in huera huarte et al 2006 huera huarte and bearman 2009a b with the cylinder immersed only in its lower portion field experiments described in vandiver et al 2009 pointed out that the geometric stiffness provides a favorable scenario for the appearance of traveling waves instead of stationary wave patterns huang et al 2011 investigated the amplification of the mean drag coefficient due the viv in flexible cylinders the viv of flexible cylinders was also studied using computational fluids dynamics cfd the papers written by willden and graham 2001 2004 pointed out that the added mass may play an important role in the structural oscillations yamamoto et al 2004 employed the discrete vortex method dvm aiming at investigating the response of a flexible model to a sheared current profile shear flow excitation was also the focus of the direct numerical simulations dns described in bourguet et al 2011 who pointed out among others aspects a mixture of standing and traveling waves bourguet et al 2012 investigated mono and multi frequency response of a flexible cylinder subjected to shear flow the authors emphasize that the transition between these two response behaviors are affected by the in line static curvature which depends on the mean drag force acting along the line from the analytical point of view non linear equations are employed as a way to emulate the self excited and self limited character of viv one of the first papers on this subject is iwan and blevins 1974 which employed the van der pol equation as a phenomenological model for the fluid oscillator facchinetti et al 2004a showed that the phenomenological model can capture some features of the 1 dof viv recently the phenomenological models have been employed jointly with structural dynamics equations aiming at describing viv of long and flexible models this kind of model is faster than 3d cfd ones and is commonly used in numerical codes for offshore applications the phenomenological models were employed aiming at investigating several aspects of interest of risers dynamics such as traveling waves facchinetti et al 2004b and the relation between mean top tension and multi modal viv response silveira et al 2007 gu et al 2013 in the offshore engineering scenario risers and tension leg platforms tlp tendons are usually driven at the hang off point by free surface waves motions of the floating unity such imposed top motions lead to temporal variation of the tension along the riser as the lateral stiffness of risers and tlp s tethers are tension dominated these structures may be subjected to parametric excitation caused by the dependence of the stiffness on time from the mathematical point of view systems in which one of the parameters of the equation of motion is explicitly dependent on time are subjected to parametric excitation particularly if the stiffness varies harmonically with time the equation of motion is recognized as a mathieu s equation depending on the combination of the parameters governing the mathieu s equation the trivial solution may be stable or unstable a straightforward way to check the stability of the trivial solution is by means of the strutt s diagram the textbooks by nayfeh and mook 1979 and meirovitch 2003 present detailed analysis regarding the mathieu s equation and the strutt s diagram investigations on parametric excitation in risers and tlps tethers can be found for example in rainey 1977 mazzilli 1985 patel and park 1991 simos and pesce 1997 franzini et al 2015 franzini and mazzilli 2016 and franzini et al 2016c a particular scenario for mathieu s instability is that in which stiffness oscillates with twice the natural frequency this condition is defined in the present paper as principal mathieu s instability tension modulations driven by prescribed top motions are the technological motivation of this paper the scientific motivation arises from the fact that the effects of tension modulation on viv are not commonly found in the literature examples of numerical investigations on this subject are silveira et al 2007 joseffson and dalton 2010 and yuan et al 2018 among other aspects the very recent paper by yuan et al 2018 points out the presence of amplitude modulated and multi frequencies responses these aspects are also verified in the experimental results herein presented experiments presented in franzini et al 2014 with a flexible cylinder immersed only in its lower portion had already revealed some effects of the prescribed top motion on the viv response the results discussed in the present paper comes from a rather comprehensive research project on non linear dynamics of risers conducted at escola politécnica of university of são paulo in the years 2010 2013 which covered thoeretical modeling and experimental investigations within the experimental approach three groups of experiments with a long and immersed flexible cylinder were carried out for two arrangements vertical and catenary configurations namely i pure top motion ii pure viv iii concomitant viv and top motion details may be found in pesce et al 2013 and pesce 2013 aiming at contributing to a better understanding of combined effects of current and parametric excitation the focus here is to present experimental results of viv of a vertical and flexible cylinder subjected to concomitant uniform free stream profile and prescribed top motions groups ii and iii see rateiro et al 2016 for results of pure viv in catenary configuration the analysis methodology herein employed considered two complementary approaches the first one is a standard analysis in which both characteristic amplitude and spectral analysis are carried out for different instrumented sections the second one employs a modal decomposition scheme which allows to obtain modal amplitude time histories the present article is actually an improved and extended merged version of two previously published ones franzini et al 2016a b bringing new results at least to the authors knowledge experimental investigations focusing on the response of long cylinders subjected to simultaneous viv and top motion excitation have not been addressed in the literature the original results herein presented may then be used as benchmark for numerical and analytical investigations the paper is structured in 5 sections in this first one a brief literature review and the contextualization are presented in the following section the description of the experimental arrangement is addressed in section 3 the modal decomposition procedure is detailed the fourth section discusses the experimental results the last section addresses the conclusions 2 experimental arrangement and modal tests the experiments were carried out at the towing tank facility at são paulo state technological research institute ipt the towing tank is 240 m long 6 m wide and 4 m deep and can operate with towing speeds up to 4 5 m s the experimental arrangement is illustrated in fig 1 the cylindrical model was made of a flexible sylicon tube of external diameter d 22 2 mm and internal diameter d i 15 8 mm filled with stainless steel microspheres this solution brings a satisfactory level of dynamic similarity with a 8 inches steel riser specially structurally and inertially further details concerning the model design methodology can be found in rateiro et al 2012 the flexible cylinder was clamped vertically at both ends the values of bending stiffness e i and axial stiffness e a were experimentally determined by using the methodology based on large displacements of beams presented in franzini et al 2012b the geometrical and physical properties of the model are presented in table 1 in this table the mass per unit length does not take into account the added mass and the mass ratio parameter m is defined as the ratio between the mass of the cylinder and the mass of water displaced by the model modal structural damping ratio and natural frequencies in air ζ 1 a i r and f n n a i r and in still water ζ 1 and f n n obtained from decay tests see salles and pesce 2017 are also presented notice that the values of f n n are linearly proportional to the mode number n and that the modal damping ratio refer to the first natural mode modal reduced velocities are defined as 1 v r n u f n n d n 1 2 3 in the latter equation f n n are kept constant and possible changes due to variations in the added mass are not taken into account these variations and their effects on the effective natural frequencies and consequently in the true reduced velocities following the nomenclature adopted in dahl et al 2010 are left to further papers in this kind of experimental investigation it is common to evaluate displacements indirectly from strain gages pesce and fujarra 2000 chaplin et al 2005a b trim et al 2005 huera huarte and bearman 2009a b and song et al 2011 and or from accelerometers signals see huang et al 2011 and morooka and tsukada 2013 overcoming typical difficulties of indirect measurements systems in the present research project particularly in this investigation a direct technique was employed a total of 43 sections along the spanwise direction ξ z l 0 ξ 0 is the lower end of the model and ξ 0 1 is the top one were instrumented with reflective strip targets the in line and cross wise displacements x ξ t and y ξ t respectively were acquired by using a qualisys optical tracking system the uncertainty in the displacement measurements was smaller than 0 1 mm see salles and pesce 2017 a load cell hbm model s2 was used to measure the vertical force at the top of the model top motion was imposed by an in house servomotor device this paper focuses on the case of harmonic and monochromatic imposed motion with amplitude a t l 0 1 and two frequencies f t f n 1 2 1 and f t f n 1 3 1 owing to its practical application in offshore engineering experiments with irregular top motion excitation were carried out as well although important such experiments will not be herein discussed all the data were sampled at f s p 60 hz for 300 s after reaching a steady state regime the range of towing speeds was 0 03 u 0 28 m s leading to reynolds number in the interval 700 re 6100 at rest condition the axial force measured at the top is t t 40 n in the same condition the axial force at the lower end of the cylinder was evaluated considering the weight of the line and the buoyancy force as t b 19 n the model was not subjected to compression hence buckling phenomena were not observed in the present investigation 3 modal decomposition scheme modal decomposition is a common procedure in flexible cylinders viv analysis as can be seen for example in moe et al 2001 chaplin et al 2005b lie and kaasen 2006 huera huarte and gharib 2011 and shang et al 2014 consider that at an instant t j x ξ t j x ξ t j d and y ξ t j y ξ t j d represent the oscillatory part of the structural response in in line and cross wise directions respectively we project the functions x ξ t j and y ξ t j on a base b of modal functions ψ n z in which n represents the mode number and max ψ n ξ 1 as follow 2 x ξ t j n 1 a n x t j ψ n ξ 3 y ξ t j n 1 a n y t j ψ n ξ the modal weights a n x t j and a n y t j are calculated from eqs 4 and 5 and from assumed orthogonality conditions 4 a n x t j 0 1 x ξ t j ψ n ξ d ξ 0 1 ψ n ξ 2 d ξ 5 a n y t j 0 1 y ξ t j ψ n ξ d ξ 0 1 ψ n ξ 2 d ξ being ξ z l 0 computing the modal weights for all time instants the modal amplitude time histories can be obtained although the galerkin decomposition technique has been used before a number of times see for example chaplin et al 2005b it is herein readdressed highlighting similarities in modal response from the modal amplitude time histories the characteristic values a i y and a i x were computed by taking the averaged 10 highest peaks as in hover et al 1997 and franzini et al 2013 herein all displacement and modal amplitude time histories are normalized by the diameter and the dimensionless time is defined as t t f n 1 for simplicity sinusoidal functions will be employed aiming at representing the modes of the model hence ψ n ξ are written as 6 ψ n ξ sin n π ξ as discussed in rao et al 2010 sinusoidal functions can be used as a good approximation for the natural modes if the number of modes participating in the response is low indeed in the present analysis the number of relevant modes identified in the response is low up to the first four natural modes see section 4 even though the spanwise dependence on the axial tension leads to mode shapes which follows bessel functions pesce et al 1999 chaplin et al 2005b have also employed sinusoidal functions in a similar problem furthermore bessel functions form a non orthogonal base of representation rendering a not so simple projection procedure as that obtained from eqs 2 and 3 an interesting alternative approach to deal with this question is the use of bessel like modes proposed in mazzilli et al 2014 which are simpler than bessel ones the bessel like modes were obtained by means of an ingenious integral averaging procedure which incorporates both bending and axial stiffness effects into an equivalent normal force in fact sensitivity regarding the projection set is certainly an aspect that deserves detailed investigations and will be explored in further papers aiming at quantifying the difference between the measurements and the modal reconstruction a projection error measure may be defined for each towing speed as 7 e t 0 1 y ˆ r ξ t n m y ξ t d ξ max a y ξ where y ˆ r ξ t n m is the modal reconstruction using n m terms and a y ξ is the measured characteristic oscillation amplitude also computed by taking the averaged 10 highest peaks fig 2 a presents an example of reconstruction of the measured cross wise displacement at a certain instant t j as expected the increase of the number of modes used in the reconstruction leads to a better representation of the measured data an example of projection error time history is presented in fig 2 b in this case up to four terms the projection error is smaller than 0 04 4 results and discussions for the sake of organization this section is divided in two subsections in the first one subsection 4 1 the results are analyzed by means of a standard analysis procedure i e characteristic oscillation amplitudes are obtained from time histories measured along the cylinder span in subsection 4 2 flexible cylinder viv is discussed from the modal amplitude time histories special focus is put on a particular towing speed at which the lock in is expected to occur in the first vibration mode additionally discussions for other reduced velocities are also carried out 4 1 standard analysis consider a towing speed condition corresponding to a reduced velocity v r 1 u f n 1 d 5 7 this is a condition in which the first natural mode lock in is expected in line and cross wise displacement time histories corresponding to a point at ξ z l 0 0 43 are presented in fig 3 as expected fig 3 a indicates that the cross wise viv amplitude response under pure viv is steady and practically constant close to 0 6 d at a dominant frequency close to the first natural frequency considering the same top motion condition fig 3 b reveals a steady in line response with dominant frequency equal to twice the cross wise one and amplitude significantly lower than that the f t f n 1 2 1 top motion excitation roughly doubles the cross wise oscillations at this point as can be seen in fig 3 c a strong amplitude modulation may be also observed not revealed under pure viv most of the energy response is concentrated around f f n 1 1 though a small amount appears at f f n 1 2 i e at the parametric excitation frequency viv at the first mode is amplified by parametric resonance of mathieu type hence the combined effects of viv in the first mode in the cross wise direction is strongly enhanced by the principal mathieu s instability in fact under a pure 2 1 top motion excitation such kind of resonance had been revealed for mode numbers n 1 and 2 see franzini et al 2015 despite the principal mathieu s instability is characterized by oscillations in the first vibration mode the amplitude spectrum of the in line response presented in fig 3 d this particular point is enhanced by top motion in the frequency components f f n 1 1 2 and 4 it is important to emphasize that the numerical investigation presented in yuan et al 2018 also revealed an enhancement of the structural oscillations for the combined viv and f t f n 1 2 1 top motion excitation on the other hand new features are revealed for the f t f n 1 3 1 case see fig 3 e and f two distinct response frequencies can be easily observed in the cross wise oscillations i a higher one at f f n 1 3 a primary response to the excitation at mode n 3 and ii a lower one at f f n 1 1 both components are beatifully composed in fact in the f t f n 1 3 1 case steady response had been found under pure top motion excitation but only for mode number n 3 and not for n 1 or 2 see franzini et al 2015 now considering the in line response only the frequency component f f n 1 3 seems relevant it is also interesting to discuss the cross wise response along the cylinder fig 4 presents spanwise distributions of the characteristic non dimensional cross wise oscillation amplitude a y ξ and the non dimensional cross wise amplitude spectra s y ξ notice that this simple statistical approach may not be sufficient to deal with the rich dynamic behavior and the amplitude modulated character of the f t f n 1 2 1 case other methods for non stationary analysis as the hilbert huang transform see huang et al 1998 might be employed in further works comparing the f t f n 1 2 1 condition fig 4 c and d with the pure viv case fig 4 a and b an increase in the maximum oscillation amplitude is clear as this top motion condition is a favorable scenario for the principal mathieu s instability the results indicate that the parametric excitation enhances the flexible cylinder viv notice also qualitative changes in the s y ξ spectrum the no top motion case spectrum is narrow banded with dominant frequency close to f n 1 for the f t f n 1 2 1 case it is observed some spread of energy around f f n 1 1 besides contributions at f f n 1 2 the f t f n 1 3 1 case results are both quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from the no top motion results as shown in fig 4 e and f the third natural mode clearly appears in the structural response hence resonance of mode n 3 see franzini et al 2015 seems to coexist with the first mode viv at this reduced velocity notice also that the s y ξ spectrum is composed by a larger number of sub harmonics integer and fractional franzini et al 2014 if compared to the no top motion test fig 5 presents characteristic values of in line response and the corresponding amplitude spectra as functions of the spanwise coordinate ξ z l 0 at the same reduced velocities already investigated in this section considering the pure viv experiment shown in fig 5 a and b the maximum characteristic amplitude is close to 0 2 d the amplitude spectrum reveals predominance of the second vibration mode despite energy at frequency components f f n 1 1 and f f n 1 4 may be also identified similarly to what was found for the cross wise vibrations the top motion excitation at f t f n 1 2 1 increases the maximum characteristic in line oscillation furthermore such top motion excitation leads to a much richer spectral distribution of amplitude when compared to the no top motion case by comparing fig 5 b and d the dominant frequency is shifted from f f n 1 2 to f f n 1 1 which is for its turn the parametric excitation response in the principal mathieu s instability condition the in line results for the experiment with f t f n 1 3 1 are presented in fig 5 e and f it can be noticed a predominance of the response in the third vibration mode with some energy at frequency components f f n 1 1 2 and 4 fig 6 presents the scalograms of the oscillatory components of both cross wise and in line oscillations at reduced velocity v r 1 5 7 we firstly analyze the cross wise scalogram for the pure viv case shown in fig 6 a the vertical aspect of the colored map reveal a very well defined first mode standing waves pattern still considering the pure viv case fig 6 b indicates that in line oscillations correspond to a standing wave pattern but with the shape of the second vibration mode a top motion excitation at f t f n 1 2 1 leads to qualitative changes in the scalogram cross wise oscillations are also in the first vibration mode however the slope of the colored map indicates the presence of traveling bending waves as can be seen in fig 6 c the scalogram presented in fig 6 d shows a predominance of in line oscillations in the first vibration mode but in a less defined aspect than that obtained for example in pure viv cross wise oscillations considering the f t f n 1 3 1 case both in line and cross wise scalograms reveal a predominance of standing waves pattern in the third vibration mode see fig 6 e and f up to this point focus was put on a particular towing speed so that first mode lock in is expected however it is also interesting to investigate the trajectories in the horizontal plane along the model for different reduced velocities such plot is presented in fig 7 considering the pure viv tests eight shaped trajectories are clearly noticeable at v r 1 5 63 moreover topological changes of the trajectories observed along the model indicate phase shift between in line and cross wise oscillation at v r 1 8 11 the eight shaped trajectories are no longer noticeable being replaced by cross wise oscillations with larger characteristic amplitude when compared to the previous case the case at v r 1 13 7 corresponds to a second mode lock in v r 2 u f n 2 d 6 8 and eight shaped trajectories are also obtained top motion excitation at f t f n 1 2 1 causes an increase in the oscillation amplitudes in the whole model and for the three reduced velocities presented in fig 7 besides such increase the trajectories in the horizontal plane do not reveal a clear pattern this is also the case for the f t f n 1 3 1 condition 4 2 modal decomposition analysis this subsection starts with an illustrative example of how the modal analysis can be useful in viv analysis fig 8 shows a standard analysis of the cross wise displacements measured at ξ z l 0 0 22 fig 8 a presents the characteristic oscillation amplitude obtained by averaging the 10 highest peaks for reduced velocities v r 1 u f n 1 d 8 there is some qualitative agreement with the results obtained with a rigid cylinder elastically supported however due to the onset of the second natural mode lock in a classical lower branch for v r 1 8 is not observed in fact the non dimensional amplitude spectrum presented in fig 8 b reveals lock in at distinct natural modes depending on the value of v r 1 although interesting both graphics are not sufficient to discuss the contribution of the distinct natural modes in the flexible cylinder viv the modal decomposition appears as a useful scheme for the mentioned analysis and examples will be addressed below firstly we focus on the condition in which lock in is expected to occur in the first cross wise mode let us consider the experiments at roughly the same modal reduced velocity v r 1 5 7 discussed in the previous subsection for such an experimental condition it is natural to investigate oscillations by projecting the instantaneous deformed configuration of the flexible cylinder onto the first vibration mode herein approximated by ψ 1 in eq 6 on the other hand it is well known that for pure viv the in line frequency is twice that observed in the cross wise direction hence it is natural to investigate the in line response from the modal amplitude time history a 2 x fig 9 presents both a 1 y t and a 2 x t and the corresponding amplitude spectra for the conditions of pure viv and combined viv and top motion excitation for this particular condition fig 9 a shows that the pure viv case presents cross wise oscillations at the first natural mode with practically no amplitude modulation still considering the pure viv case fig 9 b reveals a much smaller value of a 2 x t when compared to that obtained for the cross wise direction furthermore the corresponding amplitude spectrum s 2 x is broadbanded and has three components at f f n 1 1 f f n 1 2 and f f n 1 3 considering now the f t f n 1 2 1 case and cross wise oscillations fig 9 c at the same reduced velocity besides a marked increase in the characteristic oscillation amplitude strong amplitude modulations in a 1 y t are observable such enhancement had also been observed from the time history of a particular target see fig 3 c and from the analysis of the characteristic oscillation amplitude observed in the flexible cylinder as presented in fig 4 c notice however that the analysis of these figures indicates which vibrating mode is subjected to amplitude modulations this aspect reinforces the use of modal decomposition as a complementary tool to the standard analysis scheme fig 9 d presents the modal amplitude time history a 2 x t for the f t f n 1 2 1 case the comparison between this latter time history and that obtained from the pure viv case fig 9 b reveals a marked similarity in the characteristic modal oscillation amplitude notice however that the frequency distribution is significantly distinct three frequencies appear in the f t f n 1 2 1 case whereas a single dominant frequency dominates the pure viv response finally fig 9 e shows that the modal amplitude time history a 1 y obtained at f t f n 1 3 1 has the same aspect observed under pure viv but with lower characteristic amplitudes the dominant frequency f f n 1 1 indicates that this modal response is dominated by the flow excitation when compared to the top motion one time history a 2 x t shown in fig 9 f is similar to a 1 y t despite the dominant frequency being f f n 1 3 still considering the f t f n 1 3 1 case the discussions made in subsection 4 1 revealed that the cross wise response at this top motion excitation indicates the presence of the third vibration mode hence it is natural to analyze a 3 y t and the corresponding amplitude spectrum such results are presented in fig 10 which clearly reveals that the oscillation in the third vibrating mode is steady and has a single dominant frequency slightly lower than f f n 1 3 for the sake of comparison with experimental data obtained with the same flexible model subjected only to top motion excitation the modal amplitude time histories associated with i 1 2 and 3 had dominant frequency f f n 1 3 see franzini et al 2015 it can be concluded that at simultaneous viv and top motion excitation at f t f n 1 3 oscillations in the first vibrating mode are dominated by the flow excitation while the top motion excitation governs the response in the third vibrating mode now in fig 11 we compare trajectories in the plane a 2 x t a 1 y t such plot is analogous to the classical trajectories in the x y plane commonly reported on viv studies revealing qualitative aspects regarding synchronization 3 3 in fact quantitative analyses shall investigate the phase shift between the time histories pikovsky et al 2001 in the flexible cylinder viv context such analysis was carried out by huera huarte and bearman 2009a and franzini et al 2016a although interesting this kind of analysis for the experiments with concomitant top motion and viv is left for a further work for the sake of conciseness of the present paper considering firstly the pure viv case presented in fig 11 a one can notice a very well defined eight shaped plot indicating a high level of synchronization between these modal amplitude time histories furthermore the shape of the plot defined by the phase shift between the time histories presents remarkable similarities with the findings for 2 dof rigid cylinders at similar reduced velocities see for example jauvtis and williamson 2004 and franzini et al 2013 fig 11 b and c present respectively the results obtained at f t f n 1 2 1 and f t f n 1 3 1 there is none well defined pattern what indicates that the top motion excitation affects the synchronization between cross wise oscillations in the first vibration mode and in line oscillations in the second vibration mode the last aspect to be discussed in this paper is the characteristic modal amplitude response a n x and a n y as functions of modal reduced velocity v r n firstly we discuss the case of pure viv considering the first four vibration modes fig 12 shows that the use of modal reduced velocity v r n collapses the results for the first four vibration modes in both cross wise and in line directions this experimental result corroborates the modal independence hypothesis commonly adopted in theoretical numerical investigations of flexible cylinders viv using phenomenological models now we discuss the effects of top motion excitation on the characteristic modal amplitude response fig 13 presents a 1 y for different top motion conditions such a plot allows identifying differences in the first mode characteristic amplitude as functions of the modal reduced velocity v r 1 it is clearly noticeable that the parametric excitation at f t f n 1 2 1 roughly doubles the characteristic oscillation amplitude in the whole v r 1 range in the pure top motion excitation case the condition with f t f n 1 2 1 led to the maximum oscillation modal oscillation amplitude associated with the first vibration mode as shown in franzini et al 2015 contrarily the top motion frequency with f t f n 1 3 1 decreases the characteristic oscillation amplitudes in the range v r 1 9 however in the range v r 1 9 a surprising upward trend is obtained for this latter top motion condition reaching values comparable to those obtained for the f t f n 1 2 1 case aiming at helping understanding this striking result fig 14 presents the modal amplitude time histories for the first vibration mode at v r 1 14 notice that at this reduced velocity a first mode lock in is surely not expected indeed the pure viv case fig 14 a presents low characteristic oscillation amplitude as expected however the cases with prescribed axial motion reveal a much broader spectral distribution still considering vibrations in the first mode but including the results with top motion excitation experiments fig 15 presents in line characteristic amplitudes a 1 x as functions of v r 1 the results for pure viv and for the f t f n 1 3 1 case indicate small in line oscillations in the first vibration mode this fact may be explained using experimental evidences for an elastically mounted rigid cylinder on the other hand similarly to what is observed for the cross wise modal amplitude time histories top motion excitation at f t f n 1 2 1 practically doubles the values of a 1 x for v r 1 12 considering now the cases with top excitation with f t f n 1 3 1 the a 1 x curve very well agrees with that obtained in the pure viv case up to v r 1 9 beyond this value an increasing trend in the characteristic amplitude is obtained after the discussion of the oscillations in the first vibration mode we change the focus to the analysis of the modal amplitude time histories corresponding to the second and to the third natural modes cross wise and in line characteristic modal amplitudes for n 2 and n 3 are presented in figs 16 and 17 as functions of modal reduced velocity v r 2 and v r 3 firstly we discuss the results obtained by using the modal projection scheme on the second vibration mode in the range 0 v r 2 8 fig 16 a shows that the results for pure viv agrees with those obtained at top excitation with f t f n 1 3 1 for cross wise oscillations fig 16 b reveals that the in line resonance observed in the pure viv case is not observed for the cases with imposed motion considering now the characteristic values of modal amplitude response corresponding to the third vibration mode in the range 0 v r 3 5 it is clearly visible that the top motion with f t f n 1 3 1 excites larger vibration amplitude values if compared to the other experimental conditions herein discussed for both cross wise fig 17 a and in line fig 17 b directions 5 conclusions experiments with a long flexible cylinder were carried out at a towing tank facility aiming at studying vortex induced vibration phenomenon in the presence of imposed harmonic top motion of frequency f t and amplitude a t it was found that the top motion excitation significantly affects the flexible cylinder dynamics when compared to the pure viv condition an optical tracking system measured the cartesian coordinates of 43 points along the model two kinds of time histories were analyzed and discussed namely the displacement time histories at particular positions along the model standard analysis and the modal amplitude time histories obtained after the application of a garlerkin s scheme to the data at least to the authors knowledge experimental analysis of concomitant viv and top motion excitation is not found in the literature and may be viewed as the major contribution of this paper therefore the authors strongly believe that the present experimental results can be used as a benchmark for analytical and numerical investigations on this very important problem which is typically found in the offshore engineering focus was put on a condition in which the lock in with the first vibration mode was expected it was investigated a towing speed condition such that the reduced velocity based on the first natural frequency in still water f n 1 was v r 1 5 7 standard analysis revealed that the imposed motion significantly affects the model response amplitude modulations as well as an enrichment of the amplitude spectra were observed these results may be of importance to the dynamics of risers and tlp s tethers the modal decomposition scheme employed allowed to identify some interesting aspects a first example is related to the variation of the characteristic modal amplitude responses a n y and a n x with the modal reduced velocity v r n i e based on the natural frequency of the mode n in the case of pure viv the curves of both a n y and a n x as functions of v r n present good agreement up to the fourth vibration mode on the other hand such agreement was not obtained for experiments with concomitant viv and top motion excitation as an illustrative example the values of a 1 y were significantly increased in the whole range of towing speed tested for the f t f n 1 2 1 case contrarily at f t f n 1 3 1 a 1 y were lower than those obtained for pure viv however only for v r 1 10 still considering this same top motion frequency modal oscillation amplitudes of order of one diameter were obtained for reduced velocities larger than v r 1 14 besides changes in the characteristic oscillation amplitudes the top motion excitation modified the spectral content of the displacement time histories further work may include the analysis of mode transitions response jumps and synchronization analysis of vibrations at different modes and directions as well as a deeper analysis of the experiments with a catenary configuration modal decomposition analysis may be also addressed further by using other approximation sets such as for example bessel modes or bessel like modes presented in mazzilli et al 2014 another experimental campaign is also planned aiming a deeper investigation regarding the influence of both amplitude and frequency of the imposed top motion on the flexible cylinder response thus

increase in the oscillation amplitudes for the whole range of towing speed tested keywords vortex induced vibrations vertical flexible cylinder top motion effect experiments modal analysis 1 introduction viv is a fluid structure interaction phenomenon that has received attention from both academic and industrial communities comprehensive reviews regarding viv can be found for example in the papers by bearman 1984 2011 sarpkaya 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 and gabbai and benaroya 2005 up to the 2000 s viv was mostly investigated for rigid cylinders mounted on elastic supports allowing displacements only in the cross wise direction i e the direction transverse to the free stream direction for low values of the combined mass damping parameter m ζ m is the ratio between the oscillating mass and the mass of fluid displaced by the cylinder and ζ is the damping ratio khalak and williamson 1999 emphasized the existence of three distinct branches initial upper and lower branches in the oscillation amplitude curve versus reduced velocity v r u f n d u is the free stream velocity f n is the natural frequency in still water and d is the diameter other aspects investigated for the one degree of freedom 1 dof system with low mass parameter are the effects of the reynolds number on the amplitude peak govardhan and williamson 2006 and the amplification of the force coefficients within the lock in range sarpkaya 1995 khalak and williamson 1999 and franzini et al 2012a motivated by new technological demands especially those from the offshore industry the problem of a rigid cylinder elastically mounted on two degrees of freedom 2 dof apparatuses has received attention from several research groups considering a system with m 6 jauvtis and williamson 2004 pointed out that the in line oscillations strongly affect the vortex shedding pattern and also increase the maximum cross wise oscillation amplitude additionally the parametric experimental investigations described in stappenbelt and lalji 2008 showed that the in line oscillations become negligible for the conditions in which the combined parameter m ζ 0 066 particularly in the risers dynamics scenario the investigations on viv of flexible cylinders are crucial matters in structural design a comprehensive literature review concerning viv on long and flexible cylinders can be found in wu et al 2012 considering firstly the experimental approach pesce and fujarra 2000 studied viv on a cantilevered cylinder and observed that the peak of the first mode amplitude response was shifted to a higher value of v r when compared to the 1 dof results a few years latter pesce and fujarra 2005 replotted those results onto jauvtis and williamson 2004 obtained with a 2 dof rigid cylinder revealing a remarkable similarity in fujarra et al 2001 experiments with a cantilevered cylinder with distinct stiffness in the in line and cross wise directions were analyzed among other aspects the authors reported the existence of a high speed mode of response outside the principal synchronization regime this high speed mode is associated to the in line cross wise coupling combined to bending torsional responses chaplin et al 2005a b present experimental results of a long flexible cylinder subjected to a stepped current and comparisons with numerical codes developed by several researches groups in these papers only the lower segment of the model was subjected to the free stream whereas the upper part was kept immersed inside a vacuum tank similar experiments are described in huera huarte et al 2006 huera huarte and bearman 2009a b with the cylinder immersed only in its lower portion field experiments described in vandiver et al 2009 pointed out that the geometric stiffness provides a favorable scenario for the appearance of traveling waves instead of stationary wave patterns huang et al 2011 investigated the amplification of the mean drag coefficient due the viv in flexible cylinders the viv of flexible cylinders was also studied using computational fluids dynamics cfd the papers written by willden and graham 2001 2004 pointed out that the added mass may play an important role in the structural oscillations yamamoto et al 2004 employed the discrete vortex method dvm aiming at investigating the response of a flexible model to a sheared current profile shear flow excitation was also the focus of the direct numerical simulations dns described in bourguet et al 2011 who pointed out among others aspects a mixture of standing and traveling waves bourguet et al 2012 investigated mono and multi frequency response of a flexible cylinder subjected to shear flow the authors emphasize that the transition between these two response behaviors are affected by the in line static curvature which depends on the mean drag force acting along the line from the analytical point of view non linear equations are employed as a way to emulate the self excited and self limited character of viv one of the first papers on this subject is iwan and blevins 1974 which employed the van der pol equation as a phenomenological model for the fluid oscillator facchinetti et al 2004a showed that the phenomenological model can capture some features of the 1 dof viv recently the phenomenological models have been employed jointly with structural dynamics equations aiming at describing viv of long and flexible models this kind of model is faster than 3d cfd ones and is commonly used in numerical codes for offshore applications the phenomenological models were employed aiming at investigating several aspects of interest of risers dynamics such as traveling waves facchinetti et al 2004b and the relation between mean top tension and multi modal viv response silveira et al 2007 gu et al 2013 in the offshore engineering scenario risers and tension leg platforms tlp tendons are usually driven at the hang off point by free surface waves motions of the floating unity such imposed top motions lead to temporal variation of the tension along the riser as the lateral stiffness of risers and tlp s tethers are tension dominated these structures may be subjected to parametric excitation caused by the dependence of the stiffness on time from the mathematical point of view systems in which one of the parameters of the equation of motion is explicitly dependent on time are subjected to parametric excitation particularly if the stiffness varies harmonically with time the equation of motion is recognized as a mathieu s equation depending on the combination of the parameters governing the mathieu s equation the trivial solution may be stable or unstable a straightforward way to check the stability of the trivial solution is by means of the strutt s diagram the textbooks by nayfeh and mook 1979 and meirovitch 2003 present detailed analysis regarding the mathieu s equation and the strutt s diagram investigations on parametric excitation in risers and tlps tethers can be found for example in rainey 1977 mazzilli 1985 patel and park 1991 simos and pesce 1997 franzini et al 2015 franzini and mazzilli 2016 and franzini et al 2016c a particular scenario for mathieu s instability is that in which stiffness oscillates with twice the natural frequency this condition is defined in the present paper as principal mathieu s instability tension modulations driven by prescribed top motions are the technological motivation of this paper the scientific motivation arises from the fact that the effects of tension modulation on viv are not commonly found in the literature examples of numerical investigations on this subject are silveira et al 2007 joseffson and dalton 2010 and yuan et al 2018 among other aspects the very recent paper by yuan et al 2018 points out the presence of amplitude modulated and multi frequencies responses these aspects are also verified in the experimental results herein presented experiments presented in franzini et al 2014 with a flexible cylinder immersed only in its lower portion had already revealed some effects of the prescribed top motion on the viv response the results discussed in the present paper comes from a rather comprehensive research project on non linear dynamics of risers conducted at escola politécnica of university of são paulo in the years 2010 2013 which covered thoeretical modeling and experimental investigations within the experimental approach three groups of experiments with a long and immersed flexible cylinder were carried out for two arrangements vertical and catenary configurations namely i pure top motion ii pure viv iii concomitant viv and top motion details may be found in pesce et al 2013 and pesce 2013 aiming at contributing to a better understanding of combined effects of current and parametric excitation the focus here is to present experimental results of viv of a vertical and flexible cylinder subjected to concomitant uniform free stream profile and prescribed top motions groups ii and iii see rateiro et al 2016 for results of pure viv in catenary configuration the analysis methodology herein employed considered two complementary approaches the first one is a standard analysis in which both characteristic amplitude and spectral analysis are carried out for different instrumented sections the second one employs a modal decomposition scheme which allows to obtain modal amplitude time histories the present article is actually an improved and extended merged version of two previously published ones franzini et al 2016a b bringing new results at least to the authors knowledge experimental investigations focusing on the response of long cylinders subjected to simultaneous viv and top motion excitation have not been addressed in the literature the original results herein presented may then be used as benchmark for numerical and analytical investigations the paper is structured in 5 sections in this first one a brief literature review and the contextualization are presented in the following section the description of the experimental arrangement is addressed in section 3 the modal decomposition procedure is detailed the fourth section discusses the experimental results the last section addresses the conclusions 2 experimental arrangement and modal tests the experiments were carried out at the towing tank facility at são paulo state technological research institute ipt the towing tank is 240 m long 6 m wide and 4 m deep and can operate with towing speeds up to 4 5 m s the experimental arrangement is illustrated in fig 1 the cylindrical model was made of a flexible sylicon tube of external diameter d 22 2 mm and internal diameter d i 15 8 mm filled with stainless steel microspheres this solution brings a satisfactory level of dynamic similarity with a 8 inches steel riser specially structurally and inertially further details concerning the model design methodology can be found in rateiro et al 2012 the flexible cylinder was clamped vertically at both ends the values of bending stiffness e i and axial stiffness e a were experimentally determined by using the methodology based on large displacements of beams presented in franzini et al 2012b the geometrical and physical properties of the model are presented in table 1 in this table the mass per unit length does not take into account the added mass and the mass ratio parameter m is defined as the ratio between the mass of the cylinder and the mass of water displaced by the model modal structural damping ratio and natural frequencies in air ζ 1 a i r and f n n a i r and in still water ζ 1 and f n n obtained from decay tests see salles and pesce 2017 are also presented notice that the values of f n n are linearly proportional to the mode number n and that the modal damping ratio refer to the first natural mode modal reduced velocities are defined as 1 v r n u f n n d n 1 2 3 in the latter equation f n n are kept constant and possible changes due to variations in the added mass are not taken into account these variations and their effects on the effective natural frequencies and consequently in the true reduced velocities following the nomenclature adopted in dahl et al 2010 are left to further papers in this kind of experimental investigation it is common to evaluate displacements indirectly from strain gages pesce and fujarra 2000 chaplin et al 2005a b trim et al 2005 huera huarte and bearman 2009a b and song et al 2011 and or from accelerometers signals see huang et al 2011 and morooka and tsukada 2013 overcoming typical difficulties of indirect measurements systems in the present research project particularly in this investigation a direct technique was employed a total of 43 sections along the spanwise direction ξ z l 0 ξ 0 is the lower end of the model and ξ 0 1 is the top one were instrumented with reflective strip targets the in line and cross wise displacements x ξ t and y ξ t respectively were acquired by using a qualisys optical tracking system the uncertainty in the displacement measurements was smaller than 0 1 mm see salles and pesce 2017 a load cell hbm model s2 was used to measure the vertical force at the top of the model top motion was imposed by an in house servomotor device this paper focuses on the case of harmonic and monochromatic imposed motion with amplitude a t l 0 1 and two frequencies f t f n 1 2 1 and f t f n 1 3 1 owing to its practical application in offshore engineering experiments with irregular top motion excitation were carried out as well although important such experiments will not be herein discussed all the data were sampled at f s p 60 hz for 300 s after reaching a steady state regime the range of towing speeds was 0 03 u 0 28 m s leading to reynolds number in the interval 700 re 6100 at rest condition the axial force measured at the top is t t 40 n in the same condition the axial force at the lower end of the cylinder was evaluated considering the weight of the line and the buoyancy force as t b 19 n the model was not subjected to compression hence buckling phenomena were not observed in the present investigation 3 modal decomposition scheme modal decomposition is a common procedure in flexible cylinders viv analysis as can be seen for example in moe et al 2001 chaplin et al 2005b lie and kaasen 2006 huera huarte and gharib 2011 and shang et al 2014 consider that at an instant t j x ξ t j x ξ t j d and y ξ t j y ξ t j d represent the oscillatory part of the structural response in in line and cross wise directions respectively we project the functions x ξ t j and y ξ t j on a base b of modal functions ψ n z in which n represents the mode number and max ψ n ξ 1 as follow 2 x ξ t j n 1 a n x t j ψ n ξ 3 y ξ t j n 1 a n y t j ψ n ξ the modal weights a n x t j and a n y t j are calculated from eqs 4 and 5 and from assumed orthogonality conditions 4 a n x t j 0 1 x ξ t j ψ n ξ d ξ 0 1 ψ n ξ 2 d ξ 5 a n y t j 0 1 y ξ t j ψ n ξ d ξ 0 1 ψ n ξ 2 d ξ being ξ z l 0 computing the modal weights for all time instants the modal amplitude time histories can be obtained although the galerkin decomposition technique has been used before a number of times see for example chaplin et al 2005b it is herein readdressed highlighting similarities in modal response from the modal amplitude time histories the characteristic values a i y and a i x were computed by taking the averaged 10 highest peaks as in hover et al 1997 and franzini et al 2013 herein all displacement and modal amplitude time histories are normalized by the diameter and the dimensionless time is defined as t t f n 1 for simplicity sinusoidal functions will be employed aiming at representing the modes of the model hence ψ n ξ are written as 6 ψ n ξ sin n π ξ as discussed in rao et al 2010 sinusoidal functions can be used as a good approximation for the natural modes if the number of modes participating in the response is low indeed in the present analysis the number of relevant modes identified in the response is low up to the first four natural modes see section 4 even though the spanwise dependence on the axial tension leads to mode shapes which follows bessel functions pesce et al 1999 chaplin et al 2005b have also employed sinusoidal functions in a similar problem furthermore bessel functions form a non orthogonal base of representation rendering a not so simple projection procedure as that obtained from eqs 2 and 3 an interesting alternative approach to deal with this question is the use of bessel like modes proposed in mazzilli et al 2014 which are simpler than bessel ones the bessel like modes were obtained by means of an ingenious integral averaging procedure which incorporates both bending and axial stiffness effects into an equivalent normal force in fact sensitivity regarding the projection set is certainly an aspect that deserves detailed investigations and will be explored in further papers aiming at quantifying the difference between the measurements and the modal reconstruction a projection error measure may be defined for each towing speed as 7 e t 0 1 y ˆ r ξ t n m y ξ t d ξ max a y ξ where y ˆ r ξ t n m is the modal reconstruction using n m terms and a y ξ is the measured characteristic oscillation amplitude also computed by taking the averaged 10 highest peaks fig 2 a presents an example of reconstruction of the measured cross wise displacement at a certain instant t j as expected the increase of the number of modes used in the reconstruction leads to a better representation of the measured data an example of projection error time history is presented in fig 2 b in this case up to four terms the projection error is smaller than 0 04 4 results and discussions for the sake of organization this section is divided in two subsections in the first one subsection 4 1 the results are analyzed by means of a standard analysis procedure i e characteristic oscillation amplitudes are obtained from time histories measured along the cylinder span in subsection 4 2 flexible cylinder viv is discussed from the modal amplitude time histories special focus is put on a particular towing speed at which the lock in is expected to occur in the first vibration mode additionally discussions for other reduced velocities are also carried out 4 1 standard analysis consider a towing speed condition corresponding to a reduced velocity v r 1 u f n 1 d 5 7 this is a condition in which the first natural mode lock in is expected in line and cross wise displacement time histories corresponding to a point at ξ z l 0 0 43 are presented in fig 3 as expected fig 3 a indicates that the cross wise viv amplitude response under pure viv is steady and practically constant close to 0 6 d at a dominant frequency close to the first natural frequency considering the same top motion condition fig 3 b reveals a steady in line response with dominant frequency equal to twice the cross wise one and amplitude significantly lower than that the f t f n 1 2 1 top motion excitation roughly doubles the cross wise oscillations at this point as can be seen in fig 3 c a strong amplitude modulation may be also observed not revealed under pure viv most of the energy response is concentrated around f f n 1 1 though a small amount appears at f f n 1 2 i e at the parametric excitation frequency viv at the first mode is amplified by parametric resonance of mathieu type hence the combined effects of viv in the first mode in the cross wise direction is strongly enhanced by the principal mathieu s instability in fact under a pure 2 1 top motion excitation such kind of resonance had been revealed for mode numbers n 1 and 2 see franzini et al 2015 despite the principal mathieu s instability is characterized by oscillations in the first vibration mode the amplitude spectrum of the in line response presented in fig 3 d this particular point is enhanced by top motion in the frequency components f f n 1 1 2 and 4 it is important to emphasize that the numerical investigation presented in yuan et al 2018 also revealed an enhancement of the structural oscillations for the combined viv and f t f n 1 2 1 top motion excitation on the other hand new features are revealed for the f t f n 1 3 1 case see fig 3 e and f two distinct response frequencies can be easily observed in the cross wise oscillations i a higher one at f f n 1 3 a primary response to the excitation at mode n 3 and ii a lower one at f f n 1 1 both components are beatifully composed in fact in the f t f n 1 3 1 case steady response had been found under pure top motion excitation but only for mode number n 3 and not for n 1 or 2 see franzini et al 2015 now considering the in line response only the frequency component f f n 1 3 seems relevant it is also interesting to discuss the cross wise response along the cylinder fig 4 presents spanwise distributions of the characteristic non dimensional cross wise oscillation amplitude a y ξ and the non dimensional cross wise amplitude spectra s y ξ notice that this simple statistical approach may not be sufficient to deal with the rich dynamic behavior and the amplitude modulated character of the f t f n 1 2 1 case other methods for non stationary analysis as the hilbert huang transform see huang et al 1998 might be employed in further works comparing the f t f n 1 2 1 condition fig 4 c and d with the pure viv case fig 4 a and b an increase in the maximum oscillation amplitude is clear as this top motion condition is a favorable scenario for the principal mathieu s instability the results indicate that the parametric excitation enhances the flexible cylinder viv notice also qualitative changes in the s y ξ spectrum the no top motion case spectrum is narrow banded with dominant frequency close to f n 1 for the f t f n 1 2 1 case it is observed some spread of energy around f f n 1 1 besides contributions at f f n 1 2 the f t f n 1 3 1 case results are both quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from the no top motion results as shown in fig 4 e and f the third natural mode clearly appears in the structural response hence resonance of mode n 3 see franzini et al 2015 seems to coexist with the first mode viv at this reduced velocity notice also that the s y ξ spectrum is composed by a larger number of sub harmonics integer and fractional franzini et al 2014 if compared to the no top motion test fig 5 presents characteristic values of in line response and the corresponding amplitude spectra as functions of the spanwise coordinate ξ z l 0 at the same reduced velocities already investigated in this section considering the pure viv experiment shown in fig 5 a and b the maximum characteristic amplitude is close to 0 2 d the amplitude spectrum reveals predominance of the second vibration mode despite energy at frequency components f f n 1 1 and f f n 1 4 may be also identified similarly to what was found for the cross wise vibrations the top motion excitation at f t f n 1 2 1 increases the maximum characteristic in line oscillation furthermore such top motion excitation leads to a much richer spectral distribution of amplitude when compared to the no top motion case by comparing fig 5 b and d the dominant frequency is shifted from f f n 1 2 to f f n 1 1 which is for its turn the parametric excitation response in the principal mathieu s instability condition the in line results for the experiment with f t f n 1 3 1 are presented in fig 5 e and f it can be noticed a predominance of the response in the third vibration mode with some energy at frequency components f f n 1 1 2 and 4 fig 6 presents the scalograms of the oscillatory components of both cross wise and in line oscillations at reduced velocity v r 1 5 7 we firstly analyze the cross wise scalogram for the pure viv case shown in fig 6 a the vertical aspect of the colored map reveal a very well defined first mode standing waves pattern still considering the pure viv case fig 6 b indicates that in line oscillations correspond to a standing wave pattern but with the shape of the second vibration mode a top motion excitation at f t f n 1 2 1 leads to qualitative changes in the scalogram cross wise oscillations are also in the first vibration mode however the slope of the colored map indicates the presence of traveling bending waves as can be seen in fig 6 c the scalogram presented in fig 6 d shows a predominance of in line oscillations in the first vibration mode but in a less defined aspect than that obtained for example in pure viv cross wise oscillations considering the f t f n 1 3 1 case both in line and cross wise scalograms reveal a predominance of standing waves pattern in the third vibration mode see fig 6 e and f up to this point focus was put on a particular towing speed so that first mode lock in is expected however it is also interesting to investigate the trajectories in the horizontal plane along the model for different reduced velocities such plot is presented in fig 7 considering the pure viv tests eight shaped trajectories are clearly noticeable at v r 1 5 63 moreover topological changes of the trajectories observed along the model indicate phase shift between in line and cross wise oscillation at v r 1 8 11 the eight shaped trajectories are no longer noticeable being replaced by cross wise oscillations with larger characteristic amplitude when compared to the previous case the case at v r 1 13 7 corresponds to a second mode lock in v r 2 u f n 2 d 6 8 and eight shaped trajectories are also obtained top motion excitation at f t f n 1 2 1 causes an increase in the oscillation amplitudes in the whole model and for the three reduced velocities presented in fig 7 besides such increase the trajectories in the horizontal plane do not reveal a clear pattern this is also the case for the f t f n 1 3 1 condition 4 2 modal decomposition analysis this subsection starts with an illustrative example of how the modal analysis can be useful in viv analysis fig 8 shows a standard analysis of the cross wise displacements measured at ξ z l 0 0 22 fig 8 a presents the characteristic oscillation amplitude obtained by averaging the 10 highest peaks for reduced velocities v r 1 u f n 1 d 8 there is some qualitative agreement with the results obtained with a rigid cylinder elastically supported however due to the onset of the second natural mode lock in a classical lower branch for v r 1 8 is not observed in fact the non dimensional amplitude spectrum presented in fig 8 b reveals lock in at distinct natural modes depending on the value of v r 1 although interesting both graphics are not sufficient to discuss the contribution of the distinct natural modes in the flexible cylinder viv the modal decomposition appears as a useful scheme for the mentioned analysis and examples will be addressed below firstly we focus on the condition in which lock in is expected to occur in the first cross wise mode let us consider the experiments at roughly the same modal reduced velocity v r 1 5 7 discussed in the previous subsection for such an experimental condition it is natural to investigate oscillations by projecting the instantaneous deformed configuration of the flexible cylinder onto the first vibration mode herein approximated by ψ 1 in eq 6 on the other hand it is well known that for pure viv the in line frequency is twice that observed in the cross wise direction hence it is natural to investigate the in line response from the modal amplitude time history a 2 x fig 9 presents both a 1 y t and a 2 x t and the corresponding amplitude spectra for the conditions of pure viv and combined viv and top motion excitation for this particular condition fig 9 a shows that the pure viv case presents cross wise oscillations at the first natural mode with practically no amplitude modulation still considering the pure viv case fig 9 b reveals a much smaller value of a 2 x t when compared to that obtained for the cross wise direction furthermore the corresponding amplitude spectrum s 2 x is broadbanded and has three components at f f n 1 1 f f n 1 2 and f f n 1 3 considering now the f t f n 1 2 1 case and cross wise oscillations fig 9 c at the same reduced velocity besides a marked increase in the characteristic oscillation amplitude strong amplitude modulations in a 1 y t are observable such enhancement had also been observed from the time history of a particular target see fig 3 c and from the analysis of the characteristic oscillation amplitude observed in the flexible cylinder as presented in fig 4 c notice however that the analysis of these figures indicates which vibrating mode is subjected to amplitude modulations this aspect reinforces the use of modal decomposition as a complementary tool to the standard analysis scheme fig 9 d presents the modal amplitude time history a 2 x t for the f t f n 1 2 1 case the comparison between this latter time history and that obtained from the pure viv case fig 9 b reveals a marked similarity in the characteristic modal oscillation amplitude notice however that the frequency distribution is significantly distinct three frequencies appear in the f t f n 1 2 1 case whereas a single dominant frequency dominates the pure viv response finally fig 9 e shows that the modal amplitude time history a 1 y obtained at f t f n 1 3 1 has the same aspect observed under pure viv but with lower characteristic amplitudes the dominant frequency f f n 1 1 indicates that this modal response is dominated by the flow excitation when compared to the top motion one time history a 2 x t shown in fig 9 f is similar to a 1 y t despite the dominant frequency being f f n 1 3 still considering the f t f n 1 3 1 case the discussions made in subsection 4 1 revealed that the cross wise response at this top motion excitation indicates the presence of the third vibration mode hence it is natural to analyze a 3 y t and the corresponding amplitude spectrum such results are presented in fig 10 which clearly reveals that the oscillation in the third vibrating mode is steady and has a single dominant frequency slightly lower than f f n 1 3 for the sake of comparison with experimental data obtained with the same flexible model subjected only to top motion excitation the modal amplitude time histories associated with i 1 2 and 3 had dominant frequency f f n 1 3 see franzini et al 2015 it can be concluded that at simultaneous viv and top motion excitation at f t f n 1 3 oscillations in the first vibrating mode are dominated by the flow excitation while the top motion excitation governs the response in the third vibrating mode now in fig 11 we compare trajectories in the plane a 2 x t a 1 y t such plot is analogous to the classical trajectories in the x y plane commonly reported on viv studies revealing qualitative aspects regarding synchronization 3 3 in fact quantitative analyses shall investigate the phase shift between the time histories pikovsky et al 2001 in the flexible cylinder viv context such analysis was carried out by huera huarte and bearman 2009a and franzini et al 2016a although interesting this kind of analysis for the experiments with concomitant top motion and viv is left for a further work for the sake of conciseness of the present paper considering firstly the pure viv case presented in fig 11 a one can notice a very well defined eight shaped plot indicating a high level of synchronization between these modal amplitude time histories furthermore the shape of the plot defined by the phase shift between the time histories presents remarkable similarities with the findings for 2 dof rigid cylinders at similar reduced velocities see for example jauvtis and williamson 2004 and franzini et al 2013 fig 11 b and c present respectively the results obtained at f t f n 1 2 1 and f t f n 1 3 1 there is none well defined pattern what indicates that the top motion excitation affects the synchronization between cross wise oscillations in the first vibration mode and in line oscillations in the second vibration mode the last aspect to be discussed in this paper is the characteristic modal amplitude response a n x and a n y as functions of modal reduced velocity v r n firstly we discuss the case of pure viv considering the first four vibration modes fig 12 shows that the use of modal reduced velocity v r n collapses the results for the first four vibration modes in both cross wise and in line directions this experimental result corroborates the modal independence hypothesis commonly adopted in theoretical numerical investigations of flexible cylinders viv using phenomenological models now we discuss the effects of top motion excitation on the characteristic modal amplitude response fig 13 presents a 1 y for different top motion conditions such a plot allows identifying differences in the first mode characteristic amplitude as functions of the modal reduced velocity v r 1 it is clearly noticeable that the parametric excitation at f t f n 1 2 1 roughly doubles the characteristic oscillation amplitude in the whole v r 1 range in the pure top motion excitation case the condition with f t f n 1 2 1 led to the maximum oscillation modal oscillation amplitude associated with the first vibration mode as shown in franzini et al 2015 contrarily the top motion frequency with f t f n 1 3 1 decreases the characteristic oscillation amplitudes in the range v r 1 9 however in the range v r 1 9 a surprising upward trend is obtained for this latter top motion condition reaching values comparable to those obtained for the f t f n 1 2 1 case aiming at helping understanding this striking result fig 14 presents the modal amplitude time histories for the first vibration mode at v r 1 14 notice that at this reduced velocity a first mode lock in is surely not expected indeed the pure viv case fig 14 a presents low characteristic oscillation amplitude as expected however the cases with prescribed axial motion reveal a much broader spectral distribution still considering vibrations in the first mode but including the results with top motion excitation experiments fig 15 presents in line characteristic amplitudes a 1 x as functions of v r 1 the results for pure viv and for the f t f n 1 3 1 case indicate small in line oscillations in the first vibration mode this fact may be explained using experimental evidences for an elastically mounted rigid cylinder on the other hand similarly to what is observed for the cross wise modal amplitude time histories top motion excitation at f t f n 1 2 1 practically doubles the values of a 1 x for v r 1 12 considering now the cases with top excitation with f t f n 1 3 1 the a 1 x curve very well agrees with that obtained in the pure viv case up to v r 1 9 beyond this value an increasing trend in the characteristic amplitude is obtained after the discussion of the oscillations in the first vibration mode we change the focus to the analysis of the modal amplitude time histories corresponding to the second and to the third natural modes cross wise and in line characteristic modal amplitudes for n 2 and n 3 are presented in figs 16 and 17 as functions of modal reduced velocity v r 2 and v r 3 firstly we discuss the results obtained by using the modal projection scheme on the second vibration mode in the range 0 v r 2 8 fig 16 a shows that the results for pure viv agrees with those obtained at top excitation with f t f n 1 3 1 for cross wise oscillations fig 16 b reveals that the in line resonance observed in the pure viv case is not observed for the cases with imposed motion considering now the characteristic values of modal amplitude response corresponding to the third vibration mode in the range 0 v r 3 5 it is clearly visible that the top motion with f t f n 1 3 1 excites larger vibration amplitude values if compared to the other experimental conditions herein discussed for both cross wise fig 17 a and in line fig 17 b directions 5 conclusions experiments with a long flexible cylinder were carried out at a towing tank facility aiming at studying vortex induced vibration phenomenon in the presence of imposed harmonic top motion of frequency f t and amplitude a t it was found that the top motion excitation significantly affects the flexible cylinder dynamics when compared to the pure viv condition an optical tracking system measured the cartesian coordinates of 43 points along the model two kinds of time histories were analyzed and discussed namely the displacement time histories at particular positions along the model standard analysis and the modal amplitude time histories obtained after the application of a garlerkin s scheme to the data at least to the authors knowledge experimental analysis of concomitant viv and top motion excitation is not found in the literature and may be viewed as the major contribution of this paper therefore the authors strongly believe that the present experimental results can be used as a benchmark for analytical and numerical investigations on this very important problem which is typically found in the offshore engineering focus was put on a condition in which the lock in with the first vibration mode was expected it was investigated a towing speed condition such that the reduced velocity based on the first natural frequency in still water f n 1 was v r 1 5 7 standard analysis revealed that the imposed motion significantly affects the model response amplitude modulations as well as an enrichment of the amplitude spectra were observed these results may be of importance to the dynamics of risers and tlp s tethers the modal decomposition scheme employed allowed to identify some interesting aspects a first example is related to the variation of the characteristic modal amplitude responses a n y and a n x with the modal reduced velocity v r n i e based on the natural frequency of the mode n in the case of pure viv the curves of both a n y and a n x as functions of v r n present good agreement up to the fourth vibration mode on the other hand such agreement was not obtained for experiments with concomitant viv and top motion excitation as an illustrative example the values of a 1 y were significantly increased in the whole range of towing speed tested for the f t f n 1 2 1 case contrarily at f t f n 1 3 1 a 1 y were lower than those obtained for pure viv however only for v r 1 10 still considering this same top motion frequency modal oscillation amplitudes of order of one diameter were obtained for reduced velocities larger than v r 1 14 besides changes in the characteristic oscillation amplitudes the top motion excitation modified the spectral content of the displacement time histories further work may include the analysis of mode transitions response jumps and synchronization analysis of vibrations at different modes and directions as well as a deeper analysis of the experiments with a catenary configuration modal decomposition analysis may be also addressed further by using other approximation sets such as for example bessel modes or bessel like modes presented in mazzilli et al 2014 another experimental campaign is also planned aiming a deeper investigation regarding the influence of both amplitude and frequency of the imposed top motion on the flexible cylinder response thus
