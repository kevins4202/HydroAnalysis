2130,in the gully land reclamation project conducted in yan an china shallow failure in the middle of loess filled slopes is caused by the unsaturated seepage of rainwater along the internal interface between the original loess slopes and the loess filled slopes although the phenomenon was observed through model test the particular nature of the unsaturated seepage mechanism remains unclear to explore this mechanism we carried out an intermittent rainfall model test on a loess filled slope and the volume water content in different areas was continuously monitored based on the monitored data the unsaturated seepage process and mechanism in the internal interface was analyzed by adopting the fredlund and xing model and the childs and collis geroge model the results indicate that a water accumulation phenome occurs in the middle area of loess filled slope because of low matric suction in the middle area and high matric suction in the bottom area in addition the dynamic process of pore growth and shrinkage at different areas prevents seepage to the bottom area furthermore the regularity of pores at the interface during intermittent rainfall is summarized from a macroscopic perspective based on the matric suction and permeability coefficient the unsaturated seepage process and mechanism affected by knudsen diffusion are revealed because of the presence of unsaturated seepage a shallow failure appears in the middle area of a loess filled slope the results have a significant impact on the field applications of interfacial impermeable prevention measures keywords gully land reclamation loess filled slope unsaturated seepage mechanism internal interface intermittent rainfall data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the topography of the loess plateau of china consists mostly of hills and gullies and most areas are not suitable for construction what s more its steep terrain is not suitable for crop growth either this prevents the development of both industry and agriculture in an attempt to deal with this yan an shaanxi province which is located in the loess plateau fig 1 a implemented the gully land reclamation project in 2013 to expand the available arable land kang et al 2021 the project has promoted local economic development and increased the amount of cultivated area covering a wide range of slope with the help of novel technologies ma et al 2020a many technologies have been proposed as methods for creating loess filled slopes zhang et al 2021a and a large number of these slopes have subsequently been formed however there always remains a contact interface between a newly formed loess filled slope and the original slope which can negatively affect the rainfall infiltration of the loess filled slopes and thus the entire gully land reclamation project the gully land reclamation project has had a significant impact on the local hydrological cycle and frequency and magnitude slope failures furthermore the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of soil moisture in slopes have also been affected ma et al 2020b generally the average annual rainfall in the yan an area is between 450 mm and 550 mm and is concentrated in june to september the greatest single storm event within a 24 hour period was 139 9 mm in 1981 and the maximum recorded monthly rainfall reached 577 mm in 2013 wang et al 2014 in addition to the heavy rainfall in summer and autumn however the disintegration of the slope surfaces can also be triggered by the continuous short term rainfall between september and may wang et al 2019a in this case the loess disintegration induced by rainfall causes shallow sliding of loess filled slopes finally extensive erosion damage of the newly loess filled slope occurs which affects the use of the terrain as farmland jin 2014 these phenomena have exposed some potential problems in the gully land reclamation project early field investigations found that cracks and slope failures occurred on the loess filled slopes under general rainfall conditions fig 1 b and c and this prompted scholars to study the failure and seepage mechanisms of loess filled slopes in the gully land reclamation especially the failure and seepage mechanisms of loess filled slope coupled with rainfall and interface an interface is formed when two materials with different properties contact each other and the properties of the interface are different from the materials that constitute it this affects the overall deformation stress transfer and internal seepage su et al 2004 these phenomena are collectively referred to as interface effects interfaces generally exist in slopes and influence the deformation and failure characteristics of the slopes for example slope instability is affected by the bedrock interface gomes et al 2017 and the seismic response of a slope is influenced by the soil nails interface chavan et al 2017 even the displacement field of a slope is affected by the interface between strata with similar physical and mechanical properties ni et al 2016 the interface can be the macropores and cracks in loess which causes preferential seepage sun et al 2021 the preferential seepage in loess generally exists in the hidden fractures zhao et al 2020a these preferential channels can be divided into planar tubular and intergranular channels according to their form in loess the interface of loess filled slope in gully land reclamation project belongs to planar channel the planar channel is related to the cracks of loess the preferential infiltration rate of closed cracks is obviously higher than the homogeneous infiltration rate based on a soil column field test ma et al 2022 the test indicates that the macropores and cracks of loess is the key to preferential seepage for the loess filled slopes formed in the gully land reclamation project the key interface is the soil soil contact interface between natural loess and compacted loess tan et al 2022b the contact interface controls the seepage field of the loess filled slope and can even be the source of failure under the action of rainfall the existing research assumes that the interface in the gully land reclamation is a weak interlayer and studies its permeability characteristics guo et al 2023 however this is equivalent to expanding the interface into single strata which cannot highlight its characteristics as a weak planar channel the seepage mechanism of the interface is still unclear rainfall is the main cause of slope failure peng et al 2015 zhuang et al 2018 and many theoretical models have been proposed to explain the underlying mechanism aleotti 2004 fang et al 2023 zhang et al 2014 based on a few core original models many improved model models have since been applied to some complex situations the green ampt model was improved to describe the phenomenon where water moves upward from a perched water table and evaluate the likelihood of a shallow slope failure being induced by a particular rainfall event cho 2009 following this the concept of unsaturated seepage was introduced to explain shallow failures of slopes baum and godt 2010 zhuang et al 2017 furthermore the rapid variations of external water level after rainfall result in the alteration of pore water pressure because of this the groundwater seepage occurs and the earth pressure coefficient at rest k 0 increases increasing the potential for triggering large scale failures and reducing the stability of slopes vandenberge et al 2015 wang et al 2021 thus the seepage induced by rainfall reduces the strength properties of soil which results in slope failures so it is important to find the particular seepage channels that cause slope failures after rainfall the pore channel of water migration has been found at microscopic scales and it significantly affects soil permeability directly contributing to slope failures wang et al 2020 in addition many rainfall model tests of the slopes have been carried out to find other seepage channels at macroeconomic scale and hydrological characteristics and failure mechanisms have become the basis for judgment when searching for seepage channels qin et al 2022 tan et al 2022a zhang et al 2019 scholars generally believe that pores are the seepage channel for rainfall and that soil permeability is controlled by its unsaturated characteristics the seepage channel and the storage location of water are affected by soil s unsaturated characteristics which control the acquisition and loss of rainwater in slopes tian et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b rainwater continuously migrates to the inner slope soil by different seepage channels gradually changing a slope from an unsaturated to a saturated state but slope failure happens before the soil is completely saturated hence from the beginning of rainfall to slope failure the slope body is mostly in an unsaturated state which means that slope failure is affected by the unsaturated characteristics of the soil the relationship between soil moisture content in an unsaturated state and the susceptibility of slope failure have already been discussed ray et al 2010 to quantify soil s unsaturated seepage process and mechanism researchers have defined the concept of matric suction which is a suction that hinders the migration of rainwater in the soil and its value is equal to pore air pressure u a minus pore water pressure u w fredlund and rahardjo 1993 matric suction is an important parameter in unsaturated seepage and directly affects soil permeability xu et al 2013 although u a and u w are not convenient to measure directly because of various complexities in the field a corresponding relationship between matric suction and volume water content can be used as an alternative calculation method and this is known as the soil water characteristic curve swcc the volume water content and matric suction can be transformed into each using the swcc for fitting this relationship several swcc fitting models have been proposed brutsaert 1966 burdine 1953 mualem 1976 the early two parameter models needed to make some assumptions due to the lack of a third parameter to describe in a mathematically consistent manner a reverse sigmoid curve like the swcc the van genuchten equation and the fredlund and xing equation introduced such a third parameter fredlund and xing 1994 genuchten and th 1980 which has been shown to simulate the swcc well leong and rahardjo 1997 the swcc has also been extended to loess in order to try to explain the unsaturated characteristics of loess wang et al 2019b in this way the characteristics of unsaturated seepage can be described by the swcc in these characteristics of unsaturated seepage permeability coefficient is used to describe the permeability the saturation matric suction and volume water content can be used to predict the variation of the permeability coefficient in the past studies brooks 1965 childs et al 1950 after this prediction the unsaturated characteristics can be quantitatively expressed through continuous improvement and development permeability coefficient can also be predicted by swcc in this paper the seepage mechanism of internal interface in loess filled slopes is studied under the action of rainfall and we present the unsaturated characteristics of the interface that affect the seepage process in loess filled slopes as well the dynamic status of pores at the interface is also summarized we accomplished this by implementing an intermittent rainfall model and testing it based on the volume water content at different areas during intermittent rainfall we used the fredlund and xing swcc model to obtain the distribution of matric suction then according to the swcc and matric suction we used the prediction model of childs and collis geroge to calculate the permeability coefficient of the interface the results show that a water accumulation appears in the middle area of a loess filled slope during rainfall and that this creates low matric suction in this middle area and high matric suction in the bottom area the knudsen diffusion of the gas increases the matric suction and prevents the infiltrating rainwater from seeping along the interface in addition the dynamic pore status at different areas prevents the seepage to the bottom area finally a shallow slope failure appears in the middle area of loess filled slope the results in this paper can provide significant new information for developing ways to protect the surface of the loess filled lope and research ideas for interfacial impermeable materials 2 model test set up 2 1 study area the study area is located in the ansai yan an city northern shaanxi province china ansai is a representative area of the gully land reclamation project where a large number of loess filled slopes were built as the engineering geological profile shows in fig 2 the strata of ansai consists of lishi loess q2 malan loess q3 and earth fill q4 q2 and q3 are the strata of the original slope q3 and q4 is the strata of the filling body soil samples at the original slope and loess filled area were collected for our model test based on existing research 2 2 model test device and rainfall schemes our model test device comprises a rainfall device and a model box fig 3 the rainfall device is subdivided into a rainfall control system a rainfall system and a water supply system rainfall intensity is held at a constant value by the rainfall control system and the rainwater is uniformly sprayed at the top of the model box the related parameters of rainfall devices are shown in table 1 the similarity ratio of length cl is determined as cl 25 according to the similarity theory the similarity ratio of rainfall intensity cq is 5 using data from the china meteorological data network the maximum rainfall intensity within one hour was to 62 mm h so the rainfall intensity we used for the test was 12 4 mm h in addition the daily rainfall frequency in the model test was 9 times a day with half hour intermittent rainfall that lasted 8 days table 2 2 3 experimental materials and model filling the materials for the model were taken from the study area q2 109 18 26 e 36 34 37 n and q3 109 18 43 e 36 35 5 n respectively as shown in fig 2 the collected samples were tested by x ray diffraction the results shows that quartz chlorite and albite are the main mineralogy accounting for 52 3 13 5 and 12 4 respectively table 3 the grain size of q2 loess and q3 loess are shown in fig 4 the physical and mechanical parameters of the soil samples that were found by our indoor test are shown in table 4 our slope model was constructed according to these parameters to recreate the filling process of the gully land reclamation project we first constructed the filling of the original slope layered filling was used and each layer of filling was checked with a cutting ring any soil layer that did not meet the pre requirements was refilled fig 5 a after the soil layers of the original slope were finished the original slope was cut out according to the slope type data fig 5 b from the field then the interface was covered with high permeability material permeable geomembrane on the surface of the original slope finally the loess filled slope was filled by the same method fig 5 c and the model schematic of the loess filled model is shown in fig 5 c based on the height parameter h the loess filled slope was divided into three areas these three areas are the top area 0 9 m h 1 2 m the middle area 0 6 m h 0 9 m and the bottom area 0 3 m h 0 6 m volume water content sensors were arranged at a height of 1 0 m top area 0 8 m middle area and 0 4 m bottom area in both the interface and loess filled slope fig 6 3 theory for data processing previous researches showed that the fredlund and xing model fit the loess filled slopes well xie et al 2018 thus we applied the fredlund and xing model to fit the swccs as shown in eq 2 1 the swcc of the interface was obtained from the moisture absorption data of undisturbed loess from interfaces in yan an fig 7 a and the swcc of the loess fill slope was obtained from the moisture absorption data of remolded soil in yan an fig 7 b 2 1 θ w θ s ln e ψ a b c where θ w is the volume water content θ s is the saturated volume water content a is the parameter related to the intake value kpa b is the parameter related to the soil dehydration rate when the matric suction is higher than the intake value and c is the parameter related to residual water content e is the natural constant and its value is about 2 71828 ψ is matric suction kpa the fredlund and xing model fitted parameters are shown in table 5 they are determined by mathematical fitting next we used the childs and collis geroge model improved by kunze kunze et al 1968 to predict the interfacial permeability coefficient and assist in the analysis of the pore variation during the intermittent rainfall process the calculation formula is given in eqs 2 2 2 4 and the corresponding relationship between symbols and values in the equation is shown in table 6 based on the research literature of loess permeability with cracks we selected 5 10 5 as the ks hong et al 2019 xu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020b the swcc in fig 7 is divided into 20 equal intervals along the volume water content axis each interval is numbered from 1 to 20 the matric suction at the midpoint of j th interval is expressed by u a u w j i is the number of an interval j is count from i to 20 then ksc is calculated by eq 2 4 and equal to 7 48 10 4 m s finally the exponential function was used to fit the matric suction and the permeability coefficient 2 2 k w θ w i k s k sc a d j i m 2 j 1 2 i u a u w j 2 i 1 2 m 2 3 a d t s 2 ρ w g 2 μ w θ s p n 2 n m θ s θ s θ l 2 4 k sc a d j i m 2 j 1 2 i u a u w j 2 i 0 1 2 m we use the notation vij and mij to represent volume water content and matric suction respectively at the different heights of the interface and loess filled slope i is the location of the soil i 1 is the interface and i 2 is the loess filled slope j is the range of height h j 1 represents the top area 0 9 m h 1 2 m j 2 represents the middle area 0 6 m h 0 9 m and j 3 represents the bottom area 0 3 m h 0 6 m these three areas correspond to the three measuring points of the sensors 1 0 m 0 8 m 0 4 m the above corresponding relationships are shown in table 7 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of interface seepage of the loess filled slope under rainfall 4 1 1 rules of volume water content surge and dissipation at the interface on the 1st day of rainfall v11 and v12 were higher than in the loess filled slope at the same height and v23 was significantly higher than v13 as shown in fig 8 a on the 2nd day of rainfall fig 8 a v13 and v23 increased sharply and v13 changed significantly compared to the 1st day but was still lower than v23 v2j was higher than v1j as shown in fig 8 b finally from the 4th day of rainfall fig 8 b onward the volume water content did not change significantly under the action of rainfall the above phenomena illustrate that the interface is the preferential seepage channel the rainwater infiltrated from the top of the slope seeped along the internal interface to the inside of the slope however water accumulation appeared in the middle area of the internal interface throughout the entire process and the variation of the bottom area was different from that of top area and middle areas the loess filled slope was in an unsaturated state during the beginning of rainfall and did not change to saturated state immediately the cause of water accumulation is most likely due to unsaturated seepage next we find out the cause from the unsaturated characteristics of the interface and loess filled slope 4 1 2 distribution characteristics of interface matric suction on the 1st day of rainfall fig 9 the matric suction didn t immediately slump but exhibited a hysteresis instead after 6 h of rainfall on the 1st day the matric suction began to decrease significantly m 12 had its largest decline and decreased to its minimum after the end of the rainfall the second decline was m 13 which was different from the steep decline of m 12 as the decline in m13 decline was relatively gentle moreover internal interface became the preferential channel of seepage the value of m 12 was the lowest meaning the infiltrated rainwater tended to accumulate in the middle area of the interface fig 9 and higher m 13 hindered the seepage into the bottom area this phenomenon occurred throughout the entire experiment additionally m 11 and m 12 followed the same pattern except for their difference in magnitude during rainfalls the area with lower matric suction appeared at the same time as m 11 and m 12 during the 2nd rainfall which indicates that seepage rainwater connected first between the top and middle areas of the interface however there were other rainwater infiltration channels in the bottom area which means the bottom area followed a different changing rule the rainwater in the bottom area not only came from seepage at the internal interface but also from the bottom interface from the 3rd day of rainfall onward fig 9 a and b the rainwater infiltrating from the top of the slope underwent the following processes i the rainwater near the internal interface seeped predominantly along the interface and the rest infiltrated from the top of the loess filled slope ii the infiltrating rainwater seeped along the internal interface to the middle area of the interface iii most of the infiltrating rainwater was accumulated in the middle area of the interface and seeped into the middle area of the loess filled slope while the rest seeped along the interface to the bottom area of the interface iv the rainwater that infiltrated from the top area eventually seeped to the bottom interface and drained the slope along the bottom interface or seeped to the deeper strata 4 1 3 distribution characteristics of matric suction of the loess filled slope on the 1st day of rainfall fig 10 a the matric suction of the loess filled slope was generally higher than the interface in this way rainwater tended to infiltrate from the interface and only the soil far away from the interface had rainwater infiltrating from the loess filled slope the large difference of matric suction between the interface and the loess filled slope caused the interface to become the preferential seepage channel simultaneous variation of matric suction at different areas was observed on the 1st day of rainfall which indicated that the seepage from the internal interface to the loess filled slope was parallel to the interface even if the high matric suction caused seepage to both sides of the interface to decrease this does not mean that there was no seepage to the original slope or loess filled slope however the change time of m 23 is nearly 4 h earlier than m 13 the phenomenon indicated that the rainwater in the bottom area of the loess filled slope was not come from the internal interface on the 2nd day of rainfall fig 10 a m2j showed different change rules compared to the interface unlike the interface which was only affected by rainfall the loess filled slope was also affected by the interface the seepage from the interface made the inside of the loess filled slope develop seepage faster since the number of seepage channels increased the changes in m 21 and m 22 were nearly the same m 23 changed before the rainwater seeped to the bottom area which was about 1 5 h faster than at the interface this phenomenon indicated that the rainwater in the bottom area did not come from seepage at the internal interface but came instead from the bottom interface as mentioned above since it was affected by water concentration in the middle of the interface m 22 gradually decreased to a lower value over time causing the middle of the loess filled to become the area of water concentration m 23 remained at a higher value however which hindered rainwater seepage to the bottom area therefore the reason why water accumulated in the middle area was not only due to the lower matric suction in the middle area but also to higher matric suction in the bottom area 4 1 4 the influence of matric suction on seepage in the loess filled slope the pore of the interface forms the transportation channel of rainwater and gas because the size of pore is so small to make gas collide with the soil skeleton when infiltrated rainwater pushes the gas to move along the interface the phenomenon of gas flow is called knudsen diffusion the gas molecules adsorb on the surface of soil skeleton before rainfall fig 11 a when infiltrated rainwater seep along the pore channel the gas molecules desorb and increase pore pressure javadpour et al 2007 an apparent permeability was defined to further explain the knudsen diffusion the apparent permeability includes properties of flowing gas at specified pressure and temperature research shows that the smaller the size of the pores the larger the difference between apparent permeability and darcy permeability the lower pressures also make difference between apparent permeability and darcy permeability expand a new formulation was proposed to describe the effect of pore size pressure temperature and gas molar mass on gas flow the formulation found that diffusional flux contribution was higher at lower pressure javadpour 2009 the inter aggregate pores in loess are mainly dimensions of tens of microns others are considerably smaller than one micron li et al 2018 yu et al 2022a the matric suction in the interface and the loess filled slope ranges from 1 5 kpa to 325 kpa at the range of pore size and pressure the pressure is the main factor determining gas permeability the internal cause of gas movement is the seepage of infiltrated rainwater knudsen diffusion occurs in the micro pore of loess the gas molecules adsorbing on the surface of soil desorb and increase pore air pressure ua fig 11 b the increase of ua reduces the difference between apparent permeability and darcy permeability it means that ua has little effects on the permeability of gas the total flux of gas also decreases the ua at the gas water interface increases temporarily this prevents the infiltrated rainwater from seeping along the interface which leads to water concentration in the middle of the interface fig 11 c but the increase of ua is temporary in the subsequent rainfall the rainwater gradually fills the pore of the interface total flux of gas also increases which causes the decreases of ua and makes infiltrated rainwater seep along the interface to the bottom area fig 11 d the process described above is also reflected in the variation of matric suction matric suction and volume water content are two interactive factors that both hinder seepage in soil previous studies have shown that the interface is the preferential surface for rainwater seepage gerscovich et al 2006 wu et al 2018 and the above model test results explain the cause of this phenomenon from the perspective of unsaturated seepage at the beginning of rainfall rainwater tends to seep along the interface due to its lower matric suction which causes the interface to become the preferential seepage channel as the rainfall continues this preferential channel of seepage makes it possible for rainwater to reach the inside of loess filled slope faster than that of the slope without the interface the low matric suction in the middle of the interface also causes rainwater to accumulate in the middle area of the interface in addition the high matric suction at the bottom of the loess filled slope hinders rainwater to seep along the internal interface this eventually leads to water concentration in the middle of the interface the observe hysteresis of matric suction in the loess filled slope also indicated that volume water content in the loess filled slope was caused by seepage from the interface which accelerates the saturation process of the loess filled slope the regular variation of the volume water content in the bottom area is obviously different from that of top area and middle area this is because the rainwater recharge in the bottom area not only comes from the seepage at the internal interface but also from the unsaturated seepage at the bottom interface 4 2 characteristics of permeability at the interface of the loess filled slope under rainfall 4 2 1 the variation law of permeability coefficient at the interface to obtain a gradient of matric suction we divided the swcc shown in fig 7 a into 20 fractions and substituted them into eqs 2 2 2 4 the calculated permeability coefficient and the fitting results of the exponential function are shown in fig 12 and the fitting function is shown in eq 4 1 4 1 k 2 45 10 5 e 0 88 m where m is the matrix suction and k is the permeability coefficient from the test we can see that the soil of the loess filled slope had lower density and looser pores than the original soil which are conducive to rainfall infiltration rainwater seeps through the pores and during the process the pores expand and connect resulting in changes in the permeability coefficient hence the change in the permeability coefficient is a change due to changing pores the permeability coefficient in the middle area was much higher than that in the top area indicating that the middle area had the largest porosity and the strongest connectivity 1st rainfall in fig 13 moreover most of the seepage rainwater seeped along the interface to the middle area and then continued to seep into the loess filled slope although the heights of these areas were different they had similar stage characteristics the bottom area of the interface was not connected to the middle area or the top area and the infiltrated rainwater had not yet reached the bottom area along the interface after the 1st rainfall fig 13 the merely slight change in the bottom area was caused by the preferential seepage at the bottom interface after 1 h of rainfall on the next day however the whole interface was quickly connected the permeability coefficient in the bottom area rose to the maximum over the entire rainfall process and even reached the level of that in the middle area 2nd rainfall in fig 13 however the permeability coefficient at the bottom did not reach this value during subsequent rainfall fig 13 we presume that the reason for this was the high effective stress in the bottom area after the end of each day s rainfall seepage rainwater was discharged into the loess filled slope through different ways the pore water pressure in the soil decreased effective stress increased and overburden pressure in the soil skeleton also increased which ultimately led to pore compression in the soil thus even if the rainfall conditions were unchanged all interfaces became seepage surface for infiltration and the permeability coefficient of the bottom area could no longer reach the maximum value after the 2nd day the bottom area of the interface subsequently exhibited stage characteristics similar to other areas 2nd rainfall in fig 13 4 2 2 stage characteristics of the interfacial permeability coefficient of the interface we divided the variation in the permeability coefficient at the interface into six stages during the intermittent rainfall the characteristics of each stage are summarized and analyzed from the perspectives of permeability coefficient matric suction and pores in table 8 and the characteristics of each stage are shown in fig 14 after the 2nd rainfall the volume water content at the interface is much higher than the initial water content so stage 1 is not obvious during subsequent rainfall more and more seepage water are then left at the interface after rainfall and the characteristics of stage 6 become more unclear only stage 2 stage 3 stage 4 and stage 5 maintain the variation characteristics of initial rainfall throughout the process however we note that the permeability coefficients at different heights of the interface experience all the above stages except for the fact that the maximum values are different this phenomenon shows that the seepage law of the interface is consistent and does not change due to the height of the interface 4 2 3 the variation law of pores at the interface during intermittent rainfall compared with the infiltration mechanism of groundwater mound we think that the seepage mechanism of the interfaces in loess filled slopes has similarity at the beginning of rainfall an area of water concentration grows slowly by viscous flow through the sediment matrix once the water reaches a critical level a rapid dispersion of the infiltrating fluid occurs through macropores antia 2008 at the end of rainfall the infiltrated rainwater is held in place by the change in flow regime at the mounds boundaries antia 2010 this results in a flow rate for the descending groundwater mound which is controlled by knudsen diffusion antia 2009a antia 2008 the permeability coefficient of the interface and loess filled slope dictated by the knudsen diffusion permeability antia 2009b as mentioned above the pore size of loess and the size of matric suction make the apparent permeability coefficient determined by the knudsen diffusion almost the same as darcy s permeability coefficient therefore the calculated permeability coefficient by the childs and collis geroge model can represent viscous flow of the interface the rainwater cannot seep to the bottom area not only because of the high matrix suction at the bottom but also because the pores for rainwater seepage in the bottom area are compacted by effective stress the pores in the internal interface and the bottom interface are looser than those of the loess filled slope as well fig 15 a thus the infiltrating rainwater migrates through the pores in the interface fig 15 b during intermittent rainfall the pores undergo a dynamic process the permeability coefficient is significantly increased by expanding and connecting pores and vice versa the soil skeleton is squeezed by pore water pressure and part of the soil particles are taken away by rainwater which expands the open pores and connect the closed pores fig 15 c in our model we found that the pores of the middle area were the largest and the permeability coefficient was the highest there fig 15 c the bottom area is not connected to other areas at the beginning of the rainfall fig 15 c hence the permeability coefficient of the bottom area isn t changed by the rainfall as the bottom area is also connected by rainwater the permeability coefficient at the bottom gradually increases until it exceeds the permeability coefficient at the top area however this phenomenon doesn t last long and the reason for this is related to the effective stress at the pores the bottom area is subjected to the highest effective stress and the pores of the bottom area are compacted after the rainfall as described above fig 15 d thus the permeability coefficient of the bottom area does not exceed that of the top area during the subsequent rainfall in addition since the rainwater accumulates in the middle area the pores of middle area are the largest the interface then becomes a stable seepage channel which causes rainwater to migrate to the loess filled slope and accelerates its saturation process fig 15 e 4 3 development characteristics and prevention of slope failure two types of slope failure induced by rainfall can be divided i rainfall reaches rainfall threshold bezak et al 2019 ghanmi et al 2016 ii the physical quantity related to rainfall reaches the physical threshold sharma and konietzky 2011 yu et al 2022b e g pore pressure effective pressure pore size etc in this paper the relationship between slope failure and preferential seepage of the internal interfaces is discussed i the unsaturated seepage mechanism of the interfaces in loess filled slopes makes the infiltrated rainwater accumulate in the middle of the loess filled slope the water content of middle area surges to result in the partial disintegration of the surface of loess filled slope wang et al 2019a a shallow failure occurred at the surface in the middle area of loess filled slope fig 16 a ii the water sensitivity of loess is triggered and the strength of loess is weakened leng et al 2021 the middle area of shallow failure is expanded fig 16 b iii with the increase of rainfall the soil properties of the slope are further deteriorated the effective stress decreases while the weight of the slope increases the variation of the stress field leads to the shallow sliding in the loess filled slope fig 16 c iv the flow inside the soil layer is porous media flow which is governed by biot s theory of poro elasticity biot 1955 based on the biot s poro elasticity theory a relationship between stress and the permeability was figured out which is that seepage discharge and fluid shear stress increase with the soil permeability hsieh and yang 2013 thus according to the calculated permeability coefficient in fig 13 the shear stress at the interface increases with rainfall among them the permeability coefficient in the middle area of the interface is the highest it means that the interface is the potential failure surface of slope failure and the middle area of the interface is stress concentration area v the reason why shallow slides occur in the middle of the loess filled slope is caused by multiple factors first the water accumulation in the middle of the interface also results in the water accumulation in the middle of the loess filled slope second the water sensitivity of loess is triggered the soil properties of the middle area in the loess filled slope are deteriorated the unsaturated effective pressure decreases and pore water pressure increases the closed pore is connected the pore is expanded and the permeability is increased finally the strength of loess filled slope decreases and the shear stress of the middle area in the loess filled slope increases which leads to shallow slides of the loess filled slope the above phenomena indicate that the variation in pores at different heights is affected by effective stress pore variation and matric suction together result in water accumulation in the middle of the loess filled slope crucially the entire process is irreversible so that the rainwater cannot seep along the interface but instead accumulates in the middle of the interface and eventually enter the loess filled slope furthermore slope damage developed at the middle of the slope can also indicate water accumulation in the middle of the slope fig 16 the failure process clearly couples the interface seepage the unsaturated theory with the strength of soil controlled by biot s poroelasticity theory and effective stress principal through the permeability property of soil the interaction mechanism of seepage field and stress field of loess filled slope with interface is revealed a solution for fluid solid coupling calculation of loess filled slope is provided the results have a guiding significance on the field applications of interfacial impermeable prevention measures based on the seepage mechanism of the internal interface prevention measures for loess filled slope surface should be applied to the middle area ecologically friendly slope protection can be used to avoid shallow sliding zhang et al 2021a adding drainage to the internal interface is another method to increase slope stability by setting impermeable materials in the middle of the loess filled slope fig 17 the water content of the slope can be effectively decreased and the strength of the soil can be improved so that slope failure may be prevented 5 conclusions this study brought to light the unsaturated seepage mechanism on interfaces in loess filled slopes induced by intermittent rainfall we draw the following specific conclusions 1 rainwater tends to infiltrate from the interface and water accumulation occurs in the middle of the interface and loess filled slope in addition low matric suction in middle area and high matric suction occurs in the bottom area which we found through the transform of the swcc the knudsen diffusion increases the matric suction of the bottom area at the early stage of rainfall and hinders the infiltration of rainwater along the interface this means that the matric suction hinders the unsaturated seepage of the loess filled slope with the interface thus the most of rainwater cannot seep to the bottom area along the interface which results in the aforementioned accumulation 2 compared to the matric suction of the loess filled slope the matric suction at the interface is significantly lower as a result rainwater tends to seep along the interface in addition the rainwater in the bottom area does not come from seepage at the internal interface but come instead from the bottom interface at the beginning of rainfall the saturation process inside the loess filled slope is thus controlled by internal interface and bottom interface therefore the matric suction of the loess filled slope exhibits hysteresis 3 the permeability coefficient of the interface at each area can be calculated based on the matric suction which can then be divided into six stages according to the permeability coefficient matric suction and pore size the variation in the permeability coefficient is related to the dynamic process of the soil pores after intermittent rainfall the pores at different areas are subjected to different effective stresses which results in their compaction reducing their ability to transport rainwater additionally the bottom area has the highest compaction and the weakest ability to transport rainwater therefore the rainwater cannot seep to the bottom area not only because of the high matrix suction at the bottom but also because the pores for seepage in the bottom area are compacted by effective stress and become too small to transport rainwater credit authorship contribution statement daijin yu data curation formal analysis writing original draft qiangbing huang conceptualization

2130,in the gully land reclamation project conducted in yan an china shallow failure in the middle of loess filled slopes is caused by the unsaturated seepage of rainwater along the internal interface between the original loess slopes and the loess filled slopes although the phenomenon was observed through model test the particular nature of the unsaturated seepage mechanism remains unclear to explore this mechanism we carried out an intermittent rainfall model test on a loess filled slope and the volume water content in different areas was continuously monitored based on the monitored data the unsaturated seepage process and mechanism in the internal interface was analyzed by adopting the fredlund and xing model and the childs and collis geroge model the results indicate that a water accumulation phenome occurs in the middle area of loess filled slope because of low matric suction in the middle area and high matric suction in the bottom area in addition the dynamic process of pore growth and shrinkage at different areas prevents seepage to the bottom area furthermore the regularity of pores at the interface during intermittent rainfall is summarized from a macroscopic perspective based on the matric suction and permeability coefficient the unsaturated seepage process and mechanism affected by knudsen diffusion are revealed because of the presence of unsaturated seepage a shallow failure appears in the middle area of a loess filled slope the results have a significant impact on the field applications of interfacial impermeable prevention measures keywords gully land reclamation loess filled slope unsaturated seepage mechanism internal interface intermittent rainfall data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the topography of the loess plateau of china consists mostly of hills and gullies and most areas are not suitable for construction what s more its steep terrain is not suitable for crop growth either this prevents the development of both industry and agriculture in an attempt to deal with this yan an shaanxi province which is located in the loess plateau fig 1 a implemented the gully land reclamation project in 2013 to expand the available arable land kang et al 2021 the project has promoted local economic development and increased the amount of cultivated area covering a wide range of slope with the help of novel technologies ma et al 2020a many technologies have been proposed as methods for creating loess filled slopes zhang et al 2021a and a large number of these slopes have subsequently been formed however there always remains a contact interface between a newly formed loess filled slope and the original slope which can negatively affect the rainfall infiltration of the loess filled slopes and thus the entire gully land reclamation project the gully land reclamation project has had a significant impact on the local hydrological cycle and frequency and magnitude slope failures furthermore the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of soil moisture in slopes have also been affected ma et al 2020b generally the average annual rainfall in the yan an area is between 450 mm and 550 mm and is concentrated in june to september the greatest single storm event within a 24 hour period was 139 9 mm in 1981 and the maximum recorded monthly rainfall reached 577 mm in 2013 wang et al 2014 in addition to the heavy rainfall in summer and autumn however the disintegration of the slope surfaces can also be triggered by the continuous short term rainfall between september and may wang et al 2019a in this case the loess disintegration induced by rainfall causes shallow sliding of loess filled slopes finally extensive erosion damage of the newly loess filled slope occurs which affects the use of the terrain as farmland jin 2014 these phenomena have exposed some potential problems in the gully land reclamation project early field investigations found that cracks and slope failures occurred on the loess filled slopes under general rainfall conditions fig 1 b and c and this prompted scholars to study the failure and seepage mechanisms of loess filled slopes in the gully land reclamation especially the failure and seepage mechanisms of loess filled slope coupled with rainfall and interface an interface is formed when two materials with different properties contact each other and the properties of the interface are different from the materials that constitute it this affects the overall deformation stress transfer and internal seepage su et al 2004 these phenomena are collectively referred to as interface effects interfaces generally exist in slopes and influence the deformation and failure characteristics of the slopes for example slope instability is affected by the bedrock interface gomes et al 2017 and the seismic response of a slope is influenced by the soil nails interface chavan et al 2017 even the displacement field of a slope is affected by the interface between strata with similar physical and mechanical properties ni et al 2016 the interface can be the macropores and cracks in loess which causes preferential seepage sun et al 2021 the preferential seepage in loess generally exists in the hidden fractures zhao et al 2020a these preferential channels can be divided into planar tubular and intergranular channels according to their form in loess the interface of loess filled slope in gully land reclamation project belongs to planar channel the planar channel is related to the cracks of loess the preferential infiltration rate of closed cracks is obviously higher than the homogeneous infiltration rate based on a soil column field test ma et al 2022 the test indicates that the macropores and cracks of loess is the key to preferential seepage for the loess filled slopes formed in the gully land reclamation project the key interface is the soil soil contact interface between natural loess and compacted loess tan et al 2022b the contact interface controls the seepage field of the loess filled slope and can even be the source of failure under the action of rainfall the existing research assumes that the interface in the gully land reclamation is a weak interlayer and studies its permeability characteristics guo et al 2023 however this is equivalent to expanding the interface into single strata which cannot highlight its characteristics as a weak planar channel the seepage mechanism of the interface is still unclear rainfall is the main cause of slope failure peng et al 2015 zhuang et al 2018 and many theoretical models have been proposed to explain the underlying mechanism aleotti 2004 fang et al 2023 zhang et al 2014 based on a few core original models many improved model models have since been applied to some complex situations the green ampt model was improved to describe the phenomenon where water moves upward from a perched water table and evaluate the likelihood of a shallow slope failure being induced by a particular rainfall event cho 2009 following this the concept of unsaturated seepage was introduced to explain shallow failures of slopes baum and godt 2010 zhuang et al 2017 furthermore the rapid variations of external water level after rainfall result in the alteration of pore water pressure because of this the groundwater seepage occurs and the earth pressure coefficient at rest k 0 increases increasing the potential for triggering large scale failures and reducing the stability of slopes vandenberge et al 2015 wang et al 2021 thus the seepage induced by rainfall reduces the strength properties of soil which results in slope failures so it is important to find the particular seepage channels that cause slope failures after rainfall the pore channel of water migration has been found at microscopic scales and it significantly affects soil permeability directly contributing to slope failures wang et al 2020 in addition many rainfall model tests of the slopes have been carried out to find other seepage channels at macroeconomic scale and hydrological characteristics and failure mechanisms have become the basis for judgment when searching for seepage channels qin et al 2022 tan et al 2022a zhang et al 2019 scholars generally believe that pores are the seepage channel for rainfall and that soil permeability is controlled by its unsaturated characteristics the seepage channel and the storage location of water are affected by soil s unsaturated characteristics which control the acquisition and loss of rainwater in slopes tian et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b rainwater continuously migrates to the inner slope soil by different seepage channels gradually changing a slope from an unsaturated to a saturated state but slope failure happens before the soil is completely saturated hence from the beginning of rainfall to slope failure the slope body is mostly in an unsaturated state which means that slope failure is affected by the unsaturated characteristics of the soil the relationship between soil moisture content in an unsaturated state and the susceptibility of slope failure have already been discussed ray et al 2010 to quantify soil s unsaturated seepage process and mechanism researchers have defined the concept of matric suction which is a suction that hinders the migration of rainwater in the soil and its value is equal to pore air pressure u a minus pore water pressure u w fredlund and rahardjo 1993 matric suction is an important parameter in unsaturated seepage and directly affects soil permeability xu et al 2013 although u a and u w are not convenient to measure directly because of various complexities in the field a corresponding relationship between matric suction and volume water content can be used as an alternative calculation method and this is known as the soil water characteristic curve swcc the volume water content and matric suction can be transformed into each using the swcc for fitting this relationship several swcc fitting models have been proposed brutsaert 1966 burdine 1953 mualem 1976 the early two parameter models needed to make some assumptions due to the lack of a third parameter to describe in a mathematically consistent manner a reverse sigmoid curve like the swcc the van genuchten equation and the fredlund and xing equation introduced such a third parameter fredlund and xing 1994 genuchten and th 1980 which has been shown to simulate the swcc well leong and rahardjo 1997 the swcc has also been extended to loess in order to try to explain the unsaturated characteristics of loess wang et al 2019b in this way the characteristics of unsaturated seepage can be described by the swcc in these characteristics of unsaturated seepage permeability coefficient is used to describe the permeability the saturation matric suction and volume water content can be used to predict the variation of the permeability coefficient in the past studies brooks 1965 childs et al 1950 after this prediction the unsaturated characteristics can be quantitatively expressed through continuous improvement and development permeability coefficient can also be predicted by swcc in this paper the seepage mechanism of internal interface in loess filled slopes is studied under the action of rainfall and we present the unsaturated characteristics of the interface that affect the seepage process in loess filled slopes as well the dynamic status of pores at the interface is also summarized we accomplished this by implementing an intermittent rainfall model and testing it based on the volume water content at different areas during intermittent rainfall we used the fredlund and xing swcc model to obtain the distribution of matric suction then according to the swcc and matric suction we used the prediction model of childs and collis geroge to calculate the permeability coefficient of the interface the results show that a water accumulation appears in the middle area of a loess filled slope during rainfall and that this creates low matric suction in this middle area and high matric suction in the bottom area the knudsen diffusion of the gas increases the matric suction and prevents the infiltrating rainwater from seeping along the interface in addition the dynamic pore status at different areas prevents the seepage to the bottom area finally a shallow slope failure appears in the middle area of loess filled slope the results in this paper can provide significant new information for developing ways to protect the surface of the loess filled lope and research ideas for interfacial impermeable materials 2 model test set up 2 1 study area the study area is located in the ansai yan an city northern shaanxi province china ansai is a representative area of the gully land reclamation project where a large number of loess filled slopes were built as the engineering geological profile shows in fig 2 the strata of ansai consists of lishi loess q2 malan loess q3 and earth fill q4 q2 and q3 are the strata of the original slope q3 and q4 is the strata of the filling body soil samples at the original slope and loess filled area were collected for our model test based on existing research 2 2 model test device and rainfall schemes our model test device comprises a rainfall device and a model box fig 3 the rainfall device is subdivided into a rainfall control system a rainfall system and a water supply system rainfall intensity is held at a constant value by the rainfall control system and the rainwater is uniformly sprayed at the top of the model box the related parameters of rainfall devices are shown in table 1 the similarity ratio of length cl is determined as cl 25 according to the similarity theory the similarity ratio of rainfall intensity cq is 5 using data from the china meteorological data network the maximum rainfall intensity within one hour was to 62 mm h so the rainfall intensity we used for the test was 12 4 mm h in addition the daily rainfall frequency in the model test was 9 times a day with half hour intermittent rainfall that lasted 8 days table 2 2 3 experimental materials and model filling the materials for the model were taken from the study area q2 109 18 26 e 36 34 37 n and q3 109 18 43 e 36 35 5 n respectively as shown in fig 2 the collected samples were tested by x ray diffraction the results shows that quartz chlorite and albite are the main mineralogy accounting for 52 3 13 5 and 12 4 respectively table 3 the grain size of q2 loess and q3 loess are shown in fig 4 the physical and mechanical parameters of the soil samples that were found by our indoor test are shown in table 4 our slope model was constructed according to these parameters to recreate the filling process of the gully land reclamation project we first constructed the filling of the original slope layered filling was used and each layer of filling was checked with a cutting ring any soil layer that did not meet the pre requirements was refilled fig 5 a after the soil layers of the original slope were finished the original slope was cut out according to the slope type data fig 5 b from the field then the interface was covered with high permeability material permeable geomembrane on the surface of the original slope finally the loess filled slope was filled by the same method fig 5 c and the model schematic of the loess filled model is shown in fig 5 c based on the height parameter h the loess filled slope was divided into three areas these three areas are the top area 0 9 m h 1 2 m the middle area 0 6 m h 0 9 m and the bottom area 0 3 m h 0 6 m volume water content sensors were arranged at a height of 1 0 m top area 0 8 m middle area and 0 4 m bottom area in both the interface and loess filled slope fig 6 3 theory for data processing previous researches showed that the fredlund and xing model fit the loess filled slopes well xie et al 2018 thus we applied the fredlund and xing model to fit the swccs as shown in eq 2 1 the swcc of the interface was obtained from the moisture absorption data of undisturbed loess from interfaces in yan an fig 7 a and the swcc of the loess fill slope was obtained from the moisture absorption data of remolded soil in yan an fig 7 b 2 1 θ w θ s ln e ψ a b c where θ w is the volume water content θ s is the saturated volume water content a is the parameter related to the intake value kpa b is the parameter related to the soil dehydration rate when the matric suction is higher than the intake value and c is the parameter related to residual water content e is the natural constant and its value is about 2 71828 ψ is matric suction kpa the fredlund and xing model fitted parameters are shown in table 5 they are determined by mathematical fitting next we used the childs and collis geroge model improved by kunze kunze et al 1968 to predict the interfacial permeability coefficient and assist in the analysis of the pore variation during the intermittent rainfall process the calculation formula is given in eqs 2 2 2 4 and the corresponding relationship between symbols and values in the equation is shown in table 6 based on the research literature of loess permeability with cracks we selected 5 10 5 as the ks hong et al 2019 xu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020b the swcc in fig 7 is divided into 20 equal intervals along the volume water content axis each interval is numbered from 1 to 20 the matric suction at the midpoint of j th interval is expressed by u a u w j i is the number of an interval j is count from i to 20 then ksc is calculated by eq 2 4 and equal to 7 48 10 4 m s finally the exponential function was used to fit the matric suction and the permeability coefficient 2 2 k w θ w i k s k sc a d j i m 2 j 1 2 i u a u w j 2 i 1 2 m 2 3 a d t s 2 ρ w g 2 μ w θ s p n 2 n m θ s θ s θ l 2 4 k sc a d j i m 2 j 1 2 i u a u w j 2 i 0 1 2 m we use the notation vij and mij to represent volume water content and matric suction respectively at the different heights of the interface and loess filled slope i is the location of the soil i 1 is the interface and i 2 is the loess filled slope j is the range of height h j 1 represents the top area 0 9 m h 1 2 m j 2 represents the middle area 0 6 m h 0 9 m and j 3 represents the bottom area 0 3 m h 0 6 m these three areas correspond to the three measuring points of the sensors 1 0 m 0 8 m 0 4 m the above corresponding relationships are shown in table 7 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of interface seepage of the loess filled slope under rainfall 4 1 1 rules of volume water content surge and dissipation at the interface on the 1st day of rainfall v11 and v12 were higher than in the loess filled slope at the same height and v23 was significantly higher than v13 as shown in fig 8 a on the 2nd day of rainfall fig 8 a v13 and v23 increased sharply and v13 changed significantly compared to the 1st day but was still lower than v23 v2j was higher than v1j as shown in fig 8 b finally from the 4th day of rainfall fig 8 b onward the volume water content did not change significantly under the action of rainfall the above phenomena illustrate that the interface is the preferential seepage channel the rainwater infiltrated from the top of the slope seeped along the internal interface to the inside of the slope however water accumulation appeared in the middle area of the internal interface throughout the entire process and the variation of the bottom area was different from that of top area and middle areas the loess filled slope was in an unsaturated state during the beginning of rainfall and did not change to saturated state immediately the cause of water accumulation is most likely due to unsaturated seepage next we find out the cause from the unsaturated characteristics of the interface and loess filled slope 4 1 2 distribution characteristics of interface matric suction on the 1st day of rainfall fig 9 the matric suction didn t immediately slump but exhibited a hysteresis instead after 6 h of rainfall on the 1st day the matric suction began to decrease significantly m 12 had its largest decline and decreased to its minimum after the end of the rainfall the second decline was m 13 which was different from the steep decline of m 12 as the decline in m13 decline was relatively gentle moreover internal interface became the preferential channel of seepage the value of m 12 was the lowest meaning the infiltrated rainwater tended to accumulate in the middle area of the interface fig 9 and higher m 13 hindered the seepage into the bottom area this phenomenon occurred throughout the entire experiment additionally m 11 and m 12 followed the same pattern except for their difference in magnitude during rainfalls the area with lower matric suction appeared at the same time as m 11 and m 12 during the 2nd rainfall which indicates that seepage rainwater connected first between the top and middle areas of the interface however there were other rainwater infiltration channels in the bottom area which means the bottom area followed a different changing rule the rainwater in the bottom area not only came from seepage at the internal interface but also from the bottom interface from the 3rd day of rainfall onward fig 9 a and b the rainwater infiltrating from the top of the slope underwent the following processes i the rainwater near the internal interface seeped predominantly along the interface and the rest infiltrated from the top of the loess filled slope ii the infiltrating rainwater seeped along the internal interface to the middle area of the interface iii most of the infiltrating rainwater was accumulated in the middle area of the interface and seeped into the middle area of the loess filled slope while the rest seeped along the interface to the bottom area of the interface iv the rainwater that infiltrated from the top area eventually seeped to the bottom interface and drained the slope along the bottom interface or seeped to the deeper strata 4 1 3 distribution characteristics of matric suction of the loess filled slope on the 1st day of rainfall fig 10 a the matric suction of the loess filled slope was generally higher than the interface in this way rainwater tended to infiltrate from the interface and only the soil far away from the interface had rainwater infiltrating from the loess filled slope the large difference of matric suction between the interface and the loess filled slope caused the interface to become the preferential seepage channel simultaneous variation of matric suction at different areas was observed on the 1st day of rainfall which indicated that the seepage from the internal interface to the loess filled slope was parallel to the interface even if the high matric suction caused seepage to both sides of the interface to decrease this does not mean that there was no seepage to the original slope or loess filled slope however the change time of m 23 is nearly 4 h earlier than m 13 the phenomenon indicated that the rainwater in the bottom area of the loess filled slope was not come from the internal interface on the 2nd day of rainfall fig 10 a m2j showed different change rules compared to the interface unlike the interface which was only affected by rainfall the loess filled slope was also affected by the interface the seepage from the interface made the inside of the loess filled slope develop seepage faster since the number of seepage channels increased the changes in m 21 and m 22 were nearly the same m 23 changed before the rainwater seeped to the bottom area which was about 1 5 h faster than at the interface this phenomenon indicated that the rainwater in the bottom area did not come from seepage at the internal interface but came instead from the bottom interface as mentioned above since it was affected by water concentration in the middle of the interface m 22 gradually decreased to a lower value over time causing the middle of the loess filled to become the area of water concentration m 23 remained at a higher value however which hindered rainwater seepage to the bottom area therefore the reason why water accumulated in the middle area was not only due to the lower matric suction in the middle area but also to higher matric suction in the bottom area 4 1 4 the influence of matric suction on seepage in the loess filled slope the pore of the interface forms the transportation channel of rainwater and gas because the size of pore is so small to make gas collide with the soil skeleton when infiltrated rainwater pushes the gas to move along the interface the phenomenon of gas flow is called knudsen diffusion the gas molecules adsorb on the surface of soil skeleton before rainfall fig 11 a when infiltrated rainwater seep along the pore channel the gas molecules desorb and increase pore pressure javadpour et al 2007 an apparent permeability was defined to further explain the knudsen diffusion the apparent permeability includes properties of flowing gas at specified pressure and temperature research shows that the smaller the size of the pores the larger the difference between apparent permeability and darcy permeability the lower pressures also make difference between apparent permeability and darcy permeability expand a new formulation was proposed to describe the effect of pore size pressure temperature and gas molar mass on gas flow the formulation found that diffusional flux contribution was higher at lower pressure javadpour 2009 the inter aggregate pores in loess are mainly dimensions of tens of microns others are considerably smaller than one micron li et al 2018 yu et al 2022a the matric suction in the interface and the loess filled slope ranges from 1 5 kpa to 325 kpa at the range of pore size and pressure the pressure is the main factor determining gas permeability the internal cause of gas movement is the seepage of infiltrated rainwater knudsen diffusion occurs in the micro pore of loess the gas molecules adsorbing on the surface of soil desorb and increase pore air pressure ua fig 11 b the increase of ua reduces the difference between apparent permeability and darcy permeability it means that ua has little effects on the permeability of gas the total flux of gas also decreases the ua at the gas water interface increases temporarily this prevents the infiltrated rainwater from seeping along the interface which leads to water concentration in the middle of the interface fig 11 c but the increase of ua is temporary in the subsequent rainfall the rainwater gradually fills the pore of the interface total flux of gas also increases which causes the decreases of ua and makes infiltrated rainwater seep along the interface to the bottom area fig 11 d the process described above is also reflected in the variation of matric suction matric suction and volume water content are two interactive factors that both hinder seepage in soil previous studies have shown that the interface is the preferential surface for rainwater seepage gerscovich et al 2006 wu et al 2018 and the above model test results explain the cause of this phenomenon from the perspective of unsaturated seepage at the beginning of rainfall rainwater tends to seep along the interface due to its lower matric suction which causes the interface to become the preferential seepage channel as the rainfall continues this preferential channel of seepage makes it possible for rainwater to reach the inside of loess filled slope faster than that of the slope without the interface the low matric suction in the middle of the interface also causes rainwater to accumulate in the middle area of the interface in addition the high matric suction at the bottom of the loess filled slope hinders rainwater to seep along the internal interface this eventually leads to water concentration in the middle of the interface the observe hysteresis of matric suction in the loess filled slope also indicated that volume water content in the loess filled slope was caused by seepage from the interface which accelerates the saturation process of the loess filled slope the regular variation of the volume water content in the bottom area is obviously different from that of top area and middle area this is because the rainwater recharge in the bottom area not only comes from the seepage at the internal interface but also from the unsaturated seepage at the bottom interface 4 2 characteristics of permeability at the interface of the loess filled slope under rainfall 4 2 1 the variation law of permeability coefficient at the interface to obtain a gradient of matric suction we divided the swcc shown in fig 7 a into 20 fractions and substituted them into eqs 2 2 2 4 the calculated permeability coefficient and the fitting results of the exponential function are shown in fig 12 and the fitting function is shown in eq 4 1 4 1 k 2 45 10 5 e 0 88 m where m is the matrix suction and k is the permeability coefficient from the test we can see that the soil of the loess filled slope had lower density and looser pores than the original soil which are conducive to rainfall infiltration rainwater seeps through the pores and during the process the pores expand and connect resulting in changes in the permeability coefficient hence the change in the permeability coefficient is a change due to changing pores the permeability coefficient in the middle area was much higher than that in the top area indicating that the middle area had the largest porosity and the strongest connectivity 1st rainfall in fig 13 moreover most of the seepage rainwater seeped along the interface to the middle area and then continued to seep into the loess filled slope although the heights of these areas were different they had similar stage characteristics the bottom area of the interface was not connected to the middle area or the top area and the infiltrated rainwater had not yet reached the bottom area along the interface after the 1st rainfall fig 13 the merely slight change in the bottom area was caused by the preferential seepage at the bottom interface after 1 h of rainfall on the next day however the whole interface was quickly connected the permeability coefficient in the bottom area rose to the maximum over the entire rainfall process and even reached the level of that in the middle area 2nd rainfall in fig 13 however the permeability coefficient at the bottom did not reach this value during subsequent rainfall fig 13 we presume that the reason for this was the high effective stress in the bottom area after the end of each day s rainfall seepage rainwater was discharged into the loess filled slope through different ways the pore water pressure in the soil decreased effective stress increased and overburden pressure in the soil skeleton also increased which ultimately led to pore compression in the soil thus even if the rainfall conditions were unchanged all interfaces became seepage surface for infiltration and the permeability coefficient of the bottom area could no longer reach the maximum value after the 2nd day the bottom area of the interface subsequently exhibited stage characteristics similar to other areas 2nd rainfall in fig 13 4 2 2 stage characteristics of the interfacial permeability coefficient of the interface we divided the variation in the permeability coefficient at the interface into six stages during the intermittent rainfall the characteristics of each stage are summarized and analyzed from the perspectives of permeability coefficient matric suction and pores in table 8 and the characteristics of each stage are shown in fig 14 after the 2nd rainfall the volume water content at the interface is much higher than the initial water content so stage 1 is not obvious during subsequent rainfall more and more seepage water are then left at the interface after rainfall and the characteristics of stage 6 become more unclear only stage 2 stage 3 stage 4 and stage 5 maintain the variation characteristics of initial rainfall throughout the process however we note that the permeability coefficients at different heights of the interface experience all the above stages except for the fact that the maximum values are different this phenomenon shows that the seepage law of the interface is consistent and does not change due to the height of the interface 4 2 3 the variation law of pores at the interface during intermittent rainfall compared with the infiltration mechanism of groundwater mound we think that the seepage mechanism of the interfaces in loess filled slopes has similarity at the beginning of rainfall an area of water concentration grows slowly by viscous flow through the sediment matrix once the water reaches a critical level a rapid dispersion of the infiltrating fluid occurs through macropores antia 2008 at the end of rainfall the infiltrated rainwater is held in place by the change in flow regime at the mounds boundaries antia 2010 this results in a flow rate for the descending groundwater mound which is controlled by knudsen diffusion antia 2009a antia 2008 the permeability coefficient of the interface and loess filled slope dictated by the knudsen diffusion permeability antia 2009b as mentioned above the pore size of loess and the size of matric suction make the apparent permeability coefficient determined by the knudsen diffusion almost the same as darcy s permeability coefficient therefore the calculated permeability coefficient by the childs and collis geroge model can represent viscous flow of the interface the rainwater cannot seep to the bottom area not only because of the high matrix suction at the bottom but also because the pores for rainwater seepage in the bottom area are compacted by effective stress the pores in the internal interface and the bottom interface are looser than those of the loess filled slope as well fig 15 a thus the infiltrating rainwater migrates through the pores in the interface fig 15 b during intermittent rainfall the pores undergo a dynamic process the permeability coefficient is significantly increased by expanding and connecting pores and vice versa the soil skeleton is squeezed by pore water pressure and part of the soil particles are taken away by rainwater which expands the open pores and connect the closed pores fig 15 c in our model we found that the pores of the middle area were the largest and the permeability coefficient was the highest there fig 15 c the bottom area is not connected to other areas at the beginning of the rainfall fig 15 c hence the permeability coefficient of the bottom area isn t changed by the rainfall as the bottom area is also connected by rainwater the permeability coefficient at the bottom gradually increases until it exceeds the permeability coefficient at the top area however this phenomenon doesn t last long and the reason for this is related to the effective stress at the pores the bottom area is subjected to the highest effective stress and the pores of the bottom area are compacted after the rainfall as described above fig 15 d thus the permeability coefficient of the bottom area does not exceed that of the top area during the subsequent rainfall in addition since the rainwater accumulates in the middle area the pores of middle area are the largest the interface then becomes a stable seepage channel which causes rainwater to migrate to the loess filled slope and accelerates its saturation process fig 15 e 4 3 development

failure and preferential seepage of the internal interfaces is discussed i the unsaturated seepage mechanism of the interfaces in loess filled slopes makes the infiltrated rainwater accumulate in the middle of the loess filled slope the water content of middle area surges to result in the partial disintegration of the surface of loess filled slope wang et al 2019a a shallow failure occurred at the surface in the middle area of loess filled slope fig 16 a ii the water sensitivity of loess is triggered and the strength of loess is weakened leng et al 2021 the middle area of shallow failure is expanded fig 16 b iii with the increase of rainfall the soil properties of the slope are further deteriorated the effective stress decreases while the weight of the slope increases the variation of the stress field leads to the shallow sliding in the loess filled slope fig 16 c iv the flow inside the soil layer is porous media flow which is governed by biot s theory of poro elasticity biot 1955 based on the biot s poro elasticity theory a relationship between stress and the permeability was figured out which is that seepage discharge and fluid shear stress increase with the soil permeability hsieh and yang 2013 thus according to the calculated permeability coefficient in fig 13 the shear stress at the interface increases with rainfall among them the permeability coefficient in the middle area of the interface is the highest it means that the interface is the potential failure surface of slope failure and the middle area of the interface is stress concentration area v the reason why shallow slides occur in the middle of the loess filled slope is caused by multiple factors first the water accumulation in the middle of the interface also results in the water accumulation in the middle of the loess filled slope second the water sensitivity of loess is triggered the soil properties of the middle area in the loess filled slope are deteriorated the unsaturated effective pressure decreases and pore water pressure increases the closed pore is connected the pore is expanded and the permeability is increased finally the strength of loess filled slope decreases and the shear stress of the middle area in the loess filled slope increases which leads to shallow slides of the loess filled slope the above phenomena indicate that the variation in pores at different heights is affected by effective stress pore variation and matric suction together result in water accumulation in the middle of the loess filled slope crucially the entire process is irreversible so that the rainwater cannot seep along the interface but instead accumulates in the middle of the interface and eventually enter the loess filled slope furthermore slope damage developed at the middle of the slope can also indicate water accumulation in the middle of the slope fig 16 the failure process clearly couples the interface seepage the unsaturated theory with the strength of soil controlled by biot s poroelasticity theory and effective stress principal through the permeability property of soil the interaction mechanism of seepage field and stress field of loess filled slope with interface is revealed a solution for fluid solid coupling calculation of loess filled slope is provided the results have a guiding significance on the field applications of interfacial impermeable prevention measures based on the seepage mechanism of the internal interface prevention measures for loess filled slope surface should be applied to the middle area ecologically friendly slope protection can be used to avoid shallow sliding zhang et al 2021a adding drainage to the internal interface is another method to increase slope stability by setting impermeable materials in the middle of the loess filled slope fig 17 the water content of the slope can be effectively decreased and the strength of the soil can be improved so that slope failure may be prevented 5 conclusions this study brought to light the unsaturated seepage mechanism on interfaces in loess filled slopes induced by intermittent rainfall we draw the following specific conclusions 1 rainwater tends to infiltrate from the interface and water accumulation occurs in the middle of the interface and loess filled slope in addition low matric suction in middle area and high matric suction occurs in the bottom area which we found through the transform of the swcc the knudsen diffusion increases the matric suction of the bottom area at the early stage of rainfall and hinders the infiltration of rainwater along the interface this means that the matric suction hinders the unsaturated seepage of the loess filled slope with the interface thus the most of rainwater cannot seep to the bottom area along the interface which results in the aforementioned accumulation 2 compared to the matric suction of the loess filled slope the matric suction at the interface is significantly lower as a result rainwater tends to seep along the interface in addition the rainwater in the bottom area does not come from seepage at the internal interface but come instead from the bottom interface at the beginning of rainfall the saturation process inside the loess filled slope is thus controlled by internal interface and bottom interface therefore the matric suction of the loess filled slope exhibits hysteresis 3 the permeability coefficient of the interface at each area can be calculated based on the matric suction which can then be divided into six stages according to the permeability coefficient matric suction and pore size the variation in the permeability coefficient is related to the dynamic process of the soil pores after intermittent rainfall the pores at different areas are subjected to different effective stresses which results in their compaction reducing their ability to transport rainwater additionally the bottom area has the highest compaction and the weakest ability to transport rainwater therefore the rainwater cannot seep to the bottom area not only because of the high matrix suction at the bottom but also because the pores for seepage in the bottom area are compacted by effective stress and become too small to transport rainwater credit authorship contribution statement daijin yu data curation formal analysis writing original draft qiangbing huang conceptualization

2131,the transformation between shallow phreatic water and soil water during the freezing thawing period affects the accurate evaluation of water resources and aggravates soil salinization in laboratory freezing thawing experiments constant temperature freezing at 10 20 and 25 c was conducted for 62 successive days and natural thawing was conducted for 13 days with a groundwater table depth of 1 0 m the variations in the soil temperature upward migration amount of phreatic water to soil water uma and downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water dma of soil columns with particle sizes of d50 0 3 mm a1 d50 0 75 mm b1 d50 1 25 mm c1 d50 1 75 mm d1 and d50 2 25 mm e1 and different particle gradations with inhomogeneity coefficients of 3 47 a2 4 69 b2 8 31 c2 14 67 d2 and 19 08 e2 were analyzed the results showed that the soil temperature was more variable and reached stability earlier as the soil particle size or inhomogeneity coefficient increased the cumulative uma decreased as the soil particle size increased and the inhomogeneity coefficient decreased during the freezing process for the constant temperature freezing at 10 20 and 25 c the cumulative uma and average soil particle size were fitted using an exponential function but the effect of the soil particle size on the uma gradually weakened as the freezing air temperature decreased the daily dma decreased as the soil particle size decreased and the particle gradation improved during days 0 5 of the thawing stage while the cumulative dma increased as the soil particle size decreased and the inhomogeneity coefficient increased after days 9 10 during the thawing stage the groundwater was in a negative equilibrium under freezing thawing action and the consumption of groundwater was greater when the average soil particle size was smaller and the inhomogeneity coefficient was larger during the freezing thawing process the results of this study have important significance for soil salinization prevention and the scientific evaluation of water resources keywords freezing thawing phreatic water soil particle size inhomogeneity coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the infiltration migration evaporation and transformation of soil water during the seasonal freezing thawing period are essential components of the natural water cycle most of the arid and semi arid areas in northern china are seasonally frozen soil zones in which the soil experiences freezing and thawing processes in winter and spring making the transformation between phreatic water and soil water in the shallow groundwater areas extremely strong chen et al 2013 the phreatic water migrates into the frozen layer under the effect of the soil water potential gradient during the freezing period hansson and lundin 2005 ireson et al 2012 and the salts dissolved in the groundwater are gradually transported to the freezing front and soil salinization occurs during the thawing stage in the spring bechtold et al 2011 li et al 2020 liu et al 2009 when the liquid water content of the surface soil increases in spring the excessive amount of water can lead to waterlogging and mud pumping bayard et al 2005 the transformation between phreatic water and soil water during the freezing thawing period has essential impacts on agriculture water resources the ecological environment and human engineering activities bing et al 2015 chen et al 2022 ouyang et al 2015 it not only restricts the sustainable development of agriculture but is also detrimental to the efficient use of local water resources and ecological environmental protection therefore this research has important theoretical guiding significance for the scientific evaluation of groundwater resources and the prevention of soil salinization soil water as the most active factor in the three phase composition of soil is the link between surface water and groundwater the mutual transformation between soil water and phreatic water is very intense in areas with shallow groundwater that is the upward migration of phreatic water to soil water and downward movement of soil water to phreatic water alternately occur sun et al 2021 some scholars have used modeling batsukh et al 2022 hughes et al 2021 and novel techniques such as satellite barbosa et al 2022 and geospatial analysis sahu et al 2022 subba rao et al 2022 tafila et al 2022 to actively explore the extent of groundwater recharge in different regions and important research results have been obtained regarding the factors influencing groundwater recharge ashraf et al 2022 buhay bucton et al 2022 christine et al 2022 hassan et al 2022 tulip et al 2022 however there is a lack of exploration of the mechanisms laws and research methods in terms of the transformation between phreatic water and soil water and little research has been conducted on related monitoring techniques mehrnegar et al 2021 chinese scholars have conducted a great deal of research on the transformation patterns of phreatic water and soil water under different experimental conditions he and li 2015 zhao et al 2020 and experimental methods jiang et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 significant progress has been made in understanding the transformation mechanisms of phreatic water and soil water and the applicable scope of the different research methods during the non freezing period however the transformation between phreatic water and soil water becomes exceptionally complex during the freezing thawing period when the soil water and phreatic water migrate and transform constantly under the action of the soil water potential gradient li et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 and their transformation patterns are influenced by various factors such as the soil properties initial soil water content temperature and salinity li et al 2016 and groundwater table depth hansson and lundin 2005 xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 therefore there are relatively few research results on the transformation between phreatic water and soil water under freezing thawing action and the existing results were mainly obtained through field observations chen et al 2018 miao et al 2017 yu et al 2021 laboratory tests and numerical simulations chen et al 2019 cui et al 2020 conducted to investigate the transformation mechanism and regularity during the freezing thawing period to accurately monitor the upward migration amount of phreatic water to soil water uma and downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water dma scholars have conducted many field experiments using lysimeters but their experimental results have significant differences and affected by the meteorology of the study area numerical simulations as another essential tool for studying the phreatic water transformation process are based on specific regional natural conditions and often require considering the applicability of the model s use while reducing the uncertainty introduced by the model parameters the establishment and validation of the model require a large amount of accurate data as a basis okkonen et al 2017 in contrast laboratory tests can set test conditions and control some influencing factors and the effects of freezing and thawing on the transformation between phreatic water and soil water can be studied under different laboratory conditions the migration of phreatic water is mainly affected by the soil water transport capacity which is closely related to the soil texture gilpin 1980 lai et al 2012 hansson and lundin 2005 in non freezing period the homogeneous gong et al 2018 and layered shi et al 2012 soil and particle composition an et al 2018 influenced the migration of phreatic water the soil particle size was negatively correlated with uma during freezing period with only three kinds of soil particle size using field lysimeters chen et al 2018 soil gradation reflects the relative content of each particle group contained in the soil affecting soil water characteristic curve meskini vishkaee et al 2014 soil erosion zhai et al 2020 land use type qi et al 2018 and pollutant transport ghiasi et al 2020 the inadequate understanding of the transformation between shallow phreatic water and soil water under different particle sizes and soil gradations during freezing thawing periods prompted this study laboratory experiments on the transformation between shallow phreatic water and soil water under freezing thawing action were carried out to explore the spatial and temporal variations in the soil temperature profile to analyze the influences of the soil particle size and gradation on uma and dma under freezing thawing action and to determine the relationships between the difference between uma and dma qd and the average soil particle size and inhomogeneity coefficient respectively the research revealed the influences of the soil physical properties on the freezing thawing soil temperature and phreatic transformation 2 material and methods 2 1 laboratory device the freezing thawing laboratory device used to study the transformation between phreatic water and soil water was mainly composed of a refrigeration unit insulation device temperature humidity sensor thermistor temperature collector seepage bottle soil column and constant headwater supply system fig 1 the refrigeration unit was a numerically controlled refrigeration unit with a minimum cooling temperature of 35 c and a temperature control accuracy of 0 1 c allowing the freezing temperature to be artificially regulated the insulation device was constructed of a polyvinyl chloride pvc sheet filled with polyurethane in the middle with a thickness of 5 cm a length of 140 cm a width of 60 cm and a height of 100 cm and the upper part was covered with a foam insulation panel with a thickness of 10 cm thus the temperature of the insulation device was not affected by the refrigeration unit the temperature humidity sensor was usb type temperature and humidity recorders and was used to monitor and record the temperature and humidity changes in the surface soil during the freezing and thawing process the temperature monitoring range was 40 to 80 c with a monitoring accuracy of 0 1 c and the humidity monitoring range was 0 to 100 relative humidity rh with a monitoring accuracy of 1 5 rh the thermistor temperature collectors were multi channel data collectors and the input signal included 32 channels with an accuracy of 0 2 s channel the seepage bottles were 250 ml graduated cylinders with an accuracy of 2 ml the soil columns were 110 cm high and had an inner diameter of 15 cm they were constructed of a plexiglas tube with a thickness of 5 mm and the exterior of the columns was insulated with a 2 5 cm thick insulation layer to prevent heat exchange with the external environment the constant headwater supply system was based on the principle of a constant headwater supply of a mariotte bottle consisting of mariotte bottles with a height of 90 cm and a diameter of 8 cm and balance bottles with a height of 40 cm and a diameter of 16 cm 2 2 laboratory methods soil samples were collected from the taigu water balance experimental field of the hydrology and water resources survey station in shanxi province the samples were screened using standard laboratory sieves after air drying grinding and removing roots and other debris the soil columns were filled with five types of soil samples with different particle sizes and gradations to achieve a designed density of 1 3 1 5 g cm3 the soil columns with different particle sizes were labeled as a1 d50 0 3 mm soil particle size of 0 1 0 5 mm b1 d50 0 75 mm soil particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm c1 d50 1 25 mm soil particle size of 1 0 1 5 mm d1 d50 1 75 mm soil particle size of 1 5 2 0 mm and e1 d50 2 25 mm soil particle size of 2 0 2 5 mm according to the usda classification system the soils belong to sand the main physical parameters of the soil columns are presented in table 1 the five soil columns with different particle gradations were recorded as a2 b2 c2 d2 and e2 the main physical parameters are presented in table 2 and the soil particle gradation curves are shown in fig 2 the curvature coefficients of the five soil samples were 1 cc 3 and the particle gradation improved as the inhomogeneity coefficient increased that is the soil particle gradation gradually improved from a2 to e2 to prevent the fine soil particles in the soil column from blocking the water valve and pipeline when filling the soil columns a 10 cm thick inverted quartz sand layer was added to the bottom of the soil column and the inverted layer was separated from the soil sample by a double layer of fine mesh the thermistors were buried at depths of 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 cm in the soil columns to monitor the soil temperature every 2 h the filled soil columns were continuous and uniform and were connected to a constant headwater supply system the groundwater table depth was set to 1 0 m and the soil columns were supplied with pure water for seven days using the constant headwater supply system to ensure that the soil moisture reached a stable state before the freezing thawing experiments were conducted during the freezing process the upward migration amount of phreatic water to soil water uma was observed using the mariotte bottle and the downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water dma was monitored using the seepage bottle during the thawing process every 2 h finally both were converted to the height of water per unit of soil column cross sectional area the transformation relationships are as follows 1 q ei l i 1 l i c e 2 q rei w i 1 w i c r where qei is the upward migration amount of phreatic water to soil water on day i mm l i and l i 1 are the heights of the water level of the mariotte bottle at 8 00 am on day i and day i 1 mm respectively ce is the transformative factor between the falling height of the mariotte bottle and the rising height of the water in the soil column ce 3 52 qrei is the downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water on day i mm w i and w i 1 are the amounts of water in the infiltration bottle at 8 00 a m on day i and day i 1 ml respectively and cr is the transformative factor between the water volume in the infiltration bottle and the falling height of the water in the soil column cr 17 60 the freezing thawing laboratory tests were conducted for 75 d the freezing process was carried out at three constant freezing temperatures of 10 20 and 25 c which were adjusted when the soil temperature profile reached a stable state and the freezing process lasted for 62 d at a constant freezing air temperature of 10 c soil temperature profile of the soil column reached a steady state and the daily uma decreased on the 26th day of freezing at this time the freezing air temperature was adjusted to 20 c and the freezing was continued at a constant temperature a new steady state was achieved at 54 d and the freezing temperature was further reduced to 25 c a new steady state was achieved again at 62 d and the freezing was stopped after this the soil columns were allowed to thaw in the natural laboratory environment and the thawing process was completed when the daily dma approximately reached 0 on the 75th day the temperature and humidity were monitored every 5 min during the freezing thawing process 3 results 3 1 freezing thawing temperature and relative humidity during the freezing process the variations in the daily average temperature and daily average relative humidity were the same exhibiting fluctuating step like changes fig 3 from day 3 to day 26 of the freezing stage the average daily freezing temperature fluctuated around 10 c and the average daily relative humidity was approximately 82 from day 30 to day 54 during the freezing stage the average daily freezing temperature was approximately 20 c and the average daily relative humidity was approximately 73 from day 55 to day 62 during the freezing stage the daily average freezing temperature was approximately 25 c and the average daily relative humidity was approximately 67 after this the freezing stage was stopped and the thawing stage began the daily increase in the temperature was greater than 3 c from day 0 to day 6 during the thawing stage this was the rapid warming stage and the average daily increase in relative humidity was greater than 4 the daily increase in the temperature was less than 1 c from day 7 to day 13 during the thawing stage this was the stable fluctuation stage and the average daily increase in relative humidity was less than 1 3 2 effect of the soil particle size on the soil temperature profile 1 freezing stage the air temperature had a significant effect on the soil temperature profile the soil temperature at different depths decreased as the air temperature decreased the change in soil temperature profile significantly lagged behind the change in the air temperature because the heat capacity of the soil was significantly higher than that of the air and the lag time increased as the soil depth increased the soil temperature profiles of five different particle size columns during the freezing stage are shown in fig 4 during the freezing process the soil temperature profile decreased with increasing soil depth and the soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm was 16 55 17 41 c lower than that at a depth of 30 cm on day 62 the soil temperature at the same depth decreased more rapidly and was lower during freezing stabilization as the soil particle size increased when the freezing temperature was the same at the end of the freezing stage day 62 the smallest temperature drop of 17 70 34 22 c was observed in a1 and the largest drop of 22 05 39 42 c was observed in e1 since the thermal conductivity of the soil increased with increasing soil particle size the average soil temperature gradient in the 5 30 cm depth interval gradually became larger as the soil particle size increased when the soil temperature was stable under constant temperature freezing at 25 c the average soil temperature gradient of a1 was the smallest 0 66 c cm and that of e1 was the largest 0 70 c cm 2 thawing stage the soil temperature profiles of five different particle size columns during the thawing stage are shown in fig 5 according to the daily increase in the soil temperature profile t the temperature change can be divided into three stages a rapid warming stage t greater than 2 5 c a slow warming stage 0 3 t 2 5 c and a stable change stage t less than 0 3 c during 0 3 d of thawing the temperature variation was very small the curve of the soil temperature was approximately a straight horizontal line and the soil thawing rate increased with increasing soil particle size the daily increase in the soil temperature in a1 was 0 03 0 21 c and it entered the rapid warming stage at 5 6 d however the daily increase in the soil temperature in e1 was 0 12 0 21 c and it entered the rapid warming stage at 4 5 d the soil warming in e1 increased by 33 91 45 68 compared with that in a1 during days 5 9 of the thawing stage the soil temperature gradient decreased as the air temperature continuously increased during days 9 10 of the thawing stage which led to the soil temperature change entering the slow warming stage soil columns d1 and e1 gradually reached the stable change state at 11 12 d while soil columns a1 b1 and c1 reached this stage 1 2 d later at the end of the thawing stage the soil warming in e1 was the largest 22 57 40 07 c and that of a1 was the smallest i e 14 90 22 11 lower than that of e1 3 3 effect of the soil gradation on the soil temperature profile 1 freezing stage the soil temperature profiles of five different gradation columns during the freezing stage are shown in fig 6 the soil temperature profile changes can be divided into three stages a rapid cooling stage t greater than 2 5 c a slow cooling stage 0 3 t 2 5 c and a stable change stage t less than 0 3 c during the constant temperature freezing process at 10 c the soil freezing rate decreased as the gradation became poorer soil column a2 entered the slow cooling stage at 3 4 d of the freezing stage and it entered the stable change stage at 8 10 d e2 entered these stages 1 2 d earlier than a2 when the constant temperature freezing at 10 c was stable day 26 of the freezing stage the soil temperature profile decreased as the inhomogeneity coefficient increased the soil temperature profile of e2 was 7 83 3 5 c which was 2 46 3 88 c lower than that of a2 during the freezing process at constant temperatures of 20 c and 25 c the temperature variation trends were similar to that for constant temperature freezing at 10 c that is the soil temperature of soil column e2 decreased the fastest however during constant temperature freezing at 25 c the drop in the soil temperature profile under the influence of the temperature gradient was significantly smaller than the previous two drops in temperature due to the smaller decrease in the freezing temperature the soil temperature profile was significantly influenced by the soil particle gradation and the soil temperature profile decreased more quickly when the particle gradation was better resulting in a larger soil temperature profile gradient and further leading to a lower soil temperature when the freezing was stable at the end of the freezing stage day 62 the soil temperature profile of a2 was the highest 11 46 c to 0 79 c and that of e2 was the lowest 17 69 c to 2 9 c the temperature drop of e2 was 17 92 25 82 greater than that of a2 the average soil temperature gradient in the depth range of 5 30 cm in e2 was 0 59 c cm which was 0 1 c cm higher than that in a2 in addition there was a lag in the temperature change in the vertical direction and the drop in the soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm was 69 28 73 89 greater than that at a depth of 30 cm after freezing stability was attained 2 thawing stage the soil temperature profiles of five different gradation columns during the thawing stage are shown in fig 7 the rate of soil thawing increased as the soil gradation became better the average daily increase in the soil temperature in soil column a2 which had the worst gradation was 1 33 2 27 c d which was 0 32 0 52 c d lower than that in e2 soil column which had the best gradation the warming amplitude decreased with increasing soil depth the average daily increase in the soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm was 2 27 2 79 c d which was 69 15 72 87 higher than that at a depth of 30 cm 3 4 effect of the soil particle size on the phreatic transformation 1 upward migration of phreatic water to soil water the soil moisture and heat were redistributed during the freezing period the shallow phreatic water and deeper soil moisture continuously migrated upwards and the cumulative and daily uma decreased with increasing soil particle size fig 8 at the beginning of the freezing stage 0 5 d the daily umas of the soil columns with different particle sizes ranged from 0 08 mm d 1 to 0 33 mm d 1 and the cumulative uma was small subsequently the daily uma increased continuously under the effect of the soil water potential gradient the daily uma decreased on day 26 when the soil temperatures were stable the cumulative uma in a1 increased by 190 02 compared to e1 when the freezing temperature dropped to 20 c the soil temperature decreased rapidly with decreasing freezing temperature the liquid water phase at the freezing front turned into ice and the soil water potential gradient increased resulting in a rapid increase in the daily uma which reached a maximum of 0 74 1 99 mm d 1 during days 32 35 of the freezing stage then the daily uma began to decrease and the cumulative uma increased by 15 98 42 64 mm compared with that before cooling on day 54 when the freezing temperature dropped to 25 c the decrease in the soil temperature profile was smaller and the increase in cumulative uma decreased significantly compared with the previous two cooling stages at the end of the freezing stage the daily uma was 0 05 0 10 mm d 1 and the migration process was essentially completed the cumulative uma in a1 increased by 160 10 compared with that in e1 the fitting and regression analysis of the cumulative uma and the average soil particle size during the freezing process revealed that the cumulative uma and the average soil particle size were well fitted by the following exponential function 3 qe a e bd where qe is the cumulative uma mm d is the average soil particle size mm and a and b are regression coefficients related to the soil particle size the fitting curves of the cumulative uma and the average soil particle size at the end of the constant temperature freezing stages at 10 20 and 25 c are shown in fig 9 and the results of the regression analysis are presented in table 3 the correlation coefficients r2 of the fitting equations are all greater than 0 99 indicating that the variation in the cumulative uma with the soil average particle size during the freezing process can be well characterized by the above equations at a given significance level of α 0 05 f0 05 p n p 1 f0 05 1 3 10 13 indicating that the regression equations are strongly significant with f f0 05 p n p 1 it can be seen that the cumulative uma decreases exponentially with increasing particle size the regression coefficient a increases gradually and the absolute value of b decreases gradually with decreasing freezing air temperature this indicates that as the freezing temperature decreases the degree of the soil water phase change increases most of the soil pores are filled with ice and the cumulative uma increases continuously but the influence of the soil particle size on the uma weakens 2 downward movement of soil water to phreatic water the soil particle size determines the hydraulic conductivity and water holding characteristics of the soil which affect the downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water during the thawing process the cumulative and daily dma of the soil columns with five different particle sizes during the thawing stage are shown in fig 10 there were significant differences in the variation trends of the cumulative and daily dma of the soil columns with different particle sizes during the different thawing stages the daily dma increased with increasing particle size on days 0 5 of the thawing stage that of a1 was 2 32 mm d 1 on day 5 and that of e1 was 87 10 higher than that of a1 the cumulative dma of the soil columns with smaller particle sizes increased rapidly on days 6 9 of the thawing stage with the highest daily dma of 12 06 mm d 1 occurring in a1 on day 9 that of e1 was 84 41 lower than that of a1 the daily dmas of d1 and e1 were only 0 57 and 0 6 mm d 1 on day 12 while those of a1 b1 and c1 which had smaller particle sizes reached 0 26 0 72 mm d 1 on day 13 that is the dma stabilized earlier in the columns with larger soil particle sizes the cumulative dma during the thawing process decreased with increasing soil particle size it was 44 60 mm in soil column a1 which was 149 16 higher than that in e1 3 5 effect of the soil gradation on the phreatic transformation 1 upward migration of phreatic water to soil water the soil water potential gradient determines the rate and direction of the water migration during the freezing period while the soil gradation influences the degrees of variation in the soil temperature and liquid water content the variation trends of the cumulative uma for the soil columns with different gradations were the same fig 11 a that is the cumulative uma gradually increased with increasing freezing time and finally became stable when the freezing at a constant air temperature of 10 c was stable day 26 of the freezing stage the cumulative uma in e2 was 14 82 mm which was 9 71 mm higher than that in a2 which had the worst gradation during constant air temperature freezing at 20 c 27 54 d the soil temperature gradient increased as the freezing air temperature significantly decreased which intensified the uma and the maximum daily uma was 0 67 2 05 mm d 1 fig 11 b the daily uma was smaller during the freezing at a constant air temperature of 25 c and the uma in a2 e2 was only 1 4 2 02 mm when the freezing was stable day 62 of the freezing stage the cumulative uma increased as the soil particle gradation improved and it was 20 03 mm in a2 which was 63 02 lower than that in e2 2 downward movement of soil water to phreatic water the daily dma of the soil columns with different particle gradations initially increased and then decreased but the relative magnitudes varied significantly with the thawing time the cumulative and daily dmas of a2 e2 are shown in fig 12 the daily dma of the soil column with better particle gradation was smaller during days 0 5 of the thawing stage and the daily dma in e2 on day 5 was 57 43 lower than that in a2 the daily dma of the better graded soil columns increased continuously from day 6 to day 10 of the thawing stage with the maximum daily dma of 10 31 mm d 1 occurring in e2 on day 10 the daily dma decreased during 11 13 d and the cumulative dma gradually reached a stable state the cumulative dma was higher for better soil gradations during the thawing process and it increased from 20 91 to 142 58 in b2 e2 compared to that in a2 3 6 difference between uma and dma the extent of the transformation between phreatic water and soil water can be symbolized by the difference between the uma and dma during the freezing thawing process 4 qd qe qre where qd is the difference between uma and dma mm qe is the upward migration of phreatic water to soil water uma mm and qre is the downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water dma mm qd is strongly correlated with the average soil particle size and the inhomogeneity coefficient as follows 5 qd c e dd 6 qd e e fcu where d is the average soil particle size mm cu is the inhomogeneity coefficient and c d e and f are regression coefficients the correlation coefficients r2 of the fitting equations are all greater than 0 93 and the fitting curves are shown in fig 13 the qd values for the different particle sizes and gradations are positive indicating that the uma is always greater than the dma that is the groundwater upward migrated to the soil water during the freezing thawing period and there was severe consumption of groundwater in the soil groundwater system in addition this may cause soil salinization and other ecological problems qd decreased with increasing soil particle size indicating that the inefficient loss of groundwater decreased as the soil particle size increased while qd increased as the inhomogeneity coefficient increased for 1 cc 3 indicating that the groundwater consumption was greater when the soil gradation was better during the freezing thawing period 4 discussion 4 1 effects of the soil particle size and gradation on the soil temperature profile the change in the soil temperature profile during the freezing thawing period can be influenced by differences in the soil texture fraction of vegetation cover initial soil water content soil thermal capacity and other biophysical factors numerous studies have shown that the thermal conductivity and soil temperature gradient can vary significantly with soil texture chen 2008 zhang et al 2016 affecting the redistribution of the soil moisture and heat during the freezing thawing period and further influencing the pattern of the change in the soil temperature the soil temperature gradient is an important force affecting the redistribution of heat and is also the major factor influencing the soil temperature as the soil particle size increased or the particle gradation became better the porosity decreased and the thermal conductivity increased zhang et al 2015 the soil temperature gradient in the profile increased under the same external temperature change conditions resulting in a larger change in and earlier stabilization of the soil temperature at the same depth therefore the freezing depths of coarse grained soils and soils with an uneven particle distribution are larger in winter chen et al 2019 which has an impact on the annual average temperature surface temperature air thawing index surface thawing index and vegetation growth peng et al 2017 in addition the pattern of the soil temperature variation affected by the external temperature was quite different in the vertical direction during the freezing process the soil temperature at the surface of the soil column in contact with the air was lower than the temperature of the deeper soil and the heat in the deeper part of the soil column was transported upward via convection and thermal conduction under the effect of the temperature gradient the soil thawed in both directions during the thawing process wu et al 2016 but the deeper soil was more slowly affected by the external temperature and thus the temperature gradient of the surface soil was much larger than that of the deeper soil as a result there was an obvious lag in the temperature recovery with increasing soil depth 4 2 transformation between phreatic water and soil water 1 upward migration of phreatic water to soil water the effect of freezing on upward migration of phreatic water to soil water caused the redistribution of the soil water that is the temperature of the upper soil decreases and part of the liquid water in the soil turns to ice during the freezing process causing the shallow phreatic water to migrate upwards driven by the soil water potential gradient hou et al 2019 the soil particle size and gradation are strongly correlated with the uma as the particle size increased and the particle gradation became better the temperature gradient of the soil profile increased during the freezing process and the average soil temperature gradient difference between a1 and e1 was only 0 04 c cm so the temperature gradient of the soil profile was not the main factor influencing the uma the phreatic water migrates into the unsaturated zone through the capillaries the uma is controlled by both the rising height and the frozen depth the maximum rising height is closely related to the soil texture kowalik 2006 li et al 2014 that is soil with a smaller particle size has a larger rising height of capillary water and a stronger water holding capacity as liquid water turns into ice partly in freezing period the freezing front driving liquid water upward migrating in lower unfrozen zone is like the dry soil surface in non freezing season thus when the distance between freezing front and phreatic water table is less than the rising height of capillary of soil the phreatic water can reach the freezing front resulting more sufficient upward migration of phreatic water to soil in our laboratory tests the maximum capillary heights of a1 e1 decrease from 86 7 cm to 34 9 cm demanding their frozen depths larger than 13 3 cm to 65 1 cm to drive sufficient phreatic water upward moving based on the variations of 0 c isothermals in soil profile fig 4 the frozen depth of a1 in the freezing stage at 10 c was about 15 cm while that of e1 was less than 25 cm thus the cumulative uma of a1 with minimum particle size was the largest of all homogeneous soil columns particle gradation refers to the proportions of particles of various sizes to the total amount the average soil particle size of five soil columns with different particle gradations have little difference and the value of 1 05 to 1 07 mm but the inhomogeneity coefficient varied from 3 47 to 19 08 the soil is well graded soil when the inhomogeneity coefficient is greater than 5 the larger pores of better particle gradation are filled with soil particles that decreasing the size of the pores and increasing the capillary effect similar with the effect of particle size the upward migration amount of phreatic water to soil water increased with better particle gradation 2 downward movement of soil water to phreatic water in the thawing stage the soil liquid water in the depth of the frozen layer increase rapidly and the soil was in the low suction stage the soil gravity water was lost from the macropores and the dehydration process was rapid for the larger particle size and poor graded soil hua et al 2021 the downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water for the different soil particle sizes and gradations varied greatly with the thawing time the pore diameter and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil increase as the soil particle size increases and the particle gradation becomes poorer wesseling et al 2009 in contrast in soils with a smaller particle size or better gradation the specific surface area of the soil particles is larger and the specific yield is smaller tan et al 2006 and the soil has a stronger water holding capacity and weaker water release capacity in the initial thawing stage as the soil particle size increased or the particle gradation became poorer the profile temperature increased faster which were conducive to rapid migration of the thawed soil water from the frozen layer into the phreatic water thus the dma increased as the inhomogeneity coefficient decreased and the soil particle size increased during days 0 5 of the thawing stage however the cumulative uma increased as the soil particle size decreased and the particle gradation became better during the freezing period so the liquid water content of the unsaturated zone increased with the increasing air temperature and the soil water continued to migrate downwards under the effect of the gravitational potential gradient and the matrix potential gradient this resulted in a greater daily dma in the later stages of the thawing process for a smaller soil particle size and better particle gradation the downward movement of soil water to phreatic water was less than the upward migration of phreatic water to soil water that is the groundwater was in a negative equilibrium state during the freezing thawing process leading to water enrichment in the soil layer musa et al 2016 the soil with larger particle size and poorer particle gradation had smaller uma and larger specific yield so the difference between uma and dma was smaller than that of smaller particle size and better particle gradation the soil column with the smallest particle size had the greatest water enrichment this is beneficial to vegetation restoration in sandy habitats and to increasing the soil water content of agricultural fields in spring the phreatic water loss was smallest for the column with the poorest soil gradation which had the positive effect of reducing soil salinization 5 conclusions the soil temperature varied more and stabilized earlier in the columns with larger soil particle sizes and a better particle gradation and the variation in the soil temperature decreased with increasing depth during the freezing thawing process the cumulative and daily uma decreased with increasing soil particle size and decreasing inhomogeneity coefficient the maximum cumulative uma in a1 was 160 10 higher than that in e1 and that in e2 was 170 44 higher than that in a2 the relationship between the cumulative uma and the average soil particle size was well fitted by an exponential function and the cumulative uma increased as the freezing air temperature decreased but the effect of the soil particle size on the uma was weakened the daily dma decreased as the soil particle size decreased and the particle gradation became better during days 0 5 of the thawing stage while the cumulative dma decreased with increasing soil particle size and decreasing inhomogeneity coefficient after 9 10 d during the thawing stage during the thawing stage the cumulative dma in a1 was 149 16 higher than that in e1 and that in e2 was 142 58 higher than that in a2 the difference between the uma and dma decreased with increasing soil particle size and the phreatic consumption was greater for better soil gradations during the freezing thawing process the results of this study improve our understanding of the transformation between soil water and phreatic water during the freezing thawing period and have important

2131,the transformation between shallow phreatic water and soil water during the freezing thawing period affects the accurate evaluation of water resources and aggravates soil salinization in laboratory freezing thawing experiments constant temperature freezing at 10 20 and 25 c was conducted for 62 successive days and natural thawing was conducted for 13 days with a groundwater table depth of 1 0 m the variations in the soil temperature upward migration amount of phreatic water to soil water uma and downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water dma of soil columns with particle sizes of d50 0 3 mm a1 d50 0 75 mm b1 d50 1 25 mm c1 d50 1 75 mm d1 and d50 2 25 mm e1 and different particle gradations with inhomogeneity coefficients of 3 47 a2 4 69 b2 8 31 c2 14 67 d2 and 19 08 e2 were analyzed the results showed that the soil temperature was more variable and reached stability earlier as the soil particle size or inhomogeneity coefficient increased the cumulative uma decreased as the soil particle size increased and the inhomogeneity coefficient decreased during the freezing process for the constant temperature freezing at 10 20 and 25 c the cumulative uma and average soil particle size were fitted using an exponential function but the effect of the soil particle size on the uma gradually weakened as the freezing air temperature decreased the daily dma decreased as the soil particle size decreased and the particle gradation improved during days 0 5 of the thawing stage while the cumulative dma increased as the soil particle size decreased and the inhomogeneity coefficient increased after days 9 10 during the thawing stage the groundwater was in a negative equilibrium under freezing thawing action and the consumption of groundwater was greater when the average soil particle size was smaller and the inhomogeneity coefficient was larger during the freezing thawing process the results of this study have important significance for soil salinization prevention and the scientific evaluation of water resources keywords freezing thawing phreatic water soil particle size inhomogeneity coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the infiltration migration evaporation and transformation of soil water during the seasonal freezing thawing period are essential components of the natural water cycle most of the arid and semi arid areas in northern china are seasonally frozen soil zones in which the soil experiences freezing and thawing processes in winter and spring making the transformation between phreatic water and soil water in the shallow groundwater areas extremely strong chen et al 2013 the phreatic water migrates into the frozen layer under the effect of the soil water potential gradient during the freezing period hansson and lundin 2005 ireson et al 2012 and the salts dissolved in the groundwater are gradually transported to the freezing front and soil salinization occurs during the thawing stage in the spring bechtold et al 2011 li et al 2020 liu et al 2009 when the liquid water content of the surface soil increases in spring the excessive amount of water can lead to waterlogging and mud pumping bayard et al 2005 the transformation between phreatic water and soil water during the freezing thawing period has essential impacts on agriculture water resources the ecological environment and human engineering activities bing et al 2015 chen et al 2022 ouyang et al 2015 it not only restricts the sustainable development of agriculture but is also detrimental to the efficient use of local water resources and ecological environmental protection therefore this research has important theoretical guiding significance for the scientific evaluation of groundwater resources and the prevention of soil salinization soil water as the most active factor in the three phase composition of soil is the link between surface water and groundwater the mutual transformation between soil water and phreatic water is very intense in areas with shallow groundwater that is the upward migration of phreatic water to soil water and downward movement of soil water to phreatic water alternately occur sun et al 2021 some scholars have used modeling batsukh et al 2022 hughes et al 2021 and novel techniques such as satellite barbosa et al 2022 and geospatial analysis sahu et al 2022 subba rao et al 2022 tafila et al 2022 to actively explore the extent of groundwater recharge in different regions and important research results have been obtained regarding the factors influencing groundwater recharge ashraf et al 2022 buhay bucton et al 2022 christine et al 2022 hassan et al 2022 tulip et al 2022 however there is a lack of exploration of the mechanisms laws and research methods in terms of the transformation between phreatic water and soil water and little research has been conducted on related monitoring techniques mehrnegar et al 2021 chinese scholars have conducted a great deal of research on the transformation patterns of phreatic water and soil water under different experimental conditions he and li 2015 zhao et al 2020 and experimental methods jiang et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 significant progress has been made in understanding the transformation mechanisms of phreatic water and soil water and the applicable scope of the different research methods during the non freezing period however the transformation between phreatic water and soil water becomes exceptionally complex during the freezing thawing period when the soil water and phreatic water migrate and transform constantly under the action of the soil water potential gradient li et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 and their transformation patterns are influenced by various factors such as the soil properties initial soil water content temperature and salinity li et al 2016 and groundwater table depth hansson and lundin 2005 xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 therefore there are relatively few research results on the transformation between phreatic water and soil water under freezing thawing action and the existing results were mainly obtained through field observations chen et al 2018 miao et al 2017 yu et al 2021 laboratory tests and numerical simulations chen et al 2019 cui et al 2020 conducted to investigate the transformation mechanism and regularity during the freezing thawing period to accurately monitor the upward migration amount of phreatic water to soil water uma and downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water dma scholars have conducted many field experiments using lysimeters but their experimental results have significant differences and affected by the meteorology of the study area numerical simulations as another essential tool for studying the phreatic water transformation process are based on specific regional natural conditions and often require considering the applicability of the model s use while reducing the uncertainty introduced by the model parameters the establishment and validation of the model require a large amount of accurate data as a basis okkonen et al 2017 in contrast laboratory tests can set test conditions and control some influencing factors and the effects of freezing and thawing on the transformation between phreatic water and soil water can be studied under different laboratory conditions the migration of phreatic water is mainly affected by the soil water transport capacity which is closely related to the soil texture gilpin 1980 lai et al 2012 hansson and lundin 2005 in non freezing period the homogeneous gong et al 2018 and layered shi et al 2012 soil and particle composition an et al 2018 influenced the migration of phreatic water the soil particle size was negatively correlated with uma during freezing period with only three kinds of soil particle size using field lysimeters chen et al 2018 soil gradation reflects the relative content of each particle group contained in the soil affecting soil water characteristic curve meskini vishkaee et al 2014 soil erosion zhai et al 2020 land use type qi et al 2018 and pollutant transport ghiasi et al 2020 the inadequate understanding of the transformation between shallow phreatic water and soil water under different particle sizes and soil gradations during freezing thawing periods prompted this study laboratory experiments on the transformation between shallow phreatic water and soil water under freezing thawing action were carried out to explore the spatial and temporal variations in the soil temperature profile to analyze the influences of the soil particle size and gradation on uma and dma under freezing thawing action and to determine the relationships between the difference between uma and dma qd and the average soil particle size and inhomogeneity coefficient respectively the research revealed the influences of the soil physical properties on the freezing thawing soil temperature and phreatic transformation 2 material and methods 2 1 laboratory device the freezing thawing laboratory device used to study the transformation between phreatic water and soil water was mainly composed of a refrigeration unit insulation device temperature humidity sensor thermistor temperature collector seepage bottle soil column and constant headwater supply system fig 1 the refrigeration unit was a numerically controlled refrigeration unit with a minimum cooling temperature of 35 c and a temperature control accuracy of 0 1 c allowing the freezing temperature to be artificially regulated the insulation device was constructed of a polyvinyl chloride pvc sheet filled with polyurethane in the middle with a thickness of 5 cm a length of 140 cm a width of 60 cm and a height of 100 cm and the upper part was covered with a foam insulation panel with a thickness of 10 cm thus the temperature of the insulation device was not affected by the refrigeration unit the temperature humidity sensor was usb type temperature and humidity recorders and was used to monitor and record the temperature and humidity changes in the surface soil during the freezing and thawing process the temperature monitoring range was 40 to 80 c with a monitoring accuracy of 0 1 c and the humidity monitoring range was 0 to 100 relative humidity rh with a monitoring accuracy of 1 5 rh the thermistor temperature collectors were multi channel data collectors and the input signal included 32 channels with an accuracy of 0 2 s channel the seepage bottles were 250 ml graduated cylinders with an accuracy of 2 ml the soil columns were 110 cm high and had an inner diameter of 15 cm they were constructed of a plexiglas tube with a thickness of 5 mm and the exterior of the columns was insulated with a 2 5 cm thick insulation layer to prevent heat exchange with the external environment the constant headwater supply system was based on the principle of a constant headwater supply of a mariotte bottle consisting of mariotte bottles with a height of 90 cm and a diameter of 8 cm and balance bottles with a height of 40 cm and a diameter of 16 cm 2 2 laboratory methods soil samples were collected from the taigu water balance experimental field of the hydrology and water resources survey station in shanxi province the samples were screened using standard laboratory sieves after air drying grinding and removing roots and other debris the soil columns were filled with five types of soil samples with different particle sizes and gradations to achieve a designed density of 1 3 1 5 g cm3 the soil columns with different particle sizes were labeled as a1 d50 0 3 mm soil particle size of 0 1 0 5 mm b1 d50 0 75 mm soil particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm c1 d50 1 25 mm soil particle size of 1 0 1 5 mm d1 d50 1 75 mm soil particle size of 1 5 2 0 mm and e1 d50 2 25 mm soil particle size of 2 0 2 5 mm according to the usda classification system the soils belong to sand the main physical parameters of the soil columns are presented in table 1 the five soil columns with different particle gradations were recorded as a2 b2 c2 d2 and e2 the main physical parameters are presented in table 2 and the soil particle gradation curves are shown in fig 2 the curvature coefficients of the five soil samples were 1 cc 3 and the particle gradation improved as the inhomogeneity coefficient increased that is the soil particle gradation gradually improved from a2 to e2 to prevent the fine soil particles in the soil column from blocking the water valve and pipeline when filling the soil columns a 10 cm thick inverted quartz sand layer was added to the bottom of the soil column and the inverted layer was separated from the soil sample by a double layer of fine mesh the thermistors were buried at depths of 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 cm in the soil columns to monitor the soil temperature every 2 h the filled soil columns were continuous and uniform and were connected to a constant headwater supply system the groundwater table depth was set to 1 0 m and the soil columns were supplied with pure water for seven days using the constant headwater supply system to ensure that the soil moisture reached a stable state before the freezing thawing experiments were conducted during the freezing process the upward migration amount of phreatic water to soil water uma was observed using the mariotte bottle and the downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water dma was monitored using the seepage bottle during the thawing process every 2 h finally both were converted to the height of water per unit of soil column cross sectional area the transformation relationships are as follows 1 q ei l i 1 l i c e 2 q rei w i 1 w i c r where qei is the upward migration amount of phreatic water to soil water on day i mm l i and l i 1 are the heights of the water level of the mariotte bottle at 8 00 am on day i and day i 1 mm respectively ce is the transformative factor between the falling height of the mariotte bottle and the rising height of the water in the soil column ce 3 52 qrei is the downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water on day i mm w i and w i 1 are the amounts of water in the infiltration bottle at 8 00 a m on day i and day i 1 ml respectively and cr is the transformative factor between the water volume in the infiltration bottle and the falling height of the water in the soil column cr 17 60 the freezing thawing laboratory tests were conducted for 75 d the freezing process was carried out at three constant freezing temperatures of 10 20 and 25 c which were adjusted when the soil temperature profile reached a stable state and the freezing process lasted for 62 d at a constant freezing air temperature of 10 c soil temperature profile of the soil column reached a steady state and the daily uma decreased on the 26th day of freezing at this time the freezing air temperature was adjusted to 20 c and the freezing was continued at a constant temperature a new steady state was achieved at 54 d and the freezing temperature was further reduced to 25 c a new steady state was achieved again at 62 d and the freezing was stopped after this the soil columns were allowed to thaw in the natural laboratory environment and the thawing process was completed when the daily dma approximately reached 0 on the 75th day the temperature and humidity were monitored every 5 min during the freezing thawing process 3 results 3 1 freezing thawing temperature and relative humidity during the freezing process the variations in the daily average temperature and daily average relative humidity were the same exhibiting fluctuating step like changes fig 3 from day 3 to day 26 of the freezing stage the average daily freezing temperature fluctuated around 10 c and the average daily relative humidity was approximately 82 from day 30 to day 54 during the freezing stage the average daily freezing temperature was approximately 20 c and the average daily relative humidity was approximately 73 from day 55 to day 62 during the freezing stage the daily average freezing temperature was approximately 25 c and the average daily relative humidity was approximately 67 after this the freezing stage was stopped and the thawing stage began the daily increase in the temperature was greater than 3 c from day 0 to day 6 during the thawing stage this was the rapid warming stage and the average daily increase in relative humidity was greater than 4 the daily increase in the temperature was less than 1 c from day 7 to day 13 during the thawing stage this was the stable fluctuation stage and the average daily increase in relative humidity was less than 1 3 2 effect of the soil particle size on the soil temperature profile 1 freezing stage the air temperature had a significant effect on the soil temperature profile the soil temperature at different depths decreased as the air temperature decreased the change in soil temperature profile significantly lagged behind the change in the air temperature because the heat capacity of the soil was significantly higher than that of the air and the lag time increased as the soil depth increased the soil temperature profiles of five different particle size columns during the freezing stage are shown in fig 4 during the freezing process the soil temperature profile decreased with increasing soil depth and the soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm was 16 55 17 41 c lower than that at a depth of 30 cm on day 62 the soil temperature at the same depth decreased more rapidly and was lower during freezing stabilization as the soil particle size increased when the freezing temperature was the same at the end of the freezing stage day 62 the smallest temperature drop of 17 70 34 22 c was observed in a1 and the largest drop of 22 05 39 42 c was observed in e1 since the thermal conductivity of the soil increased with increasing soil particle size the average soil temperature gradient in the 5 30 cm depth interval gradually became larger as the soil particle size increased when the soil temperature was stable under constant temperature freezing at 25 c the average soil temperature gradient of a1 was the smallest 0 66 c cm and that of e1 was the largest 0 70 c cm 2 thawing stage the soil temperature profiles of five different particle size columns during the thawing stage are shown in fig 5 according to the daily increase in the soil temperature profile t the temperature change can be divided into three stages a rapid warming stage t greater than 2 5 c a slow warming stage 0 3 t 2 5 c and a stable change stage t less than 0 3 c during 0 3 d of thawing the temperature variation was very small the curve of the soil temperature was approximately a straight horizontal line and the soil thawing rate increased with increasing soil particle size the daily increase in the soil temperature in a1 was 0 03 0 21 c and it entered the rapid warming stage at 5 6 d however the daily increase in the soil temperature in e1 was 0 12 0 21 c and it entered the rapid warming stage at 4 5 d the soil warming in e1 increased by 33 91 45 68 compared with that in a1 during days 5 9 of the thawing stage the soil temperature gradient decreased as the air temperature continuously increased during days 9 10 of the thawing stage which led to the soil temperature change entering the slow warming stage soil columns d1 and e1 gradually reached the stable change state at 11 12 d while soil columns a1 b1 and c1 reached this stage 1 2 d later at the end of the thawing stage the soil warming in e1 was the largest 22 57 40 07 c and that of a1 was the smallest i e 14 90 22 11 lower than that of e1 3 3 effect of the soil gradation on the soil temperature profile 1 freezing stage the soil temperature profiles of five different gradation columns during the freezing stage are shown in fig 6 the soil temperature profile changes can be divided into three stages a rapid cooling stage t greater than 2 5 c a slow cooling stage 0 3 t 2 5 c and a stable change stage t less than 0 3 c during the constant temperature freezing process at 10 c the soil freezing rate decreased as the gradation became poorer soil column a2 entered the slow cooling stage at 3 4 d of the freezing stage and it entered the stable change stage at 8 10 d e2 entered these stages 1 2 d earlier than a2 when the constant temperature freezing at 10 c was stable day 26 of the freezing stage the soil temperature profile decreased as the inhomogeneity coefficient increased the soil temperature profile of e2 was 7 83 3 5 c which was 2 46 3 88 c lower than that of a2 during the freezing process at constant temperatures of 20 c and 25 c the temperature variation trends were similar to that for constant temperature freezing at 10 c that is the soil temperature of soil column e2 decreased the fastest however during constant temperature freezing at 25 c the drop in the soil temperature profile under the influence of the temperature gradient was significantly smaller than the previous two drops in temperature due to the smaller decrease in the freezing temperature the soil temperature profile was significantly influenced by the soil particle gradation and the soil temperature profile decreased more quickly when the particle gradation was better resulting in a larger soil temperature profile gradient and further leading to a lower soil temperature when the freezing was stable at the end of the freezing stage day 62 the soil temperature profile of a2 was the highest 11 46 c to 0 79 c and that of e2 was the lowest 17 69 c to 2 9 c the temperature drop of e2 was 17 92 25 82 greater than that of a2 the average soil temperature gradient in the depth range of 5 30 cm in e2 was 0 59 c cm which was 0 1 c cm higher than that in a2 in addition there was a lag in the temperature change in the vertical direction and the drop in the soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm was 69 28 73 89 greater than that at a depth of 30 cm after freezing stability was attained 2 thawing stage the soil temperature profiles of five different gradation columns during the thawing stage are shown in fig 7 the rate of soil thawing increased as the soil gradation became better the average daily increase in the soil temperature in soil column a2 which had the worst gradation was 1 33 2 27 c d which was 0 32 0 52 c d lower than that in e2 soil column which had the best gradation the warming amplitude decreased with increasing soil depth the average daily increase in the soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm was 2 27 2 79 c d which was 69 15 72 87 higher than that at a depth of 30 cm 3 4 effect of the soil particle size on the phreatic transformation 1 upward migration of phreatic water to soil water the soil moisture and heat were redistributed during the freezing period the shallow phreatic water and deeper soil moisture continuously migrated upwards and the cumulative and daily uma decreased with increasing soil particle size fig 8 at the beginning of the freezing stage 0 5 d the daily umas of the soil columns with different particle sizes ranged from 0 08 mm d 1 to 0 33 mm d 1 and the cumulative uma was small subsequently the daily uma increased continuously under the effect of the soil water potential gradient the daily uma decreased on day 26 when the soil temperatures were stable the cumulative uma in a1 increased by 190 02 compared to e1 when the freezing temperature dropped to 20 c the soil temperature decreased rapidly with decreasing freezing temperature the liquid water phase at the freezing front turned into ice and the soil water potential gradient increased resulting in a rapid increase in the daily uma which reached a maximum of 0 74 1 99 mm d 1 during days 32 35 of the freezing stage then the daily uma began to decrease and the cumulative uma increased by 15 98 42 64 mm compared with that before cooling on day 54 when the freezing temperature dropped to 25 c the decrease in the soil temperature profile was smaller and the increase in cumulative uma decreased significantly compared with the previous two cooling stages at the end of the freezing stage the daily uma was 0 05 0 10 mm d 1 and the migration process was essentially completed the cumulative uma in a1 increased by 160 10 compared with that in e1 the fitting and regression analysis of the cumulative uma and the average soil particle size during the freezing process revealed that the cumulative uma and the average soil particle size were well fitted by the following exponential function 3 qe a e bd where qe is the cumulative uma mm d is the average soil particle size mm and a and b are regression coefficients related to the soil particle size the fitting curves of the cumulative uma and the average soil particle size at the end of the constant temperature freezing stages at 10 20 and 25 c are shown in fig 9 and the results of the regression analysis are presented in table 3 the correlation coefficients r2 of the fitting equations are all greater than 0 99 indicating that the variation in the cumulative uma with the soil average particle size during the freezing process can be well characterized by the above equations at a given significance level of α 0 05 f0 05 p n p 1 f0 05 1 3 10 13 indicating that the regression equations are strongly significant with f f0 05 p n p 1 it can be seen that the cumulative uma decreases exponentially with increasing particle size the regression coefficient a increases gradually and the absolute value of b decreases gradually with decreasing freezing air temperature this indicates that as the freezing temperature decreases the degree of the soil water phase change increases most of the soil pores are filled with ice and the cumulative uma increases continuously but the influence of the soil particle size on the uma weakens 2 downward movement of soil water to phreatic water the soil particle size determines the hydraulic conductivity and water holding characteristics of the soil which affect the downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water during the thawing process the cumulative and daily dma of the soil columns with five different particle sizes during the thawing stage are shown in fig 10 there were significant differences in the variation trends of the cumulative and daily dma of the soil columns with different particle sizes during the different thawing stages the daily dma increased with increasing particle size on days 0 5 of the thawing stage that of a1 was 2 32 mm d 1 on day 5 and that of e1 was 87 10 higher than that of a1 the cumulative dma of the soil columns with smaller particle sizes increased rapidly on days 6 9 of the thawing stage with the highest daily dma of 12 06 mm d 1 occurring in a1 on day 9 that of e1 was 84 41 lower than that of a1 the daily dmas of d1 and e1 were only 0 57 and 0 6 mm d 1 on day 12 while those of a1 b1 and c1 which had smaller particle sizes reached 0 26 0 72 mm d 1 on day 13 that is the dma stabilized earlier in the columns with larger soil particle sizes the cumulative dma during the thawing process decreased with increasing soil particle size it was 44 60 mm in soil column a1 which was 149 16 higher than that in e1 3 5 effect of the soil gradation on the phreatic transformation 1 upward migration of phreatic water to soil water the soil water potential gradient determines the rate and direction of the water migration during the freezing period while the soil gradation influences the degrees of variation in the soil temperature and liquid water content the variation trends of the cumulative uma for the soil columns with different gradations were the same fig 11 a that is the cumulative uma gradually increased with increasing freezing time and finally became stable when the freezing at a constant air temperature of 10 c was stable day 26 of the freezing stage the cumulative uma in e2 was 14 82 mm which was 9 71 mm higher than that in a2 which had the worst gradation during constant air temperature freezing at 20 c 27 54 d the soil temperature gradient increased as the freezing air temperature significantly decreased which intensified the uma and the maximum daily uma was 0 67 2 05 mm d 1 fig 11 b the daily uma was smaller during the freezing at a constant air temperature of 25 c and the uma in a2 e2 was only 1 4 2 02 mm when the freezing was stable day 62 of the freezing stage the cumulative uma increased as the soil particle gradation improved and it was 20 03 mm in a2 which was 63 02 lower than that in e2 2 downward movement of soil water to phreatic water the daily dma of the soil columns with different particle gradations initially increased and then decreased but the relative magnitudes varied significantly with the thawing time the cumulative and daily dmas of a2 e2 are shown in fig 12 the daily dma of the soil column with better particle gradation was smaller during days 0 5 of the thawing stage and the daily dma in e2 on day 5 was 57 43 lower than that in a2 the daily dma of the better graded soil columns increased continuously from day 6 to day 10 of the thawing stage with the maximum daily dma of 10 31 mm d 1 occurring in e2 on day 10 the daily dma decreased during 11 13 d and the cumulative dma gradually reached a stable state the cumulative dma was higher for better soil gradations during the thawing process and it increased from 20 91 to 142 58 in b2 e2 compared to that in a2 3 6 difference between uma and dma the extent of the transformation between phreatic water and soil water can be symbolized by the difference between the uma and dma during the freezing thawing process 4 qd qe qre where qd is the difference between uma and dma mm qe is the upward migration of phreatic water to soil water uma mm and qre is the downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water dma mm qd is strongly correlated with the average soil particle size and the inhomogeneity coefficient as follows 5 qd c e dd 6 qd e e fcu where d is the average soil particle size mm cu is the inhomogeneity coefficient and c d e and f are regression coefficients the correlation coefficients r2 of the fitting equations are all greater than 0 93 and the fitting curves are shown in fig 13 the qd values for the different particle sizes and gradations are positive indicating that the uma is always greater than the dma that is the groundwater upward migrated to the soil water during the freezing thawing period and there was severe consumption of groundwater in the soil groundwater system in addition this may cause soil salinization and other ecological problems qd decreased with increasing soil particle size indicating that the inefficient loss of groundwater decreased as the soil particle size increased while qd increased as the inhomogeneity coefficient increased for 1 cc 3 indicating that the groundwater consumption was greater when the soil gradation was better during the freezing thawing period 4 discussion 4 1 effects of the soil particle size and gradation on the soil temperature profile the change in the soil temperature profile during the freezing thawing period can be influenced by differences in the soil texture fraction of vegetation cover initial soil water content soil thermal capacity and other biophysical factors numerous studies have shown that the thermal conductivity and soil temperature gradient can vary significantly with soil texture chen 2008 zhang et al 2016 affecting the redistribution of the soil moisture and heat during the freezing thawing period and further influencing the pattern of the change in the soil temperature the soil temperature gradient is an important force affecting the redistribution of heat and is also the major factor influencing the soil temperature as the soil particle size increased or the particle gradation became better the porosity decreased and the thermal conductivity increased zhang et al 2015 the soil temperature gradient in the profile increased under the same external temperature change conditions resulting in a larger change in and earlier stabilization of the soil temperature at the same depth therefore the freezing depths of coarse grained soils and soils with an uneven particle distribution are larger in winter chen et al 2019 which has an impact on the annual average temperature surface temperature air thawing index surface thawing index and vegetation growth peng et al 2017 in addition the pattern of the soil temperature variation affected by the external temperature was quite different in the vertical direction during the freezing process the soil temperature at the surface of the soil column in contact with the air was lower than the temperature of the deeper soil and the heat in the deeper part of the soil column was transported upward via convection and thermal conduction under the effect of the temperature gradient the soil thawed in both directions during the thawing process wu et al 2016 but the deeper soil was more slowly affected by the external temperature and thus the temperature gradient of the surface soil was much larger than that of the deeper soil as a result there was an obvious lag in the temperature recovery with increasing soil depth 4 2 transformation between phreatic water and soil water 1 upward migration of phreatic water to soil water the effect of freezing on upward migration of phreatic water to soil water caused the redistribution of the soil water that is the temperature of the upper soil decreases and part of the liquid water in the soil turns to ice during the freezing process causing the shallow phreatic water to migrate upwards driven by the soil water potential gradient hou et al 2019 the soil particle size and gradation are strongly correlated with the uma as the particle size increased and the particle gradation became better the temperature gradient of the soil profile increased during the freezing process and the average soil temperature gradient difference between a1 and e1 was only 0 04 c cm so the temperature gradient of the soil profile was not the main factor influencing the uma the phreatic water migrates into the unsaturated zone through the capillaries the uma is controlled by both the rising height and the frozen depth the maximum rising height is closely related to the soil texture kowalik 2006 li et al 2014 that is soil with a smaller particle size has a larger rising height of capillary water and a stronger water holding capacity as liquid water turns into ice partly in freezing period the freezing front driving liquid water upward migrating in lower unfrozen zone is like the dry soil surface in non freezing season thus when the distance between freezing front and phreatic water table is less than the rising height of capillary of soil the phreatic water can reach the freezing front resulting more sufficient upward migration of phreatic water to soil in our laboratory tests the maximum capillary heights of a1 e1 decrease from 86 7 cm to 34 9 cm demanding their frozen depths larger than 13 3 cm to 65 1 cm to drive sufficient phreatic water upward moving based on the variations of 0 c isothermals in soil profile fig 4 the frozen depth of a1 in the freezing stage at 10 c was about 15 cm while that of e1 was less than 25 cm thus the cumulative uma of a1 with minimum particle size was the largest of all homogeneous soil columns particle gradation refers to the proportions of particles of various sizes to the total amount the average soil particle size of five soil columns with different particle gradations have little difference and the value of 1 05 to 1 07 mm but the inhomogeneity coefficient varied from 3 47 to 19 08 the soil is well graded soil when the inhomogeneity coefficient is greater than 5 the larger pores of better particle gradation are filled with soil particles that decreasing the size of the pores and increasing the capillary effect similar with the effect of particle size the upward migration amount of phreatic water to soil water increased with better particle gradation 2 downward movement of soil water to phreatic water in the thawing stage the soil liquid water in the depth of the frozen layer increase rapidly and the soil was in the low suction stage the soil gravity water was lost from the macropores and the dehydration process was rapid for the larger particle size and poor graded soil hua et al 2021 the downward movement amount of soil water to phreatic water for the different soil particle sizes and gradations varied greatly with the thawing time the pore diameter and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil increase as the soil particle size increases and the particle gradation becomes poorer wesseling et al 2009 in contrast in soils with a smaller particle size or better gradation the specific surface area of the soil particles is larger and the specific yield is smaller tan et al 2006 and the soil has a stronger water holding capacity and weaker water release capacity in the initial thawing stage as the soil particle size increased or the particle gradation became poorer the profile temperature increased faster which were conducive to rapid migration of the thawed soil water from the frozen layer into the phreatic water thus the dma increased as the inhomogeneity coefficient decreased and the soil particle size increased during days 0 5 of the thawing stage however the cumulative uma increased as the soil particle size decreased and the particle gradation became better during the freezing period so the liquid water content of the unsaturated zone increased with the increasing air temperature and the soil water continued to migrate downwards under the effect of the gravitational potential gradient and the matrix potential gradient this resulted in a greater daily dma in the later stages of the thawing process for a smaller soil particle size and better particle gradation the downward movement of soil water to phreatic water was less than the upward migration of phreatic water to soil water that is the groundwater was in a negative equilibrium state during the freezing thawing process leading to water enrichment in the soil layer musa et al 2016 the soil with larger particle size and poorer particle gradation had smaller uma and larger specific yield so the difference between uma and dma was smaller than that of smaller particle size and better particle gradation the soil column with the smallest particle size had the greatest water enrichment this is beneficial to vegetation restoration in sandy habitats and to increasing the soil water content of agricultural fields in spring the phreatic water loss was smallest for the column with the poorest soil gradation which had the positive effect of reducing soil salinization 5 conclusions the soil temperature varied more and stabilized earlier in the columns with larger soil particle sizes and a better particle gradation and the variation in the soil temperature decreased with increasing depth during the freezing thawing process the cumulative and daily uma decreased with increasing soil particle size and decreasing inhomogeneity coefficient the maximum cumulative uma in a1 was 160 10 higher than that in e1 and that in e2 was 170 44 higher than that in a2 the relationship between the cumulative uma and the average soil particle size was well fitted by an exponential function and the cumulative uma increased as the freezing air temperature decreased but the effect of the soil particle size on the uma was weakened the daily dma decreased as the soil particle size decreased and the particle gradation became better during days 0 5 of the thawing stage while the cumulative dma decreased with increasing soil particle size and decreasing inhomogeneity coefficient after 9 10 d during the thawing stage during the thawing stage the cumulative dma in a1 was 149 16 higher than that in e1 and that in e2 was 142 58 higher than that in a2 the difference between the uma and dma decreased with increasing soil particle size and the phreatic consumption was greater for better soil gradations during the freezing thawing process the results of this study improve our understanding of the transformation between soil water and phreatic water during the freezing thawing period and have important

2132,except assimilated data of soil moisture sm there is always a circumstance that not every spatial point has valid value over a specific region in a day and there are invalid values or gaps between days in a time series at a spatial point especially the satellite and ground based data thus those data are not spatiotemporally seamless on daily time scale and the seamless data of surface sm is fundamental for research on the land atmosphere interactions on various time scales deep learning methods of multi perceptron mlp and convolution conv neural networks are applied for obtaining spatiotemporally seamless sm over eastern china during may september of 2015 2020 to combine the advantages of ground based and remote sensed data firstly taking atmospheric and land variables as inputs mlp is trained against the satellite products including the level 2 product of chinese fengyun 3c fy3c level 3 product of the us soil moisture active passive smap and level 2 neural network product of the european soil moisture and ocean salinity smos after that spatiotemporally seamless sm is predicted by mlp which is stable during training and validation compared with the in situ sm mlp sm inherits the characteristics of the satellite products though the quality is slightly improved secondly conv uses the mlp sm as inputs and is trained against in situ sm the unbiased errors are reduced notably that unbiased correlation increases and root mean square errors decreases at last from the pattern correlation between precipitation and sm anomalies the error reduced conv sm can well reflect the relationships forced out by the major patterns of rainfall but the satellite products cannot in addition during the evaluation smap has the best quality over eastern china and smos is generally better than fy3c however after processed by conv the differences of the quality among different satellites are negligible except some differences in the mean patterns of conv sm which is mainly associated with the properties of the satellite products keywords deep learning surface soil moisture remote sensing eastern china spatiotemporally continuity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil moisture sm is an essential variable in land atmosphere interaction that sm can significantly response and feedback to weather and climate seneviratne et al 2010 climate prediction and research need sm with various time intervals and spatial continuity which is usually observed through field observation or remote sensing dorigo et al 2011 2021 so far the ground based networks for sm observation are sparse and established over limited regions and some of the observations are temporally discontinuous chen et al 2021 thus the ground based sm cannot accomplish requirement of the spatiotemporal continuity for real time application polar orbit remote sensing of sm can cover the entire globe and the most of the sm data are temporally continuous above weekly time scale but is discontinuous below weekly because it is generally conducted by polar orbit satellites petropoulos et al 2015 xian et al 2021 furthermore the satellite sm is not as accurate as ground based sm and some even has large errors both the two types of sm data have disadvantages and it is better to combine their advantages to achieve spatiotemporal continuity and reduce errors sm data is achieved through various techniques including ground based observation remote sensing and physical model assimilation the ground based sm can be obtained through weighting the soil sample before and after drying gravimetric method taking advantage of the electromagnetic property of soil e g time domain reflectometry tdr and frequency domain reflectometry fdr francesca et al 2010 salam et al 2019 measuring neutrons emitting from radioactive source or the soil neutron probe or cosmic ray vachaud et al 1977 iwema et al 2021 and ground penetrating radar liu et al 2016 among those ground based techniques fdr has the lowest cost dorigo et al 2011 although the ground based techniques provide the most reliable values it is still a challenge to build dense networks for high frequency real time sm observations over large scale areas chen et al 2021 dorigo et al 2021 satellite remote sensing is an optional technique for monitoring sm dynamically and quasi globally several satellite missions with microwave devices have been launched during the last two decades for example the sentinel missions and the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos of the european space agency esa kerr et al 2010 hornacek et al 2012 the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 imaoka et al 2012 the microwave radiation imager mwri carried by the chinese fengyun 3b c satellites fy3b fy3c yang et al 2012 zheng et al 2020 and the soil moisture active passive smap of the us national aeronautics and space administration nasa entekhabi et al 2010 chan et al 2018 though the accuracy of satellite sm products is improving errors are inevitable and the products are not as accurate as the ground based observations ma et al 2019 moreover most of the polar orbit satellites cannot provide spatially seamless data on daily frequency in order to obtain spatiotemporally continuous sm data satellite and ground based observations can be assimilated into the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 the global reanalysis systems also provide assimilated sm products including the us national centers for environmental prediction department of energy reanalysis ii ncep doe kanamitsu et al 2002 the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis saha et al 2014 the era interim and era5 reanalyses of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts dee et al 2011 hans et al 2020 however the sm products of land model generally have poor performance on small spatial scales and there is still large space for improvement of those products dirmeyer et al 2016 besides the assimilation deep learning dl is a modern approach developed rapidly that can produce spatiotemporally continuous sm yuan et al 2020 the major difference between the two approaches is that the assimilation and dl are dynamic and data driven respectively reichstein et al 2019 comparing to the assimilation dl is more economical in terms of computation consumptions and performances better than traditionally statistical and physical models reichstein et al 2019 lee et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 according to the physical balance of land water spatiotemporal variations of sm are affected by various factors including precipitation radiation temperature humidity wind speed land cover soil properties etc kato et al 2006 qian et al 2006 katul et al 2007 mccoll et al 2017 for the data driven approach those data can be applied as input features for dl models as well as various sm products from satellite and assimilation systems fang et al 2017 lee et al 2019 the ground based sm is usually used as the learning target for dl training and validation for example the smap level 3 sm product with the horizontal resolution of about 36 km was downscaled by dl to the seamless fine resolution data over the us xu et al 2022 liu et al 2022 neural networks of the long short term memory lstm convolutional conv neural networks and lstm conv combined networks are applied to obtain either spatially or temporally continuous data over the us and asia zhang et al 2017 klingmüller and lelieveld 2021 li et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 all those studies show that dl is a powerful tool to produce spatiotemporally seamless sm and reduce errors spatiotemporal seamless sm data is important for the society and economy over eastern china so far previous studies either trained the dl against reanalysis li et al 2021 which is not as accurate as ground based observations or used the satellite products of visible infrared imaging radiometer as input features zhang et al 2017 which has larger errors than the microwave remote sensing in the present study two steps are conducted to achieve spatiotemporal continuity and reduce errors for sm products of the satellites with microwave devices over eastern china in boreal summer firstly a multi perceptron neural network is used to learn sm of fy3c smos and smap from atmospheric variables to achieve spatiotemporally seamless products of sm after that the seamless sm is used to train a conv network against ground based observations to reduce errors and produce daily sm products using the dl models to combined microwave sensing of sm and filed observed data the present study is going to solve the following questions 1 can the gaps outside of the microwave satellite scanning be filled with valid values 2 dose the filled data consistent with the satellite products 3 can the conv model reduce the errors of satellite products 4 as the error compose of bias and unbiased error do them all reduced by the dl models 2 data and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 ground based sm the hourly in situ water content in g cm 3 of surface soil is collected by fdr method by the stations in the jiangxi jiangsu and zhejiang provinces over eastern china table 1 those stations are automatic stations which are used for agriculture drought monitor and sm research the fdr uses eight sensors buried underground that send and receive 100 mhz electromagnetic pulse to detect soil water content at 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 70 80 and 90 100 cm the hourly sm at 43 stations was generally observed consistently with a few outliers and missing values during the research periods time intervals of the missing data are less than 24 h at each station the hourly data was averaged in 24 h to obtain the continuous daily sm for analysis and the value was changed from g cm 3 into m3 m 3 using the water density of 103 kg m 3 more details of the station data are presented in table a1 in the appendix besides the above mentioned sm data at the 43 in situ stations the hourly sm data in m3 m 3 at the depth of 0 10 cm from the international soil moisture network ismn stations is also used in the present study table 1 there are 65 stations with good flag for sm over the region of 100 140 e and 20 50 n during 2015 2020 see table a2 in the appendix for details the hourly data is averaged into daily interval there are 29 stations over south korea to the east of 125 e 34 stations are around the boundary between nei mongol and hebei provinces over northern china to the north of 40 n and two stations locate in hubei province inside of the region of 105 125 e and 20 40 n except for the two stations in hubei province all the stations are outside of the training area of the dl models none of the 65 stations is among the 43 stations that are used for the training of the conv model thus the different data source of ismn that is independent of the 43 in situ stations can be used for further validation of the dl models the dl models will be introduced in the following subsections 2 1 2 satellite sm products launched on november 2nd 2009 smos is the second earth explorer opportunity mission and the first mission of esa providing global measurements of l band brightness temperature for sm deriving mecklenburg et al 2016 a 2d radiometer was designed for monitoring near surface sm at 0 5 cm globally the smos l2 neural network data new smos level 2 near real time neural network soil moisture version 700 is obtained through scanning in the ascending and descending orbits table 1 the sm is retrieved from l band brightness temperature of 1 4 ghz based on the statistical coefficients estimated by a neural network this product of 2015 2020 is provided only at the satellite track about 30 tracks in a day in this study the 2d gridded binned average was applied to obtain daily sm with the horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 for sm of the descending and ascending orbits separately for example while the data are non missing values in a day and fell into a 0 25 0 25 grid cell in an orbit they are bin averaged to represent the value at that grid cell for that day the rest of the cells are filled with missing values the unit of smos sm is m3 m 3 chinese fy3c was launched on september 23rd 2013 and is the second generation polar orbiting meteorological satellite the mwri on the satellite has a microwave band of 10 65 ghz x band for the near surface sm monitor and a shallow sensing depth about 2 cm than the l band about 5 cm fy3c sm is retrieved through the radiative transfer based model using the brightness temperature in the descending and ascending orbits for bare surface the parameterized surface emissivity model qp inversion model is used to retrieve sm shi et al 2005 for the surface covered with vegetation the empirical relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index and the vegetation water content is used to obtain sm liu et al 2013 the daily fy3c level 2 products use the equal area scalable earth grid ease grid 1 0 projection with the horizontal resolution of about 25 km and unit of m3 m 3 table 1 during the retrieving the sm values 0 5 are artificially assigned to 0 5 which to a certain extent depresses sm variability and causes very large errors thus we assigned the sm values 0 5 as missing values for the fy3c product in the present study the smap mission was launched in january 2015 and started operation in april 2015 two instruments are carried by smap but the radar stopped functioning on july 7th 2015 and only the l band radiometer of 1 41 ghz is measuring sm after then reichle et al 2021 the sm data used in this study is the level 3 product smap l3 radiometer global daily 36 km ease grid soil moisture which is surface 0 5 cm sm at daily time interval on about 36 36 km horizontal grids for the descending and ascending orbits table 1 it is noted that the grids of smap product is ease grid 2 0 the data used in this study is the sm during may september of 2015 2020 generally we have the satellite sm products with daily time interval in descending and ascending orbits of fy3c smos and smap for analysis during the comparison with the in situ sm the sm values of each satellite product are averaged over the nearest four grid cells around a station to obtain time series of satellite products against the ground based observations 2 1 3 atmospheric and static land variables in this study the precipitation data used is the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph products of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration using the cmorph technique precipitation is obtained through combining precipitation estimates of several low orbiter satellites joyce et al 2004 other hourly atmospheric variables are obtained from the era5 reanalysis hans et al 2020 which is averaged into daily for analysis see table 1 for more details for each of the satellite products with different horizontal resolutions the atmospheric variables were re gridded into the resolution of the satellite product through linear interpolation besides the atmospheric variables static land variables including soil properties and land cover lc types are also used the percentages of clay silt sand and gravel of topsoil 0 30 cm are achieved from the harmonized world soil database version 1 2 hwsd which provides the soil information worldwide hwsd is the results of a collaboration of the un food and agriculture organization fao with the international institute for applied system analysis the isric world soil information the institute of soil science the chinese academy of sciences and the joint research centre of the european commission for different horizontal resolutions of the satellite products the static land variables were re gridded into the resolution of each satellite product through linear interpolation to obtain the atmospheric variables and soil properties e g percentages of clay silt sand and gravel at an in situ station the values of a variable were also averaged over the nearest four grid cells around the station it is noted that the grid cells have the resolution of 0 25 0 25 for the atmospheric variables and 1 1 km for the soil properties the 300 m resolution lc level 4 product of 2018 is provided by the copernicus climate change service c3s this product is consistent with the lc maps during 1992 2015 produced by the esa cci the data of lc classification with 38 values is defined by the fao s land cover classification system in the present study the percentage of each lc types was counted in a 0 25 0 25 grid cell with the center of an in situ station for each satellite products the percentages were counted in the grid cells of the product 2 2 methods a flow chart is presented in fig 1 to illustrate the major methods used in this study the atmospheric and static variables are used as input features to train a multi perceptron neural network mlp against satellite sm products to obtain spatiotemporally continuous data after that the data is used with atmospheric and static variables to train a conv model against station sm to reduce errors results of the mlp and conv model are validated by unbiased correlation r and root mean square error rmse empirical orthogonal functions eof and singular value decomposition svd are further used to explore the similarity of the sm anomalous patterns with that of the rainfall 2 2 1 mlp for spatiotemporal continuity in order to obtain spatiotemporally continuous sm for the satellite products mlp fig 2 is applied at every grid cell for the sm product in each orbit of a satellite over eastern china the mlp model is designed to predict sm at a grid cell at a time and if the input features at a grid cell is provided the corresponding sm value can be predicted at this grid cell in fig 2 the first layer input layer of the mlp model has 48 input features including precipitation t2 u10 v10 dlr dsr percentages of four soil types and 38 lc types after that the 48 features are passed to five hidden layers with 2000 1600 800 400 and 200 perceptrons respectively at last the output layer provides fitted sm the neighbor layers are connected with the activation of rectified linear unit relu function allowing for nonlinearity in order to save computation time we only conducted mlp for the grid cells over the region of 105 125 e and 20 40 n for each satellite product though the mlp model can be applied over the entire globe for the grid cells of each product over this region during may september of 2015 2020 90 of the total grid cells with valid sm values are randomly chosen as training targets fy3c smap and smos sm and the remaining 10 are used for validation for the grid cells without a valid value mlp uses the input features that are spatiotemporally continuous to predict the sm values over a larger region of 100 140 e and 20 60 n the mlp model with the same fitted coefficients obtained during training is used at every grid cell in an orbit of a satellite product at last sm with spatiotemporal continuity can be obtained for the products in the descending and ascending orbits of the three satellites in other words we obtain daily sm for may september of 2015 2020 using mlp for the entire region 2 2 2 conv network for reducing errors using mlp the spatiotemporally continuous sm is obtained but errors are succeeded from the satellite products since mlp sm is spatiotemporally continuous it is capable to apply more sophisticated dl to further reduce errors such as conv or lstm in the present study a dl model based on the 1d conv network is applied fig 3 in the conv model 20 input features are used the training and validation are against ground based observations of the 43 stations the first 12 input features are spatiotemporally continuous mlp sm in the descending and ascending orbits of a satellite precipitation t2 u10 v10 dlr dsr and percentages of clay silt sand and gravel the remaining eight input features are percentages of eight lc types that are the top eight lc types in the 0 25 0 25 grid cells around a station among the 43 ones including irrigated cropland 15 5 mosaic cropland 6 5 rainfed cropland 5 5 mosaic natural vegetation 3 7 evergreen needle leaved tree 3 6 urban 3 3 evergreen broad leaved tree 2 3 and water 1 4 the remaining 30 lc types do not commonly distribute around all the 43 stations which could be bad input features for the conv model that bring errors to the prediction for each input features there are 153 days during may september of each year fig 3 we use a 51 day sliding window going through the 153 days of each year to yield 103 samples in each year and thus the 51 days can be used for 1d convolution behind the input layer there are two conv layers with the sequence length of 51 and a kernel size of 3 but input channels of 20 and 40 and output channels of 40 and 80 respectively following the conv layers there are two multi perceptron layers with 80 and 40 perceptrons respectively at last the fitted sm against in situ observations are obtained for 51 days the neighbor layers are also connected by relu for nonlinearity after training the fitted coefficients are the same at every grid cell of a satellite so far we have the in situ sm from january 1st 2015 to august 27th 2017 for 11 stations and from january 1st 2015 to december 31st 2018 for the rest of 32 stations the last summer at each station is used for validation of the conv model and the remaining data is for training after that the sm during may september of 2015 2020 is predicted by the conv model at every grid cell of each satellite product of fy3c smos and smap although the conv model can be also applied over the entire globe as long as there are global input features the targets of the in situ sm mainly locates over eastern china and thus the fitted model could be better to apply over 100 140 e and 20 60 n 2 2 3 other methods for validation and evaluation the un biased correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse are used and the biases of a satellite product can be easily removed through subtracting the climatic data of in situ observations 1 s i j s i j s 1 n i 1 n s i j o i 1 n s i j s in eq 1 the bias at a station has been removed eq 1 si j is the bias removed sm of a satellite product s i j s is the satellite sm obtained through averaging the sm over the four nearest grid cells around a station s i j o is the sm at an in situ station i varies from 1 to n which is the sample size associated with time length j varies from 1 to 43 which is the number of in situ stations the correlation coefficient of the mean sm at each station between satellite and in situ sm is calculated by eq 2 and can generally represent the impact of the bias on the quality of a product small rm corresponds to large biases of a satellite product 2 r m j 1 43 i 1 n s i j o j 1 43 i 1 n s i j o i 1 n s i j s j 1 43 i 1 n s i j s j 1 43 i 1 n s i j o j 1 43 i 1 n s i j o 2 j 1 43 i 1 n s i j s j 1 43 i 1 n s i j s 2 in eqs 3 and 4 we used all the data to calculate r and rmse and i and j are omitted 3 r k 1 m s k o s o s k s k 1 m s k o s o 2 k 1 m s k s 2 4 rmse 1 m k 1 m s k s k o 2 in eq 3 k varies from 1 to m which is associated with the total sample size regardless of space or time so and s represent the in situ observed sm and bias removed satellite sm respectively because the bias has been removed in s of eqs 3 and 4 r and rmse are un biased in the following reduced error means increase of unbiased r and decrease of unbiased rmse and bias is associated with the difference of between the mean states of the model outputs and observations the major patterns of precipitation during may september of 2015 2020 are explored by the empirical orthogonal functions eof quadrelli et al 2005 a matrix of m x n m v l l z n with spatial grids of m and time length of n can be decomposed into spatial patterns m v l l eof patterns and time series l z n l principle components denoted as pcs with number of l in which each of the components or patterns is orthogonal with the others for the conciseness in the following we omit subscripts of some matrices e g z v t x the percentages of the variance explanation are calculated using the eigenvalues of xx t the eof pattern eof1 with the largest percentage of the variance explanation represents the most occurrence pattern among all the spatial distributions of the variable during the analysis period and the corresponding pc is its time variation in order to explore the major patterns of rainfall anomalies the time mean of the precipitation has been removed before eof and the first two eofs are analyzed the pattern relationships between precipitation and sm during may september of 2015 2020 are examined by the methods of the singular value decomposition svd bretherton et al 1992 in order to explore the relationship between two variables they are firstly normalized through removing their mean and then dividing by their standard deviations and the normalized variables are represented by the matrices of m1 x n and m2 y n with the time length of n and spatial grids of m1 and m2 respectively thus xy t is the correlation matrix the xy t uσv t can be decomposed into matrices of m1 u p p σ p and m2 v p in which σ is the singular values whose squares can be used to calculate the percentages of the covariance explanation and p is the number of svd modes u and v are very similar to patterns of eof but they represent the pattern pairs that x relates with y the pattern pair svd1 with the largest explanation of the total covariance represents the most common occurrence of the pattern relationship between the two variables the expansion coefficients or pcs of svds that correspond to u and v can be calculated by p t n u t x and p z n v t y respectively the correlation maps between x and z are usually called left heterogeneous maps and those between y and t are the right heterogeneous maps those pairs of the maps are used to presents the patterns that x related with y the correlation coefficients between t and z present the strength of the pattern correlation in the present study x is precipitation and y is sm the first two svds are used for analysis both eof and svd are conducted over the region of 105 125 e and 20 40 n 3 results 3 1 achieving spatiotemporally continuous sm mlp model can produce spatiotemporally continuous sm values that share the very similar spatial distribution compared with the satellite sm without mlp but the distributions are different among the satellite products fig a1 in the appendix further validation is carried out for mlp sm to check whether the satellite sm can be well reproduced by mlp fig 4 presents the scatter distribution of daily sm with y axis and without x axis mlp for training and validation during mlp 90 of the data that is randomly chosen is used for training and the remaining 10 is for validation or test during the training the correlation coefficients r between sm with and without mlp are 0 92 and 0 89 for the ascending fig 4a and descending fig 4c orbits of fy3c respectively and the corresponding rmses are 0 042 and 0 048 it is noted that sm with and without mlp shares the same mean and thus the r and rmse are unbiased in terms of the original satellite products in the validation r values are 0 89 and 0 88 and rmses are 0 049 and 0 050 for the ascending fig 4b and descending fig 4d orbits of fy3c respectively for smap the r values are generally around 0 89 and rmses are around 0 06 for both sm with and without mlp regardless of the ascending and descending orbits for smos the r values are around 0 7 and rmses are around 0 09 in fig 4 most of the scatters are around the dash lines on which r is equal to 1 and rmse is equal to 0 the scatters are more concentrate along the dash lines in fy3c and smap than those in smos and thus mlp performs the best in fy3c but the worst in smos and smap is in the middle the mlp model performs generally the same during training and validation which indicates the stable performance of the model from the validation it can be concluded that the mlp model can generally well reproduce the three satellite sm products over regions that the satellites cannot scan in fig 5 the sm with and without mlp is evaluated against sm at the 43 in situ stations through unbiased r and rmse eqs 3 and 4 the correlation coefficients rm eq 2 of the mean sm at each station between satellite and in situ sm are also presented and shown in the sub panels with red color the correlation of mean sm ranges from 0 07 to 0 26 which indicates large biases in the three satellite sm products after removing the biases at each station from the satellite products the scatters are generally along the dash lines the main panels in fig 5 in fy3c for the sm without mlp r and rmse are 0 55 0 58 and 0 075 0 077 fig 5a and c respectively for that with mlp r and rmse are 0 63 0 67 and 0 064 0 067 respectively the differences between descending and ascending orbits are negligible in terms of the total statistics the quality of mlp sm is better than that without mlp and mlp improves correlation and reduces errors for smap and smos the similar results can be found that mlp improves sm quality among the three products smap fig 5e h has the largest correlation with the in situ sm which ranges from 0 76 to 0 80 and the smallest rmse which ranges from 0 050 to 0 062 for smos fig 5i l r ranges from 0 61 to 0 78 and rmse ranges from 0 054 to 0 099 the quality of smos sm without mlp fig 5i and k is better than that of fy3c fig 5a and c in terms of r but worse in terms of rmse after mlp fig 5j and l the quality of smos is better than that of the fy3c fig 5b and d therefore besides filled the grid cells with invalid values mlp can also improve the data quality to further validate the mlp model the ismn data that is outside of the training area 105 125 e and 20 40 n of the mlp model the results are presented in fig 6 which shows very similar results as those found in fig 5 it is also found that satellite sm without mlp has higher unbiased r and lower rmse than that with mlp 3 2 reducing errors by conv to further improve the quality of satellite sm products a more sophisticated dl of conv network subsection 2 2 2 than that of mlp is applied based on the mlp sm data mlp sm of both ascending and descending orbits and atmospheric and static land variables are used to train the conv model against the in situ sm the unbiased r and rmse during training and validation are presented in fig 7 as well as the prediction on the grid cells during the training fig 7a d and g and validation fig 7b e and h the input data for the conv model are obtained through averaging around the 43 stations using the nearest four grid cells thus the same data structure as those of the in situ sm is obtained for the conv model after then the trained conv model is used to predict sm at every grid cell over 100 140 e and 20 60 n the predicted grid sm is averaged using the nearest four grid cells to compare with the in situ sm again fig 7c f and i in all the panels of fig 7 unbiased r ranges from 0 87 to 0 91 and unbiased rmse ranges from 0 033 to 0 39 the differences of r and rmse among different satellites and among training validation and prediction are negligible which indicates that the conv model is stable moreover the quality of sm in the conv model fig 7c f and i is largely improved compared with mlp sm fig 5 for all the three satellite products fig 8 presents the validation of conv sm against ismn data and the ismn data is totally outside of the 43 stations that are used to train the conv model the unbiased r between predicted conv sm and the 65 station sm is 0 83 0 82 and 0 80 for fy3c fig 8a smap fig 8b smos fig 8c and the corresponding unbiased rmse is 0 041 0 043 and 0 046 the r values are higher than those of mlp sm fig 6 regardless of ascending and descending orbits the rmse values are also smaller than those of mlp sm this indicates that outside of the training area the conv model can also reduce the errors because the ismn data is from three different networks the validation is also conducted separately for the three networks it is found that the conv model performs very well at the network fig 8m p near the training area but the sample size is very small at this network the conv model is generally well at the network to the north of 40 n but the worst at the network over south korea this probably because most of the training stations are inland but the networks over south korea near the shore the results of the three different networks are also validated for the mlp model figures are provided in the supplementary materials and compared with the results of the conv model the similar result can be found that the errors are generally smaller in conv sm than mlp sm at each network 3 3 pattern relationship with precipitation the pattern relationship between sm and precipitation is explored because precipitation is the major force of daily surface sm therefore the major pattern of sm should reflect that of precipitation and present the similar pattern based on this conception the eof analysis subsection 2 2 3 is firstly conducted for precipitation during may september during 2015 2020 to obtain the first two major patterns of the precipitation fig 9 the first pattern eof1 explains 10 66 of the total variance and the second eof2 explains 8 08 due to the daily data is used the explanation of the total variances is small for the first two eof patterns which generally present the daily rainfall patterns over eastern china during may september in fig 9a eof1 shows a uniformly anomalous rainfall band from southwest to northeast between 22 n and 32 n the anomalies outside of this band present the opposite sign and have weak amplitude eof1 shows that rainfall anomalies mainly fluctuate over the region between 22 n and 32 n where is mainly controlled by the monsoon rain band and subtropical high alternately in fig 9b a seesaw pattern is in eof2 that negatively anomalous rainfall is around 22 n but positively anomalous rainfall is around 30 n this indicates that when daily rainfall increases around 22 n it decreases around 30 n and vice versa as surface sm is generally forced by rainfall the pattern relationship between sm and precipitation should reflect the major rainfall patterns fig 9 thus svd is conducted between sm and precipitation during may september of 2015 2020 and shown in figs 10 and 11 the heterogeneous maps of the correlation coefficients for svd1 are presented in fig 10 and those patterns reflect relationships of the most occurrence between sm and precipitation the precipitation is the cmorph data and sm is the mlp and conv sm for fy3c smap and smos sm without mlp is not analyzed because of its spatiotemporal discontinuity a pair of heterogeneous maps between precipitation and mlp sm of the ascending orbit of fy3c is presented in fig 10a and b fig 10a shows the correlation coefficients between the precipitation data and the pc1 of sm in svd and fig 10b shows those between the sm data and the pc1 of precipitation in svd the pcs in svd are time variations of their corresponding svd patterns in fig 10a and b the explanation of the total covariance is 53 07 and the correlation coefficient of the pcs between sm and precipitation is 0 54 in fig 10c and d the svd1 between precipitation and mlp sm of the descending orbit of fy3c explains 47 96 of the total covariance and the correlation coefficient between the pcs is 0 51 svd1 for mlp sm of both the ascending and descending orbits of fy3c shows the very similar patterns a seesaw pattern is for the rainfall that when the rainfall increases around 25 n it decreases around 35 n fig 10a and c meanwhile sm increases over small areas between 25 n and 30 n but decreases over the remaining regions especially to the north of 35 n fig 10b and d when the rainfall decreases around 25 n the opposite patterns can be found in both precipitation and sm for the svd1 between mlp sm and precipitation for smap fig 10g j and smos fig 10m p the precipitation and sm show the similar pattern that anomalies with opposite signs over the southern and northern parts of eastern china and the strength of the anomalies is strong over the northern part svd1 for mlp sm of smap and smos generally explains about 40 of the total covariance and correlation coefficients between the pcs range from 0 65 to 0 77 for all the three satellites the svd1 patterns for the mlp sm are different from that of the eof1 pattern of precipitation fig 9a especially over the northern part of the eastern china though some similarity can be found with the eof2 pattern of precipitation fig 9b this indicates that mlp sm cannot reflect the first major pattern that forced out by rainfall and thus the original satellite sm also cannot for conv sm the similar distributions can be found for both sm and precipitation in svd1 for fy3c fig 10e and f smap fig 10k and l and smos fig 10q and r when positive anomalies of both rainfall and sm are between 22 n and 32 n weakly negative anomalies can be found to the north of 30 n except the regions to the east of 115 e and vice versa moreover except for fy3c the explanation of the covariances are increased and ranges from 47 91 to 54 16 but the correlation between pcs is decreased the correlation coefficients between the pcs are around 0 5 the svd1 patterns of both precipitation and sm are generally similar to those of the eof1 for precipitation this means that conv sm can reflect the first major pattern that forced out by rainfall for svd2 fig 11 the explanation of total covariances and correlation coefficient deceases in the conv sm but the patterns of conv sm are very similar to that of the eof2 of precipitation in svd2 the similar findings can be obtained that the mlp sm cannot reflect the force of the eof2 pattern of rainfall but the conv sm can though the spatial pattern is correct its time variation may not therefore to further prove that conv sm can reflect the time variations of the major patterns that forced out by the rainfall table 2 shows the correlation coefficients between the pcs of precipitation eof and pcs of the svd analysis because the pcs mainly reflect the time variations of the major rainfall patterns and the patterns that sm and precipitation correlates with each other the correlation coefficients can reflect the relationships between eof and svd patterns the correlation coefficients between pc1 in eof and pc1s of precipitation in svd range from 0 34 to 0 63 while svd is conducted between precipitation and mlp sm for the three satellites for conv sm those correlation coefficients are increased to about 0 85 moreover the correlation coefficients between pc1 in eof and pc1s of sm in svd are also increased to about 0 40 by the conv model this indicates that conv sm enhances the connections between rainfall and sm in terms of the first major pattern on the other hand the correlation coefficients between pc2 of eof and pc1s of svd are decreased by the conv model meanwhile those between pc1 of eof and pc2s of svd are also decreased by the conv model however those between pc2 of eof and pc2s of svd are increased by the conv model except for the correlation between pc2 in eof and pc2 in svd for smap in general mlp sm cannot clearly reflect the major force of rainfall in terms of its first two eofs but the conv sm can in the other words the pattern relationship indicates that the conv model can improve the quality of satellite sm that enhances the physical relationships between rainfall and sm data mlp sm mainly reflects the characteristics of satellite products because both the errors and signals inherit from the satellite products and the conv model to a certain extent corrects the satellite products based on in situ observations from the pattern relationship between precipitation and sm it is found that the satellite sm products could not correctly reflect the major variation of sm patterns associated with rainfall over eastern china the conv model using limited number of stations 43 over eastern china produces sm with reasonable major patterns that similar to the major rainfall force thus correction based on ground based data is needed for the satellite products before its application in a specific region for climate research based on daily sm products or unreliable results could be achieved more ground based data is needed for further studies which can improve the performance of the conv model 4 discussions lack of reliable spatiotemporally continuous data hinders the research on large space regions nowadays various input features and architectures of dl are applied widely to achieve sm data early studies used satellite data of visible infrared imaging radiometer and gravimetric sm over china to obtained spatial continuous data zhang et al 2017 the using of gravimetric sm as input features over a large region can provide well spatial variation results but gravimetric method cannot provide daily continuous values at the same site some studies use dl model to predict sm at the sites of ground stations to obtain temporal continuous data e g fang et al 2017 fang and shen 2020 elsaadani et al 2021 li et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 and the obtained data has temporal continuity but not spatial to obtain spatiotemporal continuity many other studies use dynamic outputs as targets to train dl models to get sm data lee et al 2019 klingmüller and lelieveld 2021 li et al 2021 however model outputs or reanalysis already have errors thus the present study suggested a two step method that uses the first step to obtain spatiotemporal continuity and second step to reduce errors due to the limitation of station numbers the unbiased errors are reduced notably but the biases are only improved around the training stations further discussions are provided as follows 4 1 sensitivity of the dl models to the input features the dl models are mainly based on data driven approach although structure of the model is fixed different input features lead to the changes in coefficients in the model which may result in changes in the outputs in the present study the features chosen are following an idea that variables associated with the land surface energy and water balance affected less by sm and being relatively reliable in the reanalysis near the surface dlr and dsr are the major energy source t2 is associated with the thermal flux and u10 and v10 are related to the momentum fluxes precipitation is the major water source for surface sm the static variables of lc types directly affect land surface fluxes and soil properties determine the soil water capacity and drainage the other atmospheric variables impacting sm are not considered in the dl models for example evaporation upward long and short wave radiation land surface temperature etc those variables influence sm but also highly related to sm in the reanalysis system although there are also sm atmosphere interactions between the selected atmospheric features and sm this is not considered in the present study the selected input features are reminiscent of inputs of a dynamical land model but without the variables that send out by the land surface while the sensitivity of inputs to a model is examined dl model is very different from the dynamic and linear regression model when the input features changed the physical laws are not changed in a dynamic model and the linear least squares rule is not changed in a linear regression model in those models it is relatively easy to explore the sensitivity of input features and provide explanations in the data driven dl model though the structure of a model is fixed the rules in the model are still changed with the input features and targets and what rules learnt by dl model are unable to trace unpredictable and even unknown in a dynamic model if a variable is removed from the physical equations several physical processes are removed and it is relatively easy to trace and understand the removed processes in a linear regression model if a variable is removed it is easy to explain the variance changed by this variable however if a feature is removed in a dl model the model tries their best to find out the useful information provided by the removed feature from the remaining features during this process the rules are changed to shrink the differences between features and targets therefore the dl model may be not sensitive to a feature because the model may figure it out from other features which does not mean that the removed feature that directly provides useful information is not important on the other hand if the model cannot figure it out which means the remaining features do not have information of the removed feature or the model structure does not have the ability to retrieve the same information from the remaining features the more complex structure the model has the more complicated and difficult the sensitivity is to be explained generally the sensitivity of a dl model to an input feature is different from dynamical and linear regression models and thus we put the sensitivity part in the discussions in the following we present the sensitivity of mlp fig 12 and conv models to an input feature respectively however we are not going to provide further discussions and explanations because those may change with model structure and different feature combinations in fig 12 sensitivity of the mlp model to each input feature is examined it is found that almost all the features can improve r2 decreases and rmse increases or do not change the results of the mlp model when a feature is removed except the soil properties for fy3c sm in descending orbit all the panels in fig 12 present that lc types can notably affect the results of mlp model for the conv model figures presented in the supplementary materials though some common characteristics are found that the outputs are sensitivity to lc types in the test dataset different results are obtained using the ismn data for validation it is really difficult to provide a reasonable explanation for the sensitivity of the dl models which needs to understand and trace the processes in the model so far it is better to just use the dl models as a tool to obtained better sm data for further studies in the physical world 4 2 failed to improve biases compared with the dynamic model the dl models cannot predict circumstance that they never learned this means that if the values of an input feature are out of the value range of training those values may cause differences between model results and observations in fig 7b c e f h and i the biases between conv and observed sm are negligible at the 43 stations and thus they are not shown however the biases between conv and ismn sm are very large and no better than mlp sm figures not shown this is because that the mean state of conv sm is highly sensitive to the static variables which is noted during our trail and test the conv is trained against sm of the 43 stations which have small number of lc types and soil properties they are not large enough to train the conv model to predict accurate mean state over a large region with various static characteristics for the atmospheric variables their variations are large enough at the 43 stations and thus the unbiased r and rmse are improved in conv sm compared with mlp sm no matter that the model results are validated against the 43 station or ismn sm to further present biases of the satellite products the spatial distributions of mean sm of ascending and descending orbits with and without mlp and that predicted by the conv model are further compared fig 13 in fig 13a l the distributions for sm with and without mlp of the same satellite show the very similar patterns and the differences are only among different satellite products conv sm fig 13m o exhibits different distributions compared with those without conv fig 13a l in fy3c sm without conv fig 13a d g j and m is small to the south of the yangtze river and along the huang river but large over the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and along the coastlines in fig 13m the conv sm is large to the south of 25 n and over the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and small around 27 n and over the lower reaches of the huang river in smap the sm without conv fig 13b e h and k is large to the south of 32 n but small to the north the distribution of the conv sm in smap fig 13n is similar to that of fy3c fig 13m but soil is wetter in smos sm without conv fig 13c f i l and o is large over the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river but small along the southeast coastline and to the north of 32 n the distribution of the conv sm in smos fig 13o is also similar to those of fy3c and smap fig 13m and n but the soil is drier although the same conv model is used the different input features of the satellite products still yield different results which mainly relate to the characteristics of each satellite product for the sm without conv all the satellite products present large sm over the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river but outside of this region large differences are among the three satellite products after correction by the conv model it is found that the distributions of mean sm are different from those of the sm without conv especially over the northern part of eastern china compared with the conv sm the sm without conv has small values over this region the conv model shows that sm is large over the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and to the south of 25 n and sm is small over the remaining regions for the conv sm the soil in smap is the wettest among the three satellite and the soil in smos is drier than that in fy3c this property generally inherits from mlp sm the large difference between sm with and without conv is over northern part of eastern china that the conv sm is larger than that without conv this is because the conv model is not trained with enough static features over northern china however except the 43 stations there is no extra data for further validation over those regions in the present study if enough stations with various static features are provided the conv model can give a better prediction on the mean state 4 3 other aspects compared sm with and without mlp the data quality improves in terms of unbiased r and rmse on one hand the mlp model learns the characteristics of the satellite products but mlp sm inherits both signals and errors from the satellite products on the other hand atmospheric and static land variables are used to build relationship with sm and thus the mlp model can learn some physical rules between those variables and sm therefore the mlp sm still has errors that succeed from the satellite products but the mlp model also drives the sm to follow certain rules associated with atmospheric and static land variables which maybe the reason for the quality improvement of mlp sm however the dl method likes a black box and it is difficult to trace what rules have been learnt when conv is conducted the data needs continuity on the dimensions that conv is performed on and missing value is not allowed for the conv model 2d conv needs spatial continuity and 1d conv need temporal continuity in the present study 1d conv is taken on the data sampled by a 51 day sliding window it is analogy to take the 51 day time series as an image with multiple channels and conv is conducted on this 1d image to learn sm variation in 51 days the 2d conv on 2d maps is another way to reduce errors but we didn t use it in the present study this is because presently we want to establish a conv model that is applicable on any grid cell of the satellite and the relationships and physical rules are only happened on this grid cell which is less complicate than the 2d conv 2d conv is mostly image processing on 2d maps which can reflect relationships among grid cells and also embrace physical rules but it is more complicate than 1d conv for understanding in addition the boundary between land and ocean is needed to be processed the errors of satellite products are inevitable and can be produced during scanning microwaves from the earth and postprocessing for example eastern china suffers from the severe illegal l band radio frequency interference contamination which can disturb the observations on smap and smos with l band devices during the postprocessing of fy3c products the sm values 0 5 are artificially set to 0 5 which brings very large errors to this product that when the values 0 5 is considered in the evaluation very poor quality is found for fy3c product although the errors of satellite products can be reduced by the dl models dl is not as perfect as we expected the dl models are sensitive to the input features and sample size of the data in the present study there is a problem that the grid cells of satellite products and atmospheric variables and static land variables are not match with each other interpolation is conducted and may cause errors for dl for the in situ station data the sample size is still too small that it cannot include all kinds of land types soil properties and even weather conditions moreover the in situ sm does not spread all over the eastern china the dl model cannot predict the situation that has not happened and if this situation occurs the prediction maybe wrong this means that there are still uncertainties of the results of the conv model outside of the 43 stations which needs extra data and further studies however we can foresee the great potential of dl for predicting spatiotemporally seamless sm products based on satellite data with errors reduced efficiently 5 conclusions two dl models of neural networks are used to obtain spatiotemporally seamless sm with errors being reduced on daily time interval based on the satellite products in ascending and descending orbits of fy3c smap and smos the first dl model is the mlp model which builds the relationship between satellite sm and atmospheric and static land variables as long as there are valid values of the atmospheric and static land variables on a grid cell of a satellite the mlp model can predict the sm value on this grid cell using fitted coefficients trained by the model therefore spatiotemporally seamless sm in the ascending and descending orbits of a satellite is achieved through mlp the mlp model has a stable performance during training and validation for all the three satellite products the predicted mlp sm generally has the same spatial distribution as that of sm without mlp moreover compared with in situ sm mlp also improves the data quality that unbiased r increases and unbiased rmse decreases for the sm with and without mlp smap has the best quality among the three satellites and smos is generally better than fy3c the second dl model is the conv model and conv is a powerful and sophisticated tool for image processing using the 1d conv model mlp sm is corrected against in situ sm the mlp sm from all the three satellites is corrected notably by the conv model the unbiased r reaches to about 0 89 and rmse decreases to about 0 035 after the errors are corrected by the conv model the differences of the quality between the three satellite products are negligible in terms of the total statistics similar results can be found through applying a different data source of ismn that both the mlp and sm quality is improved in terms of unbiased r and rmse however except over the region with the 43 stations the biases are not improved during the validation outside of the training region using ismn data besides the mean state the anomalous patterns of sm related to precipitation are also examined and reflect variations of sm anomalies it is found that sm without conv cannot reflect the major patterns of precipitation over eastern china which are uniformly anomalous rainfall band over the southern part of eastern china and a seesaw pattern between 25 n and 30 n however the conv sm can reflect the major patterns of precipitation and the pattern relationship is increased notably compared to mlp sm one may think the improvement of the pattern relationship between sm and precipitation is because that the precipitation is used as input features of the conv model it should be noted that the same precipitation is also used as input features of the mlp model but mlp sm cannot well reflect the major patterns of the precipitation at last no matter the mlp or conv model dl mainly makes the input data to fit the target variable in the other words mlp sm is close to satellite products and conv sm is close to in situ observations thus the three satellite products cannot well reflect the connections between sm and precipitation which suggests a carefully examination and correction of those data before their climatic application and this study presents that dl can be the powerful tool for this purpose reliable data is a good start for the research on large scale interactions between sm and the atmosphere in the pattern relationship we can see that the patterns of conv sm are closer to the pattern of precipitation than the mlp sm but the strength of the relationship is weakened this may relate to complicate land atmosphere interactions that sm is not only affected by precipitation and also has feedbacks to the atmosphere declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

continuous sm on a day applying mlp introduced in subsection 2 2 1 the spatiotemporally continuous sm was achieved and the demonstration on a random date june 4th 2018 is presented in fig a1 for fy3c top panels smap middle panels and smos bottom panels the figures for the rest of the dates are provided in the supplementary materials for the satellite sm products without mlp sm of the ascending orbit is shown in fig a1a e and i the first column and that of the descending orbit is shown in fig a1c g and k the third column sm outside of the orbits has invalid value and in the orbits sm of the three satellite products also has missing values on some grid cells those grid cells are filled with white color it is noted that the values 0 5 are set to missing value for fy3c fig a1a and c for the sm without mlp the soil is dry around 25 n and 35 n and wet around 30 n in fy3c fig a1a and c in smap fig a1e and g the soil is dry to the north of 32 n but wet to the south in smos fig a1i the soil is generally dry around 35 n and to the south of 25 n but wet around 30 n in the ascending orbit in the descending orbit fig a1j there is a wet band around 25 n from southwest to northeast and to the north and south of this band the soil is generally dry overall the three sm products generally exhibit wet soil over southern part of eastern china and dry soil over the northern part but show some differences on small spatial scales and to the south of 25 n after learning sm from atmospheric and static land variables against the satellite sm products on the grid cells with valid sm values sm on the grid cells with invalid and missing values can be predicted and filled with valid values on the maps fig a1b f j d h and l in the areas that can be scanned by the satellites the values of mlp sm and its distribution are generally similar to those without mlp over the areas outside of the orbits the mlp sm values fill all the grid cells and present the spatial continuity over the areas outside of the orbits of fy3c fig a1b and d the distribution is generally similar to that over the areas in the orbits but soil is dry around 30 n to the west of 110 e and wet along the coastlines to the south of 30 n for smap cross comparisons can be conducted between mlp sm of the ascending orbit fig a1f and sm without mlp of the descending orbit fig a1g as well as between mlp sm of the descending orbit fig a1h and sm without mlp of the ascending orbit fig a1e the distribution of mlp sm is almost the same as that without mlp in the orbits in smos the distributions of sm with and without mlp are generally the same in the areas covered by the satellite orbits however over the region to the west of 110 e and to the south of 25 n the sm with and without mlp in the orbits shows some differences that the dry fig a1i and j or wet fig a1k and l degrees are slight smaller in mlp sm this maybe because the daily atmospheric variables are used for mlp but the satellite products are instantaneous values moreover outside of the orbits mlp sm of the ascending orbit fig a1j is small but that of the descending orbit fig a1 l is large over the same region this may relate to different weather conditions in this region while the satellite tracks of different orbits are on different times in a day generally mlp can produce spatiotemporally continuous sm values that share the very similar spatial distribution with the satellite sm without mlp it is also found that the spatial distributions of sm over eastern china are different among different satellite products especially over the southern part of eastern china appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j jhydrol 2023 129308 appendix a supplementary data the

2132,except assimilated data of soil moisture sm there is always a circumstance that not every spatial point has valid value over a specific region in a day and there are invalid values or gaps between days in a time series at a spatial point especially the satellite and ground based data thus those data are not spatiotemporally seamless on daily time scale and the seamless data of surface sm is fundamental for research on the land atmosphere interactions on various time scales deep learning methods of multi perceptron mlp and convolution conv neural networks are applied for obtaining spatiotemporally seamless sm over eastern china during may september of 2015 2020 to combine the advantages of ground based and remote sensed data firstly taking atmospheric and land variables as inputs mlp is trained against the satellite products including the level 2 product of chinese fengyun 3c fy3c level 3 product of the us soil moisture active passive smap and level 2 neural network product of the european soil moisture and ocean salinity smos after that spatiotemporally seamless sm is predicted by mlp which is stable during training and validation compared with the in situ sm mlp sm inherits the characteristics of the satellite products though the quality is slightly improved secondly conv uses the mlp sm as inputs and is trained against in situ sm the unbiased errors are reduced notably that unbiased correlation increases and root mean square errors decreases at last from the pattern correlation between precipitation and sm anomalies the error reduced conv sm can well reflect the relationships forced out by the major patterns of rainfall but the satellite products cannot in addition during the evaluation smap has the best quality over eastern china and smos is generally better than fy3c however after processed by conv the differences of the quality among different satellites are negligible except some differences in the mean patterns of conv sm which is mainly associated with the properties of the satellite products keywords deep learning surface soil moisture remote sensing eastern china spatiotemporally continuity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil moisture sm is an essential variable in land atmosphere interaction that sm can significantly response and feedback to weather and climate seneviratne et al 2010 climate prediction and research need sm with various time intervals and spatial continuity which is usually observed through field observation or remote sensing dorigo et al 2011 2021 so far the ground based networks for sm observation are sparse and established over limited regions and some of the observations are temporally discontinuous chen et al 2021 thus the ground based sm cannot accomplish requirement of the spatiotemporal continuity for real time application polar orbit remote sensing of sm can cover the entire globe and the most of the sm data are temporally continuous above weekly time scale but is discontinuous below weekly because it is generally conducted by polar orbit satellites petropoulos et al 2015 xian et al 2021 furthermore the satellite sm is not as accurate as ground based sm and some even has large errors both the two types of sm data have disadvantages and it is better to combine their advantages to achieve spatiotemporal continuity and reduce errors sm data is achieved through various techniques including ground based observation remote sensing and physical model assimilation the ground based sm can be obtained through weighting the soil sample before and after drying gravimetric method taking advantage of the electromagnetic property of soil e g time domain reflectometry tdr and frequency domain reflectometry fdr francesca et al 2010 salam et al 2019 measuring neutrons emitting from radioactive source or the soil neutron probe or cosmic ray vachaud et al 1977 iwema et al 2021 and ground penetrating radar liu et al 2016 among those ground based techniques fdr has the lowest cost dorigo et al 2011 although the ground based techniques provide the most reliable values it is still a challenge to build dense networks for high frequency real time sm observations over large scale areas chen et al 2021 dorigo et al 2021 satellite remote sensing is an optional technique for monitoring sm dynamically and quasi globally several satellite missions with microwave devices have been launched during the last two decades for example the sentinel missions and the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos of the european space agency esa kerr et al 2010 hornacek et al 2012 the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 imaoka et al 2012 the microwave radiation imager mwri carried by the chinese fengyun 3b c satellites fy3b fy3c yang et al 2012 zheng et al 2020 and the soil moisture active passive smap of the us national aeronautics and space administration nasa entekhabi et al 2010 chan et al 2018 though the accuracy of satellite sm products is improving errors are inevitable and the products are not as accurate as the ground based observations ma et al 2019 moreover most of the polar orbit satellites cannot provide spatially seamless data on daily frequency in order to obtain spatiotemporally continuous sm data satellite and ground based observations can be assimilated into the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 the global reanalysis systems also provide assimilated sm products including the us national centers for environmental prediction department of energy reanalysis ii ncep doe kanamitsu et al 2002 the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis saha et al 2014 the era interim and era5 reanalyses of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts dee et al 2011 hans et al 2020 however the sm products of land model generally have poor performance on small spatial scales and there is still large space for improvement of those products dirmeyer et al 2016 besides the assimilation deep learning dl is a modern approach developed rapidly that can produce spatiotemporally continuous sm yuan et al 2020 the major difference between the two approaches is that the assimilation and dl are dynamic and data driven respectively reichstein et al 2019 comparing to the assimilation dl is more economical in terms of computation consumptions and performances better than traditionally statistical and physical models reichstein et al 2019 lee et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 according to the physical balance of land water spatiotemporal variations of sm are affected by various factors including precipitation radiation temperature humidity wind speed land cover soil properties etc kato et al 2006 qian et al 2006 katul et al 2007 mccoll et al 2017 for the data driven approach those data can be applied as input features for dl models as well as various sm products from satellite and assimilation systems fang et al 2017 lee et al 2019 the ground based sm is usually used as the learning target for dl training and validation for example the smap level 3 sm product with the horizontal resolution of about 36 km was downscaled by dl to the seamless fine resolution data over the us xu et al 2022 liu et al 2022 neural networks of the long short term memory lstm convolutional conv neural networks and lstm conv combined networks are applied to obtain either spatially or temporally continuous data over the us and asia zhang et al 2017 klingmüller and lelieveld 2021 li et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 all those studies show that dl is a powerful tool to produce spatiotemporally seamless sm and reduce errors spatiotemporal seamless sm data is important for the society and economy over eastern china so far previous studies either trained the dl against reanalysis li et al 2021 which is not as accurate as ground based observations or used the satellite products of visible infrared imaging radiometer as input features zhang et al 2017 which has larger errors than the microwave remote sensing in the present study two steps are conducted to achieve spatiotemporal continuity and reduce errors for sm products of the satellites with microwave devices over eastern china in boreal summer firstly a multi perceptron neural network is used to learn sm of fy3c smos and smap from atmospheric variables to achieve spatiotemporally seamless products of sm after that the seamless sm is used to train a conv network against ground based observations to reduce errors and produce daily sm products using the dl models to combined microwave sensing of sm and filed observed data the present study is going to solve the following questions 1 can the gaps outside of the microwave satellite scanning be filled with valid values 2 dose the filled data consistent with the satellite products 3 can the conv model reduce the errors of satellite products 4 as the error compose of bias and unbiased error do them all reduced by the dl models 2 data and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 ground based sm the hourly in situ water content in g cm 3 of surface soil is collected by fdr method by the stations in the jiangxi jiangsu and zhejiang provinces over eastern china table 1 those stations are automatic stations which are used for agriculture drought monitor and sm research the fdr uses eight sensors buried underground that send and receive 100 mhz electromagnetic pulse to detect soil water content at 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 70 80 and 90 100 cm the hourly sm at 43 stations was generally observed consistently with a few outliers and missing values during the research periods time intervals of the missing data are less than 24 h at each station the hourly data was averaged in 24 h to obtain the continuous daily sm for analysis and the value was changed from g cm 3 into m3 m 3 using the water density of 103 kg m 3 more details of the station data are presented in table a1 in the appendix besides the above mentioned sm data at the 43 in situ stations the hourly sm data in m3 m 3 at the depth of 0 10 cm from the international soil moisture network ismn stations is also used in the present study table 1 there are 65 stations with good flag for sm over the region of 100 140 e and 20 50 n during 2015 2020 see table a2 in the appendix for details the hourly data is averaged into daily interval there are 29 stations over south korea to the east of 125 e 34 stations are around the boundary between nei mongol and hebei provinces over northern china to the north of 40 n and two stations locate in hubei province inside of the region of 105 125 e and 20 40 n except for the two stations in hubei province all the stations are outside of the training area of the dl models none of the 65 stations is among the 43 stations that are used for the training of the conv model thus the different data source of ismn that is independent of the 43 in situ stations can be used for further validation of the dl models the dl models will be introduced in the following subsections 2 1 2 satellite sm products launched on november 2nd 2009 smos is the second earth explorer opportunity mission and the first mission of esa providing global measurements of l band brightness temperature for sm deriving mecklenburg et al 2016 a 2d radiometer was designed for monitoring near surface sm at 0 5 cm globally the smos l2 neural network data new smos level 2 near real time neural network soil moisture version 700 is obtained through scanning in the ascending and descending orbits table 1 the sm is retrieved from l band brightness temperature of 1 4 ghz based on the statistical coefficients estimated by a neural network this product of 2015 2020 is provided only at the satellite track about 30 tracks in a day in this study the 2d gridded binned average was applied to obtain daily sm with the horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 for sm of the descending and ascending orbits separately for example while the data are non missing values in a day and fell into a 0 25 0 25 grid cell in an orbit they are bin averaged to represent the value at that grid cell for that day the rest of the cells are filled with missing values the unit of smos sm is m3 m 3 chinese fy3c was launched on september 23rd 2013 and is the second generation polar orbiting meteorological satellite the mwri on the satellite has a microwave band of 10 65 ghz x band for the near surface sm monitor and a shallow sensing depth about 2 cm than the l band about 5 cm fy3c sm is retrieved through the radiative transfer based model using the brightness temperature in the descending and ascending orbits for bare surface the parameterized surface emissivity model qp inversion model is used to retrieve sm shi et al 2005 for the surface covered with vegetation the empirical relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index and the vegetation water content is used to obtain sm liu et al 2013 the daily fy3c level 2 products use the equal area scalable earth grid ease grid 1 0 projection with the horizontal resolution of about 25 km and unit of m3 m 3 table 1 during the retrieving the sm values 0 5 are artificially assigned to 0 5 which to a certain extent depresses sm variability and causes very large errors thus we assigned the sm values 0 5 as missing values for the fy3c product in the present study the smap mission was launched in january 2015 and started operation in april 2015 two instruments are carried by smap but the radar stopped functioning on july 7th 2015 and only the l band radiometer of 1 41 ghz is measuring sm after then reichle et al 2021 the sm data used in this study is the level 3 product smap l3 radiometer global daily 36 km ease grid soil moisture which is surface 0 5 cm sm at daily time interval on about 36 36 km horizontal grids for the descending and ascending orbits table 1 it is noted that the grids of smap product is ease grid 2 0 the data used in this study is the sm during may september of 2015 2020 generally we have the satellite sm products with daily time interval in descending and ascending orbits of fy3c smos and smap for analysis during the comparison with the in situ sm the sm values of each satellite product are averaged over the nearest four grid cells around a station to obtain time series of satellite products against the ground based observations 2 1 3 atmospheric and static land variables in this study the precipitation data used is the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph products of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration using the cmorph technique precipitation is obtained through combining precipitation estimates of several low orbiter satellites joyce et al 2004 other hourly atmospheric variables are obtained from the era5 reanalysis hans et al 2020 which is averaged into daily for analysis see table 1 for more details for each of the satellite products with different horizontal resolutions the atmospheric variables were re gridded into the resolution of the satellite product through linear interpolation besides the atmospheric variables static land variables including soil properties and land cover lc types are also used the percentages of clay silt sand and gravel of topsoil 0 30 cm are achieved from the harmonized world soil database version 1 2 hwsd which provides the soil information worldwide hwsd is the results of a collaboration of the un food and agriculture organization fao with the international institute for applied system analysis the isric world soil information the institute of soil science the chinese academy of sciences and the joint research centre of the european commission for different horizontal resolutions of the satellite products the static land variables were re gridded into the resolution of each satellite product through linear interpolation to obtain the atmospheric variables and soil properties e g percentages of clay silt sand and gravel at an in situ station the values of a variable were also averaged over the nearest four grid cells around the station it is noted that the grid cells have the resolution of 0 25 0 25 for the atmospheric variables and 1 1 km for the soil properties the 300 m resolution lc level 4 product of 2018 is provided by the copernicus climate change service c3s this product is consistent with the lc maps during 1992 2015 produced by the esa cci the data of lc classification with 38 values is defined by the fao s land cover classification system in the present study the percentage of each lc types was counted in a 0 25 0 25 grid cell with the center of an in situ station for each satellite products the percentages were counted in the grid cells of the product 2 2 methods a flow chart is presented in fig 1 to illustrate the major methods used in this study the atmospheric and static variables are used as input features to train a multi perceptron neural network mlp against satellite sm products to obtain spatiotemporally continuous data after that the data is used with atmospheric and static variables to train a conv model against station sm to reduce errors results of the mlp and conv model are validated by unbiased correlation r and root mean square error rmse empirical orthogonal functions eof and singular value decomposition svd are further used to explore the similarity of the sm anomalous patterns with that of the rainfall 2 2 1 mlp for spatiotemporal continuity in order to obtain spatiotemporally continuous sm for the satellite products mlp fig 2 is applied at every grid cell for the sm product in each orbit of a satellite over eastern china the mlp model is designed to predict sm at a grid cell at a time and if the input features at a grid cell is provided the corresponding sm value can be predicted at this grid cell in fig 2 the first layer input layer of the mlp model has 48 input features including precipitation t2 u10 v10 dlr dsr percentages of four soil types and 38 lc types after that the 48 features are passed to five hidden layers with 2000 1600 800 400 and 200 perceptrons respectively at last the output layer provides fitted sm the neighbor layers are connected with the activation of rectified linear unit relu function allowing for nonlinearity in order to save computation time we only conducted mlp for the grid cells over the region of 105 125 e and 20 40 n for each satellite product though the mlp model can be applied over the entire globe for the grid cells of each product over this region during may september of 2015 2020 90 of the total grid cells with valid sm values are randomly chosen as training targets fy3c smap and smos sm and the remaining 10 are used for validation for the grid cells without a valid value mlp uses the input features that are spatiotemporally continuous to predict the sm values over a larger region of 100 140 e and 20 60 n the mlp model with the same fitted coefficients obtained during training is used at every grid cell in an orbit of a satellite product at last sm with spatiotemporal continuity can be obtained for the products in the descending and ascending orbits of the three satellites in other words we obtain daily sm for may september of 2015 2020 using mlp for the entire region 2 2 2 conv network for reducing errors using mlp the spatiotemporally continuous sm is obtained but errors are succeeded from the satellite products since mlp sm is spatiotemporally continuous it is capable to apply more sophisticated dl to further reduce errors such as conv or lstm in the present study a dl model based on the 1d conv network is applied fig 3 in the conv model 20 input features are used the training and validation are against ground based observations of the 43 stations the first 12 input features are spatiotemporally continuous mlp sm in the descending and ascending orbits of a satellite precipitation t2 u10 v10 dlr dsr and percentages of clay silt sand and gravel the remaining eight input features are percentages of eight lc types that are the top eight lc types in the 0 25 0 25 grid cells around a station among the 43 ones including irrigated cropland 15 5 mosaic cropland 6 5 rainfed cropland 5 5 mosaic natural vegetation 3 7 evergreen needle leaved tree 3 6 urban 3 3 evergreen broad leaved tree 2 3 and water 1 4 the remaining 30 lc types do not commonly distribute around all the 43 stations which could be bad input features for the conv model that bring errors to the prediction for each input features there are 153 days during may september of each year fig 3 we use a 51 day sliding window going through the 153 days of each year to yield 103 samples in each year and thus the 51 days can be used for 1d convolution behind the input layer there are two conv layers with the sequence length of 51 and a kernel size of 3 but input channels of 20 and 40 and output channels of 40 and 80 respectively following the conv layers there are two multi perceptron layers with 80 and 40 perceptrons respectively at last the fitted sm against in situ observations are obtained for 51 days the neighbor layers are also connected by relu for nonlinearity after training the fitted coefficients are the same at every grid cell of a satellite so far we have the in situ sm from january 1st 2015 to august 27th 2017 for 11 stations and from january 1st 2015 to december 31st 2018 for the rest of 32 stations the last summer at each station is used for validation of the conv model and the remaining data is for training after that the sm during may september of 2015 2020 is predicted by the conv model at every grid cell of each satellite product of fy3c smos and smap although the conv model can be also applied over the entire globe as long as there are global input features the targets of the in situ sm mainly locates over eastern china and thus the fitted model could be better to apply over 100 140 e and 20 60 n 2 2 3 other methods for validation and evaluation the un biased correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse are used and the biases of a satellite product can be easily removed through subtracting the climatic data of in situ observations 1 s i j s i j s 1 n i 1 n s i j o i 1 n s i j s in eq 1 the bias at a station has been removed eq 1 si j is the bias removed sm of a satellite product s i j s is the satellite sm obtained through averaging the sm over the four nearest grid cells around a station s i j o is the sm at an in situ station i varies from 1 to n which is the sample size associated with time length j varies from 1 to 43 which is the number of in situ stations the correlation coefficient of the mean sm at each station between satellite and in situ sm is calculated by eq 2 and can generally represent the impact of the bias on the quality of a product small rm corresponds to large biases of a satellite product 2 r m j 1 43 i 1 n s i j o j 1 43 i 1 n s i j o i 1 n s i j s j 1 43 i 1 n s i j s j 1 43 i 1 n s i j o j 1 43 i 1 n s i j o 2 j 1 43 i 1 n s i j s j 1 43 i 1 n s i j s 2 in eqs 3 and 4 we used all the data to calculate r and rmse and i and j are omitted 3 r k 1 m s k o s o s k s k 1 m s k o s o 2 k 1 m s k s 2 4 rmse 1 m k 1 m s k s k o 2 in eq 3 k varies from 1 to m which is associated with the total sample size regardless of space or time so and s represent the in situ observed sm and bias removed satellite sm respectively because the bias has been removed in s of eqs 3 and 4 r and rmse are un biased in the following reduced error means increase of unbiased r and decrease of unbiased rmse and bias is associated with the difference of between the mean states of the model outputs and observations the major patterns of precipitation during may september of 2015 2020 are explored by the empirical orthogonal functions eof quadrelli et al 2005 a matrix of m x n m v l l z n with spatial grids of m and time length of n can be decomposed into spatial patterns m v l l eof patterns and time series l z n l principle components denoted as pcs with number of l in which each of the components or patterns is orthogonal with the others for the conciseness in the following we omit subscripts of some matrices e g z v t x the percentages of the variance explanation are calculated using the eigenvalues of xx t the eof pattern eof1 with the largest percentage of the variance explanation represents the most occurrence pattern among all the spatial distributions of the variable during the analysis period and the corresponding pc is its time variation in order to explore the major patterns of rainfall anomalies the time mean of the precipitation has been removed before eof and the first two eofs are analyzed the pattern relationships between precipitation and sm during may september of 2015 2020 are examined by the methods of the singular value decomposition svd bretherton et al 1992 in order to explore the relationship between two variables they are firstly normalized through removing their mean and then dividing by their standard deviations and the normalized variables are represented by the matrices of m1 x n and m2 y n with the time length of n and spatial grids of m1 and m2 respectively thus xy t is the correlation matrix the xy t uσv t can be decomposed into matrices of m1 u p p σ p and m2 v p in which σ is the singular values whose squares can be used to calculate the percentages of the covariance explanation and p is the number of svd modes u and v are very similar to patterns of eof but they represent the pattern pairs that x relates with y the pattern pair svd1 with the largest explanation of the total covariance represents the most common occurrence of the pattern relationship between the two variables the expansion coefficients or pcs of svds that correspond to u and v can be calculated by p t n u t x and p z n v t y respectively the correlation maps between x and z are usually called left heterogeneous maps and those between y and t are the right heterogeneous maps those pairs of the maps are used to presents the patterns that x related with y the correlation coefficients between t and z present the strength of the pattern correlation in the present study x is precipitation and y is sm the first two svds are used for analysis both eof and svd are conducted over the region of 105 125 e and 20 40 n 3 results 3 1 achieving spatiotemporally continuous sm mlp model can produce spatiotemporally continuous sm values that share the very similar spatial distribution compared with the satellite sm without mlp but the distributions are different among the satellite products fig a1 in the appendix further validation is carried out for mlp sm to check whether the satellite sm can be well reproduced by mlp fig 4 presents the scatter distribution of daily sm with y axis and without x axis mlp for training and validation during mlp 90 of the data that is randomly chosen is used for training and the remaining 10 is for validation or test during the training the correlation coefficients r between sm with and without mlp are 0 92 and 0 89 for the ascending fig 4a and descending fig 4c orbits of fy3c respectively and the corresponding rmses are 0 042 and 0 048 it is noted that sm with and without mlp shares the same mean and thus the r and rmse are unbiased in terms of the original satellite products in the validation r values are 0 89 and 0 88 and rmses are 0 049 and 0 050 for the ascending fig 4b and descending fig 4d orbits of fy3c respectively for smap the r values are generally around 0 89 and rmses are around 0 06 for both sm with and without mlp regardless of the ascending and descending orbits for smos the r values are around 0 7 and rmses are around 0 09 in fig 4 most of the scatters are around the dash lines on which r is equal to 1 and rmse is equal to 0 the scatters are more concentrate along the dash lines in fy3c and smap than those in smos and thus mlp performs the best in fy3c but the worst in smos and smap is in the middle the mlp model performs generally the same during training and validation which indicates the stable performance of the model from the validation it can be concluded that the mlp model can generally well reproduce the three satellite sm products over regions that the satellites cannot scan in fig 5 the sm with and without mlp is evaluated against sm at the 43 in situ stations through unbiased r and rmse eqs 3 and 4 the correlation coefficients rm eq 2 of the mean sm at each station between satellite and in situ sm are also presented and shown in the sub panels with red color the correlation of mean sm ranges from 0 07 to 0 26 which indicates large biases in the three satellite sm products after removing the biases at each station from the satellite products the scatters are generally along the dash lines the main panels in fig 5 in fy3c for the sm without mlp r and rmse are 0 55 0 58 and 0 075 0 077 fig 5a and c respectively for that with mlp r and rmse are 0 63 0 67 and 0 064 0 067 respectively the differences between descending and ascending orbits are negligible in terms of the total statistics the quality of mlp sm is better than that without mlp and mlp improves correlation and reduces errors for smap and smos the similar results can be found that mlp improves sm quality among the three products smap fig 5e h has the largest correlation with the in situ sm which ranges from 0 76 to 0 80 and the smallest rmse which ranges from 0 050 to 0 062 for smos fig 5i l r ranges from 0 61 to 0 78 and rmse ranges from 0 054 to 0 099 the quality of smos sm without mlp fig 5i and k is better than that of fy3c fig 5a and c in terms of r but worse in terms of rmse after mlp fig 5j and l the quality of smos is better than that of the fy3c fig 5b and d therefore besides filled the grid cells with invalid values mlp can also improve the data quality to further validate the mlp model the ismn data that is outside of the training area 105 125 e and 20 40 n of the mlp model the results are presented in fig 6 which shows very similar results as those found in fig 5 it is also found that satellite sm without mlp has higher unbiased r and lower rmse than that with mlp 3 2 reducing errors by conv to further improve the quality of satellite sm products a more sophisticated dl of conv network subsection 2 2 2 than that of mlp is applied based on the mlp sm data mlp sm of both ascending and descending orbits and atmospheric and static land variables are used to train the conv model against the in situ sm the unbiased r and rmse during training and validation are presented in fig 7 as well as the prediction on the grid cells during the training fig 7a d and g and validation fig 7b e and h the input data for the conv model are obtained through averaging around the 43 stations using the nearest four grid cells thus the same data structure as those of the in situ sm is obtained for the conv model after then the trained conv model is used to predict sm at every grid cell over 100 140 e and 20 60 n the predicted grid sm is averaged using the nearest four grid cells to compare with the in situ sm again fig 7c f and i in all the panels of fig 7 unbiased r ranges from 0 87 to 0 91 and unbiased rmse ranges from 0 033 to 0 39 the differences of r and rmse among different satellites and among training validation and prediction are negligible which indicates that the conv model is stable moreover the quality of sm in the conv model fig 7c f and i is largely improved compared with mlp sm fig 5 for all the three satellite products fig 8 presents the validation of conv sm against ismn data and the ismn data is totally outside of the 43 stations that are used to train the conv model the unbiased r between predicted conv sm and the 65 station sm is 0 83 0 82 and 0 80 for fy3c fig 8a smap fig 8b smos fig 8c and the corresponding unbiased rmse is 0 041 0 043 and 0 046 the r values are higher than those of mlp sm fig 6 regardless of ascending and descending orbits the rmse values are also smaller than those of mlp sm this indicates that outside of the training area the conv model can also reduce the errors because the ismn data is from three different networks the validation is also conducted separately for the three networks it is found that the conv model performs very well at the network fig 8m p near the training area but the sample size is very small at this network the conv model is generally well at the network to the north of 40 n but the worst at the network over south korea this probably because most of the training stations are inland but the networks over south korea near the shore the results of the three different networks are also validated for the mlp model figures are provided in the supplementary materials and compared with the results of the conv model the similar result can be found that the errors are generally smaller in conv sm than mlp sm at each network 3 3 pattern relationship with precipitation the pattern relationship between sm and precipitation is explored because precipitation is the major force of daily surface sm therefore the major pattern of sm should reflect that of precipitation and present the similar pattern based on this conception the eof analysis subsection 2 2 3 is firstly conducted for precipitation during may september during 2015 2020 to obtain the first two major patterns of the precipitation fig 9 the first pattern eof1 explains 10 66 of the total variance and the second eof2 explains 8 08 due to the daily data is used the explanation of the total variances is small for the first two eof patterns which generally present the daily rainfall patterns over eastern china during may september in fig 9a eof1 shows a uniformly anomalous rainfall band from southwest to northeast between 22 n and 32 n the anomalies outside of this band present the opposite sign and have weak amplitude eof1 shows that rainfall anomalies mainly fluctuate over the region between 22 n and 32 n where is mainly controlled by the monsoon rain band and subtropical high alternately in fig 9b a seesaw pattern is in eof2 that negatively anomalous rainfall is around 22 n but positively anomalous rainfall is around 30 n this indicates that when daily rainfall increases around 22 n it decreases around 30 n and vice versa as surface sm is generally forced by rainfall the pattern relationship between sm and precipitation should reflect the major rainfall patterns fig 9 thus svd is conducted between sm and precipitation during may september of 2015 2020 and shown in figs 10 and 11 the heterogeneous maps of the correlation coefficients for svd1 are presented in fig 10 and those patterns reflect relationships of the most occurrence between sm and precipitation the precipitation is the cmorph data and sm is the mlp and conv sm for fy3c smap and smos sm without mlp is not analyzed because of its spatiotemporal discontinuity a pair of heterogeneous maps between precipitation and mlp sm of the ascending orbit of fy3c is presented in fig 10a and b fig 10a shows the correlation coefficients between the precipitation data and the pc1 of sm in svd and fig 10b shows those between the sm data and the pc1 of precipitation in svd the pcs in svd are time variations of their corresponding svd patterns in fig 10a and b the explanation of the total covariance is 53 07 and the correlation coefficient of the pcs between sm and precipitation is 0 54 in fig 10c and d the svd1 between precipitation and mlp sm of the descending orbit of fy3c explains 47 96 of the total covariance and the correlation coefficient between the pcs is 0 51 svd1 for mlp sm of both the ascending and descending orbits of fy3c shows the very similar patterns a seesaw pattern is for the rainfall that when the rainfall increases around 25 n it decreases around 35 n fig 10a and c meanwhile sm increases over small areas between 25 n and 30 n but decreases over the remaining regions especially to the north of 35 n fig 10b and d when the rainfall decreases around 25 n the opposite patterns can be found in both precipitation and sm for the svd1 between mlp sm and precipitation for smap fig 10g j and smos fig 10m p the precipitation and sm show the similar pattern that anomalies with opposite signs over the southern and northern parts of eastern china and the strength of the anomalies is strong over the northern part svd1 for mlp sm of smap and smos generally explains about 40 of the total covariance and correlation coefficients between the pcs range from 0 65 to 0 77 for all the three satellites the svd1 patterns for the mlp sm are different from that of the eof1 pattern of precipitation fig 9a especially over the northern part of the eastern china though some similarity can be found with the eof2 pattern of precipitation fig 9b this indicates that mlp sm cannot reflect the first major pattern that forced out by rainfall and thus the original satellite sm also cannot for conv sm the similar distributions can be found for both sm and precipitation in svd1 for fy3c fig 10e and f smap fig 10k and l and smos fig 10q and r when positive anomalies of both rainfall and sm are between 22 n and 32 n weakly negative anomalies can be found to the north of 30 n except the regions to the east of 115 e and vice versa moreover except for fy3c the explanation of the covariances are increased and ranges from 47 91 to 54 16 but the correlation between pcs is decreased the correlation coefficients between the pcs are around 0 5 the svd1 patterns of both precipitation and sm are generally similar to those of the eof1 for precipitation this means that conv sm can reflect the first major pattern that forced out by rainfall for svd2 fig 11 the explanation of total covariances and correlation coefficient deceases in the conv sm but the patterns of conv sm are very similar to that of the eof2 of precipitation in svd2 the similar findings can be obtained that the mlp sm cannot reflect the force of the eof2 pattern of rainfall but the conv sm can though the spatial pattern is correct its time variation may not therefore to further prove that conv sm can reflect the time variations of the major patterns that forced out by the rainfall table 2 shows the correlation coefficients between the pcs of precipitation eof and pcs of the svd analysis because the pcs mainly reflect the time variations of the major rainfall patterns and the patterns that sm and precipitation correlates with each other the correlation coefficients can reflect the relationships between eof and svd patterns the correlation coefficients between pc1 in eof and pc1s of precipitation in svd range from 0 34 to 0 63 while svd is conducted between precipitation and mlp sm for the three satellites for conv sm those correlation coefficients are increased to about 0 85 moreover the correlation coefficients between pc1 in eof and pc1s of sm in svd are also increased to about 0 40 by the conv model this indicates that conv sm enhances the connections between rainfall and sm in terms of the first major pattern on the other hand the correlation coefficients between pc2 of eof and pc1s of svd are decreased by the conv model meanwhile those between pc1 of eof and pc2s of svd are also decreased by the conv model however those between pc2 of eof and pc2s of svd are increased by the conv model except for the correlation between pc2 in eof and pc2 in svd for smap in general mlp sm cannot clearly reflect the major force of rainfall in terms of its first two eofs but the conv sm can in the other words the pattern relationship indicates that the conv model can improve the quality of satellite sm that enhances the physical relationships between rainfall and sm data mlp sm mainly reflects the characteristics of satellite products because both the errors and signals inherit from the satellite products and the conv model to a certain extent corrects the satellite products based on in situ observations from the pattern relationship between precipitation and sm it is found that the satellite sm products could not correctly reflect the major variation of sm patterns associated with rainfall over eastern china the conv model using limited number of stations 43 over eastern china produces sm with reasonable major patterns that similar to the major rainfall force thus correction based on ground based data is needed for the satellite products before its application in a specific region for climate research based on daily sm products or unreliable results could be achieved more ground based data is needed for further studies which can improve the performance of the conv model 4 discussions lack of reliable spatiotemporally continuous data hinders the research on large space regions nowadays various input features and architectures of dl are applied widely to achieve sm data early studies used satellite data of visible infrared imaging radiometer and gravimetric sm over china to obtained spatial continuous data zhang et al 2017 the using of gravimetric sm as input features over a large region can provide well spatial variation results but gravimetric method cannot provide daily continuous values at the same site some studies use dl model to predict sm at the sites of ground stations to obtain temporal continuous data e g fang et al 2017 fang and shen 2020 elsaadani et al 2021 li et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 and the obtained data has temporal continuity but not spatial to obtain spatiotemporal continuity many other studies use dynamic outputs as targets to train dl models to get sm data lee et al 2019 klingmüller and lelieveld 2021 li et al 2021 however model outputs or reanalysis already have errors thus the present study suggested a two step method that uses the first step to obtain spatiotemporal continuity and second step to reduce errors due to the limitation of station numbers the unbiased errors are reduced notably but the biases are only improved around the training stations further discussions are provided as follows 4 1 sensitivity of the dl models to the input features the dl models are mainly based on data driven approach although structure of the model is fixed different input features lead to the changes in coefficients in the model which may result in changes in the outputs in the present study the features chosen are following an idea that variables associated with the land surface energy and water balance affected less by sm and being relatively reliable in the reanalysis near the surface dlr and dsr are the major energy source t2 is associated with the thermal flux and u10 and v10 are related to the momentum fluxes precipitation is the major water source for surface sm the static variables of lc types directly affect land surface fluxes and soil properties determine the soil water capacity and drainage the other atmospheric variables impacting sm are not considered in the dl models for example evaporation upward long and short wave radiation land surface temperature etc those variables influence sm but also highly related to sm in the reanalysis system although there are also sm atmosphere interactions between the selected atmospheric features and sm this is not considered in the present study the selected input features are reminiscent of inputs of a dynamical land model but without the variables that send out by the land surface while the sensitivity of inputs to a model is examined dl model is very different from the dynamic and linear regression model when the input features changed the physical laws are not changed in a dynamic model and the linear least squares rule is not changed in a linear regression model in those models it is relatively easy to explore the sensitivity of input features and provide explanations in the data driven dl model though the structure of a model is fixed the rules in the model are still changed with the input features and targets and what rules learnt by dl model are unable to trace unpredictable and even unknown in a dynamic model if a variable is removed from the physical equations several physical processes are removed and it is relatively easy to trace and understand the removed processes in a linear regression model if a variable is removed it is easy to explain the variance changed by this variable however if a feature is removed in a dl model the model tries their best to find out the useful information provided by the removed feature from the remaining features during this process the rules are changed to shrink the differences between features and targets therefore the dl model may be not sensitive to a feature because the model may figure it out from other features which does not mean that the removed feature that directly provides useful information is not important on the other hand if the model cannot figure it out which means the remaining features do not have information of the removed feature or the model structure does not have the ability to retrieve the same information from the remaining features the more complex structure the model has the more complicated and difficult the sensitivity is to be explained generally the sensitivity of a dl model to an input feature is different from dynamical and linear regression models and thus we put the sensitivity part in the discussions in the following we present the sensitivity of mlp fig 12 and conv models to an input feature respectively however we are not going to provide further discussions and explanations because those may change with model structure and different feature combinations in fig 12 sensitivity of the mlp model to each input feature is examined it is found that almost all the features can improve r2 decreases and rmse increases or do not change the results of the mlp model when a feature is removed except the soil properties for fy3c sm in descending orbit all the panels in fig 12 present that lc types can notably affect the results of mlp model for the conv model figures presented in the supplementary materials though some common characteristics are found that the outputs are sensitivity to lc types in the test dataset different results are obtained using the ismn data for validation it is really difficult to provide a reasonable explanation for the sensitivity of the dl models which needs to understand and trace the processes in the model so far it is better to just use the dl models as a tool to obtained better sm data for further studies in the physical world 4 2 failed to improve biases compared with the dynamic model the dl models cannot predict circumstance that they never learned this means that if the values of an input feature are out of the value range of training those values may cause differences between model results and observations in fig 7b c e f h and i the biases between conv and observed sm are negligible at the 43 stations and thus they are not shown however the biases between conv and ismn sm are very large and no better than mlp sm figures not shown this is because that the mean state of conv sm is highly sensitive to the static variables which is noted during our trail and test the conv is trained against sm of the 43 stations which have small number of lc types and soil properties they are not large enough to train the conv model to predict accurate mean state over a large region with various static characteristics for the atmospheric variables their variations are large enough at the 43 stations and thus the unbiased r and rmse are improved in conv sm compared with mlp sm no matter that the model results are validated against the 43 station or ismn sm to further present biases of the satellite products the spatial distributions of mean sm of ascending and descending orbits with and without mlp and that predicted by the conv model are further compared fig 13 in fig 13a l the distributions for sm with and without mlp of the same satellite show the very similar patterns and the differences are only among different satellite products conv sm fig 13m o exhibits different distributions compared with those without conv fig 13a l in fy3c sm without conv fig 13a d g j and m is small to the south of the yangtze river and along the huang river but large over the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and along the coastlines in fig 13m the conv sm is large to the south of 25 n and over the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and small around 27 n and over the lower reaches of the huang river in smap the sm without conv fig 13b e h and k is large to the south of 32 n but small to the north the distribution of the conv sm in smap fig 13n is similar to that of fy3c fig 13m but soil is wetter in smos sm without conv fig 13c f i l and o is large over the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river but small along the southeast coastline and to the north of 32 n the distribution of the conv sm in smos fig 13o is also similar to those of fy3c and smap fig 13m and n but the soil is drier although the same conv model is used the different input features of the satellite products still yield different results which mainly relate to the characteristics of each satellite product for the sm without conv all the satellite products present large sm over the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river but outside of this region large differences are among the three satellite products after correction by the conv model it is found that the distributions of mean sm are different from those of the sm without conv especially over the northern part of eastern china compared with the conv sm the sm without conv has small values over this region the conv model shows that sm is large over the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and to the south of 25 n and sm is small over the remaining regions for the conv sm the soil in smap is the wettest among the three satellite and the soil in smos is drier than that in fy3c this property generally inherits from mlp sm the large difference between sm with and without conv is over northern part of eastern china that the conv sm is larger than that without conv this is because the conv model is not trained with enough static features over northern china however except the 43 stations there is no extra data for further validation over those regions in the present study if enough stations with various static features are provided the conv model can give a better prediction on the mean state 4 3 other aspects compared sm with and without mlp the data quality improves in terms of unbiased r and rmse on one hand the mlp model learns the characteristics of the satellite products but mlp sm inherits both signals and errors from the satellite products on the other hand atmospheric and static land variables are used to build relationship with sm and thus the mlp model can learn some physical rules between those variables and sm therefore the mlp sm still has errors that succeed from the satellite products but the mlp model also drives the sm to follow certain rules associated with atmospheric and static land variables which maybe the reason for the quality improvement of mlp sm however the dl method likes a black box and it is difficult to trace what rules have been learnt when conv is conducted the data needs continuity on the dimensions that conv is performed on and missing value is not allowed for the conv model 2d conv needs spatial continuity and 1d conv need temporal continuity in the present study 1d conv is taken on the data sampled by a 51 day sliding window it is analogy to take the 51 day time series as an image with multiple channels and conv is conducted on this 1d image to learn sm variation in 51 days the 2d conv on 2d maps is another way to reduce errors but we didn t use it in the present study this is because presently we want to establish a conv model that is applicable on any grid cell of the satellite and the relationships and physical rules are only happened on this grid cell which is less complicate than the 2d conv 2d conv is mostly image processing on 2d maps which can reflect relationships among grid cells and also embrace physical rules but it is more complicate than 1d conv for understanding in addition the boundary between land and ocean is needed to be processed the errors of satellite products are inevitable and can be produced during scanning microwaves from the earth and postprocessing for example eastern china suffers from the severe illegal l band radio frequency interference contamination which can disturb the observations on smap and smos with l band devices during the postprocessing of fy3c products the sm values 0 5 are artificially set to 0 5 which brings very large errors to this product that when the values 0 5 is considered in the evaluation very poor quality is found for fy3c product although the errors of satellite products can be reduced by the dl models dl is not as perfect as we expected the dl models are sensitive to the input features and sample size of the data in the present study there is a problem that the grid cells of satellite products and atmospheric variables and static land variables are not match with each other interpolation is conducted and may cause errors for dl for the in situ station data the sample size is still too small that it cannot include all kinds of land types soil properties and even weather conditions moreover the in situ sm does not spread all over the eastern china the dl model cannot predict the situation that has not happened and if this situation occurs the prediction maybe wrong this means that there are still uncertainties of the results of the conv model outside of the 43 stations which needs extra data and further studies however we can foresee the great potential of dl for predicting spatiotemporally seamless sm products based on satellite data with errors reduced efficiently 5 conclusions two dl models of neural networks are used to obtain spatiotemporally seamless sm with errors being reduced on daily time interval based on the satellite products in ascending and descending orbits of fy3c smap and smos the first dl model is the mlp model which builds the relationship between satellite sm and atmospheric and static land variables as long as there are valid values of the atmospheric and static land variables on a grid cell of a satellite the mlp model can predict the sm value on this grid cell using fitted coefficients trained by the model therefore spatiotemporally seamless sm in the ascending and descending orbits of a satellite is achieved through mlp the mlp model has a stable performance during training and validation for all the three satellite products the predicted mlp sm generally has the same spatial distribution as that of sm without mlp moreover compared with in situ sm mlp also improves the data quality that unbiased r increases and unbiased rmse decreases for the sm with and without mlp smap has the best quality among the three satellites and smos is generally better than fy3c the second dl model is the conv model and conv is a powerful and sophisticated tool for image processing using the 1d conv model mlp sm is corrected against in situ sm the mlp sm from all the three satellites is corrected notably by the conv model the unbiased r reaches to about 0 89 and rmse decreases to about 0 035 after the errors are corrected by the conv model the differences of the quality between the three satellite products are negligible in terms of the total statistics similar results can be found through applying a different data source of ismn that both the mlp and sm quality is improved in terms of unbiased r and rmse however except over the region with the 43 stations the biases are not improved during the validation outside of the training region using ismn data besides the mean state the anomalous patterns of sm related to precipitation are also examined and reflect variations of sm anomalies it is found that sm without conv cannot reflect the major patterns of precipitation over eastern china which are uniformly anomalous rainfall band over the southern part of eastern china and a seesaw pattern between 25 n and 30 n however the conv sm can reflect the major patterns of precipitation and the pattern relationship is increased notably compared to mlp sm one may think the improvement of the pattern relationship between sm and precipitation is because that the precipitation is used as input features of the conv model it should be noted that the same precipitation is also used as input features of the mlp model but mlp sm cannot well reflect the major patterns of the precipitation at last no matter the mlp or conv model dl mainly makes the input data to fit the target variable in the other words mlp sm is close to satellite products and conv sm is close to in situ observations thus the three satellite products cannot well reflect the connections between sm and precipitation which suggests a carefully examination and correction of those data before their climatic application and this study presents that dl can be the powerful tool for this purpose reliable data is a good start for the research on large scale interactions between sm and the atmosphere in the pattern relationship we can see that the patterns of conv sm are closer to the pattern of precipitation than the mlp sm but the strength of the relationship is weakened this may relate to complicate land atmosphere interactions that sm is not only affected by precipitation and also has feedbacks to the atmosphere declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this research was funded by the

top panels smap middle panels and smos bottom panels the figures for the rest of the dates are provided in the supplementary materials for the satellite sm products without mlp sm of the ascending orbit is shown in fig a1a e and i the first column and that of the descending orbit is shown in fig a1c g and k the third column sm outside of the orbits has invalid value and in the orbits sm of the three satellite products also has missing values on some grid cells those grid cells are filled with white color it is noted that the values 0 5 are set to missing value for fy3c fig a1a and c for the sm without mlp the soil is dry around 25 n and 35 n and wet around 30 n in fy3c fig a1a and c in smap fig a1e and g the soil is dry to the north of 32 n but wet to the south in smos fig a1i the soil is generally dry around 35 n and to the south of 25 n but wet around 30 n in the ascending orbit in the descending orbit fig a1j there is a wet band around 25 n from southwest to northeast and to the north and south of this band the soil is generally dry overall the three sm products generally exhibit wet soil over southern part of eastern china and dry soil over the northern part but show some differences on small spatial scales and to the south of 25 n after learning sm from atmospheric and static land variables against the satellite sm products on the grid cells with valid sm values sm on the grid cells with invalid and missing values can be predicted and filled with valid values on the maps fig a1b f j d h and l in the areas that can be scanned by the satellites the values of mlp sm and its distribution are generally similar to those without mlp over the areas outside of the orbits the mlp sm values fill all the grid cells and present the spatial continuity over the areas outside of the orbits of fy3c fig a1b and d the distribution is generally similar to that over the areas in the orbits but soil is dry around 30 n to the west of 110 e and wet along the coastlines to the south of 30 n for smap cross comparisons can be conducted between mlp sm of the ascending orbit fig a1f and sm without mlp of the descending orbit fig a1g as well as between mlp sm of the descending orbit fig a1h and sm without mlp of the ascending orbit fig a1e the distribution of mlp sm is almost the same as that without mlp in the orbits in smos the distributions of sm with and without mlp are generally the same in the areas covered by the satellite orbits however over the region to the west of 110 e and to the south of 25 n the sm with and without mlp in the orbits shows some differences that the dry fig a1i and j or wet fig a1k and l degrees are slight smaller in mlp sm this maybe because the daily atmospheric variables are used for mlp but the satellite products are instantaneous values moreover outside of the orbits mlp sm of the ascending orbit fig a1j is small but that of the descending orbit fig a1 l is large over the same region this may relate to different weather conditions in this region while the satellite tracks of different orbits are on different times in a day generally mlp can produce spatiotemporally continuous sm values that share the very similar spatial distribution with the satellite sm without mlp it is also found that the spatial distributions of sm over eastern china are different among different satellite products especially over the southern part of eastern china appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j jhydrol 2023 129308 appendix a supplementary data the

2133,deglaciation due to atmospheric warming has led to the formation and expansion of numerous glacial lakes especially in the eastern himalaya many of these glacial lakes are susceptible to glacial lake outburst floods glofs which can cause far reaching impacts on downstream infrastructure and livelihoods this study is a comprehensive assessment of glof susceptibility hazard exposure vulnerability and risk for four potentially dangerous glacial lakes bechung tsho raphstreng tsho thorthomi tsho and lugge tsho located in the lunana glacier complex of the phochu basin in bhutan exposure and risk assessments were based on modelled glof hydrodynamics infrastructure data population and housing census data among the four glacial lakes thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho are relatively more susceptible to outburst floods than raphstreng tsho and bechung tsho outflow flood volumes from these lakes range between 6 105 and 3 108 m3 which can potentially impact over 16 000 people two hydropower projects numerous other infrastructures and agricultural land up to 150 km downstream of the lakes the glof exposed elements are largely in punakha and wangdue phodrang districts which are located 90 and 100 km downstream of the lunana glacier complex respectively among 17 subdistrict blocks within the basin one lunana lies in a very high glof risk area while 9 others are in the high glof risk zone the study highlights the importance of multi source data in improving the knowledge of downstream glof risk and serves as a base for improving glof risk reduction strategies in high mountain regions 1 introduction glacial lakes can be potential hazard sources as outburst floods originating from these lakes can cause far reaching damage to infrastructure and people allen et al 2015 zheng et al 2021b glacial lakes are often dammed by unstable moraine or glacier ice and are surrounded by destabilizing permafrost slopes or hanging glaciers otto 2019 richardson and reynolds 2000 slope failure originating in the vicinity of a glacial lake can result in a mass movement that can enter a lake capable of displacing the lake s water creating an impulse wave that overtops the frontal dam the instability of slopes and glacial lakes are further aggravated in young and seismically active alpine mountains armbruster et al 1978 such as himalaya where hazard chains cascades are common kirschbaum et al 2019 sharma et al 2022 the rapid expansion of glacial lakes resulting from glacier retreat increases the exposure of the lakes to glacial lake outburst flood glof triggers from the surrounding catchment where slopes are destabilized due to permafrost degradation making it more susceptible to slope failures and rockfalls grämiger et al 2017 in addition as lakes grow depending on the basin geometry the risk of overtopping failures may increase thus lake growth increases the probability of glofs being triggered rounce et al 2017 2016 and increases the potential flood volume fujita et al 2013 which are among the main factors contributing to increased glof hazard westoby et al 2015 these intrinsic and extrinsic hazard drivers can cause largely unpredictable rapid and deadly draining of lake water which may transform into debris or hyper concentrated flow as the flood entrains sediment richardson and reynolds 2000 sattar et al 2022 since glofs are high magnitude and largely unpredictable catastrophic events they can cause immense damage and disruption to the lives and infrastructures in the downstream settlements allen et al 2015 carey et al 2011 zheng et al 2021b it is estimated that 15 million people globally are exposed to the threat of glof with populations in high mountain asia the most exposed with around 1 million people living within 10 km of a glacial lake taylor et al 2023 numerous glof events have occurred in the past across the world causing damage to infrastructures and the loss of thousands of lives carrivick and tweed 2016 veh et al 2022 for example the jinweng co glof event in 2020 in the southeastern tibetan plateau destroyed ten residential houses washed away eight bridges and 43 9 km of road also causing damage to several other structures and agricultural land zheng et al 2021b in 2013 the debris flow resulting from chorabari lake combined with cloud burst induced landslides and flooding in the indian state of uttarakhand caused over 6 000 deaths and heavy damage to infrastructure allen et al 2015 in the peruvian cordillera blanca glofs in 1941 and 1945 killed over 6 000 people washed away 35 of huaraz city and other essential infrastructures including hydroelectric power stations carey et al 2011 bhutan alone has recorded at least 18 glof events since the 1950s the latest being the breaching of subsidiary lake ii of thorthormi tsho on 20 june 2019 gurung et al 2017 komori et al 2012 national center for hydrology and meteorology nchm 2019b rinzin et al 2021 at least seven of these past glof events in bhutan have caused varying degrees of infrastructure damage and loss of lives in the downstream settlements the most serious was the 1994 glof event of lugge tsho amongst best known contemporary glof events in the himalaya veh et al 2019b which led to around 21 fatalities seriously damaged punakha dzong the capital administrative center of bhutan and around 90 houses komori et al 2012 rinzin et al 2021 watanbe and daniel 1996 all these tragic and disastrous past glof experiences underpin the need for systemic flood disaster risk reduction drr activities for which detailed downstream glof hazard and risk assessment provides the necessary first step glofs often involve a cascade of different processes variably termed a process chain or hazard cascade mergili et al 2020 zheng et al 2021b which can increase the spatial reach and destructive power of the event sattar et al 2022 in the himalaya glofs frequently start with rapid mass movement into the lake often due to slope failure from the mountain flank above the lake leading to displacement waves overtopping the dam komori et al 2012 nie et al 2018 the overtopping waves cause moraine dam incision and dam failure resulting in a sudden discharge of lake water as the flood propagates farther downstream it transforms into debris flow and hyper concentrated or secondary debris flow depending on the geologic and topographic characteristics of the river channel and available sediment gaphaz 2017 schneider et al 2014 westoby et al 2014 worni et al 2014 these complex glof process chains present manifold challenges to accurately capturing its physical characteristics by numerical modelling and to a growing extent the whole hazard cascade however emerging models can either better represent phase changes or sediment laden events and their application to past events has increasingly enabled a better understanding of glofs some examples of commonly employed mass movement models include ramms christen et al 2010 r avaflow mergili et al 2017 iber bladé et al 2014 flow3d flow science 2012 d claw iverson and george 2014 and primarily for clear water floods hec ras ceiwr hec 2021 two or more of these models can be combined appropriately to model each process chain separately and sequentially frey et al 2018 schneider et al 2014 worni et al 2014 or the entire process chain can be integrated into a single model framework mergili et al 2017 however due to computation cost and uncertainty of input parameters for practical application of numerically sophisticated models westoby et al 2014 computationally less complex models like hec ras 2d are often used to capture first order hydrodynamics and impacts of glof maskey et al 2020 sattar et al 2021a sattar et al 2021b population and infrastructures continue to grow in glof prone areas despite the increasing threat from glofs allen et al 2022 carrivick and tweed 2016 taylor et al 2023 this is especially true for bhutan where most of the settlements national statistics bureau nsb 2018 and major hydropower projects the mainstay of the country s economy are concentrated along the glacier fed river valleys for example punatsangchu hydroelectric dams php i and ii are fed by meltwater from glaciers in the lunana region ministry of economic affairs moea 2021 although the positive trend in the frequency of glofs has decayed since the 1970s veh et al 2022 some studies have forecasted a 3 to 7 fold increase in glof hazard and downstream risk in the himalaya due to future deglaciation allen et al 2016 zheng et al 2021a the assessment at the global scale has pointed out that bhutan and nepal have the greatest national level economic impact from glof carrivick and tweed 2016 and in absolute normalized glof risk scores bhutan is ranked 13th in the world taylor et al 2023 the increasing glof threat coupled with growing downstream exposure merits an evaluation of systematic downstream risk combining glof hydraulics and population and census housing data while ample existing studies offer comprehensive information about the glof process chains and its effects on downstream communities frey et al 2018 kougkoulos et al 2018 sattar et al 2022 sattar et al 2021b schneider et al 2014 these studies have not included the social vulnerability due to which the glof downstream risk has remained far from being understood although allen et al 2016 have included the social vulnerability to evaluate glof downstream risk in the indian state of himachal pradesh the glof risk was evaluated based on the rough estimation of glof paths in a gis environment falling short of including glof hydraulics and intensity taylor et al 2023 assessed glof risk including exposure and vulnerability but for consistency used open access simplified data and assumptions for example populations within a 1 km buffer of river centerlines and glof reach as a fixed 50 km downstream of a lake lunana glacier complex located in the headwater of punatsangchu has five proglacial lakes of which four were reported to have high to very high outburst susceptibility in terms of both potential trigger mechanisms and flood volume nagai et al 2017 rinzin et al 2021 therefore for the first time this study offers a detailed glof risk assessment including underlying components of hazard vulnerability and exposure using multi source data including lake bathymetry openstreetmap and population and housing census data to improve confidence in the knowledge of glof susceptibility and downstream risk from these lakes this study is guided by the following three main objectives i to evaluate the potential glof hazard under different moraine breaching scenarios from the glacial lakes in the lunana glacier complex ii to identify the exposed population infrastructures and agricultural land in the valley and iii to conduct a detailed downstream risk assessment by considering socio economic factors along the potentially inundated areas of punatsangchu and phochu river basins 2 study area significance of the lunana glacier complex bhutan is a small landlocked country in the himalaya where the landscapes are largely dominated by rugged terrains and high mountains the himalaya stretch along the entire northern part of the country and host large reserves of glaciers a total of 1583 1487 km2 glaciers of which 219 951 km2 debris covered and 1364 536 km2 clean ice glaciers have been reported in the bhutan himalaya nagai et al 2016 bhutanese glaciers have undergone significant area and mass loss since the 1980s for example the glacier area shrunk by 23 3 0 9 during 1980 2010 bajracharya et al 2014 further between 2000 and 2020 glacier mass loss occurred at the rate of 0 47 m w e yr 1 higher than in other neighboring eastern himalayan 0 33 m w e yr 1 and nyainqêntanglha 0 46 m w e yr 1 regions hugonnet et al 2021 under the future global 1 5 c warming scenario the eastern himalaya where bhutan is located is projected to warm by 1 9 c which is predicted to cause a 60 of glacier mass loss by the end of 21st century kraaijenbrink et al 2017 region wide studies such as the himalayan scale nie et al 2018 high mountain asia wang et al 2020 and third pole zhang et al 2015 all have indicated that the eastern himalaya is one of the regions with the highest concentration of glacial lakes using high resolution alos prism and avnir 2 satellite imagery from 2006 to 2011 nagai et al 2017 documented 733 glacial lakes 83 6 km2 in the bhutan himalaya identified 226 lakes with positive potential flood volume pfv 0 04 33 7 106 m3 33 as having larger pfv 5 106 m3 and two with very large scale pfv 30 106 m3 a more recent inventory rinzin et al 2021 using sentinel 1 sentinel 2 and declassified corona kh 4 data reported 2574 156 63 7 9 km2 glacial lakes in 2020 from which 1118 82 92 km2 were classified as glacier fed lakes their inventory also revealed that bhutanese glacial lakes have expanded by 26 5 km2 17 since the 1960s rinzin et al 2021 further 65 lakes were found to have high outburst susceptibility based on multiple attributes such as lake area and the likelihood of mass movement into the lake rinzin et al 2021 the two inventories reported different numbers and statistics of glacial lakes in the bhutan himalaya due to differences in the approach and criteria employed in mapping glacial lakes and defining potentially dangerous glacial lakes however there is a common consensus that the phochu basin where the lunana glacier complex is located contains the largest proportion of glacial lakes and the majority of potentially dangerous glacial lakes pdgls for example rinzin et al 2021 reported the highest proportion 22 6 of glacier fed lakes in the phochu basin and identified it as the inland basin with the highest number of pdgls the two glacial lakes with larger scale potential flood volume identified by nagai et al 2017 are both located in the phochu basin likewise nearly half 8 of 17 pdgls in bhutan first identified by icimod mool et al 2001 and later verified by nchm 2019 are located in the phochu basin bhutan is a dense cluster of glacial lakes in the himalaya and the phochu basin is a global hotspot of potential glof risk taylor et al 2023 four proglacial lakes namely bechung tsho raphstreng tsho lugge tsho and thorthormi tsho in the lunana glacier complex of phochu basin in the bhutan himalaya were selected for detailed glof susceptibility evaluation and downstream hazard and risk assessment fig 1 these four glacial lakes are the primary source of water for the phochu river which coalesces with mochu and forms punatsangchu one of the biggest rivers in bhutan a first order hazard assessment had already revealed that all these lakes are highly susceptibility level higher than 0 8 or very highly susceptibility level higher than 0 6 susceptible to outburst flood rinzin et al 2021 the lunana glacier complex is also the catchment where at least three past glof events have been recorded since 1990 for example the most devastating 1994 glof from lugge tsho watanbe and daniel 1996 and the recent breaching of subsidiary lake ii of thorthormi tsho in july 2019 national center for hydrology and meteorology nchm 2019a although the artificial draining of thorthormi tsho initiated in 2008 reduced the lake water level by 5 m the lake is still deemed as highly dangerous nchm 2019b the investigation with persistent scatterer interferometry psi has revealed an unstable left moraine wall for thorthormi tsho and significant movement of the side moraine wall of lugge tsho wangchuk et al 2022 although assessment with psi by wangchuk et al 2022 has found no significant movement of the thin side moraine between thorthormi tsho and raphstreng tsho a detailed field investigation in 2019 has reported active sliding of this thin side moraine nchm 2019a suggesting a threat of a future cascading flood from thorthormi tsho and raphstreng tsho lunana the only community dwelling within the proximity of glaciers in bhutan is located about 5 20 km away from these glacial lakes punakha dzong the former capital with significant cultural heritage is situated at the confluence of phochu and mochu about 90 km downstream punatsangchu basin also hosts the two largest hydroelectric projects punatsangchu hydroelectric project php i 1200 mw and ii 1020 mw at 110 and 125 km downstream respectively which are expected to be commissioned soon moea 2021 taylor et al 2023 state that the punatsangchu catchment is the 4th most at risk from glof catchments in the world located along the phochu and punatsangchu riverbanks there are also two district capital towns khuruthang town 90 km downstream for punakha and bajo town 100 km downstream for wangdue phodrang districts this high glof potential combined with high downstream exposure means that investigating the hazard and risk status becomes critically important fig 1 3 data and method 3 1 remote sensing and field data declassified satellite data corona kh 4 and kh 9 were used to manually digitize glacier and glacial lake boundaries in the 1960s and 1970s respectively table 1 to correct the image distortion of corona and hexagon data the co registration using ground control points from sentinel 2 imagery was performed see rinzin et al 2021 a landsat series tm etm and oli were used to map glacial lakes and glaciers from 1990 to 2020 advanced land observing satellite alos phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar palsar dem with 12 5 m spatial resolution was used as a source of terrain information for the glof routing we modified terrain data along the river flow path by adding a line vector and cutting a channel through the artificial flood plain using the terrain modification tool in the ras mapper see supplementary material for detail the alos palsar dem was also used to map the lake surrounding topographic potential for ice and rock avalanching and steepness of the moraine dam the bathymetry data for three glacial lakes bechung tsho rapshtreng tsho and lugge tsho in the lunana glacier complex were collected during the field expedition from 15 september to 20 october 2021 a hummingbird 999si combo echo sounder with an inbuilt global positioning system was used to collect the bathymetry data the echo sounder transmits sound waves coupled with coordinate information into the lake bottom and records the returning echoes on a sonar chart with depth information the lake depth data collected along the transverse transects were interpolated to the entire lake surface the field measured lake bathymetry was used to calculate the flood breach volume and determine the bed topography of the lakes we used the hindu kush himalaya scale landsat based land cover data of 2018 from icimod to quantify the area of agricultural land inundated by the modelled glof icimod 2021 the same data was also used to derive pixel based manning s n value for flood routing we used time series of land ice velocity and elevation its live gardner et al 2019 to calculate the flow velocity of glaciers the glacier mass loss was calculated using the global scale glacier mass loss dataset available at a 1 1 grid scale hugonnet et al 2021 the global scale consensus ice thickness datasets and corresponding surface dem farinotti et al 2019 were also used to calculate glacier bed overdeepening and determine future glacial lake extent openstreetmap data was used to count the number of buildings exposed to the multiple glof scenarios modelled in the study data as of 15 june 2022 bhutan population and housing 2017 census data were used to determine the social vulnerability level of the exposed population nsb 2018 the 2020 livestock statistics from the ministry of agriculture and forestry bhutan renewable natural resources statistics division rnr sd 2020 were used to quantify the number of livestock exposed to the hazard from glofs the granularity of these data will be further discussed below 3 2 glacial lake outburst susceptibility assessment the glof susceptibility assessment for the lakes in the lunana glacier complex was performed based on a total of 18 conditioning and triggering factors broadly categorized into atmospheric cryospheric geotechnical and geomorphic factors after gaphaz 2017 see supplementary table s1 each factor was either observed or quantified using the presented data including remote sensing dem and field observation the topographic potential of the surrounding slopes for landslide rockfall and ice snow avalanche slope greater than or equal 30 and run out trajectory slope greater than or equal to 14 were mapped using a gis based modelling approach allen et al 2019 romstad et al 2008 fig 2 steep lakefront area sla depression angle 10 from the flat lake surface which provides information on the steepness of the moraine dam was computed following the approach of fujita et al 2013 hydrological characteristics such as total area of catchment and stream density were calculated from alos palsar dem other attributes such as calving potential which require finer resolution observation were validated based on expert interpretation of google earth imagery and field photos fig 3 the parent glacier extent was vectorized by modifying rgi v6 0 glacier outlines rgi consortium 2017 and through our expert observation in a false color composite of landsat series imagery oli tm and etm for 1990 2020 corona kh 4 for the 1960s and hexagon kh 9 for the 1970s the same scenes were also used for digitizing the glacial lake boundaries manually the glacier bed overdeepenings as an indicator of future lake extent were calculated by subtracting glacier ice thickness from the surface dem farinotti et al 2019 following linsbauer et al 2016 based on the degree to which these factors can condition or trigger a glof from a given lake inferred through either expert judgment or calculated value the above factors were classified into high medium and low susceptibility levels allen et al 2022 gaphaz 2017 with the corresponding score of 3 2 1 respectively the total glof susceptibility score of the lake was calculated as the sum of scores across all factors the susceptibility score was finally used to compare the relative outburst susceptibility level of the four lakes considered here 3 3 dam breach and glof routing hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras v 6 0 a 2 dimensional 2d dam breach model was used to simulate a series of potential glof events from the lakes in the lunana glacier complex although limited to clear water flow assumptions hec ras has been widely used for hydrodynamic modelling of glof in the himalaya such as in nepal khanal et al 2015 sattar et al 2021b tibetan plateau wang et al 2015 india sattar et al 2021a and bhutan maurer et al 2020 osti et al 2013 the model solves the 2d saint venant equation to calculate the unsteady flow hydraulics of glofs ceiwr hec 2021 the sine wave progression breach model was employed where initial breach forms slowly and with a further gradual incision the outflow velocities and shear stress change which leads to an increase in the outflow discharge sattar et al 2021b for the majority of moraine dammed lakes the outburst events are caused by displacement waves from mass movement followed by accompanying breach development and dam break gaphaz 2017 therefore we assumed that the dam breach was instigated by overtopping due to the mass movement into the lake with subsequent dam incision and degradation leading to the outburst event in hec ras this is implemented with the dam failure mode considered as overtopping where dam breach starts at the top of the dam and progresses toward the base of the moraine as erosion occurs ceiwr hec 2021 breach parameters like breach width and formation time for each glof scenario were calculated using froehlich 1995 eqs 1 and 2 this set of equations has been used previously in calculating breach parameters for glof modelling anacona et al 2015 sattar et al 2021b wang et al 2015 1 b w 0 1803 k 0 v w 0 32 h b 0 14 2 t f 0 00254 v w 0 53 h b 0 9 where bw is breach width tf is breach formation time vw is breach volume and hb is breach height for the forward modelling a series of 12 glof scenarios were simulated considering large moderate and small magnitude events originating from each lake bechung tsho raphstreng tsho thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho for each simulation a unique set of parameters were considered breach width bw breach formation time tf and breach volume vw and breach height hb while keeping the downstream valley geomorphology and river hydrological conditions constant for most past glof events in the himalaya it is unlikely that the entire moraine fails in case of an outburst event maurer et al 2020 veh et al 2019a therefore for the high magnitude glof scenario routing we constructed lake breach models assuming hb starting at the crest of the dam down to the mean depth of the lakes calculated based on the field measured bathymetry the hb for the moderate magnitude is assumed to be half of the large magnitude hb likewise the small magnitude hb was calculated as half of the moderate magnitude breach volumes were calculated from the field bathymetries as the volume of the water above the lowest point of breaching following the conservative trend in the previous studies such as of sattar et al 2021b however owing to the lack of bathymetry data the vw for thorthormi tsho was calculated as the product of area and potential lowering height hp following equation 3 fujita et al 2013 hp is the anticipated water lowering height after sla is removed due to moraine dam failure fujita et al 2013 here it is worth noting that the glof was simulated as a clear water flood and did not account for the complex process chain of a glof such as debris loading from erosion and sediment deposition along the downstream channel we used pixel based manning s n value according to the latest landsat derived land use and land cover data lulc icimod 2021 depending on different classes of lulc the pixel based manning s n ranges from 0 035 to 0 120 3 pfv min h p d m a where pfv is potential flood volume hp is potential height lowering dm is the mean depth of the lake and a is a lake area we reconstructed the 1994 glof event of lugge tsho to understand the glof hydrodynamics in the punatsangchu basin before conducting the multi scenario modelling from the lakes in the lunana glacier complex there are limited field and eyewitness information on the 1994 glof event so we drew upon sparse data available in the previous literature to define essential input parameters and initial conditions for example the moraine dam breach height was set to 18 m based on the height estimated by fujita et al 2008 likewise the dam breach width was set to 105 m and the dam crest width to 28 m both of which were constrained by koike and takenaka 2012 combining field measurements and remote sensing observations fujita et al 2008 have estimated a glof volume of 17 2 5 3 106 m3 accordingly we simulated six scenarios of glof by changing flood volume between 15 106 and 20 106 m3 each time increasing by 1 million m3 and keeping all other initial breach parameters constant other essential information available for the 1994 lugge glof is the peak flow at wangdue phodrang hydrological station 1800 2500 m3 s yamada 2000 osti et al 2013 and flood wave arrival time at punakha through eyewitness 5 1 hr and estimated using seismometer 4 75 hr maurer et al 2020 watanbe and daniel 1996 so we measured peak flow at wangdue phodrang hydrological station and flood reach time at punakha 3 4 downstream risk assessment the risk from any disaster event is represented as a function of hazard exposure and vulnerability ipcc 2014 here glof modelling results were first translated into a hazard map in doing so the flow height from each scenario modelled glof was converted into two classes of intensity high intensity more than 1 m and medium intensity less than 1 m frey et al 2018 gaphaz 2017 later the hazard map was computed by combining these intensities with the probability of occurrence low medium and high corresponding to potential large moderate and small magnitude events respectively we combined intensity and probability maps by using the simple matrix approach gaphaz 2017 since all the lakes examined here are situated in the same basin and pose a threat to the downstream regions we evaluate the combined hazard for all four glacial lakes in the lunana glacier complex this final hazard map was created by initially producing four glof hazard maps one for each lake with three hazard levels given as high medium and low later a simple matrix technique was used to merge the individual lake s hazard map the combined hazard map is classified into four hazard levels very high when all four high hazard level from each lake intersects high when at least three high hazard level intersect or two high hazard level and two medium levels intersect medium at least two medium hazard level intersect and low when all low hazard levels intersect exposure is the presence of people livelihood environmental services and other infrastructure along the flood plain allen et al 2019 flood exposure calculation involves two components delineating the flood hazard map and the population structures livestock and agricultural land intersecting with that flood hazard map tate et al 2021 the openstreetmap data were used to quantify any buildings roads and bridges that intersect with the extent of flood hazard under different scenarios while there was good coverage of openstreetmap in our study area we manually updated 75 buildings based on high resolution google earth imagery to estimate the glof exposed population we divided the total population by the number of buildings in the 17 identified subdistrict blocks to roughly appraise the number of people per exposed building following kougkoulos et al 2018 the population data were extracted from bhutan population and housing census 2017 data nsb 2018 the same approach was used to calculate the total number of exposed livestock using bhutan s annual livestock statistics 2020 from the ministry of agriculture and forestry rnr sd 2020 the inundated agricultural land was delineated by overlaying glof extent on the 2018 landsat 8 based lulc icimod 2021 the exposure level for each subdistrict block was classified into three classes depending mainly on the number of exposed buildings as high more than 50 medium 10 50 and low up to 10 buildings with agricultural land road and bridge damage we identified buildings as highly important since their destruction often directly relates to human casualties during disasters like glof allen et al 2016 based on bhutanese population and housing census 2017 data 15 social vulnerability indicators and their values were selected representing a wide range of social and economic conditions of the people nsb 2018 table 2 here we did not differentiate the indicator into positive or negative dependence since we uniformly chose indicators with positive dependence where increasing indicator value increases vulnerability for example we chose the percentage of households without a car for the indicator household ownership of the car each indicator value of the subdistrict block table s2 was normalized to a value ranging from 0 low vulnerability to 1 high vulnerability with impartial weighting the individual vulnerability index vi of each subdistrict block was calculated as the average across all normalized scores the vulnerability index for each subdistrict block was also classified into very high 0 75 1 high 0 5 0 75 medium 0 25 0 5 and low 0 0 25 finally hazard vulnerability and exposure were combined using the simple matrix method to produce the risk level of each subdistrict block fig 2 here we treated hazard exposure and vulnerability equally and no weighting was used 4 results 4 1 outburst susceptibility of glacial lake the total glof susceptibility score sc for the thorthormi tsho sc 47 and lugge tsho sc 45 was comparatively higher than the bechung tsho sc 37 and raphstreng tsho sc 34 suggesting that the former two lakes have higher chances of producing glof than the latter two since all lakes are located within the small catchment 99 3 km2 they had uniform susceptibility scores of 8 resulting from atmospheric factors seven of the 18 susceptibility factors considered here were cryospheric factors with a total score of 17 thorthormi tsho had the highest susceptibility score from cryospheric factors followed by lugge tsho with 16 this high score is because firstly the likelihood of ice avalanche an important cryospheric factor was highest for the thorthormi tsho as its total area susceptible to avalanche 4 3 km2 is higher than other lakes almost by 10 fold likewise for the lugge tsho the meltwater ponds on the moraine indicated a possible degradation of the ice core or permafrost in its terminal moraine dam lugge tsho is also in direct contact with the parent glacier and has a calving front measuring up to 360 m fig 3 indicating the high possibility of impact from the calving the thorthormi glacier surface flow velocity 9 37 m a 1 especially in the lower terminus is almost 2 3 fold higher than other glaciers the other cryospheric factors such as frontal glacier retreat mass loss and lake expansion were also higher for thorthormi and lugge tsho fig 4 and supplementary table s1 additionally the modelling of glacier bed topography suggested that lugge tsho will expand up to 1 83 km2 11 6 supplementary fig s3 the total susceptibility scores across nine geotechnical and geomorphologic factors ranked lugge tsho with the highest glof susceptibility level followed by thorthormi tsho with a score of 23 and 20 respectively again this higher score is because most of the calculated values and expert judgment for these factors were in favour of lugge tsho and thorthormi tsho as discussed below all four glacial lakes in the luanna complex have the most imminent threat from probable mass movements from the surrounding slopes clearly visible in field photos fig 3 by comparison the total area susceptible to the mass movement for thorthormi tsho is 10 8 km2 which is 2 4 fold higher than other lakes making it relatively more susceptible to the impact of the mass movement supplementary table s1 the individual catchment area for the lake ranges from 11 8 46 2 km2 however owing to the largest catchment area 46 2 km2 and high stream order lugge tsho appears to be most exposed allowing us to assign higher scores for the lugge tsho supplementary table s1 likewise the field photos showed that thorthormi tsho s moraine dam width especially toward raphstreng tsho right side is very thin 30 40 m fig 3 on the other hand raphstreng tsho s moraine width is thick 500 m as observed in google earth high resolution imagery moraine damming bechung tsho seems very wide 700 m with a good vegetation cover seemingly the most stable among the lakes in the lunana glacier complex 4 2 glof discharge and hydraulics scenario modelling of the lakes in the lunana glacier complex the glacial lakes in the lunana glacier complex have potential flood volumes ranging from 6 105 to 3 108 m3 which could produce floods with a peak discharge of 200 76 000 m3 s thorthormi tsho has a comparatively higher glof magnitude than the other three lakes fig 5 the resulting peak flow mainly depends on the flood magnitude at the starting point and gradually decreases as the flood routes downstream for example peak flow from thorthormi tsho at lunana 10 km from the lunana glacier complex is 9000 55 000 m3 s while it decreases to 4200 20 000 m3 s when the flood arrives php ii about 125 km downstream fig 6 the flood from bechung is the smallest of all attenuating before reaching toedwang in punakha the first major settlement after lunana so the flood hydraulics hereafter is presented only for the other three lakes raphstreng tsho lugge tsho and thorthormi tsho unlike peak flow the disparities in inundation depth and velocity at different downstream sites were also influenced by the channel topography and flood plain fig 7 all 12 simulated glofs arrive at lunana which is about 10 km downstream between 0 5 hr thorthormi large scenario to 4 5 hr bechung small scenario table 3 and depth ranges between 1 m and 25 m while flow velocity is 3 14 m s 1 table 3 the nine glofs 3 each from raphstreng tsho lugge tsho and thorthormi tsho take 2 5 to 4 75 hr to reach punakha dzong and flow with a velocity of 4 7 8 0 m s 1 and flow depth of 6 9 27 8 m table 3 the flood arrival time increases to 3 0 6 0 hr as the floods arrive at wangdue phodrang hydrological station here due to the low gradient slope 0 02 flood path the floods flow with the minimum velocity 1 7 3 2 m s 1 while their depth becomes the maximum 8 0 29 2 m table 3 the flood proceeds farther downstream and arrives at php i within 4 0 to 8 25 hr with a flow velocity of 1 7 7 0 m s 1 and depth of 9 0 26 2 m table 3 taking around 4 5 10 5 hr the flood flows at 3 7 m s 1 at php ii while their depth ranges between 7 0 and 29 0 m table 3 the detailed flow velocity and arrival time across various stations along the river centreline is also indicated in fig 7 4 3 downstream hazard exposure and risk glof downstream risk was computed by combining hazard exposure and vulnerability fig 8 is the excerpt of the hazard map from lunana and wangdue phodrang the simulated flood up to 150 km downstream from the lakes in the lunana glacier complex showed that the flood would inundate about 42 8 km2 downstream area out of which 15 6 fall under the very high hazard zone while 42 4 14 5 and 27 4 fall in the high medium and low hazard levels respectively in terms of total land area lunana suffers the maximum 11 3 km2 inundation followed by toedwang 5 1 km2 subdistrict blocks were classified into different glof hazard units based on which hazard level map intersected with them lunana kazhi and toedwang lie in very high hazard level zones so three of them were classified as very high glof hazard level subdistrict blocks the 13 others overlap with the high hazard level map so these 13 were assigned high hazard levels only one nahi does not intersect with the hazard map given a zero hazard level fig 9 a the glof exposure assessment showed that the simulated clear water floods from the glacial lakes in the lunana glacier complex can cause substantial inundation to two hydropower projects php i and php i and numerous structures and agricultural land across different downstream sites the floods expose up to 2 721 buildings which convert to 16 062 people and 6 157 livestock besides 11 8 km2 of agricultural land 101 4 km of roads including highways farms and feeder roads and 71 bridges are also exposed to the different hazard levels of the simulated floods of the total only 4 buildings all in lunana 0 01 km2 of agricultural land and 4 bridges all in lunana were located within the very high hazard flood zone none of the roads fall within the very high hazard zone detail in table 4 these exposed structures and agricultural land were primarily located in the subdistrict blocks of wangdue phodrang and punakha districts about 80 100 km downstream of the lunana glacier complex for example the highest number of buildings are exposed in guma 753 followed by thedtsho 639 guma also suffers from the longest stretch 15 5 km of road inundation likewise dzomi is modelled to likely suffer maximum 2 1 km2 damage to agricultural land while the highest number of bridges 11 exposure would occur in rubisa table 4 although no road is exposed in lunana since it is only connected by non vehicle access 11 8 km of the footpath is being inundated there are however current plans to extend the road network towards lunana which will change exposure and risk for display purposes we classified exposure into high medium and low levels for each subdistrict block based on our classification approach see method 10 subdistrict blocks were classified as highly exposed while 3 athang rubisa and patshaling and 1 gase tshowongm were labeled as medium and low respectively the exposure level was zero for the other three including kazhi largyab and nahi since no structure or agricultural land intersects with the flood hazard map fig 9b the calculated normalized score for the social vulnerability index for the 17 subdistrict blocks ranges from 0 3 to 0 7 a total of six including lunana largyab dzomi kabisa nahi and kazhi had high vulnerability levels only gase tshowongm had a low vulnerability level while the other 10 exhibited medium level vulnerability fig 9c the risk assessment produced by combining hazard exposure and vulnerability revealed that only lunana gewog is located in a very high risk zone nine of the other subdistrict blocks lie in high risk categories and four are in the medium risk zone the remaining 3 kazhi largyab and nahi were classified as zero risk areas since they have zero exposure and hazard fig 9d 5 discussion 5 1 glacial lakes outburst susceptibility the comprehensive analysis of wide ranging cryospheric geotechnical and geomorphological factors showed that thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho are relatively more susceptible to glof than raphstreng tsho and bechung tsho this finding resonates well with the earlier glof susceptibility assessments undertaken in the bhutan himalaya the first order gis based susceptibility assessment by rinzin et al 2021 ranked thorthormi tsho as the most dangerous glacial lake in the bhutan himalaya also the detailed field investigation by nchm 2019a has reported active sliding of a thin moraine between thorthormi tsho and raphstreng tsho thus increasing the susceptibility to glof events in the future the comparatively higher velocity of the thorthormi glacier especially in the frontal area indicates active sliding of ice the same being identified as the likely cause of thorthormi subsidiary lake ii draining in 2019 according to nchm 2019a calving of ice into the lake would further increase its hydrostatic gradient and glof volume gaphaz 2017 rounce et al 2016 and calving activities can create displacement waves as the calved ice impacts the lake the high glof susceptibility of lugge tsho also relates well with the findings from the earlier studies nchm 2019a rinzin et al 2021 wangchuk et al 2022 this is evident as lugge tsho has produced the most catastrophic past glof events in the bhutan himalaya komori et al 2012 maurer et al 2020 there is evidence of multiple cases of glof events from the same lake in the himalaya e g cirenma co in the central himalaya produced three glofs in 1964 1981 and 1983 respectively wang et al 2015 such experience from the himalaya combined with the high glof susceptibility of lugge tsho suggests that glof occurrence in the future cannot be neglected and is a subject of further investigation it is also an actively growing glacial lake in the region with the potential to grow in the future linsbauer et al 2016 implying that it is likely to become more exposed with time to surrounding slope failure rounce et al 2017 rounce et al 2016 also thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho both being in contact with their parents glaciers means they would exacerbate the melting of the corresponding glacier through increasing mechanical calving activities and subaqueous melting which in turn would cause enhanced expansion of the lake through glacier lake interaction this interaction would make thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho more susceptible to glof while also increasing potential flood volume king et al 2018 2019 thus we highly recommend continuous monitoring of thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho nevertheless we cannot discount the glof susceptibility of raphstreng tsho and bechung tsho entirely since they also have one or more factors indicating high outburst susceptibility e g high potential flood volume of raphstreng tsho bechung tsho is also expected to grow in the future by expanding towards its upstream direction and can become more exposed to glof triggers like an avalanche and landslide rockfall in the future richardson and reynolds 2000 therefore attention might be needed to monitor raphstreng tsho and bechung tsho the nchm has reported an increasing temperature trend in bhutan since the 1990s there has been a decreasing trend in precipitation but bhutan experienced high precipitation variability over the same period dorji and tamang 2019 leading to numerous extreme weather events in bhutan nchm 2022 this increasing frequency of extreme precipitation dorji and tamang 2019 added to increasing temperature would further amplify the glof susceptibility level of glacial lakes in the lunana complex gaphaz 2017 however since all lakes are located in the same basin if the most dangerous glacial lakes are monitored e g thorthormi tsho and proper disaster management plans are implemented in the downstream settlement possible downstream damage from the floods from any lakes in the basin could be highly reduced 5 2 glof risk on downstream settlement our simulation of the 1994 glof by setting breach volume at 20 0 106 yielded a peak flow of 2 129 m3 s at wangdue phodrang within the range of estimated peak flow 1800 to 2500 m3 s of the 1994 glof at the same station osti et al 2013 likewise our simulated glof takes 4 4 hr to reach punakha which also relates well with the arrival time noted by eyewitnesses and the reconstructed arrival time 4 75 hr using a seismometer maurer et al 2020 simulations with varying breach times between 0 25 and 1 hr result in a significant difference in peak discharge at the dam but both arrival time and peak flow remain fairly consistent by the time the flood wave reaches punakha and wangdue phodrang supplementary fig s2 this model calibration with the glof events of 1994 in the same basin reasonably indicates that our model setup is suitable for modelling different scenarios of future glof for risk assessment purposes the study combines hazard exposure and vulnerability to determine the risk posed by the potentially dangerous lakes in the lunana glacier complex to the downstream region along the phochu and punatsangchu banks the study reaffirms the earlier studies such as osti et al 2013 and koike and takenaka 2012 that bhutanese people are inevitably highly exposed to the glof most of the modelled glofs 8 12 from the lakes produce a flood of magnitude higher than the 1994 glof of lugge tsho fujita et al 2008 maurer et al 2020 osti et al 2013 watanbe and daniel 1996 although there is no history of floods of such high magnitudes in bhutan with climate change induced deglaciation and cryospheric system change in the high mountains across the world in recent decades gaphaz 2017 these potential events in the future cannot be disregarded our results offer new insights into the impacts of large magnitude glof events in a typical basin in the himalaya our study showed that one among 17 subdistrict blocks lunana lies in the very high glof risk zone and 9 others in a high risk zone some of the villages in lunana like thanza village of lunana are located very close to the lakes in the lunana glacier complex just about 2 7 km the large and medium scenario glofs from thorthormi tsho take only 15 30 min to reach some part of lunana this also means that the lunana region is likely impact by all glof events with little warning suggesting high magnitude damage to the exposed structures most of which are not built with the concrete wall nsb 2018 the capacity to prepare for respond to and recover from such a disaster is challenging for lunana because of its remote location and high social vulnerability level the nine high risk subdistrict block clusters fig 9 are located in the punakha and wangdue phodrang districts about 80 100 km from the lunana glacier complex the long travel time for glof allows these subdistrict blocks to potentially have more warning time in a glof event even the large scenario glof from the thorthormi tsho takes about 2 5 and 3 hr to arrive in punakha and wangdue phodrang respectively table 2 but this is only possible if there is a flood early warning system installed along the riverbank and if authorities and communities are well trained in response procedures or it becomes entirely reliant on ad hoc community to community communication flood early warning instruments have been installed along the banks of phochu and punatsangchu nchm 2021 and continuous monitoring and maintenance of these instruments are highly recommended huggel et al 2020 however due to the high density of settlement the inundation of infrastructures including buildings and roads is very high in punakha and wangdue phodrang areas 85 of exposed buildings and 59 of the bridge are located within these nine subdistrict blocks table 4 our results suggest that the lunana subdistrict block needs the highest level of attention for glof disaster risk reduction also the farther downstream settlements in the punakha and wangdue phodrang districts such as guma and thedtsho need to be prioritized fig 9 investigations elsewhere in the world have revealed that eventual damage from disasters not only depend on the magnitude of the hazard glof intensity in this case but also on the social vulnerability level crucial for resilience preparedness and response capacity of the people cutter and finch 2008 flanagan et al 2018 similarly the importance of data from multiple sources glof hazard data sub district level socio economic condition and settlement density for the downstream glof risk assessment is clearly portrayed in this study gase tshogongm falls in a high hazard zone but with low vulnerability and exposure level so it has been classified as a medium glof risk subdistrict block likewise kazhi nahi and largyab have high social vulnerability and fall in a high glof hazard zone however all of them have zero exposure which allowed us to rule out the glof risk in these subdistrict blocks under current conditions these findings help us improve the glof risk knowledge in the punatsangchu and phochu basins which is an essential preliminary assessment for the implementation of an early warning system huggel et al 2020 and risk reduction prioritization the glof early warning system has been put in place by national centre for hydrology and meteorology and is mainly based on experience from the 1994 glof event of lugge tsho nchm 2021 by contrast our downstream risk assessment is based on the multiple glof scenario modelling results most of which have a higher magnitude than the 1994 glof event thus our result provides new insights for consolidating and improving the existing early warning system to this end this study is valuable for the comprehensive and careful design of glof risk management strategy both hard engineering schemes such as improving structural measures e g construction of flood retention walls identification of safe evacuation zone lowering lake levels and enhancing the response and recovery capacity e g glof risk advocacy programs training populations for glof evacuation in the affected downstream community 5 3 glof impact on the hydroelectric project punatsangchu basin hosts the two largest hydroelectric power projects php i 1200 mw and php ii 1020 mw both of which are at the advanced stage of construction moea 2021 with a cost estimate of 1 74 nu 133 20 billion usd for php i and 0 95 nu 72 9 billion usd for php ii these two projects are record high investment projects in bhutan in the latest inventory punatsangchu headwaters have a total of 180 glacial lakes of larger than 0 05 km2 rinzin et al 2021 the glacial lakes present an imminent threat of outburst flood to these two hydroelectric projects potential glofs can impact these hydroelectric power projects and lead to significant economic loss and potentially endanger human lives while the potential impact of glofs on the hydroelectric project has been undertaken at a large scale schwanghart et al 2016 this study presents a pilot based detailed assessment of the dangerous glacial lakes and their impacts on hydropower projects in bhutan except for glofs from the bechung tsho all potential glofs intercept the hydroelectric projects and may present a significant risk in the future e g at php ii the peak ranges from 870 m3 s raphstreng small magnitude to 19000 m3 s thorthormi large magnitude these hydroelectric power projects are inevitably exposed to glofs from the lakes in the lunana glacier complex however their risk will depend on the design standard of the dams the feasibility assessment done before the commencement of these projects by the japan international cooperation agency 2001 has considered peak flow up to 2176 m3 s so a high flood magnitude 20 000 m3 s from thorthormi tsho is an order of magnitude higher than the design flood of the hydropower projects a flood of such magnitude may therefore cause severe damage to the reservoir and dam causing overtopping excessive sedimentation outages equipment damage and cascading impacts on the low lying settlements the high concentration of sediment in the punatsangchu river from the 1994 glof event of lugge tsho is said to have persisted up to a month after the event watanbe and daniel 1996 the massive landslide induced flood cascade in 2003 from the tsatichhu river a north easterly flowing tributary of the kurichu river in eastern bhutan resulted in an estimated loss of 1 1 million usd due to the disruption of the 60 mw kurichu hydroelectric power plant dunning et al 2006 the disruption of php i and php ii due to glofs from the lunana glacier complex could result in greater financial implications since their installed capacity is about 2 order magnitudes greater than the kurichu hydroelectric power plant several past glof events in the himalaya have caused implacable damage to the hydroelectric power downstream including glofs that occurred in the neighbouring regions for example the 1985 glof of dig tsho in eastern nepal vuichard and zimmermann 1987 and the 1981 glof of cirenma co wang et al 2015 and the 2016 gongbatongsha glof sattar et al 2022 in the poiqu river basin of the central himalaya all these experiences from the neighbouring himalaya and bhutan suggest that glofs from the lakes in the lunana glacier complex may also cause potential damage to php i and php ii 5 4 glof modelling approach and uncertainty the input dam breach parameters are the essential initial condition determining the magnitude of flood hydraulics and the translated hazard and risk maps sattar et al 2021a wahl 2004 previous studies have found outflow hydraulics like peak discharge are highly sensitive to breach formation time tf basheer et al 2017 sattar et al 2021a while there are no models to predict the uncertainty of glof breach parameters previous studies sattar et al 2021a somos valenzuela et al 2015 have used embankment dam based equations wahl 2004 to predict uncertainty ranges of moraine dam breach parameters when wahl 2004 is used here the value of upper bound uncertainty dam breach width for the thorthormi tsho is more than double 704 5 m the actual calculated value 293 7 m while the lower bound decreases to less than half 116 7 m there is an extensive range of uncertainty in other breach parameters like tf see supplementary table 2 for detail also due to the lack of a clear historical record scenario definition for glofs cannot typically depend on the site specific frequency magnitude relationship commonly used in other natural hazards scenario definitions frey et al 2018 gaphaz 2017 as a result the scenario definition is another primary source of uncertainty in glof modelling here we accounted for these uncertainties by considering multiple potential glof scenarios with varying magnitudes 3 from each lake following the established trend in the existing literature frey et al 2018 sattar et al 2021a sattar et al 2021b this allowed us to define 12 unique scenarios 3 for each lake all flowing along the same trajectory however for disaster risk reduction worst case glofs scenarios can be considered although it could be argued that an inability to mitigate against the highest magnitude events should not remove the focus from smaller events that could and should have mitigation schemes the overtopping breach failure mode in the hec ras dam breach model is a gradually progressive process of dam erosion due to an overflow of water which contrasts with overtopping resulting from a large displacement wave induced by a rapid mass movement into the lake these differences could have underestimated the peak discharge and flood arrival time in the current study allen et al 2022 here we do not model the process chain or the trigger processes however we assume breach scenarios of varied dimensions to assess the downstream impact moreover glof is a highly complex process involving several cascading events usually initiated by mass movement and wave overtopping followed by debris flow hyper concentrated flow and secondary debris flow gaphaz 2017 schneider et al 2014 worni et al 2014 however these complex modelling approaches are usually applied in the context where run out distance is relatively short frey et al 2018 which is not the case in bhutan especially in the punatsangchu basin here most simulated floods 8 12 can reach up to 150 km downstream the complex process chain modelling covering such a long flood reach distance is theoretically possible it is highly challenging to model multiple scenarios using existing codes like r avaflow mergili et al 2017 due to high computation costs and numerical instabilities frey et al 2018 schneider et al 2014 therefore since we modelled multiple scenarios over a very long run out distance coupled with robust downstream risk assessment the hec ras 2d model is a reasonable alternative especially for the first order evaluation in this study nonetheless through google earth high resolution imagery we observed that the phochu river channel first starts with a relatively broad plain especially in the thanza area of lunana followed by a long stretch of deep valleys and gorges 20 30 km and flood plains become wide as the river reaches the downstream site where settlements are most concentrated this channel characteristic relates well to a typical feature that will allow erosion and entrainment of the enormous amount of debris from the upstream area that would multiply flood magnitude and thus damage caused to the lives and properties as occurred during the 2016 glof event from gongbatongsha co in the central himalaya sattar et al 2022 future studies addressing the critical challenges of glof modelling like long runout distance complex process chain and high computational cost issues should be the priority because of their high discharge and entrainment capacity glofs are typically known for carrying large boulders and mobilizing large amounts of sediment which can greatly modify channel morphology cook et al 2018 nativ et al 2022 for example the 2016 glof from gongbatongsha co in central himalaya with a discharge volume about of 1 1 105 m3 changed channel morphology up to 40 km downstream and widened channel width up to 12 m at some cross sections cook et al 2018 chen et al 2023 likewise the 1994 lugge tsho glof also changed channel morphology for up to 25 km downstream maurer et al 2020 while debris deposits were evident as far as 200 km downstream watanbe and daniel 1996 huber et al 2020 suggest that numerous present day boulders along the river channels in the himalaya have likely been transported by historical glofs and estimate that glofs of discharge 103 105 m3 are capable of transporting boulders of ca 10 m diameter or more here the majority of the modelled glof scenarios 8 12 exceed peak discharges of 103 m3 s indicating their potential to transport sediments of different grades including boulders this implies that if future glof are of the same magnitude as the modelled scenarios the impact might be far more than what we projected with our clear water flood rheology therefore future studies should focus on assessing the impact of glof through a complex debris flow model or those allowing phase changes population and infrastructures are very dynamic in bhutan as it is a rapidly developing country according to icimod s land cover and land use data the built up area within our 2d model domain has increased by 194 over the period from 2000 to 2020 with an annual rate of 0 36 km2 yr the agricultural land has increased from 16 0 km2 in 2000 to 19 5 km2 in 2015 but has dropped to 17 5 km2 in 2020 although the latter might be due to the conversion of farmland into built up areas supplementary fig s4 similarly according to the bhutan population and housing census 2017 the population in the wangdue phodrang and punakha the two districts most exposed to glof have increased from 48 850 to 70 926 45 between 2005 and 2017 nsb 2018 this increasing downstream population and built up area coupled with an increase in glacial lake area since the 1990s indicates that downstream glof risk would have also increased over the period most importantly increasing glof risk in the downstream communities in the future means that continuous monitoring of glof in punatsangchu basin is highly recommended 6 conclusion this study draws upon multiple data sources including traditional declassified corona kh 4 and hexagon kh 9 landsat tm etm and oli dem lulc openstreetmap population and housing census data using these data and hydrodynamic modelling we comprehensively assessed glacial lake outburst susceptibility downstream exposure hazard vulnerability and risk in the bhutan himalaya the results showed that although all the lakes in the lunana glacier complex have one or more unfavourable glof susceptibility factors thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho are relatively more susceptible to glof a detailed hazard assessment for the potential glofs indicated that two hydropower projects and over 16 000 people dwelling along the phochu and punatsangchu banks in addition to numerous structures and agricultural land are exposed to these events our comprehensive glof risk assessment revealed 1 lunana subdistrict block in the very high glof risk zone 9 in the high risk zone mainly in punakha and wangdue phodrang areas 3 in medium and 1 in a low risk zone the other 3 had zero glof risk under current conditions we recommend continuous monitoring of the glacial lakes in the lunana glacier complex through field investigation and high resolution satellite imagery with a particular focus on thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho second as for the downstream glof disaster management we recommend that lunana should be given the highest priority followed by subdistrict blocks concentrated in the wangdue phodrang and punakha districts like guma and thedtsho the study highlights the importance of multi source data in improving the knowledge of downstream glof risk and serves

2133,deglaciation due to atmospheric warming has led to the formation and expansion of numerous glacial lakes especially in the eastern himalaya many of these glacial lakes are susceptible to glacial lake outburst floods glofs which can cause far reaching impacts on downstream infrastructure and livelihoods this study is a comprehensive assessment of glof susceptibility hazard exposure vulnerability and risk for four potentially dangerous glacial lakes bechung tsho raphstreng tsho thorthomi tsho and lugge tsho located in the lunana glacier complex of the phochu basin in bhutan exposure and risk assessments were based on modelled glof hydrodynamics infrastructure data population and housing census data among the four glacial lakes thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho are relatively more susceptible to outburst floods than raphstreng tsho and bechung tsho outflow flood volumes from these lakes range between 6 105 and 3 108 m3 which can potentially impact over 16 000 people two hydropower projects numerous other infrastructures and agricultural land up to 150 km downstream of the lakes the glof exposed elements are largely in punakha and wangdue phodrang districts which are located 90 and 100 km downstream of the lunana glacier complex respectively among 17 subdistrict blocks within the basin one lunana lies in a very high glof risk area while 9 others are in the high glof risk zone the study highlights the importance of multi source data in improving the knowledge of downstream glof risk and serves as a base for improving glof risk reduction strategies in high mountain regions 1 introduction glacial lakes can be potential hazard sources as outburst floods originating from these lakes can cause far reaching damage to infrastructure and people allen et al 2015 zheng et al 2021b glacial lakes are often dammed by unstable moraine or glacier ice and are surrounded by destabilizing permafrost slopes or hanging glaciers otto 2019 richardson and reynolds 2000 slope failure originating in the vicinity of a glacial lake can result in a mass movement that can enter a lake capable of displacing the lake s water creating an impulse wave that overtops the frontal dam the instability of slopes and glacial lakes are further aggravated in young and seismically active alpine mountains armbruster et al 1978 such as himalaya where hazard chains cascades are common kirschbaum et al 2019 sharma et al 2022 the rapid expansion of glacial lakes resulting from glacier retreat increases the exposure of the lakes to glacial lake outburst flood glof triggers from the surrounding catchment where slopes are destabilized due to permafrost degradation making it more susceptible to slope failures and rockfalls grämiger et al 2017 in addition as lakes grow depending on the basin geometry the risk of overtopping failures may increase thus lake growth increases the probability of glofs being triggered rounce et al 2017 2016 and increases the potential flood volume fujita et al 2013 which are among the main factors contributing to increased glof hazard westoby et al 2015 these intrinsic and extrinsic hazard drivers can cause largely unpredictable rapid and deadly draining of lake water which may transform into debris or hyper concentrated flow as the flood entrains sediment richardson and reynolds 2000 sattar et al 2022 since glofs are high magnitude and largely unpredictable catastrophic events they can cause immense damage and disruption to the lives and infrastructures in the downstream settlements allen et al 2015 carey et al 2011 zheng et al 2021b it is estimated that 15 million people globally are exposed to the threat of glof with populations in high mountain asia the most exposed with around 1 million people living within 10 km of a glacial lake taylor et al 2023 numerous glof events have occurred in the past across the world causing damage to infrastructures and the loss of thousands of lives carrivick and tweed 2016 veh et al 2022 for example the jinweng co glof event in 2020 in the southeastern tibetan plateau destroyed ten residential houses washed away eight bridges and 43 9 km of road also causing damage to several other structures and agricultural land zheng et al 2021b in 2013 the debris flow resulting from chorabari lake combined with cloud burst induced landslides and flooding in the indian state of uttarakhand caused over 6 000 deaths and heavy damage to infrastructure allen et al 2015 in the peruvian cordillera blanca glofs in 1941 and 1945 killed over 6 000 people washed away 35 of huaraz city and other essential infrastructures including hydroelectric power stations carey et al 2011 bhutan alone has recorded at least 18 glof events since the 1950s the latest being the breaching of subsidiary lake ii of thorthormi tsho on 20 june 2019 gurung et al 2017 komori et al 2012 national center for hydrology and meteorology nchm 2019b rinzin et al 2021 at least seven of these past glof events in bhutan have caused varying degrees of infrastructure damage and loss of lives in the downstream settlements the most serious was the 1994 glof event of lugge tsho amongst best known contemporary glof events in the himalaya veh et al 2019b which led to around 21 fatalities seriously damaged punakha dzong the capital administrative center of bhutan and around 90 houses komori et al 2012 rinzin et al 2021 watanbe and daniel 1996 all these tragic and disastrous past glof experiences underpin the need for systemic flood disaster risk reduction drr activities for which detailed downstream glof hazard and risk assessment provides the necessary first step glofs often involve a cascade of different processes variably termed a process chain or hazard cascade mergili et al 2020 zheng et al 2021b which can increase the spatial reach and destructive power of the event sattar et al 2022 in the himalaya glofs frequently start with rapid mass movement into the lake often due to slope failure from the mountain flank above the lake leading to displacement waves overtopping the dam komori et al 2012 nie et al 2018 the overtopping waves cause moraine dam incision and dam failure resulting in a sudden discharge of lake water as the flood propagates farther downstream it transforms into debris flow and hyper concentrated or secondary debris flow depending on the geologic and topographic characteristics of the river channel and available sediment gaphaz 2017 schneider et al 2014 westoby et al 2014 worni et al 2014 these complex glof process chains present manifold challenges to accurately capturing its physical characteristics by numerical modelling and to a growing extent the whole hazard cascade however emerging models can either better represent phase changes or sediment laden events and their application to past events has increasingly enabled a better understanding of glofs some examples of commonly employed mass movement models include ramms christen et al 2010 r avaflow mergili et al 2017 iber bladé et al 2014 flow3d flow science 2012 d claw iverson and george 2014 and primarily for clear water floods hec ras ceiwr hec 2021 two or more of these models can be combined appropriately to model each process chain separately and sequentially frey et al 2018 schneider et al 2014 worni et al 2014 or the entire process chain can be integrated into a single model framework mergili et al 2017 however due to computation cost and uncertainty of input parameters for practical application of numerically sophisticated models westoby et al 2014 computationally less complex models like hec ras 2d are often used to capture first order hydrodynamics and impacts of glof maskey et al 2020 sattar et al 2021a sattar et al 2021b population and infrastructures continue to grow in glof prone areas despite the increasing threat from glofs allen et al 2022 carrivick and tweed 2016 taylor et al 2023 this is especially true for bhutan where most of the settlements national statistics bureau nsb 2018 and major hydropower projects the mainstay of the country s economy are concentrated along the glacier fed river valleys for example punatsangchu hydroelectric dams php i and ii are fed by meltwater from glaciers in the lunana region ministry of economic affairs moea 2021 although the positive trend in the frequency of glofs has decayed since the 1970s veh et al 2022 some studies have forecasted a 3 to 7 fold increase in glof hazard and downstream risk in the himalaya due to future deglaciation allen et al 2016 zheng et al 2021a the assessment at the global scale has pointed out that bhutan and nepal have the greatest national level economic impact from glof carrivick and tweed 2016 and in absolute normalized glof risk scores bhutan is ranked 13th in the world taylor et al 2023 the increasing glof threat coupled with growing downstream exposure merits an evaluation of systematic downstream risk combining glof hydraulics and population and census housing data while ample existing studies offer comprehensive information about the glof process chains and its effects on downstream communities frey et al 2018 kougkoulos et al 2018 sattar et al 2022 sattar et al 2021b schneider et al 2014 these studies have not included the social vulnerability due to which the glof downstream risk has remained far from being understood although allen et al 2016 have included the social vulnerability to evaluate glof downstream risk in the indian state of himachal pradesh the glof risk was evaluated based on the rough estimation of glof paths in a gis environment falling short of including glof hydraulics and intensity taylor et al 2023 assessed glof risk including exposure and vulnerability but for consistency used open access simplified data and assumptions for example populations within a 1 km buffer of river centerlines and glof reach as a fixed 50 km downstream of a lake lunana glacier complex located in the headwater of punatsangchu has five proglacial lakes of which four were reported to have high to very high outburst susceptibility in terms of both potential trigger mechanisms and flood volume nagai et al 2017 rinzin et al 2021 therefore for the first time this study offers a detailed glof risk assessment including underlying components of hazard vulnerability and exposure using multi source data including lake bathymetry openstreetmap and population and housing census data to improve confidence in the knowledge of glof susceptibility and downstream risk from these lakes this study is guided by the following three main objectives i to evaluate the potential glof hazard under different moraine breaching scenarios from the glacial lakes in the lunana glacier complex ii to identify the exposed population infrastructures and agricultural land in the valley and iii to conduct a detailed downstream risk assessment by considering socio economic factors along the potentially inundated areas of punatsangchu and phochu river basins 2 study area significance of the lunana glacier complex bhutan is a small landlocked country in the himalaya where the landscapes are largely dominated by rugged terrains and high mountains the himalaya stretch along the entire northern part of the country and host large reserves of glaciers a total of 1583 1487 km2 glaciers of which 219 951 km2 debris covered and 1364 536 km2 clean ice glaciers have been reported in the bhutan himalaya nagai et al 2016 bhutanese glaciers have undergone significant area and mass loss since the 1980s for example the glacier area shrunk by 23 3 0 9 during 1980 2010 bajracharya et al 2014 further between 2000 and 2020 glacier mass loss occurred at the rate of 0 47 m w e yr 1 higher than in other neighboring eastern himalayan 0 33 m w e yr 1 and nyainqêntanglha 0 46 m w e yr 1 regions hugonnet et al 2021 under the future global 1 5 c warming scenario the eastern himalaya where bhutan is located is projected to warm by 1 9 c which is predicted to cause a 60 of glacier mass loss by the end of 21st century kraaijenbrink et al 2017 region wide studies such as the himalayan scale nie et al 2018 high mountain asia wang et al 2020 and third pole zhang et al 2015 all have indicated that the eastern himalaya is one of the regions with the highest concentration of glacial lakes using high resolution alos prism and avnir 2 satellite imagery from 2006 to 2011 nagai et al 2017 documented 733 glacial lakes 83 6 km2 in the bhutan himalaya identified 226 lakes with positive potential flood volume pfv 0 04 33 7 106 m3 33 as having larger pfv 5 106 m3 and two with very large scale pfv 30 106 m3 a more recent inventory rinzin et al 2021 using sentinel 1 sentinel 2 and declassified corona kh 4 data reported 2574 156 63 7 9 km2 glacial lakes in 2020 from which 1118 82 92 km2 were classified as glacier fed lakes their inventory also revealed that bhutanese glacial lakes have expanded by 26 5 km2 17 since the 1960s rinzin et al 2021 further 65 lakes were found to have high outburst susceptibility based on multiple attributes such as lake area and the likelihood of mass movement into the lake rinzin et al 2021 the two inventories reported different numbers and statistics of glacial lakes in the bhutan himalaya due to differences in the approach and criteria employed in mapping glacial lakes and defining potentially dangerous glacial lakes however there is a common consensus that the phochu basin where the lunana glacier complex is located contains the largest proportion of glacial lakes and the majority of potentially dangerous glacial lakes pdgls for example rinzin et al 2021 reported the highest proportion 22 6 of glacier fed lakes in the phochu basin and identified it as the inland basin with the highest number of pdgls the two glacial lakes with larger scale potential flood volume identified by nagai et al 2017 are both located in the phochu basin likewise nearly half 8 of 17 pdgls in bhutan first identified by icimod mool et al 2001 and later verified by nchm 2019 are located in the phochu basin bhutan is a dense cluster of glacial lakes in the himalaya and the phochu basin is a global hotspot of potential glof risk taylor et al 2023 four proglacial lakes namely bechung tsho raphstreng tsho lugge tsho and thorthormi tsho in the lunana glacier complex of phochu basin in the bhutan himalaya were selected for detailed glof susceptibility evaluation and downstream hazard and risk assessment fig 1 these four glacial lakes are the primary source of water for the phochu river which coalesces with mochu and forms punatsangchu one of the biggest rivers in bhutan a first order hazard assessment had already revealed that all these lakes are highly susceptibility level higher than 0 8 or very highly susceptibility level higher than 0 6 susceptible to outburst flood rinzin et al 2021 the lunana glacier complex is also the catchment where at least three past glof events have been recorded since 1990 for example the most devastating 1994 glof from lugge tsho watanbe and daniel 1996 and the recent breaching of subsidiary lake ii of thorthormi tsho in july 2019 national center for hydrology and meteorology nchm 2019a although the artificial draining of thorthormi tsho initiated in 2008 reduced the lake water level by 5 m the lake is still deemed as highly dangerous nchm 2019b the investigation with persistent scatterer interferometry psi has revealed an unstable left moraine wall for thorthormi tsho and significant movement of the side moraine wall of lugge tsho wangchuk et al 2022 although assessment with psi by wangchuk et al 2022 has found no significant movement of the thin side moraine between thorthormi tsho and raphstreng tsho a detailed field investigation in 2019 has reported active sliding of this thin side moraine nchm 2019a suggesting a threat of a future cascading flood from thorthormi tsho and raphstreng tsho lunana the only community dwelling within the proximity of glaciers in bhutan is located about 5 20 km away from these glacial lakes punakha dzong the former capital with significant cultural heritage is situated at the confluence of phochu and mochu about 90 km downstream punatsangchu basin also hosts the two largest hydroelectric projects punatsangchu hydroelectric project php i 1200 mw and ii 1020 mw at 110 and 125 km downstream respectively which are expected to be commissioned soon moea 2021 taylor et al 2023 state that the punatsangchu catchment is the 4th most at risk from glof catchments in the world located along the phochu and punatsangchu riverbanks there are also two district capital towns khuruthang town 90 km downstream for punakha and bajo town 100 km downstream for wangdue phodrang districts this high glof potential combined with high downstream exposure means that investigating the hazard and risk status becomes critically important fig 1 3 data and method 3 1 remote sensing and field data declassified satellite data corona kh 4 and kh 9 were used to manually digitize glacier and glacial lake boundaries in the 1960s and 1970s respectively table 1 to correct the image distortion of corona and hexagon data the co registration using ground control points from sentinel 2 imagery was performed see rinzin et al 2021 a landsat series tm etm and oli were used to map glacial lakes and glaciers from 1990 to 2020 advanced land observing satellite alos phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar palsar dem with 12 5 m spatial resolution was used as a source of terrain information for the glof routing we modified terrain data along the river flow path by adding a line vector and cutting a channel through the artificial flood plain using the terrain modification tool in the ras mapper see supplementary material for detail the alos palsar dem was also used to map the lake surrounding topographic potential for ice and rock avalanching and steepness of the moraine dam the bathymetry data for three glacial lakes bechung tsho rapshtreng tsho and lugge tsho in the lunana glacier complex were collected during the field expedition from 15 september to 20 october 2021 a hummingbird 999si combo echo sounder with an inbuilt global positioning system was used to collect the bathymetry data the echo sounder transmits sound waves coupled with coordinate information into the lake bottom and records the returning echoes on a sonar chart with depth information the lake depth data collected along the transverse transects were interpolated to the entire lake surface the field measured lake bathymetry was used to calculate the flood breach volume and determine the bed topography of the lakes we used the hindu kush himalaya scale landsat based land cover data of 2018 from icimod to quantify the area of agricultural land inundated by the modelled glof icimod 2021 the same data was also used to derive pixel based manning s n value for flood routing we used time series of land ice velocity and elevation its live gardner et al 2019 to calculate the flow velocity of glaciers the glacier mass loss was calculated using the global scale glacier mass loss dataset available at a 1 1 grid scale hugonnet et al 2021 the global scale consensus ice thickness datasets and corresponding surface dem farinotti et al 2019 were also used to calculate glacier bed overdeepening and determine future glacial lake extent openstreetmap data was used to count the number of buildings exposed to the multiple glof scenarios modelled in the study data as of 15 june 2022 bhutan population and housing 2017 census data were used to determine the social vulnerability level of the exposed population nsb 2018 the 2020 livestock statistics from the ministry of agriculture and forestry bhutan renewable natural resources statistics division rnr sd 2020 were used to quantify the number of livestock exposed to the hazard from glofs the granularity of these data will be further discussed below 3 2 glacial lake outburst susceptibility assessment the glof susceptibility assessment for the lakes in the lunana glacier complex was performed based on a total of 18 conditioning and triggering factors broadly categorized into atmospheric cryospheric geotechnical and geomorphic factors after gaphaz 2017 see supplementary table s1 each factor was either observed or quantified using the presented data including remote sensing dem and field observation the topographic potential of the surrounding slopes for landslide rockfall and ice snow avalanche slope greater than or equal 30 and run out trajectory slope greater than or equal to 14 were mapped using a gis based modelling approach allen et al 2019 romstad et al 2008 fig 2 steep lakefront area sla depression angle 10 from the flat lake surface which provides information on the steepness of the moraine dam was computed following the approach of fujita et al 2013 hydrological characteristics such as total area of catchment and stream density were calculated from alos palsar dem other attributes such as calving potential which require finer resolution observation were validated based on expert interpretation of google earth imagery and field photos fig 3 the parent glacier extent was vectorized by modifying rgi v6 0 glacier outlines rgi consortium 2017 and through our expert observation in a false color composite of landsat series imagery oli tm and etm for 1990 2020 corona kh 4 for the 1960s and hexagon kh 9 for the 1970s the same scenes were also used for digitizing the glacial lake boundaries manually the glacier bed overdeepenings as an indicator of future lake extent were calculated by subtracting glacier ice thickness from the surface dem farinotti et al 2019 following linsbauer et al 2016 based on the degree to which these factors can condition or trigger a glof from a given lake inferred through either expert judgment or calculated value the above factors were classified into high medium and low susceptibility levels allen et al 2022 gaphaz 2017 with the corresponding score of 3 2 1 respectively the total glof susceptibility score of the lake was calculated as the sum of scores across all factors the susceptibility score was finally used to compare the relative outburst susceptibility level of the four lakes considered here 3 3 dam breach and glof routing hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras v 6 0 a 2 dimensional 2d dam breach model was used to simulate a series of potential glof events from the lakes in the lunana glacier complex although limited to clear water flow assumptions hec ras has been widely used for hydrodynamic modelling of glof in the himalaya such as in nepal khanal et al 2015 sattar et al 2021b tibetan plateau wang et al 2015 india sattar et al 2021a and bhutan maurer et al 2020 osti et al 2013 the model solves the 2d saint venant equation to calculate the unsteady flow hydraulics of glofs ceiwr hec 2021 the sine wave progression breach model was employed where initial breach forms slowly and with a further gradual incision the outflow velocities and shear stress change which leads to an increase in the outflow discharge sattar et al 2021b for the majority of moraine dammed lakes the outburst events are caused by displacement waves from mass movement followed by accompanying breach development and dam break gaphaz 2017 therefore we assumed that the dam breach was instigated by overtopping due to the mass movement into the lake with subsequent dam incision and degradation leading to the outburst event in hec ras this is implemented with the dam failure mode considered as overtopping where dam breach starts at the top of the dam and progresses toward the base of the moraine as erosion occurs ceiwr hec 2021 breach parameters like breach width and formation time for each glof scenario were calculated using froehlich 1995 eqs 1 and 2 this set of equations has been used previously in calculating breach parameters for glof modelling anacona et al 2015 sattar et al 2021b wang et al 2015 1 b w 0 1803 k 0 v w 0 32 h b 0 14 2 t f 0 00254 v w 0 53 h b 0 9 where bw is breach width tf is breach formation time vw is breach volume and hb is breach height for the forward modelling a series of 12 glof scenarios were simulated considering large moderate and small magnitude events originating from each lake bechung tsho raphstreng tsho thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho for each simulation a unique set of parameters were considered breach width bw breach formation time tf and breach volume vw and breach height hb while keeping the downstream valley geomorphology and river hydrological conditions constant for most past glof events in the himalaya it is unlikely that the entire moraine fails in case of an outburst event maurer et al 2020 veh et al 2019a therefore for the high magnitude glof scenario routing we constructed lake breach models assuming hb starting at the crest of the dam down to the mean depth of the lakes calculated based on the field measured bathymetry the hb for the moderate magnitude is assumed to be half of the large magnitude hb likewise the small magnitude hb was calculated as half of the moderate magnitude breach volumes were calculated from the field bathymetries as the volume of the water above the lowest point of breaching following the conservative trend in the previous studies such as of sattar et al 2021b however owing to the lack of bathymetry data the vw for thorthormi tsho was calculated as the product of area and potential lowering height hp following equation 3 fujita et al 2013 hp is the anticipated water lowering height after sla is removed due to moraine dam failure fujita et al 2013 here it is worth noting that the glof was simulated as a clear water flood and did not account for the complex process chain of a glof such as debris loading from erosion and sediment deposition along the downstream channel we used pixel based manning s n value according to the latest landsat derived land use and land cover data lulc icimod 2021 depending on different classes of lulc the pixel based manning s n ranges from 0 035 to 0 120 3 pfv min h p d m a where pfv is potential flood volume hp is potential height lowering dm is the mean depth of the lake and a is a lake area we reconstructed the 1994 glof event of lugge tsho to understand the glof hydrodynamics in the punatsangchu basin before conducting the multi scenario modelling from the lakes in the lunana glacier complex there are limited field and eyewitness information on the 1994 glof event so we drew upon sparse data available in the previous literature to define essential input parameters and initial conditions for example the moraine dam breach height was set to 18 m based on the height estimated by fujita et al 2008 likewise the dam breach width was set to 105 m and the dam crest width to 28 m both of which were constrained by koike and takenaka 2012 combining field measurements and remote sensing observations fujita et al 2008 have estimated a glof volume of 17 2 5 3 106 m3 accordingly we simulated six scenarios of glof by changing flood volume between 15 106 and 20 106 m3 each time increasing by 1 million m3 and keeping all other initial breach parameters constant other essential information available for the 1994 lugge glof is the peak flow at wangdue phodrang hydrological station 1800 2500 m3 s yamada 2000 osti et al 2013 and flood wave arrival time at punakha through eyewitness 5 1 hr and estimated using seismometer 4 75 hr maurer et al 2020 watanbe and daniel 1996 so we measured peak flow at wangdue phodrang hydrological station and flood reach time at punakha 3 4 downstream risk assessment the risk from any disaster event is represented as a function of hazard exposure and vulnerability ipcc 2014 here glof modelling results were first translated into a hazard map in doing so the flow height from each scenario modelled glof was converted into two classes of intensity high intensity more than 1 m and medium intensity less than 1 m frey et al 2018 gaphaz 2017 later the hazard map was computed by combining these intensities with the probability of occurrence low medium and high corresponding to potential large moderate and small magnitude events respectively we combined intensity and probability maps by using the simple matrix approach gaphaz 2017 since all the lakes examined here are situated in the same basin and pose a threat to the downstream regions we evaluate the combined hazard for all four glacial lakes in the lunana glacier complex this final hazard map was created by initially producing four glof hazard maps one for each lake with three hazard levels given as high medium and low later a simple matrix technique was used to merge the individual lake s hazard map the combined hazard map is classified into four hazard levels very high when all four high hazard level from each lake intersects high when at least three high hazard level intersect or two high hazard level and two medium levels intersect medium at least two medium hazard level intersect and low when all low hazard levels intersect exposure is the presence of people livelihood environmental services and other infrastructure along the flood plain allen et al 2019 flood exposure calculation involves two components delineating the flood hazard map and the population structures livestock and agricultural land intersecting with that flood hazard map tate et al 2021 the openstreetmap data were used to quantify any buildings roads and bridges that intersect with the extent of flood hazard under different scenarios while there was good coverage of openstreetmap in our study area we manually updated 75 buildings based on high resolution google earth imagery to estimate the glof exposed population we divided the total population by the number of buildings in the 17 identified subdistrict blocks to roughly appraise the number of people per exposed building following kougkoulos et al 2018 the population data were extracted from bhutan population and housing census 2017 data nsb 2018 the same approach was used to calculate the total number of exposed livestock using bhutan s annual livestock statistics 2020 from the ministry of agriculture and forestry rnr sd 2020 the inundated agricultural land was delineated by overlaying glof extent on the 2018 landsat 8 based lulc icimod 2021 the exposure level for each subdistrict block was classified into three classes depending mainly on the number of exposed buildings as high more than 50 medium 10 50 and low up to 10 buildings with agricultural land road and bridge damage we identified buildings as highly important since their destruction often directly relates to human casualties during disasters like glof allen et al 2016 based on bhutanese population and housing census 2017 data 15 social vulnerability indicators and their values were selected representing a wide range of social and economic conditions of the people nsb 2018 table 2 here we did not differentiate the indicator into positive or negative dependence since we uniformly chose indicators with positive dependence where increasing indicator value increases vulnerability for example we chose the percentage of households without a car for the indicator household ownership of the car each indicator value of the subdistrict block table s2 was normalized to a value ranging from 0 low vulnerability to 1 high vulnerability with impartial weighting the individual vulnerability index vi of each subdistrict block was calculated as the average across all normalized scores the vulnerability index for each subdistrict block was also classified into very high 0 75 1 high 0 5 0 75 medium 0 25 0 5 and low 0 0 25 finally hazard vulnerability and exposure were combined using the simple matrix method to produce the risk level of each subdistrict block fig 2 here we treated hazard exposure and vulnerability equally and no weighting was used 4 results 4 1 outburst susceptibility of glacial lake the total glof susceptibility score sc for the thorthormi tsho sc 47 and lugge tsho sc 45 was comparatively higher than the bechung tsho sc 37 and raphstreng tsho sc 34 suggesting that the former two lakes have higher chances of producing glof than the latter two since all lakes are located within the small catchment 99 3 km2 they had uniform susceptibility scores of 8 resulting from atmospheric factors seven of the 18 susceptibility factors considered here were cryospheric factors with a total score of 17 thorthormi tsho had the highest susceptibility score from cryospheric factors followed by lugge tsho with 16 this high score is because firstly the likelihood of ice avalanche an important cryospheric factor was highest for the thorthormi tsho as its total area susceptible to avalanche 4 3 km2 is higher than other lakes almost by 10 fold likewise for the lugge tsho the meltwater ponds on the moraine indicated a possible degradation of the ice core or permafrost in its terminal moraine dam lugge tsho is also in direct contact with the parent glacier and has a calving front measuring up to 360 m fig 3 indicating the high possibility of impact from the calving the thorthormi glacier surface flow velocity 9 37 m a 1 especially in the lower terminus is almost 2 3 fold higher than other glaciers the other cryospheric factors such as frontal glacier retreat mass loss and lake expansion were also higher for thorthormi and lugge tsho fig 4 and supplementary table s1 additionally the modelling of glacier bed topography suggested that lugge tsho will expand up to 1 83 km2 11 6 supplementary fig s3 the total susceptibility scores across nine geotechnical and geomorphologic factors ranked lugge tsho with the highest glof susceptibility level followed by thorthormi tsho with a score of 23 and 20 respectively again this higher score is because most of the calculated values and expert judgment for these factors were in favour of lugge tsho and thorthormi tsho as discussed below all four glacial lakes in the luanna complex have the most imminent threat from probable mass movements from the surrounding slopes clearly visible in field photos fig 3 by comparison the total area susceptible to the mass movement for thorthormi tsho is 10 8 km2 which is 2 4 fold higher than other lakes making it relatively more susceptible to the impact of the mass movement supplementary table s1 the individual catchment area for the lake ranges from 11 8 46 2 km2 however owing to the largest catchment area 46 2 km2 and high stream order lugge tsho appears to be most exposed allowing us to assign higher scores for the lugge tsho supplementary table s1 likewise the field photos showed that thorthormi tsho s moraine dam width especially toward raphstreng tsho right side is very thin 30 40 m fig 3 on the other hand raphstreng tsho s moraine width is thick 500 m as observed in google earth high resolution imagery moraine damming bechung tsho seems very wide 700 m with a good vegetation cover seemingly the most stable among the lakes in the lunana glacier complex 4 2 glof discharge and hydraulics scenario modelling of the lakes in the lunana glacier complex the glacial lakes in the lunana glacier complex have potential flood volumes ranging from 6 105 to 3 108 m3 which could produce floods with a peak discharge of 200 76 000 m3 s thorthormi tsho has a comparatively higher glof magnitude than the other three lakes fig 5 the resulting peak flow mainly depends on the flood magnitude at the starting point and gradually decreases as the flood routes downstream for example peak flow from thorthormi tsho at lunana 10 km from the lunana glacier complex is 9000 55 000 m3 s while it decreases to 4200 20 000 m3 s when the flood arrives php ii about 125 km downstream fig 6 the flood from bechung is the smallest of all attenuating before reaching toedwang in punakha the first major settlement after lunana so the flood hydraulics hereafter is presented only for the other three lakes raphstreng tsho lugge tsho and thorthormi tsho unlike peak flow the disparities in inundation depth and velocity at different downstream sites were also influenced by the channel topography and flood plain fig 7 all 12 simulated glofs arrive at lunana which is about 10 km downstream between 0 5 hr thorthormi large scenario to 4 5 hr bechung small scenario table 3 and depth ranges between 1 m and 25 m while flow velocity is 3 14 m s 1 table 3 the nine glofs 3 each from raphstreng tsho lugge tsho and thorthormi tsho take 2 5 to 4 75 hr to reach punakha dzong and flow with a velocity of 4 7 8 0 m s 1 and flow depth of 6 9 27 8 m table 3 the flood arrival time increases to 3 0 6 0 hr as the floods arrive at wangdue phodrang hydrological station here due to the low gradient slope 0 02 flood path the floods flow with the minimum velocity 1 7 3 2 m s 1 while their depth becomes the maximum 8 0 29 2 m table 3 the flood proceeds farther downstream and arrives at php i within 4 0 to 8 25 hr with a flow velocity of 1 7 7 0 m s 1 and depth of 9 0 26 2 m table 3 taking around 4 5 10 5 hr the flood flows at 3 7 m s 1 at php ii while their depth ranges between 7 0 and 29 0 m table 3 the detailed flow velocity and arrival time across various stations along the river centreline is also indicated in fig 7 4 3 downstream hazard exposure and risk glof downstream risk was computed by combining hazard exposure and vulnerability fig 8 is the excerpt of the hazard map from lunana and wangdue phodrang the simulated flood up to 150 km downstream from the lakes in the lunana glacier complex showed that the flood would inundate about 42 8 km2 downstream area out of which 15 6 fall under the very high hazard zone while 42 4 14 5 and 27 4 fall in the high medium and low hazard levels respectively in terms of total land area lunana suffers the maximum 11 3 km2 inundation followed by toedwang 5 1 km2 subdistrict blocks were classified into different glof hazard units based on which hazard level map intersected with them lunana kazhi and toedwang lie in very high hazard level zones so three of them were classified as very high glof hazard level subdistrict blocks the 13 others overlap with the high hazard level map so these 13 were assigned high hazard levels only one nahi does not intersect with the hazard map given a zero hazard level fig 9 a the glof exposure assessment showed that the simulated clear water floods from the glacial lakes in the lunana glacier complex can cause substantial inundation to two hydropower projects php i and php i and numerous structures and agricultural land across different downstream sites the floods expose up to 2 721 buildings which convert to 16 062 people and 6 157 livestock besides 11 8 km2 of agricultural land 101 4 km of roads including highways farms and feeder roads and 71 bridges are also exposed to the different hazard levels of the simulated floods of the total only 4 buildings all in lunana 0 01 km2 of agricultural land and 4 bridges all in lunana were located within the very high hazard flood zone none of the roads fall within the very high hazard zone detail in table 4 these exposed structures and agricultural land were primarily located in the subdistrict blocks of wangdue phodrang and punakha districts about 80 100 km downstream of the lunana glacier complex for example the highest number of buildings are exposed in guma 753 followed by thedtsho 639 guma also suffers from the longest stretch 15 5 km of road inundation likewise dzomi is modelled to likely suffer maximum 2 1 km2 damage to agricultural land while the highest number of bridges 11 exposure would occur in rubisa table 4 although no road is exposed in lunana since it is only connected by non vehicle access 11 8 km of the footpath is being inundated there are however current plans to extend the road network towards lunana which will change exposure and risk for display purposes we classified exposure into high medium and low levels for each subdistrict block based on our classification approach see method 10 subdistrict blocks were classified as highly exposed while 3 athang rubisa and patshaling and 1 gase tshowongm were labeled as medium and low respectively the exposure level was zero for the other three including kazhi largyab and nahi since no structure or agricultural land intersects with the flood hazard map fig 9b the calculated normalized score for the social vulnerability index for the 17 subdistrict blocks ranges from 0 3 to 0 7 a total of six including lunana largyab dzomi kabisa nahi and kazhi had high vulnerability levels only gase tshowongm had a low vulnerability level while the other 10 exhibited medium level vulnerability fig 9c the risk assessment produced by combining hazard exposure and vulnerability revealed that only lunana gewog is located in a very high risk zone nine of the other subdistrict blocks lie in high risk categories and four are in the medium risk zone the remaining 3 kazhi largyab and nahi were classified as zero risk areas since they have zero exposure and hazard fig 9d 5 discussion 5 1 glacial lakes outburst susceptibility the comprehensive analysis of wide ranging cryospheric geotechnical and geomorphological factors showed that thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho are relatively more susceptible to glof than raphstreng tsho and bechung tsho this finding resonates well with the earlier glof susceptibility assessments undertaken in the bhutan himalaya the first order gis based susceptibility assessment by rinzin et al 2021 ranked thorthormi tsho as the most dangerous glacial lake in the bhutan himalaya also the detailed field investigation by nchm 2019a has reported active sliding of a thin moraine between thorthormi tsho and raphstreng tsho thus increasing the susceptibility to glof events in the future the comparatively higher velocity of the thorthormi glacier especially in the frontal area indicates active sliding of ice the same being identified as the likely cause of thorthormi subsidiary lake ii draining in 2019 according to nchm 2019a calving of ice into the lake would further increase its hydrostatic gradient and glof volume gaphaz 2017 rounce et al 2016 and calving activities can create displacement waves as the calved ice impacts the lake the high glof susceptibility of lugge tsho also relates well with the findings from the earlier studies nchm 2019a rinzin et al 2021 wangchuk et al 2022 this is evident as lugge tsho has produced the most catastrophic past glof events in the bhutan himalaya komori et al 2012 maurer et al 2020 there is evidence of multiple cases of glof events from the same lake in the himalaya e g cirenma co in the central himalaya produced three glofs in 1964 1981 and 1983 respectively wang et al 2015 such experience from the himalaya combined with the high glof susceptibility of lugge tsho suggests that glof occurrence in the future cannot be neglected and is a subject of further investigation it is also an actively growing glacial lake in the region with the potential to grow in the future linsbauer et al 2016 implying that it is likely to become more exposed with time to surrounding slope failure rounce et al 2017 rounce et al 2016 also thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho both being in contact with their parents glaciers means they would exacerbate the melting of the corresponding glacier through increasing mechanical calving activities and subaqueous melting which in turn would cause enhanced expansion of the lake through glacier lake interaction this interaction would make thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho more susceptible to glof while also increasing potential flood volume king et al 2018 2019 thus we highly recommend continuous monitoring of thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho nevertheless we cannot discount the glof susceptibility of raphstreng tsho and bechung tsho entirely since they also have one or more factors indicating high outburst susceptibility e g high potential flood volume of raphstreng tsho bechung tsho is also expected to grow in the future by expanding towards its upstream direction and can become more exposed to glof triggers like an avalanche and landslide rockfall in the future richardson and reynolds 2000 therefore attention might be needed to monitor raphstreng tsho and bechung tsho the nchm has reported an increasing temperature trend in bhutan since the 1990s there has been a decreasing trend in precipitation but bhutan experienced high precipitation variability over the same period dorji and tamang 2019 leading to numerous extreme weather events in bhutan nchm 2022 this increasing frequency of extreme precipitation dorji and tamang 2019 added to increasing temperature would further amplify the glof susceptibility level of glacial lakes in the lunana complex gaphaz 2017 however since all lakes are located in the same basin if the most dangerous glacial lakes are monitored e g thorthormi tsho and proper disaster management plans are implemented in the downstream settlement possible downstream damage from the floods from any lakes in the basin could be highly reduced 5 2 glof risk on downstream settlement our simulation of the 1994 glof by setting breach volume at 20 0 106 yielded a peak flow of 2 129 m3 s at wangdue phodrang within the range of estimated peak flow 1800 to 2500 m3 s of the 1994 glof at the same station osti et al 2013 likewise our simulated glof takes 4 4 hr to reach punakha which also relates well with the arrival time noted by eyewitnesses and the reconstructed arrival time 4 75 hr using a seismometer maurer et al 2020 simulations with varying breach times between 0 25 and 1 hr result in a significant difference in peak discharge at the dam but both arrival time and peak flow remain fairly consistent by the time the flood wave reaches punakha and wangdue phodrang supplementary fig s2 this model calibration with the glof events of 1994 in the same basin reasonably indicates that our model setup is suitable for modelling different scenarios of future glof for risk assessment purposes the study combines hazard exposure and vulnerability to determine the risk posed by the potentially dangerous lakes in the lunana glacier complex to the downstream region along the phochu and punatsangchu banks the study reaffirms the earlier studies such as osti et al 2013 and koike and takenaka 2012 that bhutanese people are inevitably highly exposed to the glof most of the modelled glofs 8 12 from the lakes produce a flood of magnitude higher than the 1994 glof of lugge tsho fujita et al 2008 maurer et al 2020 osti et al 2013 watanbe and daniel 1996 although there is no history of floods of such high magnitudes in bhutan with climate change induced deglaciation and cryospheric system change in the high mountains across the world in recent decades gaphaz 2017 these potential events in the future cannot be disregarded our results offer new insights into the impacts of large magnitude glof events in a typical basin in the himalaya our study showed that one among 17 subdistrict blocks lunana lies in the very high glof risk zone and 9 others in a high risk zone some of the villages in lunana like thanza village of lunana are located very close to the lakes in the lunana glacier complex just about 2 7 km the large and medium scenario glofs from thorthormi tsho take only 15 30 min to reach some part of lunana this also means that the lunana region is likely impact by all glof events with little warning suggesting high magnitude damage to the exposed structures most of which are not built with the concrete wall nsb 2018 the capacity to prepare for respond to and recover from such a disaster is challenging for lunana because of its remote location and high social vulnerability level the nine high risk subdistrict block clusters fig 9 are located in the punakha and wangdue phodrang districts about 80 100 km from the lunana glacier complex the long travel time for glof allows these subdistrict blocks to potentially have more warning time in a glof event even the large scenario glof from the thorthormi tsho takes about 2 5 and 3 hr to arrive in punakha and wangdue phodrang respectively table 2 but this is only possible if there is a flood early warning system installed along the riverbank and if authorities and communities are well trained in response procedures or it becomes entirely reliant on ad hoc community to community communication flood early warning instruments have been installed along the banks of phochu and punatsangchu nchm 2021 and continuous monitoring and maintenance of these instruments are highly recommended huggel et al 2020 however due to the high density of settlement the inundation of infrastructures including buildings and roads is very high in punakha and wangdue phodrang areas 85 of exposed buildings and 59 of the bridge are located within these nine subdistrict blocks table 4 our results suggest that the lunana subdistrict block needs the highest level of attention for glof disaster risk reduction also the farther downstream settlements in the punakha and wangdue phodrang districts such as guma and thedtsho need to be prioritized fig 9 investigations elsewhere in the world have revealed that eventual damage from disasters not only depend on the magnitude of the hazard glof intensity in this case but also on the social vulnerability level crucial for resilience preparedness and response capacity of the people cutter and finch 2008 flanagan et al 2018 similarly the importance of data from multiple sources glof hazard data sub district level socio economic condition and settlement density for the downstream glof risk assessment is clearly portrayed in this study gase tshogongm falls in a high hazard zone but with low vulnerability and exposure level so it has been classified as a medium glof risk subdistrict block likewise kazhi nahi and largyab have high social vulnerability and fall in a high glof hazard zone however all of them have zero exposure which allowed us to rule out the glof risk in these subdistrict blocks under current conditions these findings help us improve the glof risk knowledge in the punatsangchu and phochu basins which is an essential preliminary assessment for the implementation of an early warning system huggel et al 2020 and risk reduction prioritization the glof early warning system has been put in place by national centre for hydrology and meteorology and is mainly based on experience from the 1994 glof event of lugge tsho nchm 2021 by contrast our downstream risk assessment is based on the multiple glof scenario modelling results most of which have a higher magnitude than the 1994 glof event thus our result provides new insights for consolidating and improving the existing early warning system to this end this study is valuable for the comprehensive and careful design of glof risk management strategy both hard engineering schemes such as improving structural measures e g construction of flood retention walls identification of safe evacuation zone lowering lake levels and enhancing the response and recovery capacity e g glof risk advocacy programs training populations for glof evacuation in the affected downstream community 5 3 glof impact on the hydroelectric project punatsangchu basin hosts the two largest hydroelectric power projects php i 1200 mw and php ii 1020 mw both of which are at the advanced stage of construction moea 2021 with a cost estimate of 1 74 nu 133 20 billion usd for php i and 0 95 nu 72 9 billion usd for php ii these two projects are record high investment projects in bhutan in the latest inventory punatsangchu headwaters have a total of 180 glacial lakes of larger than 0 05 km2 rinzin et al 2021 the glacial lakes present an imminent threat of outburst flood to these two hydroelectric projects potential glofs can impact these hydroelectric power projects and lead to significant economic loss and potentially endanger human lives while the potential impact of glofs on the hydroelectric project has been undertaken at a large scale schwanghart et al 2016 this study presents a pilot based detailed assessment of the dangerous glacial lakes and their impacts on hydropower projects in bhutan except for glofs from the bechung tsho all potential glofs intercept the hydroelectric projects and may present a significant risk in the future e g at php ii the peak ranges from 870 m3 s raphstreng small magnitude to 19000 m3 s thorthormi large magnitude these hydroelectric power projects are inevitably exposed to glofs from the lakes in the lunana glacier complex however their risk will depend on the design standard of the dams the feasibility assessment done before the commencement of these projects by the japan international cooperation agency 2001 has considered peak flow up to 2176 m3 s so a high flood magnitude 20 000 m3 s from thorthormi tsho is an order of magnitude higher than the design flood of the hydropower projects a flood of such magnitude may therefore cause severe damage to the reservoir and dam causing overtopping excessive sedimentation outages equipment damage and cascading impacts on the low lying settlements the high concentration of sediment in the punatsangchu river from the 1994 glof event of lugge tsho is said to have persisted up to a month after the event watanbe and daniel 1996 the massive landslide induced flood cascade in 2003 from the tsatichhu river a north easterly flowing tributary of the kurichu river in eastern bhutan resulted in an estimated loss of 1 1 million usd due to the disruption of the 60 mw kurichu hydroelectric power plant dunning et al 2006 the disruption of php i and php ii due to glofs from the lunana glacier complex could result in greater financial implications since their installed capacity is about 2 order magnitudes greater than the kurichu hydroelectric power plant several past glof events in the himalaya have caused implacable damage to the hydroelectric power downstream including glofs that occurred in the neighbouring regions for example the 1985 glof of dig tsho in eastern nepal vuichard and zimmermann 1987 and the 1981 glof of cirenma co wang et al 2015 and the 2016 gongbatongsha glof sattar et al 2022 in the poiqu river basin of the central himalaya all these experiences from the neighbouring himalaya and bhutan suggest that glofs from the lakes in the lunana glacier complex may also cause potential damage to php i and php ii 5 4 glof modelling approach and uncertainty the input dam breach parameters are the essential initial condition determining the magnitude of flood hydraulics and the translated hazard and risk maps sattar et al 2021a wahl 2004 previous studies have found outflow hydraulics like peak discharge are highly sensitive to breach formation time tf basheer et al 2017 sattar et al 2021a while there are no models to predict the uncertainty of glof breach parameters previous studies sattar et al 2021a somos valenzuela et al 2015 have used embankment dam based equations wahl 2004 to predict uncertainty ranges of moraine dam breach parameters when wahl 2004 is used here the value of upper bound uncertainty dam breach width for the thorthormi tsho is more than double 704 5 m the actual calculated value 293 7 m while the lower bound decreases to less than half 116 7 m there is an extensive range of uncertainty in other breach parameters like tf see supplementary table 2 for detail also due to the lack of a clear historical record scenario definition for glofs cannot typically depend on the site specific frequency magnitude relationship commonly used in other natural hazards scenario definitions frey et al 2018 gaphaz 2017 as a result the scenario definition is another primary source of uncertainty in glof modelling here we accounted for these uncertainties by considering multiple potential glof scenarios with varying magnitudes 3 from each lake following the established trend in the existing literature frey et al 2018 sattar et al 2021a sattar et al 2021b this allowed us to define 12 unique scenarios 3 for each lake all flowing along the same trajectory however for disaster risk reduction worst case glofs scenarios can be considered although it could be argued that an inability to mitigate against the highest magnitude events should not remove the focus from smaller events that could and should have mitigation schemes the overtopping breach failure mode in the hec ras dam breach model is a gradually progressive process of dam erosion due to an overflow of water which contrasts with overtopping resulting from a large displacement wave induced by a rapid mass movement into the lake these differences could have underestimated the peak discharge and flood arrival time in the current study allen et al 2022 here we do not model the process chain or the trigger processes however we assume breach scenarios of varied dimensions to assess the downstream impact moreover glof is a highly complex process involving several cascading events usually initiated by mass movement and wave overtopping followed by debris flow hyper concentrated flow and secondary debris flow gaphaz 2017 schneider et al 2014 worni et al 2014 however these complex modelling approaches are usually applied in the context where run out distance is relatively short frey et al 2018 which is not the case in bhutan especially in the punatsangchu basin here most simulated floods 8 12 can reach up to 150 km downstream the complex process chain modelling covering such a long flood reach distance is theoretically possible it is highly challenging to model multiple scenarios using existing codes like r avaflow mergili et al 2017 due to high computation costs and numerical instabilities frey et al 2018 schneider et al 2014 therefore since we modelled multiple scenarios over a very long run out distance coupled with robust downstream risk assessment the hec ras 2d model is a reasonable alternative especially for the first order evaluation in this study nonetheless through google earth high resolution imagery we observed that the phochu river channel first starts with a relatively broad plain especially in the thanza area of lunana followed by a long stretch of deep valleys and gorges 20 30 km and flood plains become wide as the river reaches the downstream site where settlements are most concentrated this channel characteristic relates well to a typical feature that will allow erosion and entrainment of the enormous amount of debris from the upstream area that would multiply flood magnitude and thus damage caused to the lives and properties as occurred during the 2016 glof event from gongbatongsha co in the central himalaya sattar et al 2022 future studies addressing the critical challenges of glof modelling like long runout distance complex process chain and high computational cost issues should be the priority because of their high discharge and entrainment capacity glofs are typically known for carrying large boulders and mobilizing large amounts of sediment which can greatly modify channel morphology cook et al 2018 nativ et al 2022 for example the 2016 glof from gongbatongsha co in central himalaya with a discharge volume about of 1 1 105 m3 changed channel morphology up to 40 km downstream and widened channel width up to 12 m at some cross sections cook et al 2018 chen et al 2023 likewise the 1994 lugge tsho glof also changed channel morphology for up to 25 km downstream maurer et al 2020 while debris deposits were evident as far as 200 km downstream watanbe and daniel 1996 huber et al 2020 suggest that numerous present day boulders along the river channels in the himalaya have likely been transported by historical glofs and estimate that glofs of discharge 103 105 m3 are capable of transporting boulders of ca 10 m diameter or more here the majority of the modelled glof scenarios 8 12 exceed peak discharges of 103 m3 s indicating their potential to transport sediments of different grades including boulders this implies that if future glof are of the same magnitude as the modelled scenarios the impact might be far more than what we projected with our clear water flood rheology therefore future studies should focus on assessing the impact of glof through a complex debris flow model or those allowing phase changes population and infrastructures are very dynamic in bhutan as it is a rapidly developing country according to icimod s land cover and land use data the built up area within our 2d model domain has increased by 194 over the period from 2000 to 2020 with an annual rate of 0 36 km2 yr the agricultural land has increased from 16 0 km2 in 2000 to 19 5 km2 in 2015 but has dropped to 17 5 km2 in 2020 although the latter might be due to the conversion of farmland into built up areas supplementary fig s4 similarly according to the bhutan population and housing census 2017 the population in the wangdue phodrang and punakha the two districts most exposed to glof have increased from 48 850 to 70 926 45 between 2005 and 2017 nsb 2018 this increasing downstream population and built up area coupled with an increase in glacial lake area since the 1990s indicates that downstream glof risk would have also increased over the period most importantly increasing glof risk in the downstream communities in the future means that continuous monitoring of glof in punatsangchu basin is highly recommended 6 conclusion this study draws upon multiple data sources including traditional declassified corona kh 4 and hexagon kh 9 landsat tm etm and oli dem lulc openstreetmap population and housing census data using these data and hydrodynamic modelling we comprehensively assessed glacial lake outburst susceptibility downstream exposure hazard vulnerability and risk in the bhutan himalaya the results showed that although all the lakes in the lunana glacier complex have one or more unfavourable glof susceptibility factors thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho are relatively more susceptible to glof a detailed hazard assessment for the potential glofs indicated that two hydropower projects and over 16 000 people dwelling along the phochu and punatsangchu banks in addition to numerous structures and agricultural land are exposed to these events our comprehensive glof risk assessment revealed 1 lunana subdistrict block in the very high glof risk zone 9 in the high risk zone mainly in punakha and wangdue phodrang areas 3 in medium and 1 in a low risk zone the other 3 had zero glof risk under current conditions we recommend continuous monitoring of the glacial lakes in the lunana glacier complex through field investigation and high resolution satellite imagery with a particular focus on thorthormi tsho and lugge tsho second as for the downstream glof disaster management we recommend that lunana should be given the highest priority followed by subdistrict blocks concentrated in the wangdue phodrang and punakha districts like guma and thedtsho the study highlights the importance of multi source data in improving the knowledge of downstream glof risk and serves

2134,this study developed a novel approach for estimating snowmelt using an empirical radiation model referred to as the empirical radiation snowmelt model or ersm ersm assumes that energy available to melt snow is equivalent to the sum of the shortwave radiation absorbed by the snowpack and the net longwave radiation at the snow surface ersm has two components the first component is an empirically determined relationship between the observed daily snowmelt and the daily potential shortwave radiation the longwave radiation component is implicitly estimated through its influence on the observed snowmelt the daily potential shortwave radiation was found using two calculated parameters the top of the atmosphere shortwave radiation and the albedo of the snow surface this first component simulates the average snowmelt that will occur for a given level of the potential shortwave radiation the second component of ersm estimates the difference between the average snowmelt simulated from the potential shortwave radiation first component and the actual snowmelt that occurred on any day observations from 20 snotel 1 1 snotel u s department of agriculture natural resources conservation service snow telemetry site sites in the truckee river watershed were used to develop separate ersm parameters for each site ersm was able to robustly predict snowmelt for all sites considered in this study the error statistics vary with the magnitude of the observed daily snowmelt and the best results were found for magnitudes at which the majority of snowmelt occurs a particularly valuable application of ersm is its use to estimate the melt factor required by temperature index snowmelt models ersm can explain a large degree of the observed variance of the temperature index melt factor keywords snotel temperature index snowmelt truckee river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water supply in the western united states depends on snow snowmelt contributes approximately 50 to 80 of the total annual runoff in this region of the country stewart et al 2004 the importance of snow in the western united states can further be illustrated by evaluating the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation it is estimated that 60 to 80 of the total annual precipitation is realized as snowfall doesken and judson 1996 li et al 2017 this means that the snowpack acts as a natural reservoir by temporarily storing water during the winter and releasing it in the spring and summer during the freshet the increase in river flows resulting from end of winter snowmelt due to the substantial contribution of snowmelt to annual streamflow there is a need for water managers to accurately represent snow processes within hydrologic models there are two basic methods of representing snowmelt in hydrology models energy balance eb and temperature index ti eb models which are often categorized as process based models are based on calculating the net energy fluxes for the snowpack while calculating snowmelt using the eb method has been shown to produce favorable results anderson 1968 marks et al 1999 estimating all the energy components across a watershed can be difficult ohmura 2001 the ti method in contrast only requires air temperature to drive the basic melt calculation and is often referred to as an empirically based snowmelt method the ti model is based on a linear relationship between snowmelt and air temperature usace 1956 and this method has been widely used by federal state and local agencies as well as private engineering firms for several decades when modeling snowmelt hock 2003 jonsell et al 2012 geck et al 2021 in fact this method is still widely used within both planning and operational models by multiple federal agencies including the u s army corps of engineers usace and the u s bureau of reclamation primarily due to the widespread spatial and temporal availability of both air temperature and precipitation u s army corps of engineers 2017a u s army corps of engineers 2017b u s army corps of engineers 2020 air temperature data can be readily sourced for historical time periods which is crucial for model calibration validation and forecasting applications additionally these data are more commonly available outside the conterminous united states conus conversely methods which require numerous additional meteorologic boundary conditions e g eb method are difficult to apply for historical time periods over very large modeling domains e g 25 000 km2 and outside conus due to data paucity in both space and time this is important to water managers because snowmelt calculations are performed for many reasons including planning studies reservoir operations dam safety analysis flood control studies and forecasts of future runoff these studies can require estimates of snowmelt under present conditions forecasted future conditions and past conditions going back many decades the modest data requirements of the ti method make its use over this range of study conditions advantageous for this reason the ti method is the primary snowmelt method included in the hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms software usace 2018 the ti method is used by several water management agencies and the accuracy of the simulations like all snowmelt models depends on the calibration data available as well as the modelers knowledge of the watershed kumar et al 2013 due to this dependency improvements to the method have been proposed by other studies one of the improvements proposed by bormann et al 2014 is to constrain melt estimates from the ti method by snow density another common modification to the ti method is the addition of net solar radiation as mentioned above brubaker et al 1996 follum et al 2015 jost et al 2012 these modifications improve the ability to capture the temporal and spatial variability present in the linear slope coefficient melt factor that relates snowmelt to temperature brubaker et al 1996 rango martinec 1995 by including snow properties or radiation energy fluxes at the snow surface hock 1999 modified the ti method by including a radiation index in terms of potential clear sky direct solar radiation this allowed for select eb processes to be included in the simulation of melt without the need for data besides air temperature this approach was found to improve the simulation of diurnal discharge fluctuations and yielded a more realistic spatial distribution of melt rates for a small glacier in sweden pellicciotti et al 2005 made further enhancements to the ti method by including albedo in the shortwave radiation term in addition to separating the temperature dependent and temperature independent energy sources these enhancements were found to accurately simulate snow metamorphism and the transition from snow to ice the enhancements by pellicciotti et al 2005 also reduced the sensitivity of melt rates calculated through the ti method to temperature extremes for the haut glacier d arolla in valais switzerland tobin et al 2013 modified the ti method proposed by hock 1999 to better capture sub daily fluctuations in melt for two experimental watersheds in british columbia and the swiss alps the challenge with the ti method is determining the melt factor parameter under the wide range of melt conditions melt factors are observed to be highly variable both temporally and spatially bilish et al 2018 hotovy jenicek 2020 building upon the extended ti methods used by other research this study uses snowmelt and radiation relationships to refine the melt factor needed for the basic ti formulation unlike other research that includes net radiation at the snow surface in the melt calculation this study uses radiation energy fluxes to help estimate the melt factor needed to parameterize hydrologic models which use ti to estimate snowmelt our model referred to as the empirical radiation snowmelt model ersm is similar to basic ti method in that the only meteorological data required is daily average air temperature ersm can estimate daily snowmelt and serve as a tool for determining the melt factor or ratio of snowmelt to temperature which is a parameter required by ti snowmelt models ti is dependent on the duration of time that air temperature exceeds a given melt onset reference or base temperature and by the magnitude of that departure from the reference air temperature during the ablation melt season traditionally melt onset was defined at 0 c this is frequently the reference temperature employed in engineering applications such as calculating thawing degree days tdd or freezing degree days fdd braithwaite and olesen 1989 kuusisto 1980 rango and martinec 1995 however unlike tdd the ti method can include a melt onset reference temperature calculated from local meteorological data which can vary up to several degrees from zero martinec and rango 1986 hock 1999 kampf and richer 2014 the purpose of this study was to create a snowmelt model that has limited input data requirements and provides more physically based melt factors which include radiation energy fluxes for use within ti snowmelt models specific objectives of our study include 1 develop a snowmelt estimation process using only air temperature and geographic location inputs 2 create a suite of empirically derived site specific melt factors to enhance the spatial resolution of the ti snowmelt model and 3 determine a daily varying melt factor to enhance the temporal resolution of the ti snowmelt model the results of this study can be used directly in hydrology models with ti snowmelt methods to improve accuracy while still retaining the practical advantage of relative simplicity as compared to models requiring more meteorological inputs 1 1 truckee river watershed the truckee river basin trb is an approximately 7 930 km2 watershed located in the sierra nevada mountains of eastern california and western nevada the water supply for the truckee river basin is predominantly snowmelt with most of the precipitation occurring between november and april grantz 1997 the largest storms can be attributed to atmospheric rivers which bring large amounts of water vapor from the pacific ocean to the western united states ralph and dettinger 2012 the upper trb an area that is not formally defined but extends upstream from truckee meadows and metropolitan areas in western nevada to the headwaters of the basin fig 1 has an alpine landscape with elevations reaching 2740 to 3048 m horton 1997 precipitation in the upper trb is stored as snow until warming spring temperatures create a seasonal runoff event this ratio of snow water equivalent swe to total

faqs snotelsensors snow measurements from snotel sites have been widely used for previous studies the range of applications include spatial distribution of swe fassnacht et al 2003 and development of gridded swe data products broxton et al 2016 the snow pillow sensors have been shown to accurately measure swe cdwr 1976 there can be lags between swe changes in the field and those being reported by the snotel sites when there are freezing and thawing cycles which create ice layers in the snowpack this situation can result in snow bridging johnson and schaefer 2002 to correct for these errors staff at the nrcs use manual field measurements combined with meteorological information to remove snow bridging impacts from the data record j anderson nrcs personal communication 2020 there is extensive quality control performed on snotel data by the nrcs to ensure that swe is accurately represented during both the accumulation and melt periods usda 2014 even with the quality control procedures used by nrcs there are still limitations to the snotel data the swe measurement instruments can have impacts on melt timing and rates johnson and marks 2004 this data uncertainty can add to the overall uncertainty of the ersm results twenty snotel sites located in or near the upper trb were used in this study table 1 fig 1 the period of record for this study was limited by the precipitation record for each snotel site therefore we used the range wy 1991 through 2019 for our analysis understanding the annual maximum swe and melt out variability is important when developing an empirically based snowmelt model an overview of the melt season at each snotel site is provided in fig 2 the potential maximum length of the melt season for each snotel site is the time period between the earliest date on which annual maximum swe occurred filled circles in fig 2 and the latest end date of the ablation period when recorded swe reaches 0 mm open circles in fig 2 the average annual maximum swe and the average day of year doy on which the annual maximum occurs for each snotel site is indicated by the points marked in yellow vertical lines indicate standard deviation of annual maximum swe and horizontal lines indicate standard deviation of the doy on which maximum occurs for consistency across statistics the earliest date on which annual maximum swe occurred and latest date at the end of the ablation period when recorded swe reaches 0 mm for each site are shown at the same average swe value 2 methods ersm has two components the first component is an empirically determined relationship between the observed daily snowmelt and the daily potential shortwave radiation the daily potential shortwave radiation was determined using two calculated parameters the top of the atmosphere shortwave radiation and the albedo of the snow surface an individual linear relationship between observed daily snowmelt and daily potential shortwave radiation was found for each snotel site this first component provides the average snowmelt observed for a given radiation level of the potential shortwave radiation it also provides a combined estimate of the impact of other factors that influence shortwave radiation absorbed by the snowpack clear sky attenuation sky view factor cloud cover solar incident angle resultant from local topography slope and aspect as well as the site average net longwave radiation the second component estimates the difference between the average snowmelt calculated from the potential shortwave radiation and the actual snowmelt that occurred on any day the difference is estimated using an empirically determined linear relationship between the residuals form the first ersm component and the observed difference between the observed ti and a potential shortwave average ti the sum of both components is equal to the snowmelt at a single time step 2 1 identification of melt periods from snotel data the ersm model is intended to be applicable during the melt season therefore changes in snowpack temperature and melt abstraction into the liquid water content held by the snowpack were not explicitly considered in our process the daily swe data were filtered according to the following criteria days with observed melt mobs an average air temperature greater than 0 c and no precipitation were selected from each year following the annual peak swe for each site this assured that the snowmelt occurred during the melt period when snow depth was continuously decreasing during the melt period the snowpack temperature is likely isothermal meaning at or very near 0 c throughout the snowpack profile from surface to ground usace 1956 heat transfer into the snowpack at this time will cause snowmelt but not modify the snowpack temperature in addition during much of this time the liquid water content of the snowpack is likely to be at its maximum holding capacity and so snowmelt will not be abstracted into the liquid water content of the snowpack usace 1956 using these initial criteria the daily data from the 20 snotel sites provided a set of 17 022 days for analysis the snotel dataset was further limited in three ways first the analysis only includes days following the date at which 10 or more of the annual maximum swe had already been recorded as melt this was done to further maximize the likelihood that the liquid water content of the snowpack was at its maximum holding capacity second days with continuity issues when the potential daily snowmelt was greater than the swe remaining on the ground were eliminated this typically meant that the final days of the snow season when only very small amounts of swe remained were not used third all days following the summer solstice were removed because the hysteresis of clear sky radiation values before and after the summer solstice could potentially misrepresent the total energy available for snowmelt the final result using these criteria was a dataset of 13 199 days selected for analysis 2 2 ersm development the first ersm component estimates the average snowmelt that will occur for a given level of potential shortwave radiation the second component provides an estimate of the difference between the average snowmelt simulated from the potential shortwave radiation and the actual snowmelt that occurred on any day this section starts with a general background and then describes the development of each component in the ersm process the four primary modes of heat transfer between the snowpack and its environment are sensible and latent turbulent fluxes longwave radiation and shortwave radiation heat transfer resulting from precipitation falling on the snow surface as rain or snow and heat transfer from the soil layer beneath the snowpack also occur the energy available for snowmelt per day can be expressed as 1 m q latent q sensible q sw q lwnet q precipitaiton q ground where m the snowmelt due to all modes of heat transfer q latent the rate of latent heat transfer qsensible the rate of sensible heat transfer qsw rate of downwelling shortwave radiation heat transfer absorbed by the snow surface qlwnet the rate of net longwave heat transfer qprecipitation the rate of heat transfer due to rain and new snow and qground the rate of heat transfer from the ground beneath the snowpack the heat transfer rates are expressed as depth of equivalent snowmelt per unit area per day in forested areas burles and boone 2011 demonstrated turbulent fluxes qlatent and qsensible did not contribute substantially to the overall energy balance therefore we have omitted these in the ersm formulation snowmelt due to precipitation was also omitted as only dry melt conditions were considered in addition snowmelt due to heat transfer from the ground beneath the snowpack is generally negligible and therefore also omitted in this analysis anderson 1968 the relative balance of the heat transfer modes changes throughout the winter season during the melt period following the annual maximum swe which is the focus of this study short and longwave radiation are understood to be the dominant components marks and dozier 1992 and roth and nolin 2017 modifying eq 1 to neglect the turbulent fluxes heat transfer from precipitation and ground beneath the snowpack yields 2 m q sw q lwnet the q sw in eq 2 can be expanded to include all the factors that influence the shortwave radiation absorbed into the snowpack 3 q sw s sw c f a t 1 α k q toa where ssw the shortwave sky view factor which describes the fraction of shortwave radiation that is not blocked by vegetation or surrounding terrain cf fraction of shortwave radiation that passes through the clouds at the atmospheric clear sky attenuation factor α k the albedo of the snowpack assumed to be a function of snow surface age k in days and the top of atmosphere shortwave radiation q toa the coefficients in eq 3 are ssw cf at and α k and are all fractions between 0 and 1 together they control the amount of the top of atmosphere solar radiation that is absorbed by the snow surface of these parameters only the albedo can be estimated based on the snotel data its estimation only requires that the snow surface age ssa of the snow be determined from the snotel data and that the relationship between ssa and albedo is known given this the potential shortwave radiation q is found as 4 q 1 α k q toa and on any day q sw q note that units of q are millimeters of equivalent snowmelt per day this conversion is performed by dividing radiation values w m2 by the product of water density g m3 and latent heat of water j g w s g 2 2 1 top of atmosphere shortwave radiation the daily top of atmosphere toa shortwave radiation can be directly calculated using 5 q toa s 0 r 0 r 2 cos θ 0 where r0 the mean distance between the earth and sun s0 the solar constant at r0 1369 3 w m2 and θ0 the solar zenith angle the angle measured at the earth s surface between the sun and the zenith the earth sun distance r varies throughout the year because the earth follows a slightly elliptical orbit around the sun it can be determined for each day of the year using kepler s first law nasa 2014 the solar zenith angle θ0 can be calculated using woolf 1968 6 cos θ 0 cos δ cos l c o s ω sin l sin δ where δ is the solar declination l is the latitude and ω is the is the hour angle the total toa shortwave radiation for each day of the year and at each location can then be found by combining eq 5 and 6 and integrating eq 5 over each one day period 2 2 2 albedo the broadband albedo of snow declines with ssa due to progressive changes in the snow crystal morphology structure and size flanner and zender 2006 these changes are especially pronounced during melt periods henneman and stefan 1999 malik et al 2014 snow surface albedo is also influenced by the presence of dust and forest litter painter et al 2012 melloh et al 2001 and the albedo of the underlying ground surface when the snowpack is shallow and optically thin melloh et al 2002 for this study the albedo data of aguado 1985 collected over three winter seasons at a site in the upper trb was used to develop a relationship between snow surface albedo and ssa in days fig 3 the aguado data were collected over april may and early june during the early 1980 s and we assume that the relationship between albedo and ssa remains applicable for our dataset optically thin snowpacks when the observed albedo dropped below 0 4 were specifically excluded since they are not representative of the snow pillow albedo at snotel sites 2 2 3 snow surface age in fig 4 the top of atmosphere toa solar radiation at the big meadow site along with the ssa for each winter is displayed the ssa k was found by counting the number of days with an air temperature greater than 0 c after the annual maximum swe occurred a day was not counted if its average air temperature was less than 0 c 32 f or if precipitation occurred the ssa count was not reset due to precipitation in general minimal precipitation fell during the melt period and the daily totals were relatively small given that surface albedo declines with ssa the data in fig 4 provide a means of estimating the potential available solar radiation that could be absorbed by the snow surface other factors that impact the available solar radiation cloud cover the sky view factor terrain geometry and the atmospheric attenuation are not explicitly used in ersm 2 2 4 model parameters to develop the first component of ersm q was calculated for all the sites for each day included in the analysis using eq 4 the toa shortwave radiation was estimated using eq 5 and eq 6 and snow albedo was estimated using the linear equation shown in fig 3 based on the observed ssa on that day the ti was calculated based on the observed average air temperature at each site for each day in our study ti is the maximum of either the difference between the air temperature and 0 c or zero thus far in the ersm development we have calculated values of q and observed values of ti k and mobs for each day for each snotel site next q was divided into bins of 2 54 mm based on snotel swe measurement precision and each day was assigned to the appropriate bin the bins extended from 15 mm to 90 mm not every site had observations in all the bins the values of mobs in each bin were then averaged to arrive at a set of m q used to simulate the average daily snowmelt at a given level of q a linear regression between m q and q resulted in 7 m q s n q j l n where qj is the potential shortwave radiation on the jth day while sn and ln are the empirical coefficients found for the nth snotel site an example is shown for the snotel site big meadow in fig 5 a a comparison of eqs 7 and 2 shows that ln is the equivalent to qlwnet and represents the average net longwave radiation therefore the contribution of longwave radiation is implicitly estimated through its influence on the observed snowmelt a comparison of eqs 7 and 3 shows that sn is the equivalent of the product of the average values of the shortwave sky view factor the clear sky attenuation factor and the cloud factor eq 7 can be restated in more compact form as 8 m q s n q j q n l where q n l l n s n the values of sn ln and ql n are listed in table 2 for each site along with the coefficient of determination r2 which was determined through regression analysis the correlation between bin average q and m q was strong with coefficients of determination ranging from 0 85 to 0 98 however the r2 ranged from approximately 0 1 to 0 35 when compared against the un binned data due to the variance of observed melt in each water year a comparison of the observed and calculated values of m q for all sites found using eq 7 are shown in fig 6 a the second component of ersm uses the difference between the observed snowmelt mobs and m q on any day j δmj defined as 9 δ m j m obs m q from observations mobs is known and m q can be calculated from eq 8 so that δm can be determined for each day in the analysis set there is no additional information regarding shortwave radiation that can be brought to bear without increasing the number of meteorological variables which contradicts the function of the ti snowmelt approach of relative simplicity therefore ti variable is used to provide additional information regarding the available radiation δm is estimated as a linear function of the ti 10 δ m j w ti j t b where w is an empirically determined coefficient and tb is an empirically determined base value using the first component of ersm the value of tb must equal the average value of ti for a given level of bin average q so that δmj 0 when mobs m q resulting from the least squares fit from eq 7 substituting the average value of ti for a given level of bin average q designated as ti q into eq 10 result in 11 δ m j w ti j ti q the determination of ti q follows the same process as m q recall that q was divided into bins of 2 54 mm and each day was assigned to the appropriate bin the values of ti in each bin were then averaged to arrive at a set of ti q the average ti at a given level of q a linear regression between ti q and q resulted in 12 ti q t n q t n 0 where tn and tn0 are the empirical coefficients found for the nth snotel site an example is shown for the snotel site big meadow in fig 5b eq 12 can be restated more compactly as 13 ti q t n q q n ti where q n ti t n 0 t n the values of tn tn0 and q n ti are listed in table 3 for each site along with the coefficient of determination r2 derived from a regression analysis the correlation between q and ti q varied but overall was reasonably high with coefficients of determination ranging from 0 33 to 0 88 a comparison of the observed and calculated values of ti q calculated using eq 12 for all sites is shown in fig 6b δm and ti ti q were plotted for all sites and days used in our analysis fig 7 there is a linear trend with a slope of 2 06 mm per c although there is substantial variance in data the intercept is close to zero at 0 61 mm within the measurement resolution of 2 54 mm the next step was to estimate the value of w at each site for each bin of q with the linear equation 14 w n q r n q r n 0 where wn q is the slope between δm and ti n ti q n for a given level of q and rn and rn0 are the empirical coefficients found for the nth snotel site q bins with fewer than 10 observations were not used in this equation results show a positive relationship between w and q fig 8 fig 9 shows a comparison between the calculated wn q and the observed values for all snotel sites used in the study using all sites the coefficent of determination between the calculated and observed wn q is approximately 0 62 the values of rn rn0 and qw n are listed in table 4 for each site along with the coefficient of determination r2 the correlation between wn q and q ranged widely from 0 004 to 0 624 this reflects a site specific relationship between air temperature and shortwave radiation and highlights site specific variations in the sky view factor and other parameters the final ersm equations are snowmelt on a given day mcalc is estimated as 15 m calc s n q q n l w n q t i ti q where mcalc in eq 15 is the calculated snowmelt and where ti daily temperature index q 1 α k q toa q n l l n s n q n ti t n 0 t n q n w r n 0 r n ti q t n q q n ti w n q r n q q n w the first term represents the site and date specific mean daily melt the second term represents the variability around the mean by using a site specific relationship between ti and potential shortwave radiation note that variables with the subscript n are specific to a given location and found empirically based on the snowmelt observations at each snotel site the coefficients sn and ql n are listed in table 2 tn and q n ti in table 3 and rn and qw n in table 4

average air temperature c on day t tb the base temperature almost always 0 c mf t the melt factor mm day c on day t and tit the temperature index c on day t ersm can be used to estimate the melt factor mf using eq 15 as 17 m f s n q np q n l w n q np ti q np ti np w n q np a general melt factor pattern for each site calculated using eq 17 was developed and termed the melt factor normal pattern the melt factor normal pattern removes the day to day variation caused by ti which can obscure the seasonal trends in the melt factor at each site the melt factor normal pattern was found for each site using the following procedure first the average doy that the annual maximum swe occurred was selected for each site based on the snotel observations fig 2 this day served as the starting day of the normal pattern the length in days of the normal pattern was set equal to the average length of the melt season after the annual maximum swe fig 2 the ssa in days was then determined for each day of the normal pattern the snow surface albedo was then calculated using the equation shown in fig 3 based on the albedo values and the top of the atmosphere shortwave radiation q toa values of q for each day of the normal pattern denoted as q np were calculated the ti for each day was estimated using a smoothed approximation of the doy average ti based on sine functions only two periods were necessary to provide a very reasonable fit to the data the normal pattern ti tinp was estimated as 18 ti np ti avg n 1 2 a n sin n 2 π j 365 2 π ε n 365 where tiavg is the annual average ti an is the amplitude of the nth cycle j is the julian day of the year and εn is the phase of the nth cycle an and εn were estimated using the generalized reduced gradient method lasdon et al 1974 an example of the results is shown in fig 10 for the big meadow site along with the coefficients of the sine functions for that site separate coefficients were determined for each site the normal pattern melt factor mfnp for each site was then calculated for each day using the equation for mf eq 17 2 3 model evaluation the ersm performance was evaluated using several statistics including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge root mean squared error rmse average error and coefficient of determination r2 these statistics have been shown useful in evaluation of model performance for a variety of applications jackson et al 2019 specifically the kge gupta et al 2009 values can be used to determine if the model performance is better than simply using the average of the observations knoben et al 2019 states that when the mean of observations is used the kge is approximately equal to 0 41 a perfect model kge would be unity however even if kge values are negative the model may still be adding value to the predictions 3 results 3 1 daily snowmelt estimation the ersm was used to estimate the daily snowmelt at the 20 snotel sites in the upper trb over their period of record for the 13 199 days in the analysis the required inputs were the observed temperature index ti the ssa k used to calculate the albedo and top of atmosphere shortwave radiation q toa which was calculated based on doy and site location the observed and calculated doy average snowmelt align closely except for a few days in february when the calculated values are larger than the observed values fig 11 this indicates the difficulty ersm has in matching very small values of snowmelt less than 10 mm the standard deviations around the calculated doy snowmelt average are consistently less than the observed standard deviations fig 11 this suggests that ersm has difficulty in reproducing both very small and very large snowmelt values possibly due to the simplifying assumptions made in modeling snowmelt as a linear process ersm errors vary with observed daily snowmelt with the minimum average error and rmse occurring at 25 mm of daily snowmelt fig 12 the minimum errors are found for magnitudes of daily snowmelt at which the majority of snowmelt occurs it is also clear from fig 12 that ersm tends to overestimate when the observed values of daily snowmelt are small and underestimate when the observed values of daily snowmelt are large this observation is consistent with the standard deviation results in fig 11 the error statistics for snowmelt estimation for each snotel site are listed in table 5 the nse of the ersm model in estimating daily snowmelt ranges from 0 25 to 0 64 with a weighted average by the number of observations at each site of 0 44 the kge values ranged from 0 30 to 0 75 with a weighted average of 0 60 the ersm average error is quite small ranging from 2 03 to 0 00 mm while the rmse is larger ranging from 5 84 to 19 81 mm the weighted average for all sites of 10 41 mm the coefficients for the regression relationship between observed and calculated daily snowmelt are shown in the last columns along with the coefficient of determination r2 for all sites the slope of the best fit regression line is close to 1 0 ranging from 0 86 to 1 1 and averaging 0 97 the intercept is close to 0 ranging from 0 07 to 0 13 and averaging 0 01 the coefficient of determination ranges from 0 32 to 0 59 with a weighted average of 0 45 we applied the ersm to data which was not used in the training of the linear models the validation period used was wy 2020 2022 the nse kge average error rmse and r2 were all determined for each of the snotel sites in the upper trb comparing the validation error statistics to the error statistics produced during the ersm develop the metrics are generally similar for example the nse for prediction melt during the validation period ranged from 1 2 to 0 72 while the kge ranged from 0 13 to 0 84 the average error and rmse ranged from 4 5 mm to 4 3 mmm and 3 7 mm to 13 mm respectively the r2 ranged from 0 27 to 0 77 with a weighted average of 0 55 the error metrics for the validation period are provide in table s1 of the supplementary material an example of the observed and calculated daily snowmelt for both the training wy 1991 2019 and validation periods wy 2020 2022 for the big meadow snotel site is shown in fig 13 3 2 ti melt factor estimation the estimated melt factor results based on eq 17 are inherently variable day to day since this equation contains ti in the denominator in general both q and ti increase as the melt season advances but with considerable intra seasonal variation the mf is also location dependent and varies with the sn ql n q n ti and w coefficients for each snotel site as discussed in section 2 2 4 the ratio of radiation to ti dictates temporal changes in the mf such as the melt season maximum this implies that years with early snowmelt will have different mf than years with late snowmelt seasons the errors in estimating the mf are relatively larger than those of daily snowmelt simulations table 6 the mf nse and kge values range from 0 21 to 0 50 and 0 29 to 0 65 respectively the nse weighted average is 0 34 while the weighted kge average is 0 57 the mf average error is small ranging from 0 823 to 0 411 mm day c and the rms error is larger ranging from 1 692 to 4 755 mm day c with a weighted average for all sites of 3 292 mm day c table 6 the coefficients from regression analysis of the observed daily melt factor and the calculated daily melt factor are shown in the last columns of table 6 along with the coefficient of determination r2 the slope and the intercept of the best fit lines show considerably more variation than for the daily snowmelt values the coefficient of determination ranges from 0 212 to 0 563 with a weighted average of 0 41 the normal pattern melt factor and observed doy average melt factors for the big meadow site are shown in fig 14 the normal pattern melt factor for big meadow passes through the center of the observed doy average melt factors early in the melt season i e april and may the melt factor increases non linearly in comparison the melt factor becomes linear with a reduced slope later in the melt period similar calculations and patterns were found for each of the 20 snotel sites in the upper trb fig 15 there is a wide range of normal pattern melt factors in the upper trb as the site specific coefficients in eq 14 produced substantial variation for a single watershed similar to big meadow snotel several of the other snotel sites have non linearly increasing melt factors early in the melt season and nearly constant melt factors later in the ablation period based on the ersm results 4 discussion the ersm is an empirical model for estimating snowmelt based on observations of snow water equivalent swe and air temperature and was able to robustly predict snowmelt for the selected days for sites used in this study the snowmelt estimation error statistics vary with the magnitude of the observed daily snowmelt and the best results were found for magnitudes at which the majority of snowmelt occurs ersm s ability to predict daily snowmelt varies with the observed melt fig 11 the minimum average error and rms error occur at 25 mm of daily snowmelt with snowmelt overestimated at observed daily values less than this threshold and underestimated at observations greater than this threshold given the empirical approach of ersm it is probably not surprising that the best result occurs at the observed daily snowmelt that produces the most runoff over time since the large number of observed values would have greater influence on the linear model parameters the overestimation at small values of observed daily snowmelt and underestimation at larger values may also reflect systematic errors in the albedo estimation the trend is for small values of snowmelt to occur at the start of the melt period and large values to occur at the end although small and large values can occur at any time during the melt period this suggests that the albedo may be underestimated at new ssa and overestimated at older ssas improvements in the albedo estimation described above may improve these results finally factors that weren t accounted for such as snowpack temperature variations melt abstraction into the liquid water content held by the snowpack and turbulent heat fluxes may have more impact at these small and large values of observed daily snowmelt a particularly valuable application of ersm is its use to estimate the melt factor parameter required by hydrologic models using ti methods as shown in table 6 incorporating ersm into estimates can explain a large degree of the observed variance of the melt factor providing model improvements in cases where snowmelt measurements are unavailable or when used for forecasting and scenario modeling the normal pattern of the melt factor throughout the ablation period at a site can be developed based on the relevant statistics on the observed ablation period and air temperature this normal pattern can be compared to the actual seasons to gain insight into the actual melt factors likely to be expected and used for forecasting melt rates and timing of snow disappearance the first ersm component is an empirically determined relationship between the observed daily snowmelt and the daily potential shortwave radiation the daily potential shortwave radiation was determined using two calculated parameters the toa shortwave radiation and the albedo of the snow surface there are two ways that this daily potential shortwave radiation could be further refined the first is the application of a more sophisticated albedo estimation procedure more precise results could be possible if the snow surface albedo were estimated throughout the winter season to incorporate temporal variations from each new snowfall the second way that shortwave radiation could be refined in the ersm would be to account for the impact of clouds observed daily cloud cover fraction could be incorporated into the model to provide an estimate of the impact of clouds on shortwave radiation received at the snow surface given that a goal of this study was to limit the use of meteorological data required by ersm observed cloud cover fraction was not used however hargreaves and samani 1982 and bristow and campbell 1984 proposed methods for estimating solar radiation based on the difference between the daily maximum air temperature and minimum air temperature the approach of hargreaves especially has found wide acceptance and application hargreaves and allen 2003 allen 1997 almorox et al 2011 jahani et al 2017 expanding the ersm model to include the daily maximum and minimum air temperature seems a reasonable next step the second component of ersm calculates the difference between the estimated average snowmelt first component and the actual snowmelt observed on a given day improvements in this component would require explicit incorporation of additional parameters such as cloud cover sky view factor local topography and humidity that would allow further refinements in the estimation of net radiation additionally more explicit consideration of how vegetation impacts shortwave radiation through shading and net longwave radiation at each snotel site may further refine the accuracy of the ersm in our formulation eq 2 presents qlwnet as representing only net longwave radiation however this term could represent other energy fluxes e g turbulent if a site was known to have minimal net longwave energy inputs into the snowpack the ersm is a straightforward method to determine snowmelt and melt factors from the perspective of inputs required to estimate snowmelt a simpler model than ersm would use only the day of year as input we evaluated this simpler model and found increased error for the training period of wy 1991 2019 therefore the final input variables used in the ersm development provide a more accurate and potentially useful model for forecasting we have included ti in the ersm formulation which can readily be determined through air temperature forecasts finally the usefulness of a model can be evaluated by how much improvement the predicted value is compared to using an average of the observations again using the data from wy 2020 2022 the kge values for melt and melt factors ranged from 0 13 to 0 84 and 0 22 to 0 73 all kge values are greater than 0 41 which indicates he ersm performs better than using the average value from each snotel site knoben et al 2019 5 conclusion this study developed a novel approach for estimating snowmelt and assumes that snowmelt is equivalent to the sum of the shortwave radiation absorbed by the snowpack and the net longwave radiation at the snow surface the longwave radiation is implicitly estimated through its influence on the observed snowmelt ersm is an empirical model because it uses snowmelt and the air temperature calculated from swe and temperature observations at snotel sites as well as estimates of toa shortwave radiation and snow surface albedo to determine required model coefficients the ersm model was applied to 20 snotel sites in the upper trb located on the border of nevada and california the key conclusions from this work include daily snowmelt estimation can be performed without the need for complex snowmelt models by using only air temperature doy and geographic locations the spatial variability of melt factors based on ersm can be substantial as demonstrated in the upper trb the temporal variability of melt factors based on ersm are relatively large during early snowmelt months i e april and may but trends toward constant values later in the season the empirical approach of ersm does present limitations when estimating melt factors for ungauged locations the next steps for research with ersm are developing spatial patterns from other snotel locations within the western us the spatial patterns may also be important for estimating melt factors in ungauged watersheds additionally refining albedo estimates based on ssa could also improve model performance ersm also does not account for changes in the snowpack temperature or liquid water content ersm assumes that snowmelt is equivalent to the sum of the shortwave radiation absorbed by the snowpack and the net longwave radiation at the snow surface an analysis of the model error could be performed with additional energy balance component to determine accuracy gains compared to larger data requirements finally an evaluation of more complex statistical models could be peformed to evaluate potential accuracy increases to the linear models assumed in the ersm esrms ability to estimate ti model parameters using well established solar radiation concepts presents an alternative workflow to parameterize ti models during melt season ersm while needing similar data requires as ti snowmelt models does incorporate more of the energy fluxes that occur at the snow surface in melt factor

2134,this study developed a novel approach for estimating snowmelt using an empirical radiation model referred to as the empirical radiation snowmelt model or ersm ersm assumes that energy available to melt snow is equivalent to the sum of the shortwave radiation absorbed by the snowpack and the net longwave radiation at the snow surface ersm has two components the first component is an empirically determined relationship between the observed daily snowmelt and the daily potential shortwave radiation the longwave radiation component is implicitly estimated through its influence on the observed snowmelt the daily potential shortwave radiation was found using two calculated parameters the top of the atmosphere shortwave radiation and the albedo of the snow surface this first component simulates the average snowmelt that will occur for a given level of the potential shortwave radiation the second component of ersm estimates the difference between the average snowmelt simulated from the potential shortwave radiation first component and the actual snowmelt that occurred on any day observations from 20 snotel 1 1 snotel u s department of agriculture natural resources conservation service snow telemetry site sites in the truckee river watershed were used to develop separate ersm parameters for each site ersm was able to robustly predict snowmelt for all sites considered in this study the error statistics vary with the magnitude of the observed daily snowmelt and the best results were found for magnitudes at which the majority of snowmelt occurs a particularly valuable application of ersm is its use to estimate the melt factor required by temperature index snowmelt models ersm can explain a large degree of the observed variance of the temperature index melt factor keywords snotel temperature index snowmelt truckee river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water supply in the western united states depends on snow snowmelt contributes approximately 50 to 80 of the total annual runoff in this region of the country stewart et al 2004 the importance of snow in the western united states can further be illustrated by evaluating the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation it is estimated that 60 to 80 of the total annual precipitation is realized as snowfall doesken and judson 1996 li et al 2017 this means that the snowpack acts as a natural reservoir by temporarily storing water during the winter and releasing it in the spring and summer during the freshet the increase in river flows resulting from end of winter snowmelt due to the substantial contribution of snowmelt to annual streamflow there is a need for water managers to accurately represent snow processes within hydrologic models there are two basic methods of representing snowmelt in hydrology models energy balance eb and temperature index ti eb models which are often categorized as process based models are based on calculating the net energy fluxes for the snowpack while calculating snowmelt using the eb method has been shown to produce favorable results anderson 1968 marks et al 1999 estimating all the energy components across a watershed can be difficult ohmura 2001 the ti method in contrast only requires air temperature to drive the basic melt calculation and is often referred to as an empirically based snowmelt method the ti model is based on a linear relationship between snowmelt and air temperature usace 1956 and this method has been widely used by federal state and local agencies as well as private engineering firms for several decades when modeling snowmelt hock 2003 jonsell et al 2012 geck et al 2021 in fact this method is still widely used within both planning and operational models by multiple federal agencies including the u s army corps of engineers usace and the u s bureau of reclamation primarily due to the widespread spatial and temporal availability of both air temperature and precipitation u s army corps of engineers 2017a u s army corps of engineers 2017b u s army corps of engineers 2020 air temperature data can be readily sourced for historical time periods which is crucial for model calibration validation and forecasting applications additionally these data are more commonly available outside the conterminous united states conus conversely methods which require numerous additional meteorologic boundary conditions e g eb method are difficult to apply for historical time periods over very large modeling domains e g 25 000 km2 and outside conus due to data paucity in both space and time this is important to water managers because snowmelt calculations are performed for many reasons including planning studies reservoir operations dam safety analysis flood control studies and forecasts of future runoff these studies can require estimates of snowmelt under present conditions forecasted future conditions and past conditions going back many decades the modest data requirements of the ti method make its use over this range of study conditions advantageous for this reason the ti method is the primary snowmelt method included in the hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms software usace 2018 the ti method is used by several water management agencies and the accuracy of the simulations like all snowmelt models depends on the calibration data available as well as the modelers knowledge of the watershed kumar et al 2013 due to this dependency improvements to the method have been proposed by other studies one of the improvements proposed by bormann et al 2014 is to constrain melt estimates from the ti method by snow density another common modification to the ti method is the addition of net solar radiation as mentioned above brubaker et al 1996 follum et al 2015 jost et al 2012 these modifications improve the ability to capture the temporal and spatial variability present in the linear slope coefficient melt factor that relates snowmelt to temperature brubaker et al 1996 rango martinec 1995 by including snow properties or radiation energy fluxes at the snow surface hock 1999 modified the ti method by including a radiation index in terms of potential clear sky direct solar radiation this allowed for select eb processes to be included in the simulation of melt without the need for data besides air temperature this approach was found to improve the simulation of diurnal discharge fluctuations and yielded a more realistic spatial distribution of melt rates for a small glacier in sweden pellicciotti et al 2005 made further enhancements to the ti method by including albedo in the shortwave radiation term in addition to separating the temperature dependent and temperature independent energy sources these enhancements were found to accurately simulate snow metamorphism and the transition from snow to ice the enhancements by pellicciotti et al 2005 also reduced the sensitivity of melt rates calculated through the ti method to temperature extremes for the haut glacier d arolla in valais switzerland tobin et al 2013 modified the ti method proposed by hock 1999 to better capture sub daily fluctuations in melt for two experimental watersheds in british columbia and the swiss alps the challenge with the ti method is determining the melt factor parameter under the wide range of melt conditions melt factors are observed to be highly variable both temporally and spatially bilish et al 2018 hotovy jenicek 2020 building upon the extended ti methods used by other research this study uses snowmelt and radiation relationships to refine the melt factor needed for the basic ti formulation unlike other research that includes net radiation at the snow surface in the melt calculation this study uses radiation energy fluxes to help estimate the melt factor needed to parameterize hydrologic models which use ti to estimate snowmelt our model referred to as the empirical radiation snowmelt model ersm is similar to basic ti method in that the only meteorological data required is daily average air temperature ersm can estimate daily snowmelt and serve as a tool for determining the melt factor or ratio of snowmelt to temperature which is a parameter required by ti snowmelt models ti is dependent on the duration of time that air temperature exceeds a given melt onset reference or base temperature and by the magnitude of that departure from the reference air temperature during the ablation melt season traditionally melt onset was defined at 0 c this is frequently the reference temperature employed in engineering applications such as calculating thawing degree days tdd or freezing degree days fdd braithwaite and olesen 1989 kuusisto 1980 rango and martinec 1995 however unlike tdd the ti method can include a melt onset reference temperature calculated from local meteorological data which can vary up to several degrees from zero martinec and rango 1986 hock 1999 kampf and richer 2014 the purpose of this study was to create a snowmelt model that has limited input data requirements and provides more physically based melt factors which include radiation energy fluxes for use within ti snowmelt models specific objectives of our study include 1 develop a snowmelt estimation process using only air temperature and geographic location inputs 2 create a suite of empirically derived site specific melt factors to enhance the spatial resolution of the ti snowmelt model and 3 determine a daily varying melt factor to enhance the temporal resolution of the ti snowmelt model the results of this study can be used directly in hydrology models with ti snowmelt methods to improve accuracy while still retaining the practical advantage of relative simplicity as compared to models requiring more meteorological inputs 1 1 truckee river watershed the truckee river basin trb is an approximately 7 930 km2 watershed located in the sierra nevada mountains of eastern california and western nevada the water supply for the truckee river basin is predominantly snowmelt with most of the precipitation occurring between november and april grantz 1997 the largest storms can be attributed to atmospheric rivers which bring large amounts of water vapor from the pacific ocean to the western united states ralph and dettinger 2012 the upper trb an area that is not formally defined but extends upstream from truckee meadows and metropolitan areas in western nevada to the headwaters of the basin fig 1 has an alpine landscape with elevations reaching 2740 to 3048 m horton 1997 precipitation in the upper trb is stored as snow until warming spring temperatures create a seasonal runoff event this ratio of snow water equivalent swe to total winter precipitation is higher in the sierra nevada mountains at 67 relative to other mountain ranges in the western us serreze et al 1999 the lower trb is in the rain shadow of the sierra nevada mountains and receives less than 203 mm of precipitation a year horton 1997 lake tahoe is a natural lake that was raised with a controlled outlet structure in the early 20th century downstream of lake tahoe the truckee river flows northeasterly 170 km until it terminates in pyramid lake numerous projects operated by federal and local agencies regulate the timing and delivery to meet the complex water demand in the lower trb katrina et al 2007 kelley et al 2020 1 2 truckee watershed land cover the annual snowpack of the upper trb contains the higher elevation regions of the basin typically above 1830 m horton 1997 based on the national land cover database 2016 classification much of this area is evergreen forest fig 1 and is expected to have a persistent canopy cover throughout the year dewitz 2019 the next most common land cover classification is shrub or scrub vegetation the portion of the watershed located in the arid deserts of western nevada are dominated by shrub or scrub vegetation and developed land cover classifications fig 1 1 3 snowpack data all snowpack data used in this study was collected at natural resources conservation service nrcs snotel 1 sites usda nrcs 2020 each snotel site collects swe data via a pressure sensing snow pillow snow pillows are accurate instruments for measuring swe with daily data reviewed by nrcs personnel for temporal and spatial consistency wcc nrcs usda gov factpub sect 4b html hourly estimates of swe are available as well but do not receive the quality control of the daily values and were not used in this report daily average air temperatures are also measured at each snotel sites swe and temperature are reported with a precision of 2 54 mm and 0 56 c respectively nrcs usda gov wps portal wcc home dataaccesshelp faqs snotelsensors snow measurements from snotel sites have been widely used for previous studies the range of applications include spatial distribution of swe fassnacht et al 2003 and development of gridded swe data products broxton et al 2016 the snow pillow sensors have been shown to accurately measure swe cdwr 1976 there can be lags between swe changes in the field and those being reported by the snotel sites when there are freezing and thawing cycles which create ice layers in the snowpack this situation can result in snow bridging johnson and schaefer 2002 to correct for these errors staff at the nrcs use manual field measurements combined with meteorological information to remove snow bridging impacts from the data record j anderson nrcs personal communication 2020 there is extensive quality control performed on snotel data by the nrcs to ensure that swe is accurately represented during both the accumulation and melt periods usda 2014 even with the quality control procedures used by nrcs there are still limitations to the snotel data the swe measurement instruments can have impacts on melt timing and rates johnson and marks 2004 this data uncertainty can add to the overall uncertainty of the ersm results twenty snotel sites located in or near the upper trb were used in this study table 1 fig 1 the period of record for this study was limited by the precipitation record for each snotel site therefore we used the range wy 1991 through 2019 for our analysis understanding the annual maximum swe and melt out variability is important when developing an empirically based snowmelt model an overview of the melt season at each snotel site is provided in fig 2 the potential maximum length of the melt season for each snotel site is the time period between the earliest date on which annual maximum swe occurred filled circles in fig 2 and the latest end date of the ablation period when recorded swe reaches 0 mm open circles in fig 2 the average annual maximum swe and the average day of year doy on which the annual maximum occurs for each snotel site is indicated by the points marked in yellow vertical lines indicate standard deviation of annual maximum swe and horizontal lines indicate standard deviation of the doy on which maximum occurs for consistency across statistics the earliest date on which annual maximum swe occurred and latest date at the end of the ablation period when recorded swe reaches 0 mm for each site are shown at the same average swe value 2 methods ersm has two components the first component is an empirically determined relationship between the observed daily snowmelt and the daily potential shortwave radiation the daily potential shortwave radiation was determined using two calculated parameters the top of the atmosphere shortwave radiation and the albedo of the snow surface an individual linear relationship between observed daily snowmelt and daily potential shortwave radiation was found for each snotel site this first component provides the average snowmelt observed for a given radiation level of the potential shortwave radiation it also provides a combined estimate of the impact of other factors that influence shortwave radiation absorbed by the snowpack clear sky attenuation sky view factor cloud cover solar incident angle resultant from local topography slope and aspect as well as the site average net longwave radiation the second component estimates the difference between the average snowmelt calculated from the potential shortwave radiation and the actual snowmelt that occurred on any day the difference is estimated using an empirically determined linear relationship between the residuals form the first ersm component and the observed difference between the observed ti and a potential shortwave average ti the sum of both components is equal to the snowmelt at a single time step 2 1 identification of melt periods from snotel data the ersm model is intended to be applicable during the melt season therefore changes in snowpack temperature and melt abstraction into the liquid water content held by the snowpack were not explicitly considered in our process the daily swe data were filtered according to the following criteria days with observed melt mobs an average air temperature greater than 0 c and no precipitation were selected from each year following the annual peak swe for each site this assured that the snowmelt occurred during the melt period when snow depth was continuously decreasing during the melt period the snowpack temperature is likely isothermal meaning at or very near 0 c throughout the snowpack profile from surface to ground usace 1956 heat transfer into the snowpack at this time will cause snowmelt but not modify the snowpack temperature in addition during much of this time the liquid water content of the snowpack is likely to be at its maximum holding capacity and so snowmelt will not be abstracted into the liquid water content of the snowpack usace 1956 using these initial criteria the daily data from the 20 snotel sites provided a set of 17 022 days for analysis the snotel dataset was further limited in three ways first the analysis only includes days following the date at which 10 or more of the annual maximum swe had already been recorded as melt this was done to further maximize the likelihood that the liquid water content of the snowpack was at its maximum holding capacity second days with continuity issues when the potential daily snowmelt was greater than the swe remaining on the ground were eliminated this typically meant that the final days of the snow season when only very small amounts of swe remained were not used third all days following the summer solstice were removed because the hysteresis of clear sky radiation values before and after the summer solstice could potentially misrepresent the total energy available for snowmelt the final result using these criteria was a dataset of 13 199 days selected for analysis 2 2 ersm development the first ersm component estimates the average snowmelt that will occur for a given level of potential shortwave radiation the second component provides an estimate of the difference between the average snowmelt simulated from the potential shortwave radiation and the actual snowmelt that occurred on any day this section starts with a general background and then describes the development of each component in the ersm process the four primary modes of heat transfer between the snowpack and its environment are sensible and latent turbulent fluxes longwave radiation and shortwave radiation heat transfer resulting from precipitation falling on the snow surface as rain or snow and heat transfer from the soil layer beneath the snowpack also occur the energy available for snowmelt per day can be expressed as 1 m q latent q sensible q sw q lwnet q precipitaiton q ground where m the snowmelt due to all modes of heat transfer q latent the rate of latent heat transfer qsensible the rate of sensible heat transfer qsw rate of downwelling shortwave radiation heat transfer absorbed by the snow surface qlwnet the rate of net longwave heat transfer qprecipitation the rate of heat transfer due to rain and new snow and qground the rate of heat transfer from the ground beneath the snowpack the heat transfer rates are expressed as depth of equivalent snowmelt per unit area per day in forested areas burles and boone 2011 demonstrated turbulent fluxes qlatent and qsensible did not contribute substantially to the overall energy balance therefore we have omitted these in the ersm formulation snowmelt due to precipitation was also omitted as only dry melt conditions were considered in addition snowmelt due to heat transfer from the ground beneath the snowpack is generally negligible and therefore also omitted in this analysis anderson 1968 the relative balance of the heat transfer modes changes throughout the winter season during the melt period following the annual maximum swe which is the focus of this study short and longwave radiation are understood to be the dominant components marks and dozier 1992 and roth and nolin 2017 modifying eq 1 to neglect the turbulent fluxes heat transfer from precipitation and ground beneath the snowpack yields 2 m q sw q lwnet the q sw in eq 2 can be expanded to include all the factors that influence the shortwave radiation absorbed into the snowpack 3 q sw s sw c f a t 1 α k q toa where ssw the shortwave sky view factor which describes the fraction of shortwave radiation that is not blocked by vegetation or surrounding terrain cf fraction of shortwave radiation that passes through the clouds at the atmospheric clear sky attenuation factor α k the albedo of the snowpack assumed to be a function of snow surface age k in days and the top of atmosphere shortwave radiation q toa the coefficients in eq 3 are ssw cf at and α k and are all fractions between 0 and 1 together they control the amount of the top of atmosphere solar radiation that is absorbed by the snow surface of these parameters only the albedo can be estimated based on the snotel data its estimation only requires that the snow surface age ssa of the snow be determined from the snotel data and that the relationship between ssa and albedo is known given this the potential shortwave radiation q is found as 4 q 1 α k q toa and on any day q sw q note that units of q are millimeters of equivalent snowmelt per day this conversion is performed by dividing radiation values w m2 by the product of water density g m3 and latent heat of water j g w s g 2 2 1 top of atmosphere shortwave radiation the daily top of atmosphere toa shortwave radiation can be directly calculated using 5 q toa s 0 r 0 r 2 cos θ 0 where r0 the mean distance between the earth and sun s0 the solar constant at r0 1369 3 w m2 and θ0 the solar zenith angle the angle measured at the earth s surface between the sun and the zenith the earth sun distance r varies throughout the year because the earth follows a slightly elliptical orbit around the sun it can be determined for each day of the year using kepler s first law nasa 2014 the solar zenith angle θ0 can be calculated using woolf 1968 6 cos θ 0 cos δ cos l c o s ω sin l sin δ where δ is the solar declination l is the latitude and ω is the is the hour angle the total toa shortwave radiation for each day of the year and at each location can then be found by combining eq 5 and 6 and integrating eq 5 over each one day period 2 2 2 albedo the broadband albedo of snow declines with ssa due to progressive changes in the snow crystal morphology structure and size flanner and zender 2006 these changes are especially pronounced during melt periods henneman and stefan 1999 malik et al 2014 snow surface albedo is also influenced by the presence of dust and forest litter painter et al 2012 melloh et al 2001 and the albedo of the underlying ground surface when the snowpack is shallow and optically thin melloh et al 2002 for this study the albedo data of aguado 1985 collected over three winter seasons at a site in the upper trb was used to develop a relationship between snow surface albedo and ssa in days fig 3 the aguado data were collected over april may and early june during the early 1980 s and we assume that the relationship between albedo and ssa remains applicable for our dataset optically thin snowpacks when the observed albedo dropped below 0 4 were specifically excluded since they are not representative of the snow pillow albedo at snotel sites 2 2 3 snow surface age in fig 4 the top of atmosphere toa solar radiation at the big meadow site along with the ssa for each winter is displayed the ssa k was found by counting the number of days with an air temperature greater than 0 c after the annual maximum swe occurred a day was not counted if its average air temperature was less than 0 c 32 f or if precipitation occurred the ssa count was not reset due to precipitation in general minimal precipitation fell during the melt period and the daily totals were relatively small given that surface albedo declines with ssa the data in fig 4 provide a means of estimating the potential available solar radiation that could be absorbed by the snow surface other factors that impact the available solar radiation cloud cover the sky view factor terrain geometry and the atmospheric attenuation are not explicitly used in ersm 2 2 4 model parameters to develop the first component of ersm q was calculated for all the sites for each day included in the analysis using eq 4 the toa shortwave radiation was estimated using eq 5 and eq 6 and snow albedo was estimated using the linear equation shown in fig 3 based on the observed ssa on that day the ti was calculated based on the observed average air temperature at each site for each day in our study ti is the maximum of either the difference between the air temperature and 0 c or zero thus far in the ersm development we have calculated values of q and observed values of ti k and mobs for each day for each snotel site next q was divided into bins of 2 54 mm based on snotel swe measurement precision and each day was assigned to the appropriate bin the bins extended from 15 mm to 90 mm not every site had observations in all the bins the values of mobs in each bin were then averaged to arrive at a set of m q used to simulate the average daily snowmelt at a given level of q a linear regression between m q and q resulted in 7 m q s n q j l n where qj is the potential shortwave radiation on the jth day while sn and ln are the empirical coefficients found for the nth snotel site an example is shown for the snotel site big meadow in fig 5 a a comparison of eqs 7 and 2 shows that ln is the equivalent to qlwnet and represents the average net longwave radiation therefore the contribution of longwave radiation is implicitly estimated through its influence on the observed snowmelt a comparison of eqs 7 and 3 shows that sn is the equivalent of the product of the average values of the shortwave sky view factor the clear sky attenuation factor and the cloud factor eq 7 can be restated in more compact form as 8 m q s n q j q n l where q n l l n s n the values of sn ln and ql n are listed in table 2 for each site along with the coefficient of determination r2 which was determined through regression analysis the correlation between bin average q and m q was strong with coefficients of determination ranging from 0 85 to 0 98 however the r2 ranged from approximately 0 1 to 0 35 when compared against the un binned data due to the variance of observed melt in each water year a comparison of the observed and calculated values of m q for all sites found using eq 7 are shown in fig 6 a the second component of ersm uses the difference between the observed snowmelt mobs and m q on any day j δmj defined as 9 δ m j m obs m q from observations mobs is known and m q can be calculated from eq 8 so that δm can be determined for each day in the analysis set there is no additional information regarding shortwave radiation that can be brought to bear without increasing the number of meteorological variables which contradicts the function of the ti snowmelt approach of relative simplicity therefore ti variable is used to provide additional information regarding the available radiation δm is estimated as a linear function of the ti 10 δ m j w ti j t b where w is an empirically determined coefficient and tb is an empirically determined base value using the first component of ersm the value of tb must equal the average value of ti for a given level of bin average q so that δmj 0 when mobs m q resulting from the least squares fit from eq 7 substituting the average value of ti for a given level of bin average q designated as ti q into eq 10 result in 11 δ m j w ti j ti q the determination of ti q follows the same process as m q recall that q was divided into bins of 2 54 mm and each day was assigned to the appropriate bin the values of ti in each bin were then averaged to arrive at a set of ti q the average ti at a given level of q a linear regression between ti q and q resulted in 12 ti q t n q t n 0 where tn and tn0 are the empirical coefficients found for the nth snotel site an example is shown for the snotel site big meadow in fig 5b eq 12 can be restated more compactly as 13 ti q t n q q n ti where q n ti t n 0 t n the values of tn tn0 and q n ti are listed in table 3 for each site along with the coefficient of determination r2 derived from a regression analysis the correlation between q and ti q varied but overall was reasonably high with coefficients of determination ranging from 0 33 to 0 88 a comparison of the observed and calculated values of ti q calculated using eq 12 for all sites is shown in fig 6b δm and ti ti q were plotted for all sites and days used in our analysis fig 7 there is a linear trend with a slope of 2 06 mm per c although there is substantial variance in data the intercept is close to zero at 0 61 mm within the measurement resolution of 2 54 mm the next step was to estimate the value of w at each site for each bin of q with the linear equation 14 w n q r n q r n 0 where wn q is the slope between δm and ti n ti q n for a given level of q and rn and rn0 are the empirical coefficients found for the nth snotel site q bins with fewer than 10 observations were not used in this equation results show a positive relationship between w and q fig 8 fig 9 shows a comparison between the calculated wn q and the observed values for all snotel sites used in the study using all sites the coefficent of determination between the calculated and observed wn q is approximately 0 62 the values of rn rn0 and qw n are listed in table 4 for each site along with the coefficient of determination r2 the correlation between wn q and q ranged widely from 0 004 to 0 624 this reflects a site specific relationship between air temperature and shortwave radiation and highlights site specific variations in the sky view factor and other parameters the final ersm equations are snowmelt on a given day mcalc is estimated as 15 m calc s n q q n l w n q t i ti q where mcalc in eq 15 is the calculated snowmelt and where ti daily temperature index q 1 α k q toa q n l l n s n q n ti t n 0 t n q n w r n 0 r n ti q t n q q n ti w n q r n q q n w the first term represents the site and date specific mean daily melt the second term represents the variability around the mean by using a site specific relationship between ti and potential shortwave radiation note that variables with the subscript n are specific to a given location and found empirically based on the snowmelt observations at each snotel site the coefficients sn and ql n are listed in table 2 tn and q n ti in table 3 and rn and qw n in table 4 2 2 5 melt factor for ti snowmelt model the basic ti snowmelt method equation for daily snowmelt is 16 m t m ft t at t b m ft ti t when tat tb mt 0 when tat tb where mt snowmelt over on day t tat the average air temperature c on day t tb the base temperature almost always 0 c mf t the melt factor mm day c on day t and tit the temperature index c on day t ersm can be used to estimate the melt factor mf using eq 15 as 17 m f s n q np q n l w n q np ti q np ti np w n q np a general melt factor pattern for each site calculated using eq 17 was developed and termed the melt factor normal pattern the melt factor normal pattern removes the day to day variation caused by ti which can obscure the seasonal trends in the melt factor at each site the melt factor normal pattern was found for each site using the following procedure first the average doy that the annual maximum swe occurred was selected for each site based on the snotel observations fig 2 this day served as the starting day of the normal pattern the length in days of the normal pattern was set equal to the average length of the melt season after the annual maximum swe fig 2 the ssa in days was then determined for each day of the normal pattern the snow surface albedo was then calculated using the equation shown in fig 3 based on the albedo values and the top of the atmosphere shortwave radiation q toa values of q for each day of the normal pattern denoted as q np were calculated the ti for each day was estimated using a smoothed approximation of the doy average ti based on sine functions only two periods were necessary to provide a very reasonable fit to the data the normal pattern ti tinp was estimated as 18 ti np ti avg n 1 2 a n sin n 2 π j 365 2 π ε n 365 where tiavg is the annual average ti an is the amplitude of the nth cycle j is the julian day of the year and εn is the phase of the nth cycle an and εn were estimated using the generalized reduced gradient method lasdon et al 1974 an example of the results is shown in fig 10 for the big meadow site along with the coefficients of the sine functions for that site separate coefficients were determined for each site the normal pattern melt factor mfnp for each site was then calculated for each day using the equation for mf eq 17 2 3 model evaluation the ersm performance was evaluated using several statistics including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge root mean squared error rmse average error and coefficient of determination r2 these statistics have been shown useful in evaluation of model performance for a variety of applications jackson et al 2019 specifically the kge gupta et al 2009 values can be used to determine if the model performance is better than simply using the average of the observations knoben et al 2019 states that when the mean of observations is used the kge is approximately equal to 0 41 a perfect model kge would be unity however even if kge values are negative the model may still be adding value to the predictions 3 results 3 1 daily snowmelt estimation the ersm was used to estimate the daily snowmelt at the 20 snotel sites in the upper trb over their period of record for the 13 199 days in the analysis the required inputs were the observed temperature index ti the ssa k used to calculate the albedo and top of atmosphere shortwave radiation q toa which was calculated based on doy and site location the observed and calculated doy average snowmelt align closely except for a few days in february when the calculated values are larger than the observed values fig 11 this indicates the difficulty ersm has in matching very small values of snowmelt less than 10 mm the standard deviations around the calculated doy snowmelt average are consistently less than the observed standard deviations fig 11 this suggests that ersm has difficulty in reproducing both very small and very large snowmelt values possibly due to the simplifying assumptions made in modeling snowmelt as a linear process ersm errors vary with observed daily snowmelt with the minimum average error and rmse occurring at 25 mm of daily snowmelt fig 12 the minimum errors are found for magnitudes of daily snowmelt at which the majority of snowmelt occurs it is also clear from fig 12 that ersm tends to overestimate when the observed values of daily snowmelt are small and underestimate when the observed values of daily snowmelt are large this observation is consistent with the standard deviation results in fig 11 the error statistics for snowmelt estimation for each snotel site are listed in table 5 the nse of the ersm model in estimating daily snowmelt ranges from 0 25 to 0 64 with a weighted average by the number of observations at each site of 0 44 the kge values ranged from 0 30 to 0 75 with a weighted average of 0 60 the ersm average error is quite small ranging from 2 03 to 0 00 mm while the rmse is larger ranging from 5 84 to 19 81 mm the weighted average for all sites of 10 41 mm the coefficients for the regression relationship between observed and calculated daily snowmelt are shown in the last columns along with the coefficient of determination r2 for all sites the slope of the best fit regression line is close to 1 0 ranging from 0 86 to 1 1 and averaging 0 97 the intercept is close to 0 ranging from 0 07 to 0 13 and averaging 0 01 the coefficient of determination ranges from 0 32 to 0 59 with a weighted average of 0 45 we applied the ersm to data which was not used in the training of the linear models the validation period used was wy 2020 2022 the nse kge average error rmse and r2 were all determined for each of the snotel sites in the upper trb comparing the validation error statistics to the error statistics produced during the ersm develop the metrics are generally similar for example the nse for prediction melt during the validation period ranged from 1 2 to 0 72 while the kge ranged from 0 13 to 0 84 the average error and rmse ranged from 4 5 mm to 4 3 mmm and 3 7 mm to 13 mm respectively the r2 ranged from 0 27 to 0 77 with a weighted average of 0 55 the error metrics for the validation period are provide in table s1 of the supplementary material an example of the observed and calculated daily snowmelt for both the training wy 1991 2019 and validation periods wy 2020 2022 for the big meadow snotel site is shown in fig 13 3 2 ti melt factor estimation the estimated melt factor results based on eq 17 are inherently variable day to day since this equation contains ti in the denominator in general both q and ti increase as the melt season advances but with considerable intra seasonal variation the mf is also location dependent and varies with the sn ql n q n ti and w coefficients for each snotel site as discussed in section 2 2 4 the ratio of radiation to ti dictates temporal changes in the mf such as the melt season maximum this implies that years with early snowmelt will have different mf than years with late snowmelt seasons the errors in estimating the mf are relatively larger than those of daily snowmelt simulations table 6 the mf nse and kge values range from 0 21 to 0 50 and 0 29 to 0 65 respectively the nse weighted average is 0 34 while the weighted kge average is 0 57 the mf average error is small ranging from 0 823 to 0 411 mm day c and the rms error is larger ranging from 1 692 to 4 755 mm day c with a weighted average for all sites of 3 292 mm day c table 6 the coefficients from regression analysis of the observed daily melt factor and the calculated daily melt factor are shown in the last columns of table 6 along with the coefficient of determination r2 the slope and the intercept of the best fit lines show considerably more variation than for the daily snowmelt values the coefficient of determination ranges from 0 212 to 0 563 with a weighted average of 0 41 the normal pattern melt factor and observed doy average melt factors for the big meadow site are shown in fig 14 the normal pattern melt factor for big meadow passes through the center of the observed doy average melt factors early in the melt season i e april and may the melt factor increases non linearly in comparison the melt factor becomes linear with a reduced slope later in the melt period similar calculations and patterns were found for each of the 20 snotel sites in the upper trb fig 15 there is a wide range of normal pattern melt factors in the upper trb as the site specific coefficients in eq 14 produced substantial variation for a single watershed similar to big meadow snotel several of the other snotel sites have non linearly increasing melt factors early in the melt season and nearly constant melt factors later in the ablation period based on the ersm results 4 discussion the ersm is an empirical model for estimating snowmelt based on observations of snow water equivalent swe and air temperature and was able to robustly predict snowmelt for the selected days for sites used in this study the snowmelt estimation error statistics vary with the magnitude of the observed daily snowmelt and the best results were found for magnitudes at which the majority of snowmelt occurs ersm s ability to predict daily snowmelt varies with the observed melt fig 11 the minimum average error and rms error occur at 25 mm of daily snowmelt with snowmelt overestimated at observed daily values less than this threshold and underestimated at observations greater than this threshold given the empirical approach of ersm it is probably not surprising that the best result occurs at the observed daily snowmelt that produces the most runoff over time since the large number of observed values would have greater influence on the linear model parameters the overestimation at small values of observed daily snowmelt and underestimation at larger values may also reflect systematic errors in the albedo estimation the trend is for small values of snowmelt to occur at the start of the melt period and large values to occur at the end although small and large values can occur at any time during the melt period this suggests that the albedo may be underestimated at new ssa and overestimated at older ssas improvements in the albedo estimation described above may improve these results finally factors that weren t accounted for such as snowpack temperature variations melt abstraction into the liquid water content held by the snowpack and turbulent heat fluxes may have more impact at these small and large values of observed daily snowmelt a particularly valuable application of ersm is its use to estimate the melt factor parameter required by hydrologic models using ti methods as shown in table 6 incorporating ersm into estimates can explain a large degree of the observed variance of the melt factor providing model improvements in cases where snowmelt measurements are unavailable or when used for forecasting and scenario modeling the normal pattern of the melt factor throughout the ablation period at a site can be developed based on the relevant statistics on the observed ablation period and air temperature this normal pattern can be compared to the actual seasons to gain insight into the actual melt factors likely to be expected and used for forecasting melt rates and timing of snow disappearance the first ersm component is an empirically determined relationship between the observed daily snowmelt and the daily potential shortwave radiation the daily potential shortwave radiation was determined using two calculated parameters the toa shortwave radiation and the albedo of the snow surface there are two ways that this daily potential shortwave radiation could be further refined the first is the application of a more sophisticated albedo estimation procedure more precise results could be possible if the snow surface albedo were estimated throughout the winter season to incorporate temporal variations from each new snowfall the second way that shortwave radiation could be refined in the ersm would be to account for the impact of clouds observed daily cloud cover fraction could be incorporated into the model to provide an estimate of the impact of clouds on shortwave radiation received at the snow surface given that a goal of this study was to limit the use of meteorological data required by ersm observed cloud cover fraction was not used however hargreaves and samani 1982 and bristow and campbell 1984 proposed methods for estimating solar radiation based on the difference between the daily maximum air temperature and minimum air temperature the approach of hargreaves especially has found wide acceptance and application hargreaves and allen 2003 allen 1997 almorox et al 2011 jahani et al 2017 expanding the ersm model to include the daily maximum and minimum air temperature seems a reasonable next step the second component of ersm calculates the difference between the estimated average snowmelt first component and the actual snowmelt observed on a given day improvements in this component would require explicit incorporation of additional parameters such as cloud cover sky view factor local topography and humidity that would allow further refinements in the estimation of net radiation additionally more explicit consideration of how vegetation impacts shortwave radiation through shading and net longwave radiation at each snotel site may further refine the accuracy of the ersm in our formulation eq 2 presents qlwnet as representing only net longwave radiation however this term could represent other energy fluxes e g turbulent if a site was known to have minimal net longwave energy inputs into the snowpack the ersm is a straightforward method to determine snowmelt and melt factors from the perspective of inputs required to estimate snowmelt a simpler model than ersm would use only the day of year as input we evaluated this simpler model and found increased error for the training period of wy 1991 2019 therefore the final input variables used in the ersm development provide a more accurate and potentially useful model for forecasting we have included ti in the ersm formulation which can readily be determined through air temperature forecasts finally the usefulness of a model can be evaluated by how much improvement the predicted value is compared to using an average of the observations again using the data from wy 2020 2022 the kge values for melt and melt factors ranged from 0 13 to 0 84 and 0 22 to 0 73 all kge values are greater than 0 41 which indicates he ersm performs better than using the average value from each snotel site knoben et al 2019 5 conclusion this study developed a novel approach for estimating snowmelt and assumes that snowmelt is equivalent to the sum of the shortwave radiation absorbed by the snowpack and the net longwave radiation at the snow surface the longwave radiation is implicitly estimated through its influence on the observed snowmelt ersm is an empirical model because it uses snowmelt and the air temperature calculated from swe and temperature observations at snotel sites as well as estimates of toa shortwave radiation and snow surface albedo to determine required model coefficients the ersm model was applied to 20 snotel sites in the upper trb located on the border of nevada and california the key conclusions from this work include daily snowmelt estimation can be performed without the need for complex snowmelt models by using only air temperature doy and geographic locations the spatial variability of melt factors based on ersm can be substantial as demonstrated in the upper trb the temporal variability of melt factors based on ersm are relatively large during early snowmelt months i e april and may but trends toward constant values later in the season the empirical approach of ersm does present limitations when estimating melt factors for ungauged locations the next steps for research with ersm are developing spatial patterns from other snotel locations within the western us the spatial patterns may also be important for estimating melt factors in ungauged watersheds additionally refining albedo estimates based on ssa could also improve model performance ersm also does not account for changes in the snowpack temperature or liquid water content ersm assumes that snowmelt is equivalent to the sum of the shortwave radiation absorbed by the snowpack and the net longwave radiation at the snow surface an analysis of the model error could be performed with additional energy balance component to determine accuracy gains compared to larger data requirements finally an evaluation of more complex statistical models could be peformed to evaluate potential accuracy increases to the linear models assumed in the ersm esrms ability to estimate ti model parameters using well established solar radiation concepts presents an alternative workflow to parameterize ti models during melt season ersm while needing similar data requires as ti snowmelt models does incorporate more of the energy fluxes that occur at the snow surface in melt factor calculations this study provides an incremental step toward finding better snowmelt estimates and methods which are important for water managers who are responsible for making real time decisions
