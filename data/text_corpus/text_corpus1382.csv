6910,for accurate flash flood forecasting and effective stormwater planning and management in urban areas it is necessary to model not only the natural channel systems but also the large and complex networks of storm drains in this work we describe a modular storm drain model that can easily be coupled with existing gridded distributed hydrologic models for real time flash flood forecasting and stormwater planning and management for large urban areas 100 km2 a salient feature of our approach is the use of the equivalent storm drain network esdn which approximates the actual network on the same grid as that of the distributed hydrologic model thereby rendering coupling simple and modular in the integrated model storm drain flow occurs through the simplified network coarsened to the resolution of the distributed hydrologic model without full 1d 2d dynamics or very detailed man made structures and features modeled the integrated model is applied to a 144 6 km2 area of five urban catchments in the cities of arlington and grand prairie in texas us comparisons at selected locations using kinematic wave flow simulations show that the esdn approximates the flow through the original network very well with attendant savings in computational amount and reduction in modeling complexities the impact of the storm drain network is assessed via a combination of simulation experiments sensitivity analysis and limited comparison with observed flow it is shown that the storm drain network in highly urbanized catchments in the study area is very effective in reducing surface flow at most locations for about 30 min following onset of significant rainfall that the existing stormwater infrastructure would lose effectiveness for approximately 30 of the study area with a 15 increase in imperviousness relative to the current conditions and that significant uncertainties exist in partitioning of surface flow into storm drain and natural channel flows due to sensitivity to inlet flow modeling with greatly reduced computing cost and modeling complexity the proposed approach offers a practical solution for integrated stormwater modeling for large urban areas for a wide range of applications the proposed approach cannot however resolve flow at sub grid scales and hence is not appropriate for very detailed modeling for small areas keywords equivalent storm drain network distributed hydrologic modeling integrated modeling flash flood forecasting stormwater planning and management 1 introduction flooding is one of the most significant natural hazards in urban areas and a significant cause for economic loss and inconvenience to the residents to mitigate hazards and to reduce negative impacts of flooding urban municipalities operate storm drain networks of varying capacity and complexity whereas the conveyance capacities of storm drain systems are generally much smaller than those of the natural channel systems rafieeinasab et al 2015 storm drain networks may significantly alter the severity of flooding and other negative impacts depending on the location of flooding and the magnitude of rainfall for accurate flash flood forecasting in urban areas it is therefore necessary to model not only the natural channel systems but also the large and complex networks of storm drains hénonin et al 2010 such a capability is also important for planning and management of stormwater infrastructure which has traditionally been designed on a site by site basis with the goal of keeping the post development peak flow from flooding events the same as before such practice however does not reduce the runoff or the total volume of stormwater and may still produce flooding downstream also with site by site design it is not possible to fully account for spatiotemporal variations of runoff and flow through natural and man made hydrologic and hydraulic systems or spatiotemporal variability of precipitation beyond the site scale as such the resulting stormwater system may not work effectively at larger watershed scales indeed mccuen 1979 and emerson et al 2005 showed that an unplanned system of site based stormwater control measures or best management practices can actually increase flooding on a watershed scale owing to the effect of many facilities discharging into a receiving water body in an uncoordinated fashion causing the very flooding problem the individual basins were built to solve nrc 2008 the ability to model the natural channel and storm drain systems jointly for large urban areas also allows objective assessment of performance of stormwater infrastructure from heavy to extreme precipitation under changing conditions many researchers have assessed the impacts of climate change on urban drainage systems and analyzed specific impacts on different small urban areas e g watt et al 2003 mailhot et al 2006a guo 2006 denault et al 2006 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 increase in intensity and frequency of heavy to extreme rainfall events may cause increase in sewer overflows and urban flooding mailhot et al 2006a willems et al 2012 nazari et al 2016 while the results vary depending on the urban catchment s response to such rainfall most conclude that urban areas are subject to increased probability of surcharge and resulting flooding as such a critical need exists in stormwater planning and management for capability to assess the performance of large storm drain networks under heavy to extreme rainfall changing land cover conditions and climate change norouzi et al 2018 integrated modeling of flow through natural channels and storm drains for small urban areas is not new bonnifait et al 2009 kim et al 2012 neal et al 2012 schumann et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 guidolin et al 2012 gires et al 2015 simões et al 2011 approaches such as 1d storm drain 2d surface flow modeling leandro et al 2009 have gained wide popularity and acceptance in recent years many urban hydraulic models of varying levels of sophistication currently exist such as hec 1 usace 1985 tr 20 and tr 55 soil conservation service 1983 1986 mouse dhi 1995 infoworks icm integrated catchment modeling innovyze 2012 mike urban andersen et al 2004 and stormwater management model swmm huber and dickinson 1988 just to name a few for real time applications over large areas 100 km2 however such approaches quickly become impractical because of modeling complexities and extremely large computational requirements pina et al 2016 chen et al 2012 duncan et al 2011 leitão et al 2010 distributed hydrologic models reed et al 2004 smith et al 2004 on the other hand are more suitable for real time application over large areas koren et al 2004 gochis et al 2014 but are intended to simulate mainly surface flows in order to add ability to model storm drains to distributed hydrologic models an integration with hydraulic models is needed the objective of this work is to develop a storm drain model that can easily be integrated with the existing gridded distributed hydrologic models for real time simulation of flow through both natural channels and storm drains for large urban areas the specific research questions addressed are 1 how to reduce the geometric complexity of a storm drain network into a simpler equivalent network 2 how to partition storm runoff into pipe and overland flow what are the largest sources of uncertainty in the above partitioning 3 how does the storm drain network alter the hydrologic response of urban catchments how does the response vary according to the size of the contributing area land cover and rainfall magnitude and 4 what is the relative importance of natural channels and storm drains in stormwater management and flood control at different spatiotemporal scales the new and significant contributions of this research are 1 development of an integrated model capable of simulating flow through both natural channels and storm drains for real time application for large urban areas 2 development of an automatic algorithm for derivation of equivalent storm drain network esdn for direct coupling with existing gridded distributed hydrologic model and 3 advances in understanding of hydrologic response of urban catchments to heavy to extreme rainfall from site to catchment scales the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the approach and method for integrated modeling section 3 describes the study area and data used section 4 presents the results section 5 summarizes the conclusions and future research recommendations 2 integrated modeling of natural channels and storm drain networks the general approach adopted in this work is to develop a storm drain module that can be coupled with the existing gridded distribute models with minimum changes to the latter the gridded distributed hydrologic model used in this work is the u s national weather service s nws hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model rdhm koren et al 2004 nws 2009 the rdhm has been used in many research and operational applications moreda et al 2006 reed et al 2007 nguyen et al 2012 fares et al 2014 habibi et al 2016 and is recognized as one of the best performing distributed hydrologic models reed et al 2004 smith et al 2012 moreda et al 2006 the rdhm operates on the rectangular hydrologic rainfall analysis project hrap projection grid greene and hudlow 1982 which has a resolution of approximately 4 km 4 km in mid latitudes whereas the a priori parameters are available for the continental us at 1 hrap resolution only the rdhm can operate at higher resolutions of 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 hrap etc in this work the 1 16 hrap resolution or about 250 m is used throughout the rdhm uses the sacramento model sac burnash et al 1973 for rainfall runoff modeling and the kinematic wave model chow et al 1988 koren et al 2004 for hillslope and channel routing surface runoff is routed within each cell through conceptual hillslopes that drain into the conceptual channel running through the same grid cell subsurface runoff from the sac is drained directly into the conceptual channel in developing the storm drain module modularity simplicity and computational efficiency are of great importance so that it may easily be integrated with the existing distributed models with gridded hillslope and channel routing by operating the storm drain module on the same grid as the gridded hydrologic model one only needs to partition runoff into natural channel and storm drain flows at each grid box route the flows separately and discharge the storm drain flow into the natural channel at outfall locations in this way adding the storm drain module to the gridded distributed model amounts only to adding a sink to the existing channel routing model if the grid box contains inlets and a source if the grid box contains outfalls fig 1 shows the schematic of this approach in the context of the rdhm the above modeling approach entails significant simplification of the relevant processes due e g to the coarse resolution of 250 m employed as such the proposed approach is not appropriate for certain applications which may require very high resolution modeling the spatial scale of the modeling domain of interest in this work is 100 1000 times larger than that in typical 1d 2d application gires et al 2015 simões et al 2011 the proposed approach hence represents a set of modeling choices carefully selected from the array of elements in storm drain and distributed hydrologic modeling toward an operational viable solution for large urban areas with the esdn approach the storm drain modeling sdm takes the following steps 1 determine the model resolution 2 derive the esdn from the actual storm drain network to the resolution of the rdhm 3 run the sac to determine surface and subsurface runoff for all grid cells 4 partition the surface runoff between the esdn and the natural channel network for all grid cells 5 route the storm drain flow through the esdn using a pipe flow approach and discharge into the natural channels at outfall containing grid cells 6 route the natural channel flow through the natural channel network and 7 repeat steps 3 through 6 for all time steps the following describes the storm drain module and its integration with the rdhm steps 2 through 6 in detail 2 1 hillslope routing the water depth over the conceptual hillslopes in each grid cell is modeled via kinematic wave routing koren et al 2004 1 h t l h q l h x r s 2 q l h 1 l h 1 n h 5 3 s 1 2 2 d 1 n h 5 3 s 1 2 where h denotes the water depth on the hillslopes m rs denotes the surface runoff rate m s q l h denotes the total discharge per unit area from all hillslopes in the grid box m s lh denotes the hillslope length m given by the area of a grid cell m2 divided by the total width of the hillslopes over which surface flow occurs m s denotes the slope of the hillslopes dimensionless n denotes the hillslope manning roughness coefficient s m1 3 d denotes the drainage density m 1 a parameter for subdividing a cell into equally sized overland flow planes and t denotes time s the drainage density d represents the reciprocal of the characteristic length scale of a hillslope within a cell and a constant value of 2 5 km 1 is assumed in this work the identity of 1 lh 2d in eq 2 stems from the assumed symmetry of the conceptual hillslopes draining into the natural channel that runs in the middle of the grid box for further details of the model and estimating parameters the reader is referred to koren et al 2004 2 2 channel routing with the inclusion of storm drain flow the rdhm routing model for natural channels koren et al 2004 is modified to the following 3 a t q x r g q l h f c l c q inlet l c q outfall l c 4 q q s a m where a denotes the wetted cross section of the natural channel m2 q denotes the flow though the natural channel m3 s rg denotes the subsurface runoff rate from sac m s q l h denotes the overland flow rate per unit area at the hillslope outlet m s see eqs 1 and 2 fc denotes the grid cell area m2 lc denote the channel

exponent parameter qs denotes the specific discharge m s and m denotes an exponent parameter in eq 3 the total flow into the storm drain network through the inlets in the grid cell cannot exceed the total flow generated from the hillslope at that grid cell or the total flow generated from the pavement area of the grid cell qpvmt see section 2 4 i e q inlet min q l h f c q pvmt the a priori parameter grids of qs and m are available from the nws for the continental us conus based on the 30 m resolution national elevation dataset from the nhdplus version 2 nhdplusv2 david et al 2011 the cell to cell connectivity is derived with the cell outlet tracing with an area threshold algorithm reed 2003 in this work the routing model parameters and the channel connectivity are rederived at 1 16 hrap resolution using the nws developed programs with eq 3 storm drain modeling amounts to modeling time varying qinlet and qoutfall at all grid boxes which is described below 2 3 equivalent storm drain network esdn the purpose of the esdn is to represent the actual network with a hydraulically equivalent virtual network that has only a single virtual pipe in each grid box in this way one may couple the storm drain module to the gridded distributed model only by adding sink and source terms in the existing channel routing model as shown in eq 3 deriving the esdn amounts to coarsening the real storm drain network such that the former approximates the mass and momentum balance of the latter within acceptable accuracy pipe networks generally consist of series and parallel pipes all such configurations may be combined and converted into a simple equivalent pipe jeppson 1974 multiple approaches exist for modeling equivalent pipe systems of series and parallel pipes under steady state and full flow conditions anderson and al jamal 1995 larock et al 2000 most approaches are based on adjusting the diameter and length or roughness of the pipes while keeping the other properties unchanged the resulting equivalent network produces the same pressure heads and head losses as the original network for all flow rates the main limitation with the above simplification is that although the resulting network is hydraulically equivalent to the original network it does not preserve travel time due to the steady state assumption to approximate both the hydraulics and the travel time for series and parallel pipes raczynski et al 2008 developed the hydraulic and travel time equivalent technique which is used in this work as described below to determine the equivalent pipe the equivalent diameter of the aggregated pipes is first determined using the average total travel time of series and parallel pipes the average total travel time across a set of series pipes is the sum of the travel times in each pipe for parallel pipes the total travel time is determined by discharge weighted average travel time whereas the computed equivalent length ensures that the travel time in the equivalent pipe will equal to the series or parallel pipes it does not ensure that the system will be hydraulically equivalent to maintain hydraulic consistency between the original and equivalent systems pipe roughness is determined from equivalent pipe relationships derived using conservation of energy across a set of pipes in parallel or series in this work the expression derived from the manning s equation is used to calculate the equivalent length habibi 2017 raczynski et al 2008 for derivation of the esdn it is necessary first to determine the flow directions of the real network for this purpose an automatic algorithm has been newly developed in r the program inputs the gis layers of inlets junctions outlets and pipe identifiers and coordinates and outputs flow directions in the real storm drain network the algorithm starts from the most downstream point of the network and moves upstream in the following sequence of operations 1 select an outfall from the outfall gis layer 2 identify all pipes that drain to the selected outfall 3 determine the flow direction for each pipe identified in step 2 based on elevation and 4 locate the immediate upstream point and repeat steps 2 and 3 the flow directions derived above for the actual storm drain network are used to derive the equivalent network using a second automatic algorithm developed in r which is described below 1 select an outfall in the real network and read flow directions for the branch of the actual network that drains to the outfall 2 select the most upstream grid box in the branch and search for any connecting pipes 3 calculate the equivalent pipe characteristics 4 repeat steps 2 and 3 until the actual pipes within the grid box are reduced to a single equivalent pipe 5 repeat steps 2 through 4 for all grid boxes that contain the branch until the outlet is reached and 6 repeat the above steps for all branches within the real network for the algorithmic details the reader is referred to habibi 2017 figs 2a and 2b show the original storm drain network and the resulting equivalent network for the five urban catchments on a 250 m grid respectively in these catchments there are about 22 000 storm drain pipes and open channels in the actual network which are reduced to about 2000 in the equivalent network some storm drain open channels are self contained and are not connected to any other structures such channels are considered as natural channels and excluded in the construction of the esdn to check the goodness of the equivalent network modeling the routing results using the full and equivalent networks for the johnson creek catchment see fig 3 are compared in fig 4 at the outfalls of six branches of the equivalent network for routing kinematic wave model is used for both networks using the same inflows see section 2 5 fig 4 shows that the hydrographs from the equivalent network are very close to those from the original network the comparisons are similar for the other catchments and are not shown the above results indicate that the equivalent network represents the storm drain network very well the esdn identified in this way is then connected to the natural channel network by mapping the former in hrap coordinates and assigning cell numbers that are common to both the natural channel and the equivalent storm drain networks missing values of slope and diameter for storm drains exist in the storm drain database provided by the cities of arlington and grand prairie in this work they are filled with estimates according to the following rules if the pipe diameter is unknown the pipe size is selected based on the standard pipe size chart and the sizes of the up and downstream pipes if the slope of the pipe is unknown the ground slope is used 2 4 flow into storm drains flow into the esdn is determined by modeling inlet flows under the following assumptions 1 runoff generated on the inlet bearing roadways drains first into the esdn based on head discharge inlet equations and provided that the sewer network is not full 2 if the storm drain network is full the runoff drains into the natural channel in that grid box and 3 all inlets in the same grid box share the same capacity there are four types of inlets typically used for urban drainage curb opening grate and combination of curb opening and grate inlets and linear drains akan and houghtalen 2003 txdot 2016 in the study area curb opening inlets dominate it is therefore assumed that all inlets are of this type weir or orifice equations have been used by many researchers to determine flow rate into a curb inlet fig 5 shows the flow rate as a function of water depth for three different inlet lengths see section 4 4 for the choice for the same inlet height and discharge coefficient based on leandro et al 2007 chen et al 2003 gallegos et al 2009 and txdot 2016 changing the inlet height or discharge coefficient has the same effect as changing the inlet length see eqs 5 and 6 below as such fig 5 depicts the sensitivity to inlet height or discharge coefficient as well the figure indicates that significant variations exist among different models and that txdot 2016 overlaps the most with the other models in this work txdot 2016 was used as described below clogging is accounted for by fractionally reducing the number of inlets in a grid box see section 4 4 other factors that may also modify inlet flow see e g leitão et al 2016 are not considered in this work for simplicity if the depth of flow in the gutter is less than or equal to 1 4 times the height of the inlet opening the inlet is assumed to operate as a weir txdot 2016 if there are nw such inlets in the grid cell the total flow into the esdn at that grid box is given by txdot 2016 5 q inlet n w c w l w y 3 2 i f y 1 4

and d denotes the height of the inlet opening m if y d the inlet is assumed to operate as an orifice note that the water depth y in eq 5 reflects the slope of the pavement from which the pavement flow drains into the inlet see eq 8 the total flow through no such orifices is given by txdot 2016 6 q inlet n o c o d l o 2 g y i f y d where c o denotes the orifice coefficient of 0 67 lo denotes the circumference of the orifice m and g denotes the gravitational acceleration m s2 at depths between 1 0 and 1 4 times the opening height flow is in a transition stage and is determined based on the smaller of the weir and orifice flows to determine y in eqs 5 and 6 water depth on the pavement in each grid box was modeled using kinematic wave routing analogous to that for hillslope routing in eqs 1 and 2 7 h pvmt t l pvmt q pvmt x i 8 q pvmt 1 l pvmt 1 n pvmt h pvmt 5 3 s 1 2 where hpvmt denotes the water depth on the pavement m i denotes the rain rate for the grid cell m s qpvmt denotes the flow on the pavement per unit area m s lpvmt denotes the pavement length m assumed to be f c m and npvmt denotes the manning s roughness coefficient for the pavement the total flow from the pavement area in a grid box qpvmt m3 s is given by q pvmt q pvmt f pvmt where fpvmt denotes the pavement area m2 estimated from the gis layers the water depth on the pavement hpvmt is used for y in eqs 5 and 6 if qinlet is larger than qpvmt qinlet is set to qpvmt if q inlet is smaller than the total hillslope flow into the channel q l h f c the remaining flow q l h f c q inlet is assumed to drain into the natural channel as shown in eq 3 in the highly unlikely case of q inlet q l h f c q inlet is set to q l h f c in reality the curb opening inlets intercept gutter flow whereas eqs 7 and 8 model sheet flow also a number of parameters in the routing and inlet flow models is subject to significant uncertainties to assess the impact of the parameters to partitioning of surface runoff into flow into the storm drain network and that into the natural channels a sensitivity analysis was carried out with respect to the key inlet flow model parameters see section 4 4 2 5 storm drain flow modeling flow through the esdn is modeled based on simplification of the continuity and momentum equations under the kinematic wave assumption chow et al 1988 9 dv d t q in q out 10 s f s 0 where v denotes the volume of water in the pipe m3 qin denotes the inflow rate m3 s and qout denotes the outflow rate m3 s if the upstream end of the pipe represents an inlet s we have qin qinlet if the downstream of the pipe represents an outfall s we have qout qoutfall the above simplification is valid if the variations in the hydrograph are gradual enough to result in a quasi steady flow for each pipe motiee 1996 and the pipe is not surcharged the momentum equation can be expressed via the manning s equation as chow et al 1988 11 a p n p p p 2 3 s o 1 2 3 5 q out 3 5 where ap denotes the wetted cross sectional

downstream water depth for the flowchart of the integrated model operation the reader is referred to habibi 2017 note that while multiple elements have been newly added as described above the only change necessary to the rdhm code itself is adding the source and sink terms in eq 3 3 study area and data used the study area includes five urban catchments in the cities of arlington and grand prairie in the dallas fort worth dfw area of tx with a combined area of 144 6 km2 see fig 2 the size and time to peak at the outlet of each catchment vary from 3 4 to 54 6 km2 and from 0 5 to 2 5 h respectively rafieeinasab et al 2015 for the storm drain network and topography in the study area and the percent impervious cover the reader is referred to rafieeinasab et al 2015 the average percent impervious cover varies from 31 in the fish creek catchment to 48 in the johnson creek catchment for the rdhm a total of 11 a priori parameters for the sac are available for the conus at 1 hrap resolution based on soil and land cover data anderson et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 in this work the sac parameters were derived at a resolution of 1 16 hrap for the study area norouzi 2016 using the computer program developed by the nws zhang et al 2011 the soil and land cover data used are from the soil survey geographic ssurgo database and the national land cover database nlcd for 2001 2006 and 2011 respectively in addition to the 11 a priori parameters pctim permanently impervious area was also derived for the study area at 1 16 hrap resolution for the sac which assumes that all rain that falls on the impervious area runs off without interception storage to evaluate the performance of the integrated model streamflow simulations were compared with observations for the study basins water level observations from pressure transducer sensors are available every 15 min from the high water warning system operated by the cities of arlington and grand prairie these observations were used previously to validate streamflow simulations rafieeinasab et al 2015 using rating curves derived via 1 d steady state non uniform hydraulic modeling kean and smith 2005 2010 norouzi et al 2015 high spatiotemporal resolution quantitative precipitation estimation qpe is essential for prediction of urban flash floods for the study area the dfw demonstration network of the collaborative adaptive sensing of the atmosphere casa program consisting of high resolution x band radars provides high resolution 500 m 1 min qpe chen and chandrasekar 2015 which also utilizes the next generation radar nexrad rafieeinasab et al 2014 2015 carried out comparative evaluation of different radar based qpe products for the study area they showed that in general the casa qpe is more accurate for larger precipitation amounts whereas the multisensor precipitation estimator mpe seo et al 2010 estimates are more accurate for smaller amounts in this work both the casa and mpe qpe products are used 4 results this section presents the results in four parts 1 comparison of the simulated flow at catchment outlets against observations to assess the ability of the model to well represent real flows in the natural channels 2 analysis of the integrated model results with and without storm drain modeling from site to catchment scales to assess the contributing area dependent impact of storm drains to surface flow 3 assessment of the impact of storm drains on peak flow under the existing land cover conditions and under a 15 increase in imperviousness and 4 assessment of the impact of the initial conditions of the storm drain flow model and the sensitivity of the conveyance volumes in the natural channel and storm drain networks to selected inlet flow model parameters 4 1 comparison with observed flow at catchment outlet the esdn modeled in this work include not only the storm drainage pipes but also the open channel to which storm drainage pipes are connected all other man made open channels not including roadways are considered as part of the natural channel network one may hence expect the conveyance capacity of the esdn to be relatively modest compared to that of the natural channel network rafieeinasab et al 2015 indicated that full capacity open channel storm drains can convey several times more flow than full flow storm drain pipes in the study area and that for a large event such as tropical storm ts hermine in 2010 the natural channels convey about 3 and 15 times as much flow as the full capacity man made open channels and pipes respectively ts hermine produced 160 mm of rainfall over a 24 h period in the study area which corresponds to a return period of about 25 years in the study area water level observations are available only at the catchment outlets where the discharge represents the combined flow through both the natural channels and storm drains as such comparison of streamflow at the outlets of sizable catchments is not likely to reveal the impact of storm drains on the other hand one may still compare the natural channel flow simulations with and without storm drain modeling with the observed flow to assess the quality of the integrated model simulation at the catchment scale the premise of such comparison is that if the model can simulate outlet flow realistically it is likely to be able to simulate flows from smaller contributing areas it is important to note that in this assessment we are not necessarily interested in the absolute accuracy of the simulation given the various sources of error instead our primary interest is in ascertaining whether the model response is realistic at the catchment scale relative to the observed flow so that the model response at smaller spatial scales is likely to be realistic figs 6a and 6b show the hyetographs top and the simulated vs observed hydrographs bottom for two events occurred in late november and december of 2015 respectively in the 14 4 km2 cottonwood creek at carrier outlet 6363 the total rainfall amounts are 120 mm over a 24 h period for the nov event fig 6a and 90 mm over a 48 h period for the dec event fig 6b which correspond to return periods of approximately 5 and 2 years respectively fig 6c shows the comparison of simulated flow vs observed water level for the jan 2017 event shown in fig 10a see section 4 2 at three additional outlet locations of 6043 arbor creek at tarrant 6083 n fork cottonwood at gswp and 6143 fish creek at gswp the contributing areas are 4 1 8 4 and 31 2 km2 respectively the rainfall data used is the casa qpe at 1 8 hrap and 1 min resolution the rdhm resolution is at 1 16 hrap figs 6a and 6b indicate that the model simulations are able to capture the events quite well but that they are not able to pick up very fast varying streamflow responses very well in addition the model simulation for the late dec event exhibits flow magnitude dependent errors the errors present in these simulations are not at all surprising in that they are based solely on the a priori model parameters for both soil moisture accounting and routing as no calibration was attempted in this work overall it is seen that the model is capable of producing realistic streamflow responses to significant rainfall events albeit with a mix of both amplitude seo et al 2009 and phase liu et al 2011 errors of varying magnitude comparison of streamflow simulations with red dashed line and without blue 2 for interpretation of color in figs 6a 7 and 12 the reader is referred to the web version of this article 2 dashed line storm drain modeling in fig 6a indicates that the differences between the two are indistinguishable for the larger nov event but that for the smaller dec event the peak flows at the outlet have increased slightly with storm drain modeling fig 6c which only allows qualitative comparison of flow vs stage generally supports the above observations fig 6c indicates that for outlet 6143 which is associated with the largest contributing area among the four significant hydrologic uncertainty exists which is likely to override the effects of storm drain modeling except perhaps for the most upstream areas as explained above discharge at the catchment outlet reflects both the natural channel and storm drain flows and hence is not very useful in assessing the impact of storm drains to assess performance at much smaller spatial scales a set of twin simulation experiments were carried out which is described below 4 2 impact of storm drains at different scales of contributing area in the dfw area the design of stormwater infrastructure calls for 25 yr 24 h design rainfall for conveyance and for 100 yr 24 h design rainfall for flood mitigation nctcog 2015 in this work we apply spatially uniform 100 yr 5 min and 24 h rainfall of constant rates to assess the impact of storm drain network on channel flow in response to impulse and step function forcings of rainfall respectively we then apply two actual events for additional assessment fig 7 shows the simulated hydrographs of channel flow with red solid line and without blue solid line sdm at all grid boxes in the johnson creek catchment outlet 6033 40 4 km2 due to a spatial uniform rainfall pulse of 280 7 mm hr lasting 5 min because the hydrographs shown in the figure represent the response of the contributing areas to what is essentially an impulse they may be considered as scaled unit hydrographs as expected the smaller the contributing area the faster the hydrologic response though difficult to see in this figure there are numerous hydrographs near the origin representing the response of very small contributing areas to help discern the hydrographs associated with storm drains from those without fig 8 shows the box and whisker plots of the surface flow in logarithmic scale at all grid boxes as a function of time elapsed with and without sdm in the figure the upper and lower ends of the box represent the 75th and 25th percentiles the line in the box represents the median and the ends of the whiskers represent median 1 58 i q r n where iqr denotes the inter quartile range and n denotes the sample size it is seen that the storm drains in this catchment reduce surface flow in the median sense for about 30 min and that at a number of locations the reduction persists well past 30 min for outlet 6133 of the fish creek catchment 54 3 km2 not shown it was observed that the storm drains reduce flow at most locations only for the first 10 min or less and that between 15 and 40 min or so there is a noticeable increase in flow with storm drains modeled the above observations suggest that the fish creek catchment may be susceptible to downstream flooding due to storm drains upstream to track the impact of storm drains on surface flow at each grid box during the course of the catchment response following an impulse rainfall fig 9 plots the ratio of the flow with storm drains to that without at all grid boxes in the johnson creek catchment due to 100 yr 5 min rainfall a ratio of less or greater than unity is an indication that the storm drains reduce or increase surface flow at that location respectively note in the figure that the storm drains reduce flow significantly for a very short duration at almost all grid cells that the flow remains reduced for the entire duration at many of the above locations but that there are locations where the storm drains increase flow between 5 and 50 min the results for other catchments are qualitatively similar and are not shown figs 10a and 10b show the hyetographs and box and whisker plots of the hydrographs with and without sdm for the johnson creek catchment gp6033 for the jan 16 2017 and may 29 2015 events respectively also shown are the rainfall maps based on the casa qpe the 2017 event a fast moving convective front which also spawned tornadoes produced up to 100 mm of rain in about 6 h in parts of the catchment the 2015 event which was the largest in dfw during the wettest ever may of that year produced up to 130 mm in about 7 h in large parts of arlington and grand prairie for the jan 2017 event it is seen that the storm drains reduce surface flow significantly and that at many locations the reduction persists throughout the event for the may 2015 event which had a return period of over 300 years for 6 h duration norouzi 2016 the storm drains had a very small impact as the extreme rainfall was widespread and quickly filled almost the entire storm drain network fig 10b for stormwater planning and management the locations where surface flow increases due to storm drains are of particular interest the following subsection describes how such areas may be identified by spatially mapping the changes in peak surface flow from the integrated model 4 3 impact of storm drains on peak flow to ascertain the locations where storm drains may increase or decrease peak surface flow the ratio of the peak flow with storm drains to that without is calculated at each grid cell and mapped over the entire catchment this ratio is referred to herein as the peak flow ratio pfr fig 11 shows the map of the pfr for a 100 yr 24 h rainfall amount of 280 7 mm for the entire study area note in the figure that the pfr is less than unity for most cells i e storm drains reduce peak flow and that the ratio is smaller for many grid cells where a large number of inlets exist fig 12 shows the map of the pfr exceeding unity but only for those cells that do not contain outfalls in this way we exclude the cells from consideration where the increase in peak flow is due to direct discharges from storm drains it is likely that some of the colored cells shown in fig 12 contain higher order natural streams for which the performance of storm drain systems may not be of concern all other colored cells in fig 12 may be considered as not being served well by the existing stormwater infrastructure in the sense that peak flow has increased due to storm drains compared to the storm drain less conditions in the dfw area and elsewhere continuing urbanization is expected to alter the hydrologic response of urban catchments analysis of the nlcd land cover of 2001 2006 and 2011 for the area indicates that imperviousness increased by about 15 percent between 2001 and 2011 norouzi 2016 fig 13 is the same as fig 11 but the peak flow with storm drains under the existing condition i e the denumerator in the pfr has been replaced with that under a uniform 15 increase in imperviousness in all catchments note that with the increase in imperviousness the size of the area of the pfr exceeding unity has increased by about 30 indicating that in many areas the existing storm drains would no longer be adequate 4 4 sensitivity to initial conditions of storm drain flow and inlet flow parameters because the residence time of stormwater in the storm drain network is only of the order of 10 h or less for the study catchments in most situations one may safely initialize the esdn with no flow conditions as the event progresses however the accuracy of the model state may deteriorate due to the growth of simulation error in time it is hence necessary to assess the impact of the initial flow conditions in the esdn on time to peak and peak flow to that end comparisons of time to peak and peak flow were made between the two bounding conditions of completely empty and full storm drains following a 100 yr return period rainfall of 5 min duration the results indicate that the accuracy of the state variable in the storm drain model ap in eq 11 may impact the quality of simulation significantly particularly when the storm drains may undergo successive cycles of filling and draining from successive short duration pulses of rainfall although flow through storm drain systems is well understood its modeling entails significant uncertainties pappenberger et al 2008 mantovan and todini 2006 in this work inlet flows are determined based on uniform kinematic wave water depth over the paved areas in each grid cell assuming either weir or orifice flow see section 2 4 in reality inlet flow is partitioned from gutter flow whose depth is typically larger than the uniform water depth over the entire pavement in inlet design inlet flow is determined by the interception rate or the efficiency of the inlet which depends on the gutter flow ttxdot 2016 in this work we assess the impact of selected inlet parameters to partitioning of hillslope runoff into inlet and channel flows by evaluating the sensitivity of weir flow in eq 5 to the inlet length lw because changing the number of inlets in the grid cell n or the weir coefficient cw has the same effect as changing lw analysis of sensitivity on lw amounts to that of all three parameters n cw and lw for this reason we chose a wide range of values for lw to encompass possible variations in n and cw as well in the study area both curb opening and depressed curb opening inlets exist for which the weir discharge coefficient cw is 0 374 and 0 286 respectively a typical curb opening inlet has a length of 2 5 m in the study area but at many locations the inlets are doubled to a length of 5 0 m inlets may be clogged which would effectively reduce n and or lw in inlet design clogging factors of 0 12 and 0 08 are suggested for one and two units of curb opening inlets guo and mackenzie 2012 which effectively reduces n in eq 5 to 0 88n and 0 92n respectively from the above one may arrive at the lower and upper bounds for ncwlw of 0 63n and 1 87n respectively to encompass approximately the above range of possible variations lw 1 7 2 5 and 5 0 m were chosen without reducing n and keeping cw 0 374 then lw 10 0 m and 50 0 m were added to assess the asymptotic behavior fig 14 shows the volume of stormwater conveyed by the natural channels vs the storm drains from spatially uniform 100 yr return period 5 min rainfall over the five catchments the uppermost dotted black line denotes the total stormwater volume conveyed both by the natural and storm drain networks different colors represent different nominal inlet lengths for each color the solid and dashed lines denote the stormwater conveyed by the natural channels and storm drains respectively the solid and dotted lines of the same color hence partition the total stormwater volume into natural channel and stormwater flow volume the following observations may be made in fig 14 the stormwater volume conveyed by storm drains with a nominal inlet length of 2 5 and 5 0 m is approximately 22 and 38 respectively of the total runoff volume for both 5 min and 24 h rainfall of 100 yr return period the limiting conveyance volume by storm drains is reached at the nominal inlet length of 50 m where over 60 of the surface runoff is conveyed by storm drains as expected the rate of increase in the runoff volume conveyed by storm drains decreases as the nominal inlet length increases i e there is diminishing marginal value in increasing the inlet capacity the above results indicate that significant uncertainties exist in partitioning surface runoff into natural channel and storm drain flows and that rigorous uncertainty analysis is necessary for comprehensive assessment with greatly reduced modeling complexity and computational requirements the integrated modeling approach proposed in this work makes such analysis readily possible currently simulation of a 24 h event for the study area of 144 6 km2 at a 250 m resolution with 1 min rainfall input takes about 3 h or about 12 5 s per time step on a 6 intel xeon cpu e5 2620 v2 2 10 ghz core computer with 65 gb memory the current version of the storm drain model has very large room for improvement in computational efficiency it is expected that multi fold and significant reduction in computing time is readily achievable with and without parallelization respectively a task left as a future endeavor 5 conclusions and future research recommendations for accurate flash flood forecasting and effective stormwater planning and management in urban areas it is necessary to model not only the natural channel systems but also the large and complex networks of storm drains whereas there exist many 1d 2d models most are not well suited for real time operation or large area implementation due to extremely large computational and modeling requirements noh et al 2018 high resolution distributed modeling on the other hand is now a common operational practice for water modeling and forecasting for large areas 100 km2 around the world see e g the national water model nwm in the us http water noaa gov about nwm in this work we propose a modular storm drain model which may be easily coupled with existing gridded distributed hydrologic models the proposed integrated model is applied to a 144 6 km2 area consisting of five urban catchments in the cities of arlington and grand prairie in texas us whereas the above domain is large by the stormwater modeling standards it represents only a small fraction of the large cities in dfw for reference the cities of dallas fort worth arlington and grand prairie which comprise the mid section of dfw have a combined area of about 2371 9 km2 the storm drain module described in this work is aimed at eventual operation for such large areas a salient feature of the proposed approach is the use of the equivalent storm drain network esdn which approximates the actual storm drain network on the same grid as the distributed hydrologic model thus rendering coupling of the storm drain module and the distributed model extremely simple the esdn uses the equivalent systems method of raczynski et al 2008 which has also been used by a number of researchers and practitioners for modeling flow through pipe networks mohamed and ahmed 2011 gad and mohammed 2014 choi and kang 2015 the gridded distributed hydrologic model used in this work is the nws s rdhm the main findings are as follows the esdn represents the real storm drain network very well at the catchment scale the impact of storm drains is not readily discernable because streamflow at the catchment outlet integrates both the natural channel and storm drain flows for smaller catchments it is seen that storm drain modeling increases peak flow at the outlet slightly for significant events to assess the impact of the storm drain network at all locations twin simulation experiments were carried out in which the integrated model was run with and without the storm drain module using impulse and step function design rainfall the results show that the storm drains are very effective in reducing surface flow for a short duration at almost all grid cells in the study area and that at many locations the flow remains reduced for the entire duration for the highly urbanized johnson creek catchment outlet 6033 the storm drain network reduces surface flow at most locations for about 30 min and that the reduction persists well past 30 min at many locations for the least impervious fish creek catchment outlet 6133 on the other hand the storm drain network reduces surface flow only for the first 10 min or less at most locations and increases noticeably between 15 and 40 min the above suggests that the fish creek catchment may be susceptible to downstream flooding due to storm drain flow from upstream the simulation results also reveal that there are locations in the johnson creek catchment where the existing storm drain network may increase peak flow compared to the storm drain less conditions and that with a 15 increase in imperviousness relative to the current conditions the existing stormwater infrastructure would lose effectiveness for approximately 30 of the study area the above results demonstrate the potential power of the integrated model for real time flash flood forecasting as well as planning and management of stormwater infrastructure for large urban areas the integrated model simulations also show that for the study area the stormwater volume conveyed by storm drains with a nominal inlet length of 2 5 and 5 0 m is approximately 22 and 38 respectively of the total runoff volume for both 5 min and 24 h rainfall of 100 yr return period as expected the rate of increase in the runoff volume conveyed by storm drains decreases as the nominal inlet length of the inlet increases indicating diminishing marginal value in increasing the inlet capacity the sensitivity to the inlet flow parameters indicates significant uncertainties in partitioning surface runoff into natural channel and storm drain flows whereas rigorous uncertainty analysis for stormwater infrastructure for a large area using 1d 2d modeling would be extremely expensive for modeling and computationally wise the integrated modeling approach proposed in this work makes such analysis possible even for very large areas due to the coarse resolution and simplifications however the proposed approach cannot resolve flow at sub grid scales and hence is not suitable for very detailed modeling for small areas validation of simulation results at sufficiently small spatial scales remains a large challenge due to lack of ubiquitous streamflow sensing it is noted that water level sensors are being deployed at small urban streams in the study area and elsewhere in dfw habibi et al 2017 and the crowdsourcing app iseeflood choe et al 2017 http ispuw uta edu nsf 8 1 1description html have also been launched to aid validation as well as real

2014 to forecast streamflow and other hydrologic variables over conus though wrf hydro and rdhm have significant differences in routing operations it is expected that the storm drain module developed

6910,for accurate flash flood forecasting and effective stormwater planning and management in urban areas it is necessary to model not only the natural channel systems but also the large and complex networks of storm drains in this work we describe a modular storm drain model that can easily be coupled with existing gridded distributed hydrologic models for real time flash flood forecasting and stormwater planning and management for large urban areas 100 km2 a salient feature of our approach is the use of the equivalent storm drain network esdn which approximates the actual network on the same grid as that of the distributed hydrologic model thereby rendering coupling simple and modular in the integrated model storm drain flow occurs through the simplified network coarsened to the resolution of the distributed hydrologic model without full 1d 2d dynamics or very detailed man made structures and features modeled the integrated model is applied to a 144 6 km2 area of five urban catchments in the cities of arlington and grand prairie in texas us comparisons at selected locations using kinematic wave flow simulations show that the esdn approximates the flow through the original network very well with attendant savings in computational amount and reduction in modeling complexities the impact of the storm drain network is assessed via a combination of simulation experiments sensitivity analysis and limited comparison with observed flow it is shown that the storm drain network in highly urbanized catchments in the study area is very effective in reducing surface flow at most locations for about 30 min following onset of significant rainfall that the existing stormwater infrastructure would lose effectiveness for approximately 30 of the study area with a 15 increase in imperviousness relative to the current conditions and that significant uncertainties exist in partitioning of surface flow into storm drain and natural channel flows due to sensitivity to inlet flow modeling with greatly reduced computing cost and modeling complexity the proposed approach offers a practical solution for integrated stormwater modeling for large urban areas for a wide range of applications the proposed approach cannot however resolve flow at sub grid scales and hence is not appropriate for very detailed modeling for small areas keywords equivalent storm drain network distributed hydrologic modeling integrated modeling flash flood forecasting stormwater planning and management 1 introduction flooding is one of the most significant natural hazards in urban areas and a significant cause for economic loss and inconvenience to the residents to mitigate hazards and to reduce negative impacts of flooding urban municipalities operate storm drain networks of varying capacity and complexity whereas the conveyance capacities of storm drain systems are generally much smaller than those of the natural channel systems rafieeinasab et al 2015 storm drain networks may significantly alter the severity of flooding and other negative impacts depending on the location of flooding and the magnitude of rainfall for accurate flash flood forecasting in urban areas it is therefore necessary to model not only the natural channel systems but also the large and complex networks of storm drains hénonin et al 2010 such a capability is also important for planning and management of stormwater infrastructure which has traditionally been designed on a site by site basis with the goal of keeping the post development peak flow from flooding events the same as before such practice however does not reduce the runoff or the total volume of stormwater and may still produce flooding downstream also with site by site design it is not possible to fully account for spatiotemporal variations of runoff and flow through natural and man made hydrologic and hydraulic systems or spatiotemporal variability of precipitation beyond the site scale as such the resulting stormwater system may not work effectively at larger watershed scales indeed mccuen 1979 and emerson et al 2005 showed that an unplanned system of site based stormwater control measures or best management practices can actually increase flooding on a watershed scale owing to the effect of many facilities discharging into a receiving water body in an uncoordinated fashion causing the very flooding problem the individual basins were built to solve nrc 2008 the ability to model the natural channel and storm drain systems jointly for large urban areas also allows objective assessment of performance of stormwater infrastructure from heavy to extreme precipitation under changing conditions many researchers have assessed the impacts of climate change on urban drainage systems and analyzed specific impacts on different small urban areas e g watt et al 2003 mailhot et al 2006a guo 2006 denault et al 2006 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 increase in intensity and frequency of heavy to extreme rainfall events may cause increase in sewer overflows and urban flooding mailhot et al 2006a willems et al 2012 nazari et al 2016 while the results vary depending on the urban catchment s response to such rainfall most conclude that urban areas are subject to increased probability of surcharge and resulting flooding as such a critical need exists in stormwater planning and management for capability to assess the performance of large storm drain networks under heavy to extreme rainfall changing land cover conditions and climate change norouzi et al 2018

guidolin et al 2012 gires et al 2015 simões et al 2011 approaches such as 1d storm drain 2d surface flow modeling leandro et al 2009 have gained wide popularity and acceptance in recent years many

however such approaches quickly become impractical because of modeling complexities and extremely large computational requirements pina et al 2016 chen et al 2012 duncan et al 2011 leitão et al 2010 distributed hydrologic models reed et al 2004 smith et al 2004 on the other hand are more suitable for real time application over large areas koren et al 2004 gochis et al 2014 but are intended to simulate mainly surface flows in order to add ability to model storm drains to distributed hydrologic models an integration with hydraulic models is needed the objective of this work is to develop a storm drain model that can easily be integrated with the existing gridded distributed hydrologic models for real time simulation of flow through both natural channels and storm drains for large urban areas the specific research questions addressed are 1 how to reduce the geometric complexity of a storm drain network into a simpler equivalent network 2 how to partition storm runoff into pipe and overland flow what are the largest sources of uncertainty in the above partitioning 3 how does the storm drain network alter the hydrologic response of urban catchments how does the response vary according to the size of the contributing area land cover and rainfall magnitude and 4 what is the relative importance of natural channels and storm drains in stormwater management and flood control at different spatiotemporal scales the new and significant contributions of this research are 1 development of an integrated model capable of simulating flow through both natural channels and storm drains for real time application for large urban areas 2 development of an automatic algorithm for derivation of equivalent storm drain network esdn for direct coupling with existing gridded distributed hydrologic model and 3 advances in understanding of hydrologic response of urban catchments to heavy to extreme rainfall from site to catchment scales the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the approach and method for integrated modeling section 3 describes the study area and data used section 4 presents the results section 5 summarizes the conclusions and future research recommendations 2 integrated modeling of natural channels and storm drain networks the general approach adopted in this work is to develop a storm drain module that can be coupled with the existing gridded distribute models with minimum changes to the latter the gridded distributed hydrologic model used in this work is the u s national weather service s nws hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model rdhm koren et al 2004 nws 2009 the rdhm has been used in many research and operational applications moreda et al 2006 reed et al 2007 nguyen et al 2012 fares et al 2014 habibi et al 2016 and is recognized as one of the best performing distributed hydrologic models reed et al 2004 smith et al 2012 moreda et al 2006 the rdhm operates on the rectangular hydrologic rainfall analysis project hrap projection grid greene and hudlow 1982 which has a resolution of approximately 4 km 4 km in mid latitudes whereas the a priori parameters are available for the continental us at 1 hrap resolution only the rdhm can operate at higher resolutions of 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 hrap etc in this work the 1 16 hrap resolution or about 250 m is used throughout the rdhm uses the sacramento model sac burnash et al 1973 for rainfall runoff modeling and the kinematic wave model chow et al 1988 koren et al 2004 for hillslope and channel routing surface runoff is routed within each cell through conceptual hillslopes that drain into the conceptual channel running through the same grid cell subsurface runoff from the sac is drained directly into the conceptual channel in developing the storm drain module modularity simplicity and computational efficiency are of great importance so that it may easily be integrated with the existing distributed models with gridded hillslope and channel routing by operating the storm drain module on the same grid as the gridded hydrologic model one only needs to partition runoff into natural channel and storm drain flows at each grid box route the flows separately and discharge the storm drain flow into the natural channel at outfall locations in this way adding the storm drain module to the gridded distributed model amounts only to adding a sink to the existing channel routing model if the grid box contains inlets and a source if the grid box contains outfalls fig 1 shows the schematic of this approach in the context of the rdhm the above modeling approach entails significant simplification of the relevant processes due e g to the coarse resolution of 250 m employed as such the proposed approach is not appropriate for certain applications which may require very high resolution modeling the spatial scale of the modeling domain of interest in this work is 100 1000 times larger than that in typical 1d 2d application gires et al 2015 simões et al 2011 the proposed approach hence represents a set of modeling choices carefully selected from the array of elements in storm drain and distributed hydrologic modeling toward an operational viable solution for large urban areas with the esdn approach the storm drain modeling sdm takes the following steps 1 determine the model resolution 2 derive the esdn from the actual storm drain network to the resolution of the rdhm 3 run the sac to determine surface and subsurface runoff for all grid cells 4 partition the surface runoff between the esdn and the natural channel network for all grid cells 5 route the storm drain flow through the esdn using a pipe flow approach and discharge into the natural channels at outfall containing grid cells 6 route the natural channel flow through the natural channel network and 7 repeat steps 3 through 6 for all time steps the following describes the storm drain module and its integration with the rdhm steps 2 through 6 in detail 2 1 hillslope routing the water depth over the conceptual hillslopes in each grid cell is modeled via kinematic wave routing koren et al 2004 1 h t l h q l h x r s 2 q l h 1 l h 1

grid box m s lh denotes the hillslope length m given by the area of a grid cell m2 divided by the total width of the hillslopes over which surface flow occurs m s denotes the slope of the hillslopes dimensionless n denotes the hillslope manning roughness coefficient s m1 3 d denotes the drainage density m 1 a parameter for subdividing a cell into equally sized overland flow planes and t denotes time s the drainage density d represents the reciprocal of the characteristic length scale of a hillslope within a cell and a constant value of 2 5 km 1 is assumed in this work the identity of 1 lh 2d in eq 2 stems from the assumed symmetry of the conceptual hillslopes draining into the natural channel that runs in the middle of the grid box for further details of the model and estimating parameters the reader is referred to koren et al 2004 2 2 channel routing with the inclusion of storm drain flow the rdhm routing model for natural channels koren et al 2004 is modified to the

parameter grids of qs and m are available from the nws for the continental us conus based on the 30 m resolution national elevation dataset from the nhdplus version 2 nhdplusv2 david et al 2011 the cell to cell connectivity is derived with the cell outlet tracing with an area threshold algorithm reed 2003 in this work the routing model parameters and the channel connectivity are rederived at 1 16 hrap resolution using the nws developed programs with eq 3 storm drain modeling amounts to modeling time varying qinlet and qoutfall at all grid boxes which is described below 2 3 equivalent storm drain network esdn the purpose of the esdn is to represent the actual network with a hydraulically equivalent virtual network that has only a single virtual pipe in each grid box in this way one may couple the storm drain module to the gridded distributed model only by adding sink and source terms in the existing channel routing model as shown in eq 3 deriving the esdn amounts to coarsening the real storm drain network such that the former approximates the mass and momentum balance of the latter within acceptable accuracy pipe networks generally consist of series and parallel pipes all such configurations may be combined and converted into a simple equivalent pipe jeppson 1974 multiple approaches exist for modeling equivalent pipe systems of series and parallel pipes under steady state and full flow conditions anderson and al jamal 1995 larock et al 2000 most approaches are based on adjusting the diameter and length or roughness of the pipes while keeping the other properties unchanged the resulting equivalent network produces the same pressure heads and head losses as the original network for all flow rates the main limitation with the above simplification is that although the resulting network is hydraulically equivalent to the original network it does not preserve travel time due to the steady state assumption to approximate both the hydraulics and the travel time for series and parallel pipes raczynski et al 2008 developed the hydraulic and travel time equivalent technique which is used in this work as described below to determine the equivalent pipe the equivalent diameter of the aggregated pipes is first determined using the average total travel time of series and parallel pipes the average total travel time across a set of series pipes is the sum of the travel times in each pipe for parallel pipes the total travel time is determined by discharge weighted average travel time whereas the computed equivalent length ensures that the travel time in the equivalent pipe will equal to the series or parallel pipes it does not ensure that the system will be hydraulically equivalent to maintain hydraulic consistency between the original and equivalent systems pipe roughness is determined from equivalent pipe relationships derived using conservation of energy across a set of pipes in parallel or series in this work the expression derived from the manning s equation is used to calculate the equivalent length habibi 2017 raczynski et al 2008 for derivation of the esdn it is necessary first to determine the flow directions of the real network for this purpose an automatic algorithm has been newly developed in r the program inputs the gis layers of inlets junctions outlets and pipe identifiers and coordinates and outputs flow directions in the real storm drain network the algorithm starts from the most downstream point of the network and moves upstream in the following sequence of operations 1 select an outfall from the outfall gis layer 2 identify all pipes that drain to the selected outfall 3 determine the flow direction for each pipe identified in step 2 based on elevation and 4 locate the immediate upstream point and repeat steps 2 and 3 the flow directions derived above for the actual storm drain network are used to derive the equivalent network using a second automatic algorithm developed in r which is described below 1 select an outfall in the real network and read flow directions for the branch of the actual network that drains to the outfall 2 select the most upstream grid box in the branch and search for any connecting pipes 3 calculate the equivalent pipe characteristics 4 repeat steps 2 and 3 until the actual pipes within the grid box are reduced to a single equivalent pipe 5 repeat steps 2 through 4 for all grid boxes that contain the branch until the outlet is reached and 6 repeat the above steps for all branches within the real network for the algorithmic details the reader is referred to habibi 2017 figs 2a and 2b show the original storm drain network and the resulting equivalent network for the five urban catchments on a 250 m grid respectively in these catchments there are about 22 000 storm drain pipes and open channels in the actual network which are reduced to about 2000 in the equivalent network some storm drain open channels are self contained and are not connected to any other structures such channels are considered as natural channels and excluded in the construction of the esdn to check the goodness of the equivalent network modeling the routing results using the full and equivalent networks for the johnson creek catchment see fig 3 are compared in fig 4 at the outfalls of six branches of the equivalent network for routing kinematic wave model is used for both networks using the same inflows see section 2 5 fig 4 shows that the hydrographs from the equivalent network are very close to those from the original network the comparisons are similar for the other catchments and are not shown the above results indicate that the equivalent network represents the storm drain network very well the esdn identified in this way is then connected to the natural channel network by mapping the former in hrap coordinates and assigning cell numbers that are common to both the natural channel and the equivalent storm drain networks missing values of slope and diameter for storm drains exist in the storm drain database provided by the cities of arlington and grand prairie in this work they are filled with estimates according to the following rules if the pipe diameter is unknown the pipe size is selected based on the standard pipe size chart and the sizes of the up and downstream pipes if the slope of the pipe is unknown the ground slope is used 2 4 flow into storm drains flow into the esdn is determined by modeling inlet flows under the following assumptions 1 runoff generated on the inlet bearing roadways drains first into the esdn based on head discharge inlet equations and provided that the sewer network is not full 2 if the storm drain network is full the runoff drains into the natural channel in that grid box and 3 all inlets in the same grid box share the same capacity there are four types of inlets typically used for urban drainage curb opening grate and combination of curb opening and grate inlets and linear drains akan and houghtalen 2003 txdot 2016 in the study area curb opening inlets dominate it is therefore assumed that all inlets are of this type weir or orifice equations have been used by many researchers to determine flow rate into a curb inlet fig 5 shows the flow rate as a function of water depth for three different inlet lengths see section 4 4 for the choice for the same inlet height and discharge coefficient based on leandro et al 2007 chen et al 2003 gallegos et al 2009 and txdot 2016 changing the inlet height or discharge coefficient has the same effect as changing the inlet length see eqs 5 and 6 below as such fig 5 depicts the sensitivity to inlet height or discharge coefficient as well the figure indicates that significant variations exist among different models and that txdot 2016 overlaps the most with the other models in this work txdot 2016 was used as described below clogging is accounted for by fractionally reducing the number of inlets in a grid box see section 4 4 other factors that may also modify inlet flow see e g leitão et al 2016 are not considered in this work for simplicity if the depth of flow in the gutter is less than or equal to 1 4 times the height of the inlet opening the

change necessary to the rdhm code itself is adding the source and sink terms in eq 3 3 study area and data used the study area includes five urban catchments in the cities of arlington and grand prairie in the dallas fort worth dfw area of tx with a combined area of 144 6 km2 see fig 2 the size and time to peak at the outlet of each catchment vary from 3 4 to 54 6 km2 and from 0 5 to 2 5 h respectively rafieeinasab et al 2015 for the storm drain network and topography in the study area and the percent impervious cover the reader is referred to rafieeinasab et al 2015 the average percent impervious cover varies from 31 in the fish creek catchment to 48 in the johnson creek catchment for the rdhm a total of 11 a priori parameters for the sac are available for the conus at 1 hrap resolution based on soil and land cover data anderson et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 in this work the sac parameters were derived at a resolution of 1 16 hrap for the study area norouzi 2016 using the computer program developed by the nws zhang et al 2011 the soil and land cover data used are from the soil survey geographic ssurgo database and the national land cover database nlcd for 2001 2006 and 2011 respectively in addition to the 11 a priori parameters pctim permanently impervious area was also derived for the study area at 1 16 hrap resolution for the sac which assumes that all rain that falls on the impervious area runs off without interception storage to evaluate the performance of the integrated model streamflow simulations were compared with observations for the study basins water level observations from pressure transducer sensors are available every 15 min from the high water warning system operated by the cities of arlington and grand prairie these observations were used previously to validate streamflow simulations rafieeinasab et al 2015 using rating curves derived via 1 d steady state non uniform hydraulic modeling kean and smith 2005 2010 norouzi et al 2015 high spatiotemporal resolution quantitative precipitation estimation qpe is essential for prediction of urban flash floods for the study area the dfw demonstration network of the collaborative adaptive

nexrad rafieeinasab et al 2014 2015 carried out comparative evaluation of different radar based qpe products for the study area they showed that in general the casa qpe is more accurate for larger precipitation amounts whereas the multisensor precipitation estimator mpe seo et al 2010 estimates are more accurate for smaller amounts in this work both the casa and mpe qpe products are used 4 results this section presents the results in four parts 1 comparison of the simulated flow at catchment outlets against observations to assess the ability of the model to well represent real flows in the natural channels 2 analysis of the integrated model results with and without storm drain modeling from site to catchment scales to assess the contributing area dependent impact of storm drains to surface flow 3 assessment of the impact of storm drains on peak flow under the existing land cover conditions and under a 15 increase in imperviousness and 4 assessment of the impact of the initial conditions of the storm drain flow model and the sensitivity of the conveyance volumes in the natural channel and storm drain networks to selected inlet flow model parameters 4 1 comparison with observed flow at catchment outlet the esdn modeled in this work include not only the storm drainage pipes but also the open channel to which storm drainage pipes are connected all other man made open channels not including roadways are considered as part of the natural channel network one may hence expect the conveyance capacity of the esdn to be relatively modest compared to that of the natural channel network rafieeinasab et al 2015 indicated that full capacity open channel storm drains can convey several times more flow than full flow storm drain pipes in the study area and that for a large event such as tropical storm ts hermine in 2010 the natural channels convey about 3 and 15 times as much flow as the full capacity man made open channels and pipes respectively ts hermine produced 160 mm of rainfall over a 24 h period in the study area which corresponds to a return period of about 25 years in the study area water level observations are available only at the catchment outlets where the discharge represents the combined flow through both the natural channels and storm drains as such comparison of streamflow at the outlets of sizable catchments is not likely to reveal the impact of storm drains on the other hand one may still compare the natural channel flow simulations with and without storm drain modeling with the observed flow to assess the quality of the integrated model simulation at the catchment scale the premise of such comparison is that if the model can simulate outlet flow realistically it is likely to be able to simulate flows from smaller contributing areas it is important to note that in this assessment we are not necessarily interested in the absolute accuracy of the simulation given the various sources of error instead our primary interest is in ascertaining whether the model response is realistic at the catchment scale relative to the observed flow so that the model response at smaller spatial scales is likely to be realistic figs 6a and 6b show the hyetographs top and the simulated vs observed hydrographs bottom for two events occurred in late november and december of 2015 respectively in the 14 4 km2 cottonwood creek at carrier outlet 6363 the total rainfall amounts are 120 mm over a 24 h period for the nov event fig 6a and 90 mm over a 48 h period for the dec event fig 6b which correspond to return periods of approximately 5 and 2 years respectively fig 6c shows the comparison of simulated flow vs observed water level for the jan 2017 event shown in fig 10a see section 4 2 at three additional outlet locations of 6043 arbor creek at tarrant 6083 n fork cottonwood at gswp and 6143 fish creek at gswp the contributing areas are 4 1 8 4 and 31 2 km2 respectively the rainfall data used is the casa qpe at 1 8 hrap and 1 min resolution the rdhm resolution is at 1 16 hrap figs 6a and 6b indicate that the model simulations are able to capture the events quite well but that they are not able to pick up very fast varying streamflow responses very well in addition the model simulation for the late dec event exhibits flow magnitude dependent errors the errors present in these simulations are not at all surprising in that they are based solely on the a priori model parameters for both soil moisture accounting and routing as no calibration was attempted in this work overall it is seen that the model is capable of producing realistic streamflow responses to significant rainfall events albeit with a mix of both amplitude seo et al 2009 and phase liu et al 2011 errors of varying magnitude comparison of streamflow simulations with red dashed line and without blue 2 for interpretation of color in figs 6a 7 and 12 the reader is referred to the web version of this article 2 dashed line storm drain modeling in fig 6a indicates that the differences between the two are indistinguishable for the larger nov event but that for the smaller dec event the peak flows at the outlet have increased slightly with storm drain modeling fig 6c which only allows qualitative comparison of flow vs stage generally supports the above observations fig 6c indicates that for outlet 6143 which is associated with the largest contributing area among the four significant hydrologic uncertainty exists which is likely to override the effects of storm drain modeling except perhaps for the most upstream areas as explained above discharge at the catchment outlet reflects both the natural channel and storm drain flows and hence is not very useful in assessing the impact of storm drains to assess performance at much smaller spatial scales a set of twin simulation experiments were carried out which is described below 4 2 impact of storm drains at different scales of contributing area in the dfw area the design of stormwater infrastructure calls for 25 yr 24 h design rainfall for conveyance and for 100 yr 24 h design rainfall for flood mitigation nctcog 2015 in this work we apply spatially uniform 100 yr 5 min and 24 h rainfall of constant rates to assess the impact of storm drain network on channel flow in response to impulse and step function forcings of rainfall respectively we then apply two actual events for additional assessment fig 7 shows the simulated hydrographs of channel flow with red solid line and without blue solid line sdm at all grid boxes in the johnson creek catchment outlet 6033 40 4 km2 due to a spatial uniform rainfall pulse of 280 7 mm hr lasting 5 min because the hydrographs shown in the figure represent the response of the contributing areas to what is essentially an impulse they may be considered as scaled unit hydrographs as expected the smaller the contributing area the faster the hydrologic response though difficult to see in this figure there are numerous hydrographs near the origin representing the response of very small contributing areas to help discern the hydrographs associated with storm drains from those without fig 8 shows the box and whisker plots of the surface flow in logarithmic scale at all grid boxes as a function of time elapsed with and without sdm in the figure the upper and lower ends of the box represent the 75th and 25th percentiles the line in the box represents the median and the ends of the whiskers represent median 1 58 i q r n where iqr denotes the inter quartile range and n denotes the sample size it is seen that the storm drains in this catchment reduce surface flow in the median sense for about 30 min and that at a number of locations the reduction persists well past 30 min for outlet 6133 of the fish creek catchment 54 3 km2 not shown it was observed that the storm drains reduce flow at most locations only for the first 10 min or less and that between 15 and 40 min or so there is a noticeable increase in flow with storm drains modeled the above observations suggest that the fish creek catchment may be susceptible to downstream flooding due to storm drains upstream to track the impact of storm drains on surface flow at each grid box during the course of the catchment response following an impulse rainfall fig 9 plots the ratio of the flow with storm drains to that without at all grid boxes in the johnson creek catchment due to 100 yr 5 min rainfall a ratio of less or greater than unity is an indication that the storm drains reduce or increase surface flow at that location respectively note in the figure that the storm drains reduce flow significantly for a very short duration at almost all grid cells that the flow remains reduced for the entire duration at many of the above locations but that there are locations where the storm drains increase flow between 5 and 50 min the results for other catchments are qualitatively similar and are not shown figs 10a and 10b show the hyetographs and box and whisker plots of the hydrographs with and without sdm for the johnson creek catchment gp6033 for the jan 16 2017 and may 29 2015 events respectively also shown are the rainfall maps based on the casa qpe the 2017 event a fast moving convective front which also spawned tornadoes produced up to 100 mm of rain in about 6 h in parts of the catchment the 2015 event which was the largest in dfw during the wettest ever may of that year produced up to 130 mm in about 7 h in large parts of arlington and grand prairie for the jan 2017 event it is seen that the storm drains reduce surface flow significantly and that at many locations the reduction persists throughout the event for the may 2015 event which had a return period of over 300 years for 6 h duration norouzi 2016 the storm drains had a very small impact as the extreme rainfall was widespread and quickly filled almost the entire storm drain network fig 10b for stormwater planning and management the locations where surface flow increases due to storm drains are of particular interest the following subsection describes how such areas may be identified by spatially mapping the changes in peak surface flow from the integrated model 4 3 impact of storm drains on peak flow to ascertain the locations where storm drains may increase or decrease peak surface flow the ratio of the peak flow with storm drains to that without is calculated at each grid cell and mapped over the entire catchment this ratio is referred to herein as the peak flow ratio pfr fig 11 shows the map of the pfr for a 100 yr 24 h rainfall amount of 280 7 mm for the entire study area note in the figure that the pfr is less than unity for most cells i e storm drains reduce peak flow and that the ratio is smaller for many grid cells where a large number of inlets exist fig 12 shows the map of the pfr exceeding unity but only for those cells that do not contain outfalls in this way we exclude the cells from consideration where the increase in peak flow is due to direct discharges from storm drains it is likely that some of the colored cells shown in fig 12 contain higher order natural streams for which the performance of storm drain systems may not be of concern all other colored cells in fig 12 may be considered as not being served well by the existing stormwater infrastructure in the sense that peak flow has increased due to storm drains compared to the storm drain less conditions in the dfw area and elsewhere continuing urbanization is expected to alter the hydrologic response of urban catchments analysis of the nlcd land cover of 2001 2006 and 2011 for the area indicates that imperviousness increased by about 15 percent between 2001 and 2011 norouzi 2016 fig 13 is the same as fig 11 but the peak flow with storm drains under the existing condition i e the denumerator in the pfr has been replaced with that under a uniform 15 increase in imperviousness in all catchments note that with the increase in imperviousness the size of the area of the pfr exceeding unity has increased by about 30 indicating that in many areas the existing storm drains would no longer be adequate 4 4 sensitivity to initial conditions of storm drain flow and inlet flow parameters because the residence time of stormwater in the storm drain network is only of the order of 10 h or less for the study catchments in most situations one may safely initialize the esdn with no flow conditions as the event progresses however the accuracy of the model state may deteriorate due to the growth of simulation error in time it is hence necessary to assess the impact of the initial flow conditions in the esdn on time to peak and peak flow to that end comparisons of time to peak and peak flow were made between the two bounding conditions of completely empty and full storm drains following a 100 yr return period rainfall of 5 min duration the results indicate that the accuracy of the state variable in the storm drain model ap in eq 11 may impact the quality of simulation significantly particularly when the storm drains may undergo successive cycles of filling and draining from successive short duration pulses of rainfall although flow through storm drain systems is well understood its modeling entails significant uncertainties pappenberger et al 2008 mantovan and todini 2006 in this work inlet flows are determined based on uniform kinematic wave water depth over the paved areas in each grid cell assuming either weir or orifice flow see section 2 4 in reality inlet flow is partitioned from gutter flow whose depth is typically larger than the uniform water depth over the entire pavement in inlet design inlet flow is determined by the interception rate or the efficiency of the inlet which depends on the gutter flow ttxdot 2016 in this work we assess the impact of selected inlet parameters to partitioning of hillslope runoff into inlet and channel flows by evaluating the sensitivity of weir flow in eq 5 to the inlet length lw because changing the number of inlets in the grid cell n or the weir coefficient cw has the same effect as changing lw analysis of sensitivity on lw amounts to that of all three parameters n cw and lw for this reason we chose a wide range of values for lw to encompass possible variations in n and cw as well in the study area both curb opening and depressed curb opening inlets exist for which the weir discharge coefficient cw is 0 374 and 0 286 respectively a typical curb opening inlet has a length of 2 5 m in the study area but at many locations the inlets are doubled to a length of 5 0 m inlets may be clogged which would effectively reduce n and or lw in inlet design clogging factors of 0 12 and 0 08 are suggested for one and two units of curb opening inlets guo and mackenzie 2012 which effectively reduces n in eq 5 to 0 88n and 0 92n respectively from the above one may arrive at the lower and upper bounds for ncwlw of 0 63n and 1 87n respectively to encompass approximately the above range of possible variations lw 1 7 2 5 and 5 0 m were chosen without reducing n and keeping cw 0 374 then lw 10 0 m and 50 0 m were added to assess the asymptotic behavior fig 14 shows the volume of stormwater conveyed by the natural channels vs the storm drains from spatially uniform 100 yr return period 5 min rainfall over the five catchments the uppermost dotted black line denotes the total stormwater volume conveyed both by the natural and storm drain networks different colors represent different nominal inlet lengths for each color the solid and dashed lines denote the stormwater conveyed by the natural channels and storm drains respectively the solid and dotted lines of the same color hence partition the total stormwater volume into natural channel and stormwater flow volume the following observations may be made in fig 14 the stormwater volume conveyed by storm drains with a nominal inlet length of 2 5 and 5 0 m is approximately 22 and 38 respectively of the total runoff volume for both 5 min and 24 h rainfall of 100 yr return period the limiting conveyance volume by storm drains is reached at the nominal inlet length of 50 m where over 60 of the surface runoff is conveyed by storm drains as expected the rate of increase in the runoff volume conveyed by storm drains decreases as the nominal inlet length increases i e there is diminishing marginal value in increasing the inlet capacity the above results indicate that significant uncertainties exist in partitioning surface runoff into natural channel and storm drain flows and that rigorous uncertainty analysis is necessary for comprehensive assessment with greatly reduced modeling complexity and computational requirements the integrated modeling approach proposed in this work makes such analysis readily possible currently simulation of a 24 h event for the study area of 144 6 km2 at a 250 m resolution with 1 min rainfall input takes about 3 h or about 12 5 s per time step on a 6 intel xeon cpu e5 2620 v2 2 10 ghz core computer with 65 gb memory the current version of the storm drain model has very large room for improvement in computational efficiency it is expected that multi fold and significant reduction in computing time is readily achievable with and without parallelization respectively a task left as a future endeavor 5 conclusions and future research recommendations for accurate flash flood forecasting and effective stormwater planning and management in urban areas it is necessary to model not only the natural channel systems but also the large and complex networks of storm drains whereas there exist many 1d 2d models most are not well suited for real time operation or large area implementation due to extremely large computational and modeling requirements noh et al 2018 high resolution distributed modeling on the other hand is now a common operational practice for water modeling and forecasting for large areas 100 km2 around the world see e g the national water model nwm in the us http water noaa gov about nwm in this work we propose a modular storm drain model which may be easily coupled with existing gridded distributed hydrologic models the proposed integrated model is applied to a 144 6 km2 area consisting of five urban catchments in the cities of arlington and grand prairie in texas us whereas the above domain is large by the stormwater modeling standards it represents only a small fraction of the large cities in dfw for reference the cities of dallas fort worth arlington and grand prairie which comprise the mid section of dfw have a combined area of about 2371 9 km2 the storm drain module described in this work is aimed at eventual operation for such large areas a salient feature of the proposed approach is the use of the equivalent storm drain network esdn which approximates the actual storm drain network on the same grid as the distributed hydrologic model thus rendering coupling of the storm drain module and the distributed model extremely simple the esdn uses the equivalent systems method of raczynski et al 2008 which has also been used by a number of researchers and practitioners for modeling flow through pipe networks mohamed and ahmed 2011 gad and mohammed 2014 choi and kang 2015 the gridded distributed hydrologic model used in this work is the nws s rdhm the main findings are as follows the esdn represents the real storm drain network very well at the catchment scale the impact of storm drains is not readily discernable because streamflow at the catchment outlet integrates both the natural channel and storm drain flows for smaller catchments it is seen that storm drain modeling increases peak flow at the outlet slightly for significant events to assess the impact of the storm drain network at all locations twin simulation experiments were carried out in which the integrated model was run with and without the storm drain module using impulse and step function design rainfall the results show that the storm drains are very effective in reducing surface flow for a short duration at almost all grid cells in the study area and that at many locations the flow remains reduced for the entire duration for the highly urbanized johnson creek catchment outlet 6033 the storm drain network reduces surface flow at most locations for about 30 min and that the reduction persists well past 30 min at many locations for the least impervious fish creek catchment outlet 6133 on the other hand the storm drain network reduces surface flow only for the first 10 min or less at most locations and increases noticeably between 15 and 40 min the above suggests that the fish creek catchment may be susceptible to downstream flooding due to storm drain flow from upstream the simulation results also reveal that there are locations in the johnson creek catchment where the existing storm drain network may increase peak flow compared to the storm drain less conditions and that with a 15 increase in imperviousness relative to the current conditions the existing stormwater infrastructure would lose effectiveness for approximately 30 of the study area the above results demonstrate the potential power of the integrated model for real time flash flood forecasting as well as planning and management of stormwater infrastructure for large urban areas the integrated model simulations also show that for the study area the stormwater volume conveyed by storm drains with a nominal inlet length of 2 5 and 5 0 m is approximately 22 and 38 respectively of the total runoff volume for both 5 min and 24 h rainfall of 100 yr return period as expected the rate of increase in the runoff volume conveyed by storm drains decreases as the nominal inlet length of the inlet increases indicating diminishing marginal value in increasing the inlet capacity the sensitivity to the inlet flow parameters indicates significant uncertainties in partitioning surface runoff into natural channel and storm drain flows whereas rigorous uncertainty analysis for stormwater infrastructure for a large area using 1d 2d modeling would be extremely expensive for modeling and computationally wise the integrated modeling approach proposed in this work makes such analysis possible even for very large areas due to the coarse resolution and simplifications however the proposed approach cannot resolve flow at sub grid scales and hence is not suitable for very detailed modeling for small areas validation of simulation results at sufficiently small spatial scales remains a large challenge due to lack of ubiquitous streamflow sensing it is noted that water level sensors are being deployed at small urban streams in the study area and elsewhere in dfw habibi et al 2017 and the crowdsourcing app iseeflood choe et al 2017 http ispuw uta edu nsf 8 1 1description html have also been launched to aid validation as well as real

6911,the mekong region home to one of the world s great rivers the mekong is also one of the world s most geostrategic regions featuring seemingly conflicting interests among regional states including viet nam thailand myanmar laos and cambodia and world powers such as china and the united states of america for nearly a century some of the riparian states have developed parts of the basin in their territories to great benefits and harm and recently the remaining late developing countries are catching up with water and related resources development plans to dam withdraw and use the mighty mekong to fund national progress and alleviate poverty world leaders academics ngos media and even some government officials have warned that the current rush to development is not only bringing a sure death to a great previously untamed river potentially displacing millions of people and threatening livelihoods but would also usher in an era of aggravated tensions and possibly even conflict the mekong river commission mrc tasked to manage the river for the sake of the environment and the people is failing its mission with work that has been ineffective uninfluential and wasted critics say yet this scenario is both wrong in its thesis about mekong development and misleading in its understanding of mrc s role and work while past and current water resources development in the region has brought challenges and risks associated with changes in the river system these have not led to widespread destruction of livelihoods and conflict among riparian countries a critical factor preventing conflict and managing tensions as well as supporting optimal and sustainable development is the mrc and its water diplomacy framework which has a technical core to provide objective scientific advices and legal institutional and strategic mechanisms that facilitate and support negotiated solutions to complex water and related problems while challenges remain for the mrc as an organization its water diplomacy framework has gradually been established and strengthened as the cases of managing tensions and potential conflicts in the mekong for the past twenty years illustrate keywords mekong river mekong river commission water diplomacy conflict management prior consultation hydropower geo politics 1 introduction the mekong region is a geo political hotspot featuring seemingly conflicting interests among regional states including china viet nam thailand myanmar laos and cambodia furthermore various regional and international powers have for centuries shaped its fate the mekong river as a natural resource has received international attention on many occasions be it for research missions on its immense biodiversity its exploitation for development purposes or for its protection as one of the last almost untamed great rivers on the planet various plans and perceptions clash resulting in tensions and possibly even conflict not enough credit is given to the regional institutional frameworks in the mekong basin in the management of tensions and disputes on transboundary water resources in this regard while there are other actors only one organization in the region has the legal mandate from the lower mekong basin countries to coordinate jointly plan and balance socially and environmentally just development of the catchment including its protection and the conservation of resources 2 although the paper is focused on the primary unique and critical role of the mrc in mekong water governance and development we acknowledge the important roles of other actors in the region including non governmental ones see for example 1 lebel l dore j daniel r koma y s 2007 democratizing water governance in the mekong region in l lebel r daniel editors m power book series on water

mighty river in vientiane with national coordinating offices of its four member countries in phnom penh vientiane bangkok and hanoi as well as ho chi minh city its framework and tools in operation have however not been well understood by many actors and stakeholders its conflict management role is rarely recognized tasked as the river manager the mrc draws different expectations as regards its role mandate and responsibility some viewed it as a failed regulator of the river some as merely a research organization and others as a talk shop without any teeth in reality far from being an onlooker dore and lazarus 2009 p 361 the mrc has succeeded in bringing together its member countries partners and stakeholders from the region and elsewhere to jointly discuss water and related issues and take action this was however frequently overshadowed by sporadic unsuccessful attempts in reaching agreement on development matters the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how mrc s role has evolved over time as a technical knowledge hub and a platform for water diplomacy facilitating water related negotiations in the region after a short overview on the mekong river basin the mekong is put into its historical context not only have riparian countries been in hostility for centuries global powers also intervened and exercised their influence research and development plans on the mekong river to grasp and cultivate its prosperity have gone hand in hand with mekong institutional development and the path leading up to the establishment of the mrc of today to illustrate the mrc s water diplomacy framework in action four cases are presented i the yali falls hydropower project on a significant mekong tributary ii china s development of the upper mekong iii the first three

people the mean annual discharge of the mekong is approximately 475 km3 most flow is contributed from tributaries in the lower mekong basin flow from the upper mekong contributes only a small portion to the annual flow of the mekong but in the dry season it is significant constituting up to 40 on average china contributes 17 myanmar less than 1 laos 41 thailand 15 cambodia 19 and viet nam 8 to the annual discharge a distinct characteristic for the mekong is its high seasonal flow variation due to the southwest monsoon generating wet and dry seasons usually the flood season lasts from june to november and the dry season from december to may many key ecosystems and fish depend on these seasonal changes during the dry season many fish species migrate to deep pools in the mainstream for spawning they return to nutrient rich grounds at phnom penh the seasonal changes of water level cause the water flow reversal to and from the tonle sap lake one of the most unique hydrological

respectively build more or less equally powerful kingdoms the lao kingdom of lane xang first consolidated under king fa ngum in 1353 and reaching its peak under king suriyavongsa in the 17th century composing of modern day laos and northeastern thailand was one of the largest kingdoms in southeast asia for over three centuries the mekong river ran through its entire territory after leaving china and before entering cambodia while relations were happy until the 18th century ngaosyvathn 1985 p 1251 military conflict occurred between the two in the late 1770s when lane xang was incorporated into the siamese kingdom for over a hundred years until the early 1890s the history between cambodia and thailand is also deep going back as far as the 13th century when the siamese kingdom of soukhothai broke away from the khmer empire of angkor subsequently various siamese and khmer kingdoms would engage in wars and interventions in the mid 14th century mid late 15th century late 16th century early 17th century early and late 18th century and early 19th century cambodian vietnamese rivalry also dated back to the 13th century when the khmer empire came gradually under vietnamese influence and direct control by the 19th century 3 2 mekong sites global battle ground on top of this history of warring nations and states is the fundamental fact that the mekong region is located in southeast asia which is classified in political geography as one of a few regions on earth as a shatterbelt a large strategically located region that is occupied by a number of conflicting states and is caught between the conflicting interests of adjoining great powers cohen 1963 p 83 this means that national and regional processes could not be developed or understood purely independently without taking into account external influences major powers throughout time from britain france the united states soviet union russia to japan and china intervened one time or another in the region the region has rarely been left to its own fate one can see this intervention clearly when britain colonized burma in the 19th century and basically put an end to warring burmese siamese relations france colonized viet nam cambodia and laos in the same century and pulled half of lan xang the left bank of the mekong river for incorporation into french indochina giving the other half the right bank of the mekong to siam leaving thailand un colonized and as a buffer state between the two external powers at the time it was also during french colonization that the khmer kingdom lost much of its southern cone including a large chunk of the mekong delta outside players would hitherto shape the course of history of the region and the mekong from the 2nd world war in which the japanese occupied the region and displaced the british and the french to the post war era in which americans soviets and chinese directly sponsored supported and intervened on different sides of the indochina viet nam laos cambodian vietnamese wars of the 1970s to 1990s lastly even in the contemporary period border skirmishes and confrontations sometimes flared up among the mekong riparian states including between cambodia and viet nam 1975 1977 thailand and viet nam cambodia 1979 1989 viet nam and china 1979 laos and thailand 1987 1988 and cambodia and thailand 1950s 2008 2011 under the context of these historical altercations and contemporary scrimmages complicated by additional layers of outside meddling no wonder every time tension popped up among the countries critics prophesized that it would lead to conflicts the australian historian milton osborne even subtitled his popular book about the mekong turbulent past uncertain future osborne 2000 7 see also his earlier book osborne m 1999 river road to

contributors to this publication 9 the un economic commission for asia and the far east s ecafe now the un economic and social commission for asia and the pacific escap bureau for flood control presented a first report in 1952 on mekong flood control and water resources development proposing studies to fill knowledge gaps five years later ecafe released a landmark report on development of water resources in the lower mekong basin proposing irrigation and hydropower plans as well as an institutional framework that would lay the ground for the creation of the mekong committee with cambodia laos thailand and viet nam as members in 1957 the first institutional cooperation framework for the lower mekong and the predecessor of the mrc the 1957 report drew up initial mainstream dam projects of pa mong khemerat khone falls sambor and tonle sap not to be outshined american agencies and institutions were also influential in the early post war days considered the first mekong basin planning document the 1956 reconnaissance report lower mekong basin of the us bureau of reclamation department of interior called for extensive data gathering and studies on agriculture fisheries navigation and education another famous american agency the us army corps of engineers usace department of defense conducted a mission led by general raymond wheeler in 1958 that saw the great potential of the lower mekong for service to the riparian countries in the fields of navigation hydropower generation irrigation and other related water uses he recommended pa mong sambor and tonle sap as the top three dams in 1962 the us ford foundation sent out a mission led by the distinguished environmental geographer gilbert white to explore the mekong it concluded with a report economic and social aspects of lower mekong development stating that the mekong scheme has a great potential for transforming the life of peoples of the basin four years later the us bureau of reclamation undertook a comprehensive feasibility report of the pa mong mainstream multi purpose dam a 4800 megawatt flagship project upstream of vientiane that would spur and symbolize the development of the mighty river us and un passions to turn the mekong from a region of war to a region of prosperity were not limited to technical agencies but a matter of high politics american president lyndon johnson at that time espoused that the us wanted a mekong river program that would dwarf the tennessee valley authority while un secretary general u thant proclaimed the mekong river project as one of most significant actions undertaken by un hence from early missions investigations and studies that influenced the mekong committee came the ambitious indicative basin plan of 1970 with some 180 projects the plan commissioned by the committee proposed a short term 2 billion program until 1980 including 700 000 ha of irrigation expansion and 3273 megawatt of hydropower on tributaries a 10 billion long term program for 1981 2000 comprising a cascade of mainstream dams part of a list of 17 mainstream projects for 17 000 megawatt the indicative basin plan foresaw major benefits in terms of flood control expansion of power and irrigation development as well as extension of navigation by about 800 km this was not to be at least not yet while some tributary projects were implemented and substantial funding gained for plan implementation mainstream projects that required active cooperation among the riparians could not materialize due to returning instabilities and fighting in indochina in the 1970 s once again conflicts decimated hopes and desires for development and prosperity in addition a legal hurdle was put up with the 1975 joint declaration of principles by the mekong committee in which article x states mainstream waters are a resource of common interest not subject to major unilateral appropriation by any riparian state without prior approval by the other basin states through the committee this clause on the one hand contributed to the prevention of mainstream development and for a long time saved the mekong as one of the last great rivers that was free flowing on the other hand some argue it also stifled economic growth while the western world benefited from water resources exploitation before and during the same period take the united states for example which has about 80 000 dams of which about 8000 are large dams the colorado river a transboundary river with mexico was extensively developed throughout the 20th century as was the case with the large columbia river shared with canada or australia which as a federal system gives its states rights and control over water resources that has built almost 500 large dams three fourths of which came after 1950 or japan which has built nearly 450 large dams for flood control and hydropower or even small norway which became known as a hydropower powerhouse in europe with about 1110 hydropower plants totalling 29 000 megawatt of installed capacity more or less the entire potential of the lower mekong in the mekong case due to conflicts on the backdrop of external power struggles the 1970 indicative basin plan with only 16 out of 180 projects implemented was revised down and scaled back in 1987 with a cascade of smaller dams along the mainstream divided into 29 projects 26 of which were national in scope contrary to the multipurpose nature of the 1970 plan the focus became hydropower with secondary benefits for other sectors the largest project was still the mainstream pa mong with modifications called low pa mong dam the 1987 indicative basin plan was put out by the interim mekong committee interim because cambodia was not a member due to internal political instability keeping the country away from mekong cooperation for more than ten years from the late 1970s to the early 1990s when peace returned to cambodia with the signing of the paris accords in 1991 the country joined the other three lower riparians of laos thailand and viet nam to negotiate a new mekong cooperation treaty the agreement on the cooperation for the sustainable development of the mekong river basin of 5 april 1995 the 1995 mekong agreement a new inter governmental framework for cooperation one outside the un system was established the mrc leading up to the creation of the new organization and shortly afterwards international support and influences remained palpable the un development programme undp supported the negotiation of the 1995 mekong agreement 10 with the mrc out of the un system in 1995 un organizations have played minor roles in mekong water affairs ever since 10 a year before the mrc was born with the anticipation that the new body would take the work further france s compagnie nationale du rhône cnr led a study for the interim mekong committee called the 1994 mekong mainstream run of river hydropower which advocated run of the river hydropower projects on the mekong mainstream a strategic shift of the 1987 plan of storage dams which were not implemented much anyway nine projects were considered sound from economic social and environmental points of view at the time including the planned mainstream dams don sahong sambor pak beng and xayaburi the 1994 plan however was not really discussed again in formal mrc meetings mainly due to differences of views by the mekong countries as to what would be the basin development plan and the influence of key donors during the early years of the mrc even though conflicts and instabilities in the region prevented much of lower mekong mainstream development some development did take place mostly in tributaries of the thai and vietnamese parts of the basin in thailand s northeast construction of dams for irrigation and hydropower took off in the 1960s in viet nam s part of the delta downstream of cambodia irrigation was extensively developed much earlier and in the central highlands many large hydropower dams were constructed upstream of cambodia it was not until the 1990s however that these developments drew public attention for the tensions that they had ignited the pak mun dam in thailand and the yali falls dam in viet nam were visible cases of public contention a major development also came this decade when china began building dams on the mainstream upper mekong river completing six so far manwan 1992 dachaoshan 2003 jinghong 2009 xiaowan 2010 gongguoqiao 2012 and nuozhadu 2014 the 1750 megawatt jinghong dam is the last of the yunnan cascade closest to the lower mekong while the 4200 megawatt xiaowan and 5850 megawatt nuozhadu are two large storage dams that are already influencing the natural flow regime of the mekong into the 21st century with more political stability economic growth and international finance late developing countries laos and cambodia followed china with plans to implement mainstream projects the ideas were not new the previous basin plans especially the 1994 report became influential in these countries and the private sector nearly 60 years after investigation and planning the first mainstream project on the lower mekong was proposed for implementation in 2010 a lao thai joint investment for the 1285 megawatt xayaburi hydropower project in northern laos see fig 1 and fig 2 xayaburi along with don sahong and other planned mainstream dams and projects with potential harmful effects have undergone scrutiny by the mrc member countries and stakeholders while there is no veto right or unilateral right to proceed by member s the mrc has since its inception gradually established a water diplomacy framework not called as such at the time that would help to inform negotiations manage tensions and resolve disputes essentially keeping the mekong free from water related conflicts what is the mrc s water diplomacy framework and how it has been utilized are the subjects of the next sections 5 mrc water diplomacy framework in theory the mrc water diplomacy framework has at its core the technical cooperation on water data and information collection management and sharing monitoring and forecasting state of the basin reporting studies and assessment and technical guidelines that serve as a basis to understand and tackle issues from a scientific viewpoint based on this solid technical foundation and understanding three distinct but inter related mechanisms facilitate and support negotiated solutions to water disagreements tensions and disputes legal institutional and strategic see fig 3 in legal terms the 1995 mekong agreement along with the five mrc procedures that were subsequently developed to monitor and deal with maintenance of flows water quality water use monitoring data and information sharing and consultation on infrastructure projects lay solid legal foundations in terms of international obligations in sharing and utilizing a transboundary river no other developing basins have such comprehensive rules for the management of their transboundary rivers individually and collectively these procedures are ahead of the curve for their time and place and demonstrate the countries commitment to work together one of the main ones or certainly most visible the procedures for notification prior consultation and agreement known as pnpca was adopted in november 2003 the pnpca is a set of three different processes notification prior consultation and agreement undertaken by mrc member countries under the facilitation of the mrc secretariat mrcs for certain projects using water from the mekong basin which may significantly alter water flow or water quality of the mainstream such projects may include large scale irrigation hydropower and flood control lasting six months unless extended the prior consultation focuses on assessing and discussing transboundary impacts of proposed development projects and what can be done to avoid minimize and mitigate these the procedures allow national information about commercial projects to be shared internationally scientific assessments by independent experts to be carried out and discussions and debates to be held by stakeholders it is a legitimate platform where different views can be heard openly and tensions managed and addressed in a transparent fashion in terms of institutions the mrc is well established with a council of ministers meeting once a year a joint committee jc of heads of department in charge of mekong affairs meeting twice or more a year as needed and a strong secretariat acting as a technical knowledge hub and water diplomacy platform facilitator linking up with the mrc at the regional level and coordinating mekong issues at the national levels are the national mekong committees and their secretariats the national committees are chaired by the minister in charge of water management and compose of vice ministers and heads of departments from key line agencies including foreign affairs planning and investment environment and water related sectors energy agriculture transport fisheries etc in 2010 the mrc was recognized and given highest political commitment with the first summit of prime ministers this was repeated four and eight years later at their latest summit the mekong leaders upheld the mrc s role as primary and unique in mekong development starting from 2017 regional and national linkages were strengthened with the establishment of expert groups in basin planning environmental management data modelling and forecasting and for the first time in mekong history in strategy and partnership in essence a group devoted to water diplomacy and cooperation see fig 4 the mrc also has established regional stakeholder engagement in the forms of regular regional stakeholder forums and specific forums for certain issues or groups that bring in voices of non state actors including ngos csos private sector and others while the legal foundations legitimize the institutional mechanisms mrc bodies the institutions in turn are the vehicles that prepare and endorse strategies and plans from the basin as opposed to national perspectives the basin wide strategies and plans provide directions and guidance to address basin wide needs challenges and opportunities that one country cannot do alone this strategic aspect therefore rounds out the water diplomacy framework and directly supports the implementation of the 1995 mekong agreement the legal foundation in mrc s case the main common strategy is the integrated water resources management iwrm based basin development strategy first approved in 2011 and updated and agreed again in 2016 the strategy sets out shared understandings about development opportunities medium and long term risks and priorities for development and management the strategy is being implemented by mrc through the mrc strategic plan and by the countries through the national indicative plans 2016 2020 in addition to the basin development strategy the mrc also has sector or thematic focused strategies on climate change hydropower navigation and fisheries the role of mrc in providing a water diplomacy platform and its secretariat as the honest broker gradually evolved with the organization s legal institutional and strategic strengthening the cases below illustrate some of the more visible challenges and tensions among the riparians on water and related developments and the role of mrc in managing these 6 mrc water diplomacy in action managing water and related tensions in the mekong 6 1 damming the lower mekong tributaries yali falls the 720 megawatt yali falls dam was the first hydropower plant to be constructed in the se san river a major and significant tributary of the mekong the dam is situated just downstream of the confluence between the krong poko and dak bla rivers in central viet nam approximately 70 km upstream of the cambodian border hirsch and wyatt 2004 pp 53 54 fisheries office 2000 p 3 its former plans were reassessed by the interim mekong committee and viet nam in the 1980s when electricity was in high demand swedpower 1986 thim 2010 pp 1 2 in 1990 the vietnamese ministry of energy concluded a feasibility study for the yali falls thim 2010 p 69 after its assessment the interim mekong committee asked for further environmental considerations that led to the environmental and financing studies on the yali falls hydropower project by the swiss electrowatt engineering services ltd in 1991 92 thim 2010 p 69 electrowatt engineering services ltd 1993 without any further objections the construction of the yali falls dam began in 1993 by vietnam electricity evn thim 2010 p 69 since 1996 however riverbank communities along the se san claimed to experience detrimental impacts from the dam construction fisheries office 2000 the first turbine trial run in february 2000 led to several loss of life livestock property and environmental damages fisheries office 2000 thim 2010 pp 2 72 this turbine incident brought the yali falls dam international attention and scrutiny through a number of reports by various local and international news agencies roeun and mockenhaupt 2000 saroeun and stormer 2000 bainbridge 2002 and mobilized ngos to support and engage with affected communities fisheries office 2000 baird et al 2002 rutkow et al 2005 the cambodia national mekong committee immediately contacted the mrcs to submit concerns to the viet nam national mekong committee which led to several interventions by the mrcs contrary to widespread perception of its inaction in this particular case the mrcs sent a team to the affected ratanakiri province in cambodia to assess the caused damages the results from the fact finding mission were discussed at the 11th mrc jc meeting in march 2000 and during an informal meeting between the jc members of cambodia and viet nam where the two parties agreed to visit the project site later in april 2000 at the yali falls site the mrcs facilitated negotiations on possible mechanisms for information exchange in an effort to minimize downstream effects five agreed measures were then implemented and followed up by the cambodia viet nam joint committee for the management of the se san river established by the mrc see thim 2010 pp 2 139 152 first it was agreed that information on the reservoir operation particularly water releases from the vietnamese dam under normal and extreme conditions be exchanged in advance of planned releases through appropriate channels similarly information on the river situation in cambodia should be transmitted in the same manner second water releases from the yali reservoir should be gradual so that inhabitants along the se san river can take advance notice of water level changes and take precautions accordingly third it was agreed that under normal circumstances 15 days advance notice of water releases should be given through national mekong committees relevant provincial authorities and the mrcs forth under emergencies and extreme flood situations advance warning should be immediately disseminated to relevant levels finally further environmental mitigation studies if needed would be discussed later with the participation of the mrc to implement the five agreed measures the cambodia viet nam joint committee met annually from 2001 to 2003 to establish the water release notification system conduct water quality analysis and draft terms of reference for hydrodynamic modelling and an environmental impact assessment of the se san river the committee met again in 2008 to discuss the results of previously conducted studies nevertheless some ngos and other stakeholders criticized mrc s response claiming that measurements taken were insufficient and the notification system did not work properly due to a lack of communication infrastructure in the affected villages several representatives of civil society ngos and scientists took the mrc to task for in their view failing to meet the needs of affected communities in the se san river basin hirsch and wyatt 2004 rutkow et al 2005 the mrc s role as a facilitator at the time should be understood in the context of preferences by the member countries cambodia and viet nam to conduct bilateral negotiations instead of further internationalising the issue indeed some even argue that bilateral negotiations fortified viet nam s position see also wyatt and baird 2007 saroeun 2000 and that cambodia had limited resources to ensure the effective implementation of the joint committee s conflict resolution efforts thim 2010 p 144 in retrospect the mrc did create an enabling environment for other regional actors to step in and contribute to building provincial and local resilience in fact the events of yali falls devastating as they were to local communities who were impacted served to activate and mobilise local provincial national regional and indeed international actors in the region the case particularly catalysed the mrc s engagement with tributary areas implementing a range of water management measures that provided the foundation for increased transboundary cooperation and stakeholder engagement in the se san basin for years to come 6 2 development of the upper mekong chinese dam cascade when china started with the construction of its first dam the manwan on the upper mekong in 1986 downstream countries did not publicly raise concerns richardson 2009 p 1 some would say they had little or no information since the 1990s however there are ongoing debates about the potential impacts of the chinese cascade of hydropower dams in the lower mekong basin li et al 2011 p 329 while studies have acknowledged the potential benefits of dry season flow increase on irrigation expansion and flood drought management concerns remain these mainly have to do with the consequences of an altering flow and sediment regime on the mekong s ecosystems and livelihoods international centre for environmental management 2010 mekong river commission 2016 mrc and ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 räsänen et al 2017 moreover after the occurrence of extreme or unusual downstream flood or drought events sections of the public speculated about the influence of the chinese dams in 1993 and 1997 some mekong governments raised concerns when local communities related the uncommonly low water levels limiting navigation in the golden triangle area with the commissioning of the manwan dam yeophantong 2014 pp 711 712 during the dry season of 2004 a mekong crisis nearly arose when thai farmers in northern provinces were affected by unusual droughts in 2008 environmental organizations and local communities in thailand and lao pdr suspected the chinese dams and their blasting of rocks for navigation purposes as partially responsible for the heavy floods gunn and mccartan 2008 p 3 yeophantong 2014 p 712 the 2010 drought that coincided with mrc s first summit where china responded to allegations by the indignant public received wide media attention ahuja 2010 fuller 2010 leitsinger 2010 yeophantong 2014 pp 712 713 an acute water level peak in december 2013 and water level fluctuations in february 2014 again evoked speculations around chinese dams among thai and lao riverside communities mrc 2013 2014a while many of the extreme events were mainly related to unusual meteorological and hydrological patterns environmental organizations and riverside communities have stuck to their perceptions about the influence of the upper mekong dams ngo coalitions such as international rivers based in california the united states or the thai people s network for mekong have challenged arguments otherwise and asked for more transparency from china s side for the mrc china is a long standing dialogue partner 11 the other mrc dialogue partner is myanmar 11 with cooperation in regular yearly formal dialogue meetings data sharing and technical exchanges since the signing of the agreement on the provision of hydrological information of the lancang river during the flood season in april 2002 china has been sharing hydrological data on a daily basis from two stations one located at yunjinghong on the mekong mainstream and one on a tributary at manan between june 15 and october 15 this agreement was renewed in 2008 and 2013 with the period in the latest agreement extended by 30 days from 01 june to 31 october kittikhoun n y in this regard china often states that it shares more data with mrc than with any other parties it shares international rivers with mrc studies and assessments point to both potentially positive and negative effects of upper mekong development on the lower part analysis comparing the natural versus the flow under the influence of chinese dam operations have shown that the water flow tends to be higher during the dry season and lower during the flood season mrc and ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 räsänen et al 2017 during the 2004 drought event the mrcs ceo at the time actively worked to ease tensions including visiting the commission on foreign affairs of the thai house of representatives to discuss the benefits and possible adverse impacts from china s dams on thailand with data from china during the flood season and its own data from monitoring networks in the dry season the mrc has studied drought and flood situations in the basin including possible impacts by upper mekong dams mrc 2008b 2013 when necessary it asked for more detailed information from china this was the case in 2004 2010 and 2014 mrc 2010a mrc 2014a in 2010 due to queries and concerns raised by mrcs and mekong countries china invited a delegation of lower mekong government officials and mrcs for a visit to the xiaowan and jinghong dams followed by discussions with the chinese government in beijing on enhanced cooperation modalities mrc 2010b a breakthrough of sorts came in 2016 in the face of the severe drought situation in the mekong in the dry season between december 2015 and may 2016 when china released supplementary water at jinghong during the months of march april and may joint observation and analysis by china and the mrcs were conducted for the first time revealing some positive effects of the release increased water level and discharge along the mekong mainstream and decreased salinity intrusion in the mekong delta for this joint analysis china shared water level and discharge data from one lancang mainstream and one tributary station for the 2015 2016 drought season in addition long term average monthly water level and discharge data for 1960 2009 and 2010 2015 were exchanged mrc and ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 this cooperation gave further momentum to the mrc and china to conduct other joint work during a visit of the chinese vice minister of water resources to the mrcs in vientiane in november 2014 china committed to work with mrc in analysing past water fluctuations affecting the lower mekong basin mrc 2014b in april 2016 the mrcs china and the international water management institute iwmi agreed on a joint research proposal on the effect of the lancang cascade of dams on extreme events starting with the droughts of 2009 2010 flash flood of december 2013 and drought of 2015 2016 it is expected that the results would come out in 2018 mrc unpublished 2017a pp 62 63 at the 3rd mrc summit of april 2018 the chinese minister of water resources opened more doors for china mrc cooperation including strengthening synergy and connectivity among regional and national development strategies and collaborating among mekong related cooperation frameworks such as the asian development bank s greater mekong subregion program and the new mekong lancang cooperation 6 3 developing the lower mekong mainstream xayaburi don sahong and pak beng 6 3 1 xayaburi hydropower project the first mainstream dam in the lower mekong basin has caused lively debates among the mrc member countries donors civil society non governmental and international organizations several years ago it was not imaginable that an actual large dam would come to fruition in the lower mekong surely this gave rise to plenty of alarm bells about the coming conflict over the mekong this time actually primarily about the river the xayaburi hydropower project was submitted to mrcs for prior consultation in september 2010 from the beginning the lao government and its lead thai developer ch karnchang have presented their project as being environmentally friendly lao pdr jc working group 2011 p 1 mrc unpublished 2017b p 3 xayaburi was prioritised in previous mekong committee studies and is part of the six planned mainstream projects above vientiane that was assessed in a cumulative fashion by the mrc basin wide assessment of development scenarios in 2010 to be among those whose adverse impacts on cambodia and viet nam may due to distance and other factors be less significant than from those further downstream the more specific mrcs technical review of the project identified gaps in the submitted documents and in knowledge on migratory fish species and asked among others for further measures on fish and sediment management mrc 2011b concerns about impacts on fisheries resource have already emerged during a mrc regional multi stakeholder consultation on perspectives and interests related to hydropower development in the mekong basin in september 2008 mrc 2008a pp 10 11 there a group of international experts on fisheries and fish friendly dam design and operation reported the results of their assessment arguing that existing fish passage technologies are unlikely to allow a satisfactory migration of the diverse fish species with large numbers in the mekong dugan et al 2010 as the mrc s first six month prior consultation from december 2010 to april 2011 was drawing to a close some member countries asked for more time for transboundary impact studies and consultations especially cambodia and viet nam cambodia national mekong committee 2011 ministry of natural resources and environment thailand 2011 viet nam national mekong committee 2011 the strategic environment assessment sea of mainstream dams recommended a ten years deferral icem 2010 the sea which was carried out by a consulting company for mrc and did not have all mrc members official endorsement was frequently cited by the media and ngos for the project to be put on hold laos took the position not to extend the consultation period but showed willingness to conduct further studies to address issues raised by the mrcs technical review and concerns from stakeholders lao pdr jc working group 2011 in their understanding the process was complete as they had met all mrc standards as confirmed by a study by their international consulting and engineering company pöyry headquartered in finland as mrc governance bodies the jc and council were not able to reach a common agreement in april and december 2011 respectively the issue was referred for resolution by the governments following the conflict resolution clause stipulated in the 1995 mekong agreement mrc 2015a p 22 actually the case went up to the highest levels of government with the four prime ministers during the 3rd mekong japan summit in bali indonesia in november 2011 agreeing to commission a study on sustainable management and development of the mekong river basin including impacts by mainstream hydropower projects on 8 december 2011 the mrc council agreed to implement the study which became known as the council study 12 mrc conducted the council study from 2012 to 2017 the final report of more than 3600 pages was released beginning 2018 following numerous technical consultations at the regional and national levels as well as stakeholder fora the study assessed the environmental social and economic costs and benefits of existing and planned water resources developments in the lower mekong basin since its completion mrcs has reported key findings and messages in a series of national meetings to the member countries 12 mrc 2011a after the prior consultation process campaigns against the dam by national and international ngos continued and mrc donors helped to leverage stakeholder s requests by urging mrc and laos to conduct further studies and be transparent about the redesign of the xayaburi dam cambodia and viet nam also made representations to the lao government looking back one can observe that in terms of the water diplomacy scorecard the mrc has done quite solidly in the technical areas assessment and guidelines while the institutional and strategic aspects had room for improvement for example anticipating the notification of the first mainstream hydropower project the mrcs worked on various initiatives including the analysis of different mekong development scenarios for the basin development strategy a sea of the planned mainstream dams in the lower mekong basin studies on fish migration and the development of a hydropower program mrc 2008a p 5 the established mrc initiative on sustainable hydropower then coordinated the drafting process of the preliminary design guidance for proposed mainstream dams in the lower mekong basin pdg endorsed by the mrc jc in 2009 the pdg became an influential guide in the private sector community with plans to develop hydropower in the mekong mainstream this pdg served as the main tool the mrc used to assess the documents submitted by laos on the xayaburi hydropower project for this purpose the mrcs formed a task group to facilitate and support the work of the special jc working group that was established to advice the mrc jc during the prior consultation the prior consultation roadmap scope of assessment site visit mode of national consultations coordination issues and the findings of the assessment were discussed in three sessions of the jc working group a special jc session in april 2011 and a council meeting in december 2011 were tasked to conclude the process mrc 2011b pp 3 5 mrc 2015a p 22 during the whole process the mrcs task group with the support of a sediment and fisheries expert group and individual experts provided the most up to date technical knowledge according to international standards with the aim of improving xayaburi hydropower project mrc 2011b pp 3 4 relevant information on the prior consultation process and its results were put on the mrc website remarkably the mrc jc agreed to disclose and publish the results of the mrcs technical review in march 2011 mrc 2011a p 3 member countries conducted national consultations while regional stakeholder consultations were not held for the first prior consultation stakeholder voices and concerns about mainstream development were heard during the mrc basin development planning process sea and other related activities mrc 2011b p 4 mrc 2015a p 22 which helped inform the mrcs review of xayaburi even though the first prior consultation on the xayaburi dam was perceived as rather unsuccessful by some stakeholders citing issues ranging from not being able to stop the dam to too few opportunities for public participation the process allowed for public debates as well as recommendations from mrc and further studies by the developer that contributed to the improvement of the dam laos has invested in redesigning the dam at their own cost of hundreds of millions of dollars in 2015 it held a workshop to engage the mrcs and countries on their redesign and further measures to address fish and sediment issues mrc 2015a p 22 the lao government has also welcomed visits from all corners of the world to xayaburi for site inspection and mutual learning and has engaged leading international agencies such as the us army corps of engineers and the australian centre for international agricultural research to support ongoing design changes adaptation and monitoring nevertheless there was only some interaction and data and information exchange between laos its developer and the mrcs on the redesign and further measures taken as the post consultation process was not formalised mrc unpublished 2017b p 3 some information was submitted by laos to mrcs and mrcs has been reviewing changes in the dam design 13 for issues on the xayaburi prior consultation process see as well rieu clarke a 2015 notification and consultation procedures under the mekong agreement insights from the xayaburi controversy asianjil 5 01 143 175 13 6 3 2 don sahong hydropower project the don sahong hydropower project was the second dam on the mainstream to undergo the mrc prior consultation between july 2014 and january 2015 criticisms about the dam from environmentalist groups and ngo networks were no less fierce than that of xayaburi the dam is situated on the hou sahong channel on the mainstream in laos this channel carries most of the mekong discharge during the dry season mrc 2015b p 4 the hou sahong channel is a key route for fish migration the main concerns raised by the mrcs technical review related to whether it was possible to modify the nearby hou xang pheuak and hou sadam channels to be used as alternative fish routes in addition the possible impact on the irrawaddy dolphin population a now iconic specie in the mekong was raised mrc 2015b p 17 45 on the plus side the mrcs concluded that the possible adverse transboundary impacts related to water quality sediment and water flows to cambodia and the delta were less significant fisheries and livelihoods issues were the main concerns raised by ngos and civil society that have campaigned against the dam since its initial plans in 2006 for some stakeholders the 260 megawatt production of the small scale dam will not compensate for its potential negative environmental and social impacts during the don sahong prior consultation process a complaint against the developer malaysian mega first corporation berhad mfcb was submitted to the national human rights commission of malaysia and called for an investigation of the transboundary impacts on thai and cambodian communities international rivers 2015 the case even caught the attention of the un human rights mechanism with the un special procedures filing a report to the un human rights council citing allegations that the project may pose a threat to local livelihoods cambodia lying two kilometres downstream of the dam asked for more time to conduct transboundary environmental impact assessments to consider the most appropriate mitigation measures cambodia referred to article 7 of the 1995 mekong agreement urging laos to make every effort to avoid minimize and mitigate harmful effects that might occur to the environment cambodia national mekong committee 2015 viet nam was of the same view and asked for a prolongation of the prior consultation process until the end of 2015 viet nam national mekong committee 2015 thailand indicated that a six month extension would be appreciated to conduct further impact assessments ministry of natural resources and environment thailand 2015 in the lao view the risks related to the project are low as the project would only use one of several channels in the area minimizing disturbances to the hydrology and sediment transport the mrcs technical review also pointed out that these two issues were not significant laos wished to close the prior consultation process after six months as they have undertaken every effort to mitigate potential negative transboundary impacts ministry of natural resources and environment lao pdr and lao national mekong committee secretariat 2015 during the course of the project they have also submitted additional documents mrc 2015b p 44 similar to the xayaburi hydropower project the mrc jc and council could however not agree on how to move forward with the proposed don sahong dam and according to the 1995 mekong agreement the governments were asked to step in using their diplomatic channels the proceedings for the don sahong hydropower project have taken longer than those for xayaburi as the former was first submitted to the mrcs as a notification in september 2013 after the notified mrc countries asked for a resubmission for prior consultation the mrcs conducted a pre assessment of the documents from october to december 2013 which was considered during a special jc session in january 2014 in november 2013 as well as march 2014 based on invitations from the lao government site visits were conducted to don sahong by mrcs and country representatives in june 2014 laos informed the mrc that they would submit the project as a prior consultation mrc 2015b p 4 as was the case with the first prior consultation a mrcs task group worked on the technical review with the support of independent international experts the jc working group met three times and the jc once to discuss the proceeding and results of the assessment in addition to national consultations the mrcs organized one regional public consultation in pakse in southern laos mrc 2015b pp 4 6 in the case of don sahong the mrcs strength lies in providing technical expertise and recommendations the mrcs also proposed extending the prior consultation period to consider and assess additional documents submitted by laos mrc 2015b p 44 while the three notified countries supported this it proved difficult to have unanimous agreement as the modalities for a justified extension have not been clarified given the experience from xayaburi mrc unpublished 2017b p 4 timely provision of relevant information to the public and their participation opportunities have improved but remained at an informing stage mrc unpublished 2017b p 4 in november 2016 the cambodian prime minister aired the view that the don sahong project would not likely cause significant transboundary impact to cambodia after inspecting the project site although the post consultation process has still not been formalized the mrcs has managed to bring together the governments of laos and cambodia to agree to work on a joint project in the khonefalls area which includes a joint environmental monitoring program for the don sahong project under mrc to improve the mrc pnpca and other mrc procedures the mrcs established a joint platform in 2013 which has held a number of meetings and workshops with the objective to address recognized challenges in the implementation of the mrc procedures mrc unpublished 2017b p 2 convened by the mrcs the february 2017 dialogue workshop on lessons learned for pnpca bringing together practitioners from the countries and well known international legal experts was particularly instructive in making recommendations that will be crucial for future project assessments and negotiations 6 3 3 pak beng hydropower project while the pak beng hydropower project a lao project with investment from china did not face a high degree of public opposition like the first two cases issue of cumulative impacts nevertheless engendered media headlines such as killing the mekong dam by dam as the dam in laos is far upstream from cambodia and viet nam most concerns came from thai riverine communities whose vocal representatives had already taken the xayaburi case to court and are doing similarly with pak beng the main concerns of the mrcs technical review were related to sediment management the design of the fish passage and navigation lock furthermore the report recommended studying upstream impacts into thailand and socio economic impacts downstream mrcs 2017 pp 71 79 stakeholders were most concerned about fish sediment and dam cascade coordination issues the three notified countries provided feedback with regard to technical issues but also concerning availability of information and data they asked for more in depth studies on transboundary and cumulative impacts and mentioned monitoring and other follow up work cambodia national mekong committee 2017 ministry of natural resources and environment thailand 2017 viet nam national mekong committee 2017 laos showed commitment in taking into account raised issues lao national mekong committee secretariat 2017 the third mrc prior consultation from december 2016 to june 2017 was perceived as more successful by the mrc and stakeholders than the first two ones after the submission of the pak beng hydropower project in november 2016 there were clear expectations from the member countries stakeholder and development partners as mentioned lessons learned were captured by the mrc on the first two cases with recommendations that would form the basis to prepare for the third pnpca 14 lessons learned covered key issues such as timely notification completeness of information period of consultation the consultation preparation phase and post consultation process and stakeholder engagement among others 14 after the reform of the mrcs in 2016 it also emerged stronger with key management strategic and technical staff that were fully committed to ensuring a good process and outcome three factors were decisive firstly stakeholders were better informed and more engaged in the process regional forums were held openly in addition to many informal interactions and meetings with key stakeholders secondly the process has been more transparent and better managed with clearly defined steps for the preparation phase prior consultation and post consultation process thirdly a clear end result of the prior consultation was envisioned which succeeded in concluding a negotiated and agreed statement of the member countries in june 2017 mrcs 2017 p 1 mrc unpublished 2017b p 5 the mrc s donors applauded the process and outcome of the pnpca technical review and welcomed the agreed statement by the mrc member countries facilitated by the secretariat as in the previous two cases the timeline was tight to prepare and discuss the technical review conducted by the mrcs task group and international experts the jc working group met three times during the six month prior consultation period national experts supported the review process and provided inputs at the national level national and two regional public consultations organized by the mrcs considered stakeholders comments mrcs 2017 pp 11 12 the mrc has had the opportunity to influence the final design and operation of the dam as laos submitted the project at feasibility stage in addition to sharing technical expertise the mrcs has made strategic use of its networks within the member countries to lobby for an agreement on the prior consultation process for the first time focus on article 7 to make every effort to avoid minimise and mitigate harmful effects of the mekong agreement has helped to develop the joint statement mrc unpublished 2017b pp 5 6 a definite milestone achievement for the mrc and its member countries the agreed statement formed the basis for the development of a joint action plan for the pak beng project this formalized post prior consultation process has been received positively by stakeholders mrc unpublished 2017b p 6 the joint action plan will ensure regular exchange between the developer laos and mrc during the finalization of the design construction and operation phases of the dam the plan will be implemented and further adapted over time to meet changing needs and circumstances mrcs unpublished 2017 p 2 to further improve future pnpcas the joint statement asked to incorporate the key findings from the pak beng hydropower project pnpca process in the development of commentaries to the procedures for notification prior consultation and agreement through its work with the mrc joint platform mrc 2017 p 4 the main purpose of the commentaries is to further provide a common understanding on the pnpca moreover the pdg will be updated based on the newly developed mrc guidelines for hydropower impact mitigation and risk management considering lessons learnt and new critical topics mrc unpublished 2017a p 32 in short mrc s prior consultation process has improved in term of organizational aspects stakeholder engagement has evolved from informing to consulting towards collaboration on how to address concerns and therefore contributed to diffusing tensions 6 4 waterway transportation agreement between cambodia and viet nam while hydropower development in one of the great rivers of the world would naturally ignite a great deal of attention and therefore the water diplomacy work of the mrc this is not the only sector the organization works on plans to enhance waterborne transport in the mekong have also been controversial due to potential environmental and social impacts within the frame of mrc s mandate to enhance freedom of navigation in the basin the mrcs has been successful in addressing challenges of transboundary cooperation between cambodia and viet nam cross border trade and the efficiency of waterborne cargo and passenger transportation in december 2009 cambodia and viet nam signed a legally binding agreement on waterway transportation which has been enforced since january 2011 mrc 2015a p 29 mrc unpublished 2017a p 35 the mrcs significantly contributed to this historical step and has supported the countries in implementing the agreement the agreement was drafted by the mrcs navigation program team with the help of international experts in consultation with relevant entities of the governments of cambodia and viet nam mrc 2015a p 29 experiences from the belgium dutch scheldt treaty that allowed for improved waterborne transportation and trade on the river scheldt have helped shape the agreement mrc 2009 during the three year drafting and negotiation phase the mrcs advised and funded two national legal task forces and facilitated bilateral meetings between the two countries that led to the signing of the agreement mrc 2015a p 29 this is in contrast to earlier unsuccessful attempts at developing an agreement without the mrc by the two countries from 1998 to 2006 guttman 2013 7 conclusion in a region marred by historical conflicts superpower rivalries and recurrent tensions one wonders how the mekong basin states have managed to keep it together for almost thirty years now without a conflict over water resources tensions and challenges have popped up that could have escalated to active opposition and confrontation as in other regions of the world this paper argues that the role of an inter governmental river basin organization traditionally seen as more of the realm of technical water cooperation is absolutely critical in not only looking at the issues from an objective scientific perspective but also in facilitating and supporting negotiated solutions through established legal institutional and strategic mechanisms in the mekong the riparian countries and their development partners can be proud to have invested in the water diplomacy framework of the mrc as the cases of potential conflicts due to conflicting interests in using and developing the transboundary tributaries and mainstream demonstrate the organization has proven its worth and value in supporting the countries in trying to resolve disputes a strong and proactive mrc is able to legitimately make a difference due to the legal foundation of cooperation that it can reference the mekong agreement and procedures that require some obligations of member states the institutional support and engagement that it can muster from national mekong committees partners and stakeholders and the strategic direction that it has been given via the basin development strategy and other basin wide strategies e g looking beyond national borders and interests optimizing basin benefits and minimizing mitigating transboundary impacts while challenges for an organization such as mrc remain one can fairly say that it is one of the most successful cases of transboundary cooperation over a major river in the world in a region that is known as a hotbed of conflicts and rivalries from within and without a key to this success has been the existence and operation of the different aspects technical legal institutional and strategic of the mrc s water diplomacy framework lacking one or another could not be optimal underlying all of this is politics the often cited political commitment or lack thereof in the mekong case this commitment could be said to be the mekong spirit defined in typical mekong way as a combination of collective courage statesmanship perseverance and goodwill among the mekong states reflecting their collective desire for mutual understanding and accommodation to achieve a shared vision for the mekong 15 see section 4 in secretariat of the interim committee for coordination of investigations of the lower mekong basin 1989 the mekong committee

6911,the mekong region home to one of the world s great rivers the mekong is also one of the world s most geostrategic regions featuring seemingly conflicting interests among regional states including viet nam thailand myanmar laos and cambodia and world powers such as china and the united states of america for nearly a century some of the riparian states have developed parts of the basin in their territories to great benefits and harm and recently the remaining late developing countries are catching up with water and related resources development plans to dam withdraw and use the mighty mekong to fund national progress and alleviate poverty world leaders academics ngos media and even some government officials have warned that the current rush to development is not only bringing a sure death to a great previously untamed river potentially displacing millions of people and threatening livelihoods but would also usher in an era of aggravated tensions and possibly even conflict the mekong river commission mrc tasked to manage the river for the sake of the environment and the people is failing its mission with work that has been ineffective uninfluential and wasted critics say yet this scenario is both wrong in its thesis about mekong development and misleading in its understanding of mrc s role and work while past and current water resources development in the region has brought challenges and risks associated with changes in the river system these have not led to widespread destruction of livelihoods and conflict among riparian countries a critical factor preventing conflict and managing tensions as well as supporting optimal and sustainable development is the mrc and its water diplomacy framework which has a technical core to provide objective scientific advices and legal institutional and strategic mechanisms that facilitate and support negotiated solutions to complex water and related problems while challenges remain for the mrc as an organization its water diplomacy framework has gradually been established and strengthened as the cases of managing tensions and potential conflicts in the mekong for the past twenty years illustrate keywords mekong river mekong river commission water diplomacy conflict management prior consultation hydropower geo politics 1 introduction the mekong region is a geo political hotspot featuring seemingly conflicting interests among regional states including china viet nam thailand myanmar laos and cambodia furthermore various regional and international powers have for centuries shaped its fate the mekong river as a natural resource has received international attention on many occasions be it for research missions on its immense biodiversity its exploitation for development purposes or for its protection as one of the last almost untamed great rivers on the planet various plans and perceptions clash resulting in tensions and possibly even conflict not enough credit is given to the regional institutional frameworks in the mekong basin in the management of tensions and disputes on transboundary water resources in this regard while there are other actors only one organization in the region has the legal mandate from the lower mekong basin countries to coordinate jointly plan and balance socially and environmentally just development of the catchment including its protection and the conservation of resources 2 although the paper is focused on the primary unique and critical role of the mrc in mekong water governance and development we acknowledge the important roles of other actors in the region including non governmental ones see for example 1 lebel l dore j daniel r koma y s 2007 democratizing water governance in the mekong region in l lebel r daniel editors m power book series on water

mighty river in vientiane with national coordinating offices of its four member countries in phnom penh vientiane bangkok and hanoi as well as ho chi minh city its framework and tools in operation have however not been well understood by many actors and stakeholders its conflict management role is rarely recognized tasked as the river manager the mrc draws different expectations as regards its role mandate and responsibility some viewed it as a failed regulator of the river some as merely a research organization and others as a talk shop without any teeth in reality far from being an onlooker dore and lazarus 2009 p 361 the mrc has succeeded in bringing together its member countries partners and stakeholders from the region and elsewhere to jointly discuss water and related issues and take action this was however frequently overshadowed by sporadic unsuccessful attempts in reaching agreement on development matters the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how mrc s role has evolved over time as a technical knowledge hub and a platform for water diplomacy facilitating water related negotiations in the region after a short overview on the mekong river basin the mekong is put into its historical context not only have riparian countries been in hostility for centuries global powers also intervened and exercised their influence research and development plans on the mekong river to grasp and cultivate its prosperity have gone hand in hand with mekong institutional development and the path leading up to the establishment of the mrc of today to illustrate the mrc s water diplomacy framework in action four cases are presented i the yali falls hydropower project on a significant mekong tributary ii china s development of the upper mekong iii the first three mainstream hydropower projects in the lower mekong basin and iv navigation between viet nam and cambodia 2 the mekong basin the mekong river with a length of approximately 4800 km is the 12th longest river in the world it flows from its source in the tibetan plateau through china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and viet nam via a large delta into the sea draining a basin area of 795 000 km2 in the upper mekong basin the mekong known as the lancang in chinese decreases in altitude by about 4000 m south of china s yunnan province the lower mekong basin begins which is home to over 65 million people the mean annual discharge of the mekong is approximately 475 km3 most flow is contributed from tributaries in the lower mekong basin flow from the upper mekong contributes only a small portion to the annual flow of the mekong but in the dry season it is significant constituting up to 40 on average china contributes 17 myanmar less than 1 laos 41 thailand 15 cambodia 19 and viet nam 8 to the annual discharge a distinct characteristic for the mekong is its high seasonal flow variation due to the southwest monsoon generating wet and dry seasons usually the flood season lasts from june to november and the dry season from december to may many key ecosystems and fish depend on these seasonal changes during the dry season many fish species migrate to deep pools in the mainstream for spawning they return to nutrient rich grounds at phnom penh the seasonal changes of water level cause the water flow reversal to and from the tonle sap lake one of the most unique hydrological processes in the world mrc 2016 p 17 3 for recent assessments on the mekong flow regime see for example 1 hoang l p lauri h kummu m koponen j van vliet m t h supit i leemans r kabat p ludwig f 2016

respectively build more or less equally powerful kingdoms the lao kingdom of lane xang first consolidated under king fa ngum in 1353 and reaching its peak under king suriyavongsa in the 17th century composing of modern day laos and northeastern thailand was one of the largest kingdoms in southeast asia for over three centuries the mekong river ran through its entire territory after leaving china and before entering cambodia while relations were happy until the 18th century ngaosyvathn 1985 p 1251 military conflict occurred between the two in the late 1770s when lane xang was incorporated into the siamese kingdom for over a hundred years until the early 1890s the history between cambodia and thailand is also deep going back as far as the 13th century when the siamese kingdom of soukhothai broke away from the khmer empire of angkor subsequently various siamese and khmer kingdoms would engage in wars and interventions in the mid 14th century mid late 15th century late 16th century early 17th century early and late 18th century and early 19th century cambodian vietnamese rivalry also dated back to the 13th century when the khmer empire came gradually under vietnamese influence and direct control by the 19th century 3 2 mekong sites global battle ground on top of this history of warring nations and states is the fundamental fact that the mekong region is located in southeast asia which is classified in political geography as one of a few regions on earth as a shatterbelt a large strategically located region that is occupied by a number of conflicting states and is caught between the conflicting interests of adjoining great powers cohen 1963 p 83 this means that national and regional processes could not be developed or understood purely independently without taking into account external influences major powers throughout time from britain france the united states soviet union russia to japan and china intervened one time or another in the region the region has rarely been left to its own fate one can see this intervention clearly when britain colonized burma in the 19th century and basically put an end to warring burmese siamese relations france colonized viet nam cambodia and laos in the same century and pulled half of lan xang the left bank of the mekong river for incorporation into french indochina giving the other half the right bank of the mekong to siam leaving thailand un colonized and as a buffer state between the two external powers at the time it was also during french colonization that the khmer kingdom lost much of its southern cone including a large chunk of the mekong delta outside players would hitherto shape the course of history of the region and the mekong from the 2nd world war in which the japanese occupied the region and

contributors to this publication 9 the un economic commission for asia and the far east s ecafe now the un economic and social commission for asia and the pacific escap bureau for flood control presented a first report in 1952 on mekong flood control and water resources development proposing studies to fill knowledge gaps five years later ecafe released a landmark report on development of water resources in the lower mekong basin proposing irrigation and hydropower plans as well as an institutional framework that would lay the ground for the creation of the mekong committee with cambodia laos thailand and viet nam as members in 1957 the first institutional cooperation framework for the lower mekong and the predecessor of the mrc the 1957 report drew up initial mainstream dam projects of pa mong khemerat khone falls sambor and tonle sap not to be outshined american agencies and institutions were also influential in the early post war days considered the first mekong basin planning document the 1956 reconnaissance report lower mekong basin of the us bureau of reclamation department of interior called for extensive data gathering and studies on agriculture fisheries navigation and education another famous american agency the us army corps of engineers usace department of defense conducted a mission led by general raymond wheeler in 1958 that saw the great potential of the lower mekong for service to the riparian countries in the fields of navigation hydropower generation irrigation and other related water uses he recommended pa mong sambor and tonle sap as the top three dams in 1962 the us ford foundation sent out a mission led by the distinguished environmental geographer gilbert white to explore the mekong it concluded with a report economic and social aspects of lower mekong development stating that the mekong scheme has a great potential for transforming the life of peoples of the basin four years later the us bureau of reclamation undertook a comprehensive feasibility report of the pa mong mainstream multi purpose dam a 4800 megawatt flagship project upstream of vientiane that would spur and symbolize the development of the mighty river us and un passions to turn the mekong from a region of war to a region of prosperity were not limited to technical agencies but a matter of high politics american president lyndon johnson at that time espoused that the us wanted a mekong river program that would dwarf the tennessee valley authority while un secretary general u thant proclaimed the mekong river project as one of most significant actions undertaken by un hence from early missions investigations and studies that influenced the mekong committee came the ambitious indicative basin plan of 1970 with some 180 projects the plan commissioned by the committee proposed a short term 2 billion program until 1980 including 700 000 ha of irrigation expansion and 3273 megawatt of hydropower on tributaries a 10 billion long term program for 1981 2000 comprising a cascade of mainstream dams part of a list of 17 mainstream projects for 17 000 megawatt the indicative basin plan foresaw major benefits in terms of flood control expansion of power and irrigation development as well as extension of navigation by about 800 km this was not to be at least not yet while some tributary projects were implemented and substantial funding gained for plan implementation mainstream projects that required active cooperation among the riparians could not materialize due to returning instabilities and fighting in indochina in the 1970 s once again conflicts decimated hopes and desires for development and prosperity in addition a legal hurdle was put up with the 1975 joint declaration of principles by the mekong committee in which article x states mainstream waters are a resource of common interest not subject to major unilateral appropriation by any riparian state without prior approval by the other basin states through the committee this clause on the one hand contributed to the prevention of mainstream development and for a long time saved the mekong as one of the last great rivers that was free flowing on the other hand some argue it also stifled economic growth while the western world benefited from water resources exploitation before and during the same period take the united states for example which has about 80 000 dams of which about 8000 are large dams the colorado river a transboundary river with mexico was extensively developed throughout the 20th century as was the case with the large columbia river shared with canada or australia which as a federal system gives its states rights and control over water resources that has built almost 500 large dams three fourths of which came after 1950 or japan which has built nearly 450 large dams for flood control and hydropower or even small norway which became known as a hydropower powerhouse in europe with about 1110 hydropower plants totalling 29 000 megawatt of installed capacity more or less the entire potential of the lower mekong in the mekong case due to conflicts on the backdrop of external power struggles the 1970 indicative basin plan with only 16 out of 180 projects implemented was revised down and scaled back in 1987 with a cascade of smaller dams along the mainstream divided into 29 projects 26 of which were national in scope contrary to the multipurpose nature of the 1970 plan the focus became hydropower with secondary benefits for other sectors the largest project was still the mainstream pa mong with modifications called low pa mong dam the 1987 indicative basin plan was put out by the interim mekong committee interim because cambodia was not a member due to internal political instability keeping the country away from mekong cooperation for more than ten years from the late 1970s to the early 1990s when peace returned to cambodia with the signing of the paris accords in 1991 the country joined the other three lower riparians of laos thailand and viet nam to negotiate a new mekong cooperation treaty the agreement on the cooperation for the sustainable development of the mekong river basin of 5 april 1995 the 1995 mekong agreement a new inter governmental framework for cooperation one outside the un system was established the mrc leading up to the creation of the new organization and shortly afterwards international support and influences remained palpable the un development programme undp supported the negotiation of the 1995 mekong agreement 10 with the mrc out of the un system in 1995 un organizations have played minor roles in mekong water affairs ever since 10 a year before the mrc was born with the anticipation that the new body would take the work further france s compagnie nationale du rhône cnr led a study for the interim mekong committee called the 1994 mekong mainstream run of river hydropower which advocated run of the river hydropower projects on the mekong mainstream a strategic shift of the 1987 plan of storage dams which were not implemented much anyway nine projects were considered sound from economic social and environmental points of view at the time including the planned mainstream dams don sahong sambor pak beng and xayaburi the 1994 plan however was not really discussed again in formal mrc meetings mainly due to differences of views by the mekong countries as to what would be the basin development plan and the influence of key donors during the early years of the mrc even though conflicts and instabilities in the region prevented much of lower mekong mainstream development some development did take place mostly in tributaries of the thai and vietnamese parts of the basin in thailand s northeast construction of dams for irrigation and hydropower took off in the 1960s in viet nam s part of the delta downstream of cambodia irrigation was extensively developed much earlier and in the central highlands many large hydropower dams were constructed upstream of cambodia it was not until the 1990s however that these developments drew public attention for the tensions that they had ignited the pak mun dam in thailand and the yali falls dam in viet nam were visible cases of public contention a major development also came this decade when china began building dams on the mainstream upper mekong river completing six so far manwan 1992 dachaoshan 2003 jinghong 2009 xiaowan 2010 gongguoqiao 2012 and nuozhadu 2014 the 1750 megawatt jinghong dam is the last of the yunnan cascade closest to the lower mekong while the 4200 megawatt xiaowan and 5850 megawatt nuozhadu are two large storage dams that are already influencing the natural flow regime of the mekong into the 21st century with more political stability economic growth and international finance late developing countries laos and cambodia followed china with plans to implement mainstream projects the ideas were not new the previous basin plans especially the 1994 report became influential in these countries and the private sector nearly 60 years after investigation and planning the first mainstream project on the lower mekong was proposed for implementation in 2010 a lao thai joint investment for the 1285 megawatt xayaburi hydropower project in northern laos see fig 1 and fig 2 xayaburi along with don sahong and other planned mainstream dams and projects with potential harmful effects have undergone scrutiny by the mrc member countries and stakeholders while there is no veto right or unilateral right to proceed by member s the mrc has since its inception gradually established a water diplomacy framework not called as such at the time that would help to inform negotiations manage tensions and resolve disputes essentially keeping the mekong free from water related conflicts what is the mrc s water diplomacy framework and how it has been utilized are the subjects of the next sections 5 mrc water diplomacy framework in theory the mrc water diplomacy framework has at its core the technical cooperation on water data and information collection management and sharing monitoring and forecasting state of the basin reporting studies and assessment and technical guidelines that serve as a basis to understand and tackle issues from a scientific viewpoint based on this solid technical foundation and understanding three distinct but inter related mechanisms facilitate and support negotiated solutions to water disagreements tensions and disputes legal institutional and strategic see fig 3 in legal terms the 1995 mekong agreement along with the five mrc procedures that were subsequently developed to monitor and deal with maintenance of flows water quality water use monitoring data and information sharing and consultation on infrastructure projects lay solid legal foundations in terms of international obligations in sharing and utilizing a transboundary river no other developing basins have such comprehensive rules for the management of their transboundary rivers individually and collectively these procedures are ahead of the curve for their time and place and demonstrate the countries commitment to work together one of the main ones or certainly most visible the procedures for notification prior consultation and agreement known as pnpca was adopted in november 2003 the pnpca is a set of three different processes notification prior consultation and agreement undertaken by mrc member countries under the facilitation of the mrc secretariat mrcs for certain projects using water from the mekong basin which may significantly alter water flow or water quality of the mainstream such projects may include large scale irrigation hydropower and flood control lasting six months unless extended the prior consultation focuses on assessing and discussing transboundary impacts of proposed development projects and what can be done to avoid minimize and mitigate these the procedures allow national information about commercial projects to be shared internationally scientific assessments by independent experts to be carried out and discussions and debates to be held by stakeholders it is a legitimate platform where different views can be heard openly and tensions managed and addressed in a transparent fashion in terms of institutions the mrc is well established with a council of ministers meeting once a year a joint committee jc of heads of department in charge of mekong affairs meeting twice or more a year as needed and a strong secretariat acting as a technical knowledge hub and water diplomacy platform facilitator linking up with the mrc at the regional level and coordinating mekong issues at the national levels are the national mekong committees and their secretariats the national committees are chaired by the minister in charge of water management and compose of vice ministers and heads of departments from key line agencies including foreign affairs planning and investment environment and water related sectors energy agriculture transport fisheries etc in 2010 the mrc was recognized and given highest political commitment with the first summit of prime ministers this was repeated four and eight years later at their latest summit the mekong leaders upheld the mrc s role as primary and unique in mekong development starting from 2017 regional and national linkages were strengthened with the establishment of expert groups in basin planning environmental management data modelling and forecasting and for the first time in mekong history in strategy and partnership in essence a group devoted to water diplomacy and cooperation see fig 4 the mrc also has established regional stakeholder engagement in the forms of regular regional stakeholder forums and specific forums for certain issues or groups that bring in voices of non state actors including ngos csos private sector and others while the legal foundations legitimize the institutional mechanisms mrc bodies the institutions in turn are the vehicles that prepare and endorse strategies and plans from the basin as opposed to national perspectives the basin wide strategies and plans provide directions and guidance to address basin wide needs challenges and opportunities that one country cannot do alone this strategic aspect therefore rounds out the water diplomacy framework and directly supports the implementation of the 1995 mekong agreement the legal foundation in mrc s case the main common strategy is the integrated water resources management iwrm based basin development strategy first approved in 2011 and updated and agreed again in 2016 the strategy sets out shared understandings about development opportunities medium and long term risks and priorities for development and management the strategy is being implemented by mrc through the mrc strategic plan and by the countries through the national indicative plans 2016 2020 in addition to the basin development strategy the mrc also has sector or thematic focused strategies on climate change hydropower navigation and fisheries the role of mrc in providing a water diplomacy platform and its secretariat as the honest broker gradually evolved with the organization s legal institutional and strategic strengthening the cases below illustrate some of the more visible challenges and tensions among the riparians on water and related developments and the role of mrc in managing these 6 mrc water diplomacy in action managing water and related tensions in the mekong 6 1 damming the lower mekong tributaries yali falls the 720 megawatt yali falls dam was the first hydropower plant to be constructed in the se san river a major and significant tributary of the mekong the dam is situated just downstream of the confluence between the krong poko and dak bla rivers in central viet nam approximately 70 km upstream of the cambodian border hirsch and wyatt 2004 pp 53 54 fisheries office 2000 p 3 its former plans were reassessed by the interim mekong committee and viet nam in the 1980s when electricity was in high demand swedpower 1986 thim 2010 pp 1 2 in 1990 the vietnamese ministry of energy concluded a feasibility study for the yali falls thim 2010 p 69 after its assessment the interim mekong committee asked for further environmental considerations that led to the environmental and financing studies on the yali falls hydropower project by the swiss electrowatt engineering services ltd in 1991 92 thim 2010 p 69 electrowatt engineering services ltd 1993 without any further objections the construction of the yali falls dam began in 1993 by vietnam electricity evn thim 2010 p 69 since 1996 however riverbank communities along the se san claimed to experience detrimental impacts from the dam construction fisheries office 2000 the first turbine trial run in february 2000 led to several loss of life livestock property and environmental damages fisheries office 2000 thim 2010 pp 2 72 this turbine incident brought the yali falls dam international attention and scrutiny through a number of reports by various local and international news agencies roeun and mockenhaupt 2000 saroeun and stormer 2000 bainbridge 2002 and mobilized ngos to support and engage with affected communities fisheries office 2000 baird et al 2002 rutkow et al 2005 the cambodia national mekong committee immediately contacted the mrcs to submit concerns to the viet nam national mekong committee which led to several interventions by the mrcs contrary to widespread perception of its inaction in this particular case the mrcs sent a team to the affected ratanakiri province in cambodia to assess the caused damages the results from the fact finding mission were discussed at the 11th mrc jc meeting in march 2000 and during an informal meeting between the jc members of cambodia and viet nam where the two parties agreed to visit the project site later in april 2000 at the yali falls site the mrcs facilitated negotiations on possible mechanisms for information exchange in an effort to minimize downstream effects five agreed measures were then implemented and followed up by the cambodia viet nam joint committee for the management of the se san river established by the mrc see thim 2010 pp 2 139 152 first it was agreed that information on the reservoir operation particularly water releases from the vietnamese dam under normal and extreme conditions be exchanged in advance of planned releases through appropriate channels similarly information on the river situation in cambodia should be transmitted in the same manner second water releases from the yali reservoir should be gradual so that inhabitants along the se san river can take advance notice of water level changes and take precautions accordingly third it was agreed that under normal circumstances 15 days advance notice of water releases should be given through national mekong committees relevant provincial authorities and the mrcs forth under emergencies and extreme flood situations advance warning should be immediately disseminated to relevant levels finally further environmental mitigation studies if needed would be discussed later with the participation of the mrc to implement the five agreed measures the cambodia viet nam joint committee met annually from 2001 to 2003 to establish the water release notification system conduct water quality analysis and draft terms of reference for hydrodynamic modelling and an environmental impact assessment of the se san river the committee met again in 2008 to discuss the results of previously conducted studies nevertheless some ngos and other stakeholders criticized mrc s response claiming that measurements taken were insufficient and the notification system did not work properly due to a lack of communication infrastructure in the affected villages several representatives of civil society ngos and scientists took the mrc to task for in their view failing to meet the needs of affected communities in the se san river basin hirsch and wyatt 2004 rutkow et al 2005 the mrc s role as a facilitator at the time should be understood in the context of preferences by the member countries cambodia and viet nam to conduct bilateral negotiations instead of further internationalising the issue indeed some even argue that bilateral negotiations fortified viet nam s position see also wyatt and baird 2007 saroeun 2000 and that cambodia had limited resources to ensure the effective implementation of the joint committee s conflict resolution efforts thim 2010 p 144 in retrospect the mrc did create an enabling environment for other regional actors to step in and contribute to building provincial and local resilience in fact the events of yali falls devastating as they were to local communities who were impacted served to activate and mobilise local provincial national regional and indeed international actors in the region the case particularly catalysed the mrc s engagement with tributary areas implementing a range of water management measures that provided the foundation for increased transboundary cooperation and stakeholder engagement in the se san basin for years to come 6 2 development of the upper mekong chinese dam cascade when china started with the construction of its first dam the manwan on the upper mekong in 1986 downstream countries did not publicly raise concerns richardson 2009 p 1 some would say they had little or no information since the 1990s however there are ongoing debates about the potential impacts of the chinese cascade of hydropower dams in the lower mekong basin li et al 2011 p 329 while studies have acknowledged the potential benefits of dry season flow increase on irrigation expansion and flood drought management concerns remain these mainly have to do with the consequences of an altering flow and sediment regime on the mekong s ecosystems and livelihoods international centre for environmental management 2010 mekong river commission 2016 mrc and ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 räsänen et al 2017 moreover after the occurrence of extreme or unusual downstream flood or drought events sections of the public speculated about the influence of the chinese dams in 1993 and 1997 some mekong governments raised concerns when local communities related the uncommonly low water levels limiting navigation in the golden triangle area with the commissioning of the manwan dam yeophantong 2014 pp 711 712 during the dry season of 2004 a mekong crisis nearly arose when thai farmers in northern provinces were affected by unusual droughts in 2008 environmental organizations and local communities in thailand and lao pdr suspected the chinese dams and their blasting of rocks for navigation purposes as partially responsible for the heavy floods gunn and mccartan 2008 p 3 yeophantong 2014 p 712 the 2010 drought that coincided with mrc s first summit where china responded to allegations by the indignant public received wide media attention ahuja 2010 fuller 2010 leitsinger 2010 yeophantong 2014 pp 712 713 an acute water level peak in december 2013 and water level fluctuations in february 2014 again evoked speculations around chinese dams among thai and lao riverside communities mrc 2013 2014a while many of the extreme events were mainly related to unusual meteorological and hydrological patterns environmental organizations and riverside communities have stuck to their perceptions about the influence of the upper mekong dams ngo coalitions such as international rivers based in california the united states or the thai people s network for mekong have challenged arguments otherwise and asked for more transparency from china s side for the mrc china is a long standing dialogue partner 11 the other mrc dialogue partner is myanmar 11 with cooperation in regular yearly formal dialogue meetings data sharing and technical exchanges since the signing of the agreement on the provision of hydrological information of the lancang river during the flood season in april 2002 china has been sharing hydrological data on a daily basis from two stations one located at yunjinghong on the mekong mainstream and one on a tributary at manan between june 15 and october 15 this agreement was renewed in 2008 and 2013 with the period in the latest agreement extended by 30 days from 01 june to 31 october kittikhoun n y in this regard china often states that it shares more data with mrc than with any other parties it shares international rivers with mrc studies and assessments point to both potentially positive and negative effects of upper mekong development on the lower part analysis comparing the natural versus the flow under the influence of chinese dam operations have shown that the water flow tends to be higher during the dry season and lower during the flood season mrc and ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 räsänen et al 2017 during the 2004 drought event the mrcs ceo at the time actively worked to ease tensions including visiting the commission on foreign affairs of the thai house of representatives to discuss the benefits and possible adverse impacts from china s dams on thailand with data from china during the flood season and its own data from monitoring networks in the dry season the mrc has studied drought and flood situations in the basin including possible impacts by upper mekong dams mrc 2008b 2013 when necessary it asked for more detailed information from china this was the case in 2004 2010 and 2014 mrc 2010a mrc 2014a in 2010 due to queries and concerns raised by mrcs and mekong countries china invited a delegation of lower mekong government officials and mrcs for a visit to the xiaowan and jinghong dams followed by discussions with the chinese government in beijing on enhanced cooperation modalities mrc 2010b a breakthrough of sorts came in 2016 in the face of the severe drought situation in the mekong in the dry season between december 2015 and may 2016 when china released supplementary water at jinghong during the months of march april and may joint observation and analysis by china and the mrcs were conducted for the first time revealing some positive effects of the release increased water level and discharge along the mekong mainstream and decreased salinity intrusion in the mekong delta for this joint analysis china shared water level and discharge data from one lancang mainstream and one tributary station for the 2015 2016 drought season in addition long term average monthly water level and discharge data for 1960 2009 and 2010 2015 were exchanged mrc and ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 this cooperation gave further momentum to the mrc and china to conduct other joint work during a visit of the chinese vice minister of water resources to the mrcs in vientiane in november 2014 china committed to work with mrc in analysing past water fluctuations affecting the lower mekong basin mrc 2014b in april 2016 the mrcs china and the international water management institute iwmi agreed on a joint research proposal on the effect of the lancang cascade of dams on extreme events starting with the droughts of 2009 2010 flash flood of december 2013 and drought of 2015 2016 it is expected that the results would come out in 2018 mrc unpublished 2017a pp 62 63 at the 3rd mrc summit of april 2018 the chinese minister of water resources opened more doors for china mrc cooperation including strengthening synergy and connectivity among regional and national development strategies and collaborating among mekong related cooperation frameworks such as the asian development bank s greater mekong subregion program and the new mekong lancang cooperation 6 3 developing the lower mekong mainstream xayaburi don sahong and pak beng 6 3 1 xayaburi hydropower project the first mainstream dam in the lower mekong basin has caused lively debates among the mrc member countries donors civil society non governmental and international organizations several years ago it was not imaginable that an actual large dam would come to fruition in the lower mekong surely this gave rise to plenty of alarm bells about the coming conflict over the mekong this time actually primarily about the river the xayaburi hydropower project was submitted to mrcs for prior consultation in september 2010 from the beginning the lao government and its lead thai developer ch karnchang have presented their project as being environmentally friendly lao pdr jc working group 2011 p 1 mrc unpublished 2017b p 3 xayaburi was prioritised in previous mekong committee studies and is part of the six planned mainstream projects above vientiane that was assessed in a cumulative fashion by the mrc basin wide assessment of development scenarios in 2010 to be among those whose adverse impacts on cambodia and viet nam may due to distance and other factors be less significant than from those further downstream the more specific mrcs technical review of the project identified gaps in the submitted documents and in knowledge on migratory fish species and asked among others for further measures on fish and sediment management mrc 2011b concerns about impacts on fisheries resource have already emerged during a mrc regional multi stakeholder consultation on perspectives and interests related to hydropower development in the mekong basin in september 2008 mrc 2008a pp 10 11 there a group of international experts on fisheries and fish friendly dam design and operation reported the results of their assessment arguing that existing fish passage technologies are unlikely to allow a satisfactory migration of the diverse fish species with large numbers in the mekong dugan et al 2010 as the mrc s first six month prior consultation from december 2010 to april 2011 was drawing to a close some member countries asked for more time for transboundary impact studies and consultations especially cambodia and viet nam cambodia national mekong committee 2011 ministry of natural resources and environment thailand 2011 viet nam national mekong committee 2011 the strategic environment assessment sea of mainstream dams recommended a ten years deferral icem 2010 the sea which was carried out by a consulting company for mrc and did not have all mrc members official endorsement was frequently cited by the media and ngos for the project to be put on hold laos took the position not to extend the consultation period but showed willingness to conduct further studies to address issues raised by the mrcs technical review and concerns from stakeholders lao pdr jc working group 2011 in their understanding the process was complete as they had met all mrc standards as confirmed by a study by their international consulting and engineering company pöyry headquartered in finland as mrc governance bodies the jc and council were not able to reach a common agreement in april and december 2011 respectively the issue was referred for resolution by the governments following the conflict resolution clause stipulated in the 1995 mekong agreement mrc 2015a p 22 actually the case went up to the highest levels of government with the four prime ministers during the 3rd mekong japan summit in bali indonesia in november 2011 agreeing to commission a study on sustainable management and development of the mekong river basin including impacts by mainstream hydropower projects on 8 december 2011 the mrc council agreed to implement the study which became known as the council study 12 mrc conducted the council study from 2012 to 2017 the final report of more than 3600 pages was released beginning 2018 following numerous technical consultations at the regional and national levels as well as stakeholder fora the study assessed the environmental social and economic costs and benefits of existing and planned water resources developments in the lower mekong basin since its completion mrcs has reported key findings and messages in a series of national meetings to the member countries 12 mrc 2011a after the prior consultation process campaigns against the dam by national and international ngos continued and mrc donors helped to leverage stakeholder s requests by urging mrc and laos to conduct further studies and be transparent about the redesign of the xayaburi dam cambodia and viet nam also made representations to the lao government looking back one can observe that in terms of the water diplomacy scorecard the mrc has done quite solidly in the technical areas assessment and guidelines while the institutional and strategic aspects had room for improvement for example anticipating the notification of the first mainstream hydropower project the mrcs worked on various initiatives including the analysis of different mekong development scenarios for the basin development strategy a sea of the planned mainstream dams in the lower mekong basin studies on fish migration and the development of a hydropower program mrc 2008a p 5 the established mrc initiative on sustainable hydropower then coordinated the drafting process of the preliminary design guidance for proposed mainstream dams in the lower mekong basin pdg endorsed by the mrc jc in 2009 the pdg became an influential guide in the private sector community with plans to develop hydropower in the mekong mainstream this pdg served as the main tool the mrc used to assess the documents submitted by laos on the xayaburi hydropower project for this purpose the mrcs formed a task group to facilitate and support the work of the special jc working group that was established to advice the mrc jc during the prior consultation the prior consultation roadmap scope of assessment site visit mode of national consultations coordination issues and the findings of the assessment were discussed in three sessions of the jc working group a special jc session in april 2011 and a council meeting in december 2011 were tasked to conclude the process mrc 2011b pp 3 5 mrc 2015a p 22 during the whole process the mrcs task group with the support of a sediment and fisheries expert group and individual experts provided the most up to date technical knowledge according to international standards with the aim of improving xayaburi hydropower project mrc 2011b pp 3 4 relevant information on the prior consultation process and its results were put on the mrc website remarkably the mrc jc agreed to disclose and publish the results of the mrcs technical review in march 2011 mrc 2011a p 3 member countries conducted national consultations while regional stakeholder consultations were not held for the first prior consultation stakeholder voices and concerns about mainstream development were heard during the mrc basin development planning process sea and other related activities mrc 2011b p 4 mrc 2015a p 22 which helped inform the mrcs review of xayaburi even though the first prior consultation on the xayaburi dam was perceived as rather unsuccessful by some stakeholders citing issues ranging from not being able to stop the dam to too few opportunities for public participation the process allowed for public debates as well as recommendations from mrc and further studies by the developer that contributed to the improvement of the dam laos has invested in redesigning the dam at their own cost of hundreds of millions of dollars in 2015 it held a workshop to engage the mrcs and countries on their redesign and further measures to address fish and sediment issues mrc 2015a p 22 the lao government has also welcomed visits from all corners of the world to xayaburi for site inspection and mutual learning and has engaged leading international agencies such as the us army corps of engineers and the australian centre for international agricultural research to support ongoing design changes adaptation and monitoring nevertheless there was only some interaction and data and information exchange between laos its developer and the mrcs on the redesign and further measures taken as the post consultation process was not formalised mrc unpublished 2017b p 3 some information was submitted by laos to mrcs and mrcs has been reviewing changes in the dam design 13 for issues on the xayaburi prior consultation process see as well rieu clarke a 2015 notification and consultation procedures under the mekong agreement insights from the xayaburi controversy asianjil 5 01 143 175 13 6 3 2 don sahong hydropower project the don sahong hydropower project was the second dam on the mainstream to undergo the mrc prior consultation between july 2014 and january 2015 criticisms about the dam from environmentalist groups and ngo networks were no less fierce than that of xayaburi the dam is situated on the hou sahong channel on the mainstream in laos this channel carries most of the mekong discharge during the dry season mrc 2015b p 4 the hou sahong channel is a key route for fish migration the main concerns raised by the mrcs technical review related to whether it was possible to modify the nearby hou xang pheuak and hou sadam channels to be used as alternative fish routes in addition the possible impact on the irrawaddy dolphin population a now iconic specie in the mekong was raised mrc 2015b p 17 45 on the plus side the mrcs concluded that the possible adverse transboundary impacts related to water quality sediment and water flows to cambodia and the delta were less significant fisheries and livelihoods issues were the main concerns raised by ngos and civil society that have campaigned against the dam since its initial plans in 2006 for some stakeholders the 260 megawatt production of the small scale dam will not compensate for its potential negative environmental and social impacts during the don sahong prior consultation process a complaint against the developer malaysian mega first corporation berhad mfcb was submitted to the national human rights commission of malaysia and called for an investigation of the transboundary impacts on thai and cambodian communities international rivers 2015 the case even caught the attention of the un human rights mechanism with the un special procedures filing a report to the un human rights council citing allegations that the project may pose a threat to local livelihoods cambodia lying two kilometres downstream of the dam asked for more time to conduct transboundary environmental impact assessments to consider the most appropriate mitigation measures cambodia referred to article 7 of the 1995 mekong agreement urging laos to make every effort to avoid minimize and mitigate harmful effects that might occur to the environment cambodia national mekong committee 2015 viet nam was of the same view and asked for a prolongation of the prior consultation process until the end of 2015 viet nam national mekong committee 2015 thailand indicated that a six month extension would be appreciated to conduct further impact assessments ministry of natural resources and environment thailand 2015 in the lao view the risks related to the project are low as the project would only use one of several channels in the area minimizing disturbances to the hydrology and sediment transport the mrcs technical review also pointed out that these two issues were not significant laos wished to close the prior consultation process after six months as they have undertaken every effort to mitigate potential negative transboundary impacts ministry of natural resources and environment lao pdr and lao national mekong committee secretariat 2015 during the course of the project they have also submitted additional documents mrc 2015b p 44 similar to the xayaburi hydropower project the mrc jc and council could however not agree on how to move forward with the proposed don sahong dam and according to the 1995 mekong agreement the governments were asked to step in using their diplomatic channels the proceedings for the don sahong hydropower project have taken longer than those for xayaburi as the former was first submitted to the mrcs as a notification in september 2013 after the notified mrc countries asked for a resubmission for prior consultation the mrcs conducted a pre assessment of the documents from october to december 2013 which was considered during a special jc session in january 2014 in november 2013 as well as march 2014 based on invitations from the lao government site visits were conducted to don sahong by mrcs and country representatives in june 2014 laos informed the mrc that they would submit the project as a prior consultation mrc 2015b p 4 as was the case with the first prior consultation a mrcs task group worked on the technical review with the support of independent international experts the jc working group met three times and the jc once to discuss the proceeding and results of the assessment in addition to national consultations the mrcs organized one regional public consultation in pakse in southern laos mrc 2015b pp 4 6 in the case of don sahong the mrcs strength lies in providing technical expertise and recommendations the mrcs also proposed extending the prior consultation period to consider and assess additional documents submitted by laos mrc 2015b p 44 while the three notified countries supported this it proved difficult to have unanimous agreement as the modalities for a justified extension have not been clarified given the experience from xayaburi mrc unpublished 2017b p 4 timely provision of relevant information to the public and their participation opportunities have improved but remained at an informing stage mrc unpublished 2017b p 4 in november 2016 the cambodian prime minister aired the view that the don sahong project would not likely cause significant transboundary impact to cambodia after inspecting the project site although the post consultation process has still not been formalized the mrcs has managed to bring together the governments of laos and cambodia to agree to work on a joint project in the khonefalls area which includes a joint environmental monitoring program for the don sahong project under mrc to improve the mrc pnpca and other mrc procedures the mrcs established a joint platform in 2013 which has held a number of meetings and workshops with the objective to address recognized challenges in the implementation of the mrc procedures mrc unpublished 2017b p 2 convened by the mrcs the february 2017 dialogue workshop on lessons learned for pnpca bringing together practitioners from the countries and well known international legal experts was particularly instructive in making recommendations that will be crucial for future project assessments and negotiations 6 3 3 pak beng hydropower project while the pak beng hydropower project a lao project with investment from china did not face a high degree of public opposition like the first two cases issue of cumulative impacts nevertheless engendered media headlines such as killing the mekong dam by dam as the dam in laos is far upstream from cambodia and viet nam most concerns came from thai riverine communities whose vocal representatives had already taken the xayaburi case to court and are doing similarly with pak beng the main concerns of the mrcs technical review were related to sediment management the design of the fish passage and navigation lock furthermore the report recommended studying upstream impacts into thailand and socio economic impacts downstream mrcs 2017 pp 71 79 stakeholders were most concerned about fish sediment and dam cascade coordination issues the three notified countries provided feedback with regard to technical issues but also concerning availability of information and data they asked for more in depth studies on transboundary and cumulative impacts and mentioned monitoring and other follow up work cambodia national mekong committee 2017 ministry of natural resources and environment thailand 2017 viet nam national mekong committee 2017 laos showed commitment in taking into account raised issues lao national mekong committee secretariat 2017 the third mrc prior consultation from december 2016 to june 2017 was perceived as more successful by the mrc and stakeholders than the first two ones after the submission of the pak beng hydropower project in november 2016 there were clear expectations from the member countries stakeholder and development partners as mentioned lessons learned were captured by the mrc on the first two cases with recommendations that would form the basis to prepare for the third pnpca 14 lessons learned covered key issues such as timely notification completeness of information period of consultation the consultation preparation phase and post consultation process and stakeholder engagement among others 14 after the reform of the mrcs in 2016 it also emerged stronger with key management strategic and technical staff that were fully committed to ensuring a good process and outcome three factors were decisive firstly stakeholders were better informed and more engaged in the process regional forums were held openly in addition to many informal interactions and meetings with key stakeholders secondly the process has been more transparent and better managed with clearly defined steps for the preparation phase prior consultation and post consultation process thirdly a clear end result of the prior consultation was envisioned which succeeded in concluding a negotiated and agreed statement of the member countries in june 2017 mrcs 2017 p 1 mrc unpublished 2017b p 5 the mrc s donors applauded the process and outcome of the pnpca technical review and welcomed the agreed statement by the mrc member countries facilitated by the secretariat as in the previous two cases the timeline was tight to prepare and discuss the technical review conducted by the mrcs task group and international experts the jc working group met three times during the six month prior consultation period national experts supported the review process and provided inputs at the national level national and two regional public consultations organized by the mrcs considered stakeholders comments mrcs 2017 pp 11 12 the mrc has had the opportunity to influence the final design and operation of the dam as laos submitted the project at feasibility stage in addition to sharing technical expertise the mrcs has made strategic use of its networks within the member countries to lobby for an agreement on the prior consultation process for the first time focus on article 7 to make every effort to avoid minimise and mitigate harmful effects of the mekong agreement has helped to develop the joint statement mrc unpublished 2017b pp 5 6 a definite milestone achievement for the mrc and its member countries the agreed statement formed the basis for the development of a joint action plan for the pak beng project this formalized post prior consultation process has been received positively by stakeholders mrc unpublished 2017b p 6 the joint action plan will ensure regular exchange between the developer laos and mrc during the finalization of the design construction and operation phases of the dam the plan will be implemented and further adapted over time to meet changing needs and circumstances mrcs unpublished 2017 p 2 to further improve future pnpcas the joint statement asked to incorporate the key findings from the pak beng hydropower project pnpca process in the development of commentaries to the procedures for notification prior consultation and agreement through its work with the mrc joint platform mrc 2017 p 4 the main purpose of the commentaries is to further provide a common understanding on the pnpca moreover the pdg will be updated based on the newly developed mrc guidelines for hydropower impact mitigation and risk management considering lessons learnt and new critical topics mrc unpublished 2017a p 32 in short mrc s prior consultation process has improved in term of organizational aspects stakeholder engagement has evolved from informing to consulting towards collaboration on how to address concerns and therefore contributed to diffusing tensions 6 4 waterway transportation agreement between cambodia and viet nam while hydropower development in one of the great rivers of the world would naturally ignite a great deal of attention and therefore the water diplomacy work of the mrc this is not the only sector the organization works on plans to enhance waterborne transport in the mekong have also been controversial due to potential environmental and social impacts within the frame of mrc s mandate to enhance freedom of navigation in the basin the mrcs has been successful in addressing challenges of transboundary cooperation between cambodia and viet nam cross border trade and the efficiency of waterborne cargo and passenger transportation in december 2009 cambodia and viet nam signed a legally binding agreement on waterway transportation which has been enforced since january 2011 mrc 2015a p 29 mrc unpublished 2017a p 35 the mrcs significantly contributed to this historical step and has supported the countries in implementing the agreement the agreement was drafted by the mrcs navigation program team with the help of international experts in consultation with relevant entities of the governments of cambodia and viet nam mrc 2015a p 29 experiences from the belgium dutch scheldt treaty that allowed for improved waterborne transportation and trade on the river scheldt have helped shape the agreement mrc 2009 during the three year drafting and negotiation phase the mrcs advised and funded two national legal task forces and facilitated bilateral meetings between the two countries that led to the signing of the agreement mrc 2015a p 29 this is in contrast to earlier unsuccessful attempts at developing an agreement without the mrc by the two countries from 1998 to 2006 guttman 2013 7 conclusion in a region marred by historical conflicts superpower rivalries and recurrent tensions one wonders how the mekong basin states have managed to keep it together for almost thirty years now without a conflict over water resources tensions and challenges have popped up that could have escalated to active opposition and confrontation as in other regions of the world this paper argues that the role of an inter governmental river basin organization traditionally seen as more of the realm of technical water cooperation is absolutely critical in not only looking at the issues from an objective scientific perspective but also in facilitating and supporting negotiated solutions through established legal institutional and strategic mechanisms in the mekong the riparian countries and their development partners can be proud to have invested in the water diplomacy framework of the mrc as the cases of potential conflicts due to conflicting interests in using and developing the transboundary tributaries and mainstream demonstrate the organization has proven its worth and value in supporting the countries in trying to resolve disputes a strong and proactive mrc is able to legitimately make a difference due to the legal foundation of cooperation that it can reference the mekong agreement and procedures that require some obligations of member states the institutional support and engagement that it can muster from national mekong committees partners and stakeholders and the strategic direction that it has been given via the basin development strategy and other basin wide strategies e g looking beyond national borders and interests optimizing basin benefits and minimizing mitigating transboundary impacts while challenges for an organization such as mrc remain one can fairly say that it is one of the most successful cases of transboundary cooperation over a major river in the world in a region that is known as a hotbed of conflicts and rivalries from within and without a key to this success has been the existence and operation of the different aspects technical legal institutional and strategic of the mrc s water diplomacy framework lacking one or another could not be optimal underlying all of this is politics the often cited political commitment or lack thereof in the mekong case this commitment could be said to be the mekong spirit defined in typical mekong way as a combination of collective courage statesmanship perseverance and goodwill among the mekong states reflecting their collective desire for mutual understanding and accommodation to achieve a shared vision for the mekong 15 see section 4 in secretariat of the interim committee for coordination of investigations of the lower mekong basin 1989 the mekong committee

6912,a hydrologic model calibrated using only streamflow data can produce acceptable streamflow simulation at the watershed outlet yet unrealistic representations of water balance across the landscape recent studies have demonstrated the potential of multi objective calibration using remotely sensed evapotranspiration et and gaged streamflow data to spatially improve the water balance however methodological clarity on how to best integrate et data and model parameters in multi objective model calibration to improve simulations is lacking to address these limitations we assessed how a spatially explicit distributed calibration approach that uses 1 remotely sensed et data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and 2 frequently overlooked biophysical parameters can improve the overall predictability of two key components of the water balance streamflow and et at different locations throughout the watershed we used the soil and water assessment tool swat previously modified to represent hydrologic transport and filling spilling of landscape depressions in a large watershed of the prairie pothole region united states we employed a novel stepwise series of calibration experiments to isolate the effects on streamflow and simulated et of integrating biophysical parameters and spatially explicit remotely sensed et data into model calibration results suggest that the inclusion of biophysical parameters involving vegetation dynamics and energy utilization mechanisms tend to increase model accuracy furthermore we found that using a lumped versus a spatially explicit approach for integrating et into model calibration produces a sub optimal model state with no potential improvement in model performance across large spatial scales however when we utilized the same modis et datasets but calibrated each sub basin in the spatially explicit approach water yield prediction uncertainty decreased including a distinct improvement in the temporal and spatial accuracy of simulated et and streamflow this further resulted in a more realistic simulation of vegetation growth when compared to modis leaf area index data these findings afford critical insights into the efficient integration of remotely sensed big data into hydrologic modeling and associated watershed management decisions our approach can be generalized and potentially replicated using other hydrologic models and remotely sensed data resources and in different geophysical settings of the globe keywords modis multi objective calibration prairie pothole region swat uncertainty 1 introduction calibration of a hydrologic model involves constraining the solution space i e the range of parameter combinations to identify the most optimal parameter set that ostensibly represents watershed physics the traditional approach of calibration with gaged streamflow data may produce a pseudo accurate model showing acceptable skill for streamflow simulation at target locations while incorrectly representing internal watershed processes maneta et al 2017 rajib et al 2016a 2018a such a model giving right answers for wrong reasons a characteristic of equifinality beven 2012 beven and freer 2001 favis mortlock 2004 might lead to incorrect interpretation of a hypothesis or an unsuitable selection of land management alternatives for future scenarios the potential availability of remotely sensed streamflow estimates at ungaged locations is alluring nasa 2016 but the information contained in streamflow time series may not sufficiently capture how vertical fluxes evolve at different spatial and temporal scales within the watershed birkel et al 2014 li et al 2018 against this backdrop using spatially distributed remotely sensed estimates of water balance components e g soil moisture and evapotranspiration affords multi scale multi objective calibration of hydrologic models bai et al 2018 fatichi et al 2016 li et al 2016 which may help to remedy this equifinality or pseudo accuracy issue while remotely sensed surface soil moisture is being increasingly used in model calibrations e g milzow et al 2011 li et al 2018 parajka et al 2009 sutanudjaja et al 2014 wanders et al 2014 its influence on the simulation of root zone moisture evapotranspiration and streamflow could be limited depending on model structure chen et al 2011 han et al 2012 several studies e g brocca et al 2012 rajib et al 2016a silvestro et al 2015 have recommended constraining models with remotely sensed estimate s that can represent the entire majority portion of the root zone biotic e g vegetation growth and abiotic e g energy exchange processes this is where remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration et emerge as an effective data resource e g herman et al 2018 immerzeel and droogers 2008 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 rientjes et al 2013 vervoort et al 2014 winsemius et al 2008 currently two primary issues exist related to the use of remotely sensed et in model calibration first reproducible methods for handling spatially distributed and widely available big data such as remotely sensed et are not prominent in the literature for example inefficient methods for using remotely sensed et data as part of a multi objective calibration of hydrologic models across a large number of sub basins or any other spatial unit e g grid cells may have resulted in the current perception that this approach improves et but may have mixed or limited influence on streamflow simulations e g lópez lópez et al 2017 tobin and bennett 2017 second most studies that have used remotely sensed et data for model calibration focus only on calibrating surface sub surface and river routing parameters e g immerzeel and droogers 2008 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 rientjes et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2017 this practice does not leverage the potential for biophysical parameters within a hydrologic model to improve the overall representation of its physical processes yang and zhang 2016 zhu and zhuang 2015 it is yet to be explored whether biophysical parameters such as those associated with vegetation dynamics land atmosphere interaction and energy utilization affect model calibration performance with or without the use of remotely sensed et data in calibration process our study fills these knowledge gaps using a modified version of the process based semi distributed hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 neitsch et al 2011 through a series of calibration configurations we investigate i the degree to which adding biophysical parameters not traditionally considered in a streamflow only calibration effects hydrologic simulation ii the difference in simulated hydrologic responses due to the inclusion of remotely sensed et in a multi objective calibration with gaged streamflow data and iii the additional change in hydrologic responses if remotely sensed et is utilized in a spatially distributed calibration approach while this study methodologically benchmarks remote sensing enabled swat calibration in a north american watershed insights provided here should be applicable for other hydrologic models and geophysical settings as well 2 study area we conducted this study on the 1670 km2 pipestem creek watershed in north dakota united states fig 1 located in the prairie pothole region in the northern great plains pipestem creek watershed landform consists of two ecoregions the high elevation missouri coteau in the west and the drift plains in the eastern part of the watershed epa 2011 the coteau landscape in particular is pockmarked with thousands of wetland depressions created by glacial retreat during the wisconsinan period phillips et al 2005 winter and rosenberry 1995 these wetlands have been variously termed prairie potholes including non floodplain wetlands nfws lane et al 2018 amongst others tiner 2003 leibowitz 2015 mushet et al 2015 here we will use the term surface depressions the surface depressions in the prairie pothole region may be permanently inundated ephemeral or completely dry year to year labaugh et al 1998 winter and rosenberry 1998 primary water input in these surface depressions is the spring snowmelt and direct precipitation as such water levels progressively drop through the summer months kantrud et al 1989 this oscillatory dry wet cycle makes et a dominant driver of water which responds to and also affects the fluctuations and successions of vegetation euliss et al 2004 gleason et al 2008 van der valk 1981 2005 van der valk and mushet 2016 van der kamp et al 2016 with all these features pipestem creek watershed is an ideal watershed for hydrologic modeling experiments 3 methodology we constructed four calibration configurations of a modified swat model evenson et al 2016 with increasing number of parameters and a progressively discretized way of optimizing them using remotely sensed et data the four configurations include i m1 basic calibration using only streamflow data evenson et al 2016 ii m2 biophysics another application of m1 incorporating biophysical parameters iii m3 lumped et multi objective calibration of m2 using both remotely sensed et and streamflow data parameters were optimized in a lumped approach commonly followed in many previous studies iv m4 spatial et the same as m3 except the parameters were optimized in a spatially distributed approach based on the outcome of these calibration experiments we quantified the effects of biophysical parameters and remotely sensed et data on simulated water balance components specifically et and streamflow to further reveal the nature of change in prediction uncertainty temporal and spatial variability of streamflow and vegetation growth we have conducted additional assessments using two configurations in the following we first outline the model and the data used then provide a detailed description of the model configurations 3 1 a modified swat model the major modeling components in swat include hydrology vegetation dynamics landscape and in stream nutrient loading stream temperature and land management gassman et al 2007 swat divides a watershed into multiple sub basins which are then further discretized into hydrologic response units hrus consisting of homogeneous land use management topographical and soil characteristics neitsch et al 2011 the modified swat model used in this study was originally developed by evenson et al 2016 with improved spatial representation and hydrologic functions evenson et al 2016 conducted a series of novel modifications in the existing swat source code neitsch et al 2011 to i enable a spatially explicit representation of surface depressions and hydrologic transport between surface depressions and uplands ii improve seepage and sub surface inflow simulation and iii facilitate the simulation of fill spill hydrologic relationships there have been several applications of the swat model to specifically understand the hydrologic effects of surface depressions e g almendinger et al 2011 evenson et al 2015 2018 liu et al 2008 rahman et al 2016 wang et al 2008 swat has also been widely used for hydrological modeling in various geophysical settings worldwide including major river basins in the united states rajib and merwade 2017 europe abbaspour et al 2015 africa schuol et al 2008 and asia islam et al 2017 thus findings from this study may be pertinent to worldwide swat model applications and at spatial scales much larger than the pipestem creek watershed 3 2 geospatial inputs and weather forcing the 30 m national elevation dataset usgs ned 2015 30 m 2011 national land cover database nlcd homer et al 2015 and 1 250 000 state soil geographic database statsgo nrcs 2015 available within swat database were the primary geospatial inputs in the modified swat model to have a spatially explicit representation of surface depressions in the swat model evenson et al 2016 first identified surface depressions using the national wetland inventory nwi http www fws gov wetlands and national hydrography dataset nhd https nhd usgs gov following lane et al 2012 and then estimated their storage capacities using a digital terrain constructed from 10 m ned e g lane and d amico 2010 this approach provided unprecedented geospatial specificity to model a watershed as discretely as possible contrasting the 1217 hrus that a swat model would produce for the pipestem creek watershed based upon ned nlcd and statsgo data modified spatial representation by evenson et al 2016 had 62 721 hrus within the same number of sub basins n 29 we used the daymet daily total precipitation and average maximum minimum temperature as the primary weather inputs thornton et al 2014 gridded data available at 1 km spatial resolution while creating ancillary weather inputs i e solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity using the swat model s built in weather generator wgn neitsch et al 2011 as we maintained identical weather inputs in all the four calibration configurations possible propagation error resulted from daymet and wgn data may have equivalent effect on the simulation results 3 3 mechanism for simulating et and vegetation dynamics we let swat estimate potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman monteith p m method such that et simulations were compatible with modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer algorithm section 3 4 2 taking this pet as the maximum permissible limit swat simulates an evaporative demand etd that is spatially across hrus and temporally along daily time steps variable swat s p m equation to estimate plant demand the transpiration component of etd requires leaf area index lai lai representing the spatio temporal dynamics of vegetation growth is simulated via a biome specific semi empirical leaf development curve with several user defined biophysical parameters like radiation use efficiency and maximum canopy height soil demand or the evaporation component of etd follows an exponential relationship with above ground vegetation also simulated by leveraging similar parameters rajib et al 2018a eventually swat uses the existing moisture content in soil profile to scale etd into et rajib and merwade 2016 this built in architecture to simulate lai and et was retained in our modified swat model 3 4 reference data for model calibration and verification 3 4 1 streamflow for calibration and verification of the modified swat model we used streamflow data from the only available us geological survey usgs gaging station at the watershed outlet fig 1 but varied how this data was included in the multi objective calibration depending on the model configuration see section 3 5 this gage had 41 estimated values over a 5 year period 753 of 1826 data points between 2009 and 2013 especially prevalent during the winter months when icy conditions prevent gage reading to avoid uncertainties implicit in statistical estimation of streamflow time series chokmani et al 2008 hamilton 2004 we only used the observed data in model calibration following evenson et al 2018 and 2016 however given the large inter annual hydrologic variability in the watershed and the prairie pothole region as a whole van der valk 2005 van der valk and mushet 2016 van der kamp et al 2016 it was deemed necessary to perform a long term verification of the calibrated model leveraging the best available data to facilitate this we included both estimated and observed streamflow data for model verification purposes 3 4 2 remotely sensed evapotranspiration and vegetation the 8 day total 1 km gridded et data from modis mod16a2 collection 5 mu et al 2013 was geo referenced and spatially aggregated into each of the 29 sub basins of the pipestem creek watershed using a semi automatic web based tool rajib et al 2018b while dynamically accounting for the heterogeneity in size shape and locations of the sub basins the tool puts area weighted average value of 8 day total et mm h20 from encompassing and or intersecting modis grid cells onto each of the sub basins despite potential inaccuracies due to spatial aggregation zhang et al 2016 this area weighted averaging is a reasonable scheme to create spatially explicit time series of remotely sensed data for hydrologic modeling purposes ershadi et al 2013 rajib et al 2018a to enable swat calibration at a daily time scale we temporally disaggregated the sub basin level 8 day total modis et data using the corresponding daily estimates from the north american land data assimilation system nldas phase 2 nasa 2017 eq 1 1 et i m et t m et i n et t n here m and n represent modis and nldas respectively t refers to the total 8 day value the index i denotes a particular day within that 8 day segment t we applied the same data processor tool to create sub basin level nldas time series from its original 12 km gridded estimates both modis and nldas estimates are based on the penman monteith p m method however assumptions on aerodynamic surface resistances as well as the sources of land use and meteorological input data in their respective algorithms are different differences between the absolute values of modis and nldas et did not affect et i m as we used nldas estimate in eq 1 only as a temporal scaling factor without altering the total amount of et estimated by modis in each 8 day window et t m therefore we labeled the modis nldas hybrid estimate et i m simply as modis et logic suggests that simulated et will follow the spatio temporal trend of reference et that constrains a hydrologic model during the calibration process modis data in our study therefore to build multiple lines of evidence on the overall improvement of the model in representing watershed characteristics and particularly the energy balance we used lai as an independent reference variable not included in the calibration process our lai based evaluation is novel because it is the first to use vegetation dynamics for cross verification when remotely sensed et is applied in model calibration previous studies on model calibration using remotely sensed et measured performance improvements based solely on simulated et outputs e g herman et al 2018 immerzeel and droogers 2008 rientjes et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2017 no other variables were considered to compare lai simulations across model configurations we obtained watershed average lai data from a 4 day total modis product mcd15a3h version 6 myneni et al 2015 creation of watershed average lai time series from the original 500 m gridded data again required employing the semi automatic data processor tool however no temporal re scaling was necessary in this case as we computed 4 day total values from swat s daily outputs to match temporal resolution of the original modis data with the advances in satellite sensor technologies and data assimilation techniques various multi source robust et products have emerged in recent years some of these relatively new et estimates are available at a daily time step not requiring any temporal re scaling disaggregation e g zhang et al 2016 2010 yet we preferred using modis et and lai data because these are open source global datasets with long term and continuous availability reasonably good spatio temporal resolution and more importantly well documented quality assessments e g mu et al 2011 2013 ruhoff et al 2013 yan et al 2016 yang et al 2006 velpuri et al 2013 because uncertainties are common in any remotely sensed product none of these datasets should be considered as actual observations 3 5 calibration configurations fig 2 schematically outlines the modeling architecture involved in the four calibration configurations namely m1 basic m2 biophysics m3 lumped et and m4 spatial et all explained below in individual subsections all calibrations were conducted at daily time step using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi version 2 in the swat cup platform abbaspour 2015 abbaspour et al 2007 to be consistent with evenson et al 2018 and 2016 each configuration went through a 3 year initialization 2006 2008 followed by a 3 year calibration 2009 2011 the iterations were divided into two successive batches sufi 2 uses latin hypercube sampling lhs to set potential parameter combinations based on the specified initial range for every calibration parameter using an inverse optimization approach sufi 2 then finds a narrower range of parameter values at the end of the preliminary batch to initiate the next batch for further iterations we selected kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 as the objective function which was maximized for streamflow and et depending on the model configuration to find the most optimal parameter set kge decomposes nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and mean squared error mse into a three dimensional criteria space and finds out a pareto front in terms of the shortest euclidean distance ed 2 kge 1 e d 1 r 1 2 μ s μ 0 1 2 σ s σ 0 1 2 where r represents the correlation μ s μ 0 and σ s σ 0 respectively represent bias and variability ratio between the simulated and observed variable μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the variable the indices s and o denote simulation and observed data respectively kge ranges from to 1 with a value closer to 1 indicates a relatively accurate model as noted above our goal was to keep the total length of the simulation consistent with previously published research on pipestem creek watershed using the same modified model e g evenson et al 2018 2016 however the need for long term verification of model outputs and the limited availability of observed streamflow data see section 3 4 1 made it challenging to follow the conventional split sample approach where model calibration and verification is conducted over two non overlapping independent time periods we therefore evaluated verified our calibrated model configurations over a 5 year period 2009 2013 despite this partial overlap with the calibration period 2009 2011 our approach resulted in an acceptable degree of independence among the calibration and verification datasets for three reasons 1 we excluded estimated streamflow data from the model calibration but included them in the verification stage 2 our model verification with streamflow and et data included two more years 2012 2013 beyond the calibration period and 3 we used lai data as a measure of cross verification to facilitate further independent evaluation and assess how a multi objective use of et and streamflow in swat calibration might change the model s response during extreme flood events we also excluded a specific portion of observed streamflow record august 2011 from the calibration period and used it for model verification 3 5 1 baseline model m1 m1 basic involved calibration only with streamflow data at the watershed outlet and included 21 parameters related to surface sub surface runoff channel routing and snow accumulation processes in the calibration fig 3 and table a1 in appendix a all of these parameters their respective initial range and the m1 configuration as a whole were identical with the calibration performed by evenson et al 2016 differing in this study only in the management of snow parameters we excluded snow parameters after the first batch of iterations to be able to compare with m4 outputs see below in section 3 5 4 m1 was our baseline to measure the degree of model improvement in subsequent configurations 3 5 2 effect of biophysical parameters m2 m2 biophysics was the same as m1 basic except with the addition of 10 parameters related to biophysical processes see fig 3 there are more than 20 such parameters in swat geodatabase neitsch et al 2011 however they are often underutilized and assigned default values the parameters we selected collectively represent a range of processes including vegetation growth land atmosphere feedback and energy use mechanisms having more parameters would push the computational overhead of our hyper resolution model 63 000 hrus beyond a workable limit initial ranges for the 10 additional parameters were set following the suggestions from swat developers abbaspour 2015 most of the contemporary swat applications including those on watersheds with abundant surface depressions e g evenson et al 2016 rahman et al 2016 ikenberry et al 2017 do not consider biophysical parameters in model calibration the underlying notion is that biophysical parameters are least sensitive for hydrologic simulation compared to those representing runoff routing and snow accumulation processes however due to the heavily conceptualized equations that swat employs to capture biophysical interactions it is possible that including the relevant parameters within a simple streamflow only calibration can make notable difference in the overall spatial hydrologic response of the model we performed the built in global sensitivity analysis scheme in sufi 2 abbaspour 2015 rajib and merwade 2016 to substantiate this notion optimizing 31 parameters through the first batch of iterations the second batch in m2 biophysics excluded the snow parameters which made it comparable with m1 basic see fig 2 thus differences in outputs between these two configurations identified the effect of biophysical parameters on model predictability 3 5 3 use of remotely sensed et data in model calibration m3 the most optimal model resulting from the first batch of iterations in m2 biophysics became the starting point for m3 lumped et fig 2 the difference between these two configurations was solely that m3 lumped et included modis et as an additional model constraint in the second and final batch of iterations the optimization algorithm sufi 2 used 30 constraints together 29 time series of modis et one for each sub basin and a single time series of streamflow data watershed outlet the 30 objective functions essentially 30 kges as shown in eq 3 were given equal weighting factor to form an aggregated value kge 3 k g e i 1 n f w f i k g e f i j 1 n e w e j k g e e j here n and w are the number of objective variables reference datasets and the weight assigned to each of them respectively the values f and e stand for streamflow and et respectively also i denotes the streamflow gaging stations and j denotes sub basins with modis et data the parameter set producing the highest kge was the most optimal one unlike the runoff routing parameters in swat the majority of its biophysical parameters cannot be defined at hru or sub basin level instead these parameters are associated with specific plant biome type and it is possible that the same biome type may exist in multiple hrus or sub basins because of this inconsistency the m3 configuration restricts every parameter so that it can only be changed in a unique way irrespective of the hru sub basin more specifically in successive iterations during the calibration a particular parameter must have an identical amount rate of change across the entire watershed and that amount rate is pre selected from a latin hypercube sampling of its initial range of values this is essentially a lumped approach notwithstanding the inclusion of spatially distributed modis et data in the calibration process hereafter referred as m3 lumped et previous studies indiscriminately applied this lumped approach even though biophysical parameters were not included in their respective calibrations consequently it became common to lump all the available et time series into a single calibration target eq 3 e g immerzeel and droogers 2008 rientjes et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2017 regardless of these limitations m3 lumped et configuration provided new insights as noted considering that the use of modis et in m3 lumped et was the only difference from m2 biophysics comparison of these two configurations can distinguish the effect of remotely sensed data from that of biophysical parameters which had not been addressed in any previous study 3 5 4 value of spatially distributed calibration using remotely sensed et m4 m3 lumped et and m4 spatial et were identical except a spatially distributed calibration approach was implemented in the m4 configuration the goal of m4 spatial et was to leverage the maximum potential of spatially distributed modis et data and allow highly discretized parameter optimization by calibrating 29 sub basins individually each sub basin had two constraints to find optimal parameters a representative time series of modis et specific to the sub basin and a time series of streamflow data at the watershed outlet lack of spatial heterogeneity in snow accumulation processes is a limitation in the current swat modeling framework all the snow parameters in swat can only be defined at watershed level neitsch et al 2011 that is why iteration of snow parameters was technically impossible in a sub basin level calibration approach such as m4 spatial et in order to have an even comparison with m4 spatial et snow parameters were not adjusted after the first batch of iterations in any of the four configurations this problem is very specific to swat continued optimization of snow parameters throughout the calibration process and that in an m4 spatial et type setup might be doable in the case of other hydrologic models 4 results 4 1 model predictability across the spectrum of calibration configurations both biophysical parameters and remotely sensed et data influenced model predictability this is evidenced by the relative change of model performance among the four configurations in terms of kge for simulated daily et at sub basin level and streamflow at the watershed outlet fig 4 a c considering the improved spatial representation seepage sub surface inflow and fill spill hydrologic simulation of surface depressions evenson et al 2016 the baseline configuration m1 should exhibit minimal inaccuracy in reproducing hydrologic processes as expected the high kge score 0 90 in m1 basic for the most optimal streamflow simulation during the calibration period fit the traditional swat evaluation rubric of a very good hydrologic model moriasi et al 2015 but pseudo accuracy was evident based on the low watershed average kge 0 60 for et demonstrating potential limitations of simulated vertical water fluxes in the m1 basic configuration this may in part be an underlying reason that the streamflow simulation in m1 basic did not perform well in the verification phase see fig 4c the pseudo accuracy was intriguing as it indicated the need for supplementing spatially explicit hydrologic transport between surface depressions and fill spill mechanisms in a hydrologic model with measures that potentially account for other process uncertainties in the model one way to address this issue was to focus on biophysical parameters inclusion of biophysical parameters in model calibration is appropriate because of the coupled relationships the vegetation and energy related processes have with the partitioning of water at different scales of a watershed the same model m1 basic showed a different and slightly improved see fig 4c model performance simply when additional biophysical parameters were included in a streamflow only calibration m2 biophysics compared to the variable spatial nature of et simulation in the m1 basic configuration with sub basins having very high 0 75 to very low 0 40 kges m2 biophysics suggested an improved spatial accuracy via more consistent kges 0 50 0 70 across the watershed fig 4b this seemingly improved model state in m2 biophysics resonated in the streamflow verification showing relatively higher kge than m1 basic fig 4c while these results confirmed the sensitivity of biophysical parameters to mediate hydrologic processes in a watershed with abundant surface depressions and fill spill phenomena fig 3 one can expect that these parameters would affect hydrologic simulations in other geophysical settings too including agricultural and forested landscapes e g quinton et al 2010 yang and zhang 2016 however it is expected that the calibration of biophysical parameters is more effective in the presence of constraint datasets relevant to their physical processes e g et and vegetation growth in the next configuration with modis et as an additional calibration target m3 lumped et we found considerable improvement in swat s et simulation fig 4a and b hypothetically improved et implies improved physical representation of the model s water balance components as such other hydrologic processes including streamflow should reflect traces of improvement too this was evident in m3 lumped et through a distinctively increased streamflow kge during the model verification although streamflow kge decreased in the calibration period compared to m1 basic and m2 biophysics fig 4c the goal of the m4 spatial et configuration was to evaluate whether using the same calibration targets of m3 lumped et in a spatially distributed approach can further improve model performance results from m4 spatial et were the most telling in terms of kge scores for both et and streamflow simulations the watershed average kge for et was 0 70 in m4 spatial et particularly contrasting to 0 60 in m1 basic and the highest among the four configurations as we moved through our calibration experiments from one level to the next m1 to m4 we identified increasing gain in the overall spatial accuracy of et simulations fig 4a and b we interpreted this drift in spatial accuracy pulling of models efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 by looking onto the spread and skewness of sub basin level kge distributions for instance the best spatial accuracy in m4 spatial et fig 4a was reflected through the smallest spread range of kges and the maximum skewness toward high kges fig 4b this evolution of model performance quantitatively showed how the state of a model can transitionally improve in predictability and shrink in equifinality with a spatially explicit et calibration in line with its spatial accuracy in et simulation m4 spatial et showed remarkably improved streamflow simulation skill during the model verification kge 0 75 fig 4c while these results collectively made m4 spatial et the superior configuration another key aspect made marked difference in the efficacy of m4 s spatially distributed calibration approach unlike m3 lumped et m4 spatial et did not show a drastic drop in streamflow calibration performance it rather retained nearly the same calibration performance as m1 basic and m2 biophysics despite a multi objective optimization with the same total volume of et data used to calibrate m3 lumped et in this way m4 spatial et fully complied with the theoretical cause and effect expectancy that an improved representation of water and energy balance should result in improved streamflow simulation as well 4 2 additional insights on hydrologic representation to further explore the overall improvements achievable through the m4 spatial et configuration below we present a holistic evaluation of its outputs focusing on three different perspectives i uncertainty in predicted water balance ii temporal and spatial variability of streamflow and iii vegetation growth here m4 spatial et is contrasted only against m1 basic given these are the two extreme configurations in terms of model accuracy 4 2 1 uncertainty in predicted water balance m4 spatial et showed substantially reduced uncertainty in simulated water yields compared to m1 fig 5 we chose water yield as a holistic index of water balance because it is the amount of water contributed to stream after the model accounts for fill spill hydrology and all hydrological losses e g to evapotranspiration and soil infiltration neitsch et al 2011 the relative uncertainty mapped in fig 5a reflects the average 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band width in calibrated water yield outputs at the sub basin level normalized with respect to the minimum and maximum band widths across all the sub basins irrespective of a particular configuration here our simulations showed consistently smaller prediction uncertainty in m4 spatial et irrespective of the location and timing of high flow events within the watershed fig 5b 4 2 2 temporal and spatial variability of streamflow we compared the temporal variability of streamflow between m1 basic and m4 spatial et in terms of their flow exceedance probability at the watershed outlet fig 6 irrespective of the flow regime high flow medium flow and low flow the most optimal streamflow output from m4 spatial et generally showed better conformity with usgs data compared to m1 basic taking into account fill spill processes during extreme events improved high flow simulations in m4 spatial et indicate enhanced functioning of the modified spatial representation and hydrologic transport proposed by evenson et al 2016 fig 6 however given the high inter annual variability of ponded area in the prairie pothole region van der valk and mushet 2016 it is not surprising that hydrologic models would struggle in reproducing average condition water balance in the watershed accordingly m1 basic and m4 spatial et both resulted in large departures from usgs data during medium flow conditions however the difference usgs minus swat was consistently smaller in the case of m4 spatial et furthermore simulated streamflow in m4 spatial et was in closer proximity with usgs data 90 of the time during the 2009 2013 period indicated by the low flow conditions in fig 6 this was expected given the influence of et on the diffusivity of soil moisture and mobility of groundwater when there is no surface runoff tobin and bennett 2017 szilagyi et al 2007 these results also afford temporal insight to the variation of streamflow kge values shown in fig 4c in addition to temporal dynamics we found prominent differences between m1 basic and m4 spatial et in the spatial variability of streamflow even when both configurations produced peak flows at the same time stamp as the usgs data fig 7 apart from this identical temporal response particularly in the two specific flood dates shown here we also noted the peak magnitudes which were distinctively more accurate in the case of m4 spatial et the combined impression from this duo i e timing and magnitude suggest that the spatial variability captured in m1 basic may have unrealistic representation of landscape response 4 2 3 model accuracy in simulating vegetation growth the traditional way of gaging the level of physical realism in a hydrologic model is to assess improvements in water balance components therefore models are often not assessed for accuracy in energy balance components although the energy balance can considerably influence water balance hurkmans et al 2008 rajib et al 2018a troch et al 2009 we considered watershed average vegetation growth lai as an indicator that implicitly represents the collective effects of improved water and energy balances in the model long et al 2014 m1 basic produced unrealistically high lai values compared to m4 spatial et and modis data fig 8 the lack of biophysical parameters in the m1 basic calibration and therefore the use of default values that for the most part stayed spatially constant across the watershed undermined the ability of the model to simulate vegetation dynamics the inaccurate lai in m1 basic indicated another persistent limitation of the model suggesting that a modified water retention discharge fill spill mechanism evenson et al 2016 may only have limited influence on other hydrologic processes in a watershed although swat s default lai development formulation was not modified in any of our model configurations based on swat s internal structure see section 3 3 the parameter values defining the shape and inflection points of the lai curve could be varied spatially in the m4 spatial et calibration and that using spatially explicit et data therefore the m4 lai values compare better with the modis lai this improved representation of vegetation dynamics in m4 spatial et compared to m1 basic was a reasonable indicator that the model was efficiently reproducing both water and energy partitioning which may affect future biogeochemical applications of the model including carbon storage and nutrient cycling 5 discussion 5 1 managing potential limitations involving remotely sensed data for calibration using remotely sensed data to calibrate a hydrologic model will inevitably produce different outputs compared to the same model that uses gaged streamflow data as the calibration objective it is questionable however whether the differences in the remote sensing integrated model emerge for right reasons to enable physically meaningful application of remotely sensed et in model calibration and therefore get the right changes in model predictability for the right reasons we took measures to overcome the following challenges 5 1 1 is multi objective calibration with et and streamflow more effective compared to using et alone simultaneous use of streamflow and et in hydrologic model calibration is recommended as a best practice e g kunnath poovakka et al 2016 rientjes et al 2013 vervoort et al 2014 studies using remotely sensed soil moisture preferred the same li et al 2018 rajib et al 2016a wanders et al 2014 a model calibrated against only et or soil moisture would produce too little or too much of a particular vertical water flux to the atmosphere or through soil horizons unless the horizontal water routing in the model are also simultaneously adjusted the outcome would be a highly equifinal model having good accuracy for a specific vertical flux but adverse or no change in streamflow simulation accuracy e g lópez lópez et al 2017 tobin and bennett 2017 wanders et al 2014 for similar reasons decoupling the horizontal water routing component is a potential reason why some current generation hybrid land surface river routing models exhibit acknowledged timing problems in vertical fluxes as well as in streamflow simulations e g lin et al 2018 therefore it is rational to accept that watershed hydrologic responses can be best captured when both the vertical and the horizontal flux components in the model are constrained with relevant calibration targets such as et and streamflow the amount of uncertainty in remotely sensed et is purportedly higher than that in gaged streamflow data vervoort et al 2014 in our initial exploration not shown we found that modis et if used from the very beginning of the calibration process inserts propagating error so that the accuracy of simulated streamflow with respect to gage station data cannot be improved beyond a certain level we also found that this model state is irreversible and may not be reinstated without changing the sequence of introducing modis et data into the calibration process therefore we hypothesized that calibrating the model first with gaged streamflow a relatively well verified in situ dataset produces a reasonable water balance that could serve as a baseline for further adjustment of hydrologic fluxes through a multi objective approach involving both streamflow and et this two step calibration is also favorable for applying other remotely sensed datasets including soil moisture for which systematic bias is a deterring factor draper et al 2009 reichle and koster 2004 simulated soil moisture output from a model that is pre calibrated against streamflow data can be used to reduce systematic bias in the remotely sensed soil moisture before it is integrated with the model through a data assimilation and or a re calibration process e g lópez lópez et al 2017 rajib et al 2016a wanders et al 2014 5 1 2 is it justified to calibrate et related parameters separately related to the two step calibration explained above it may not be physically coherent to calibrate biophysical or et related parameters separately herman et al 2018 applied remotely sensed et data to adjust only four additional parameters in a swat model excluding all the other surface subsurface and routing parameters that were initially calibrated using streamflow data in a preceding step as we performed global sensitivity analysis several parameters with apparent high sensitivity in m1 basic e g main channel manning s n were ultimately found to be less sensitive in the presence of biophysical parameters see fig 3 this provides supportive evidence that parameters in process based hydrologic models e g swat or coupled atmospheric land surface models e g wrf hydro gochis et al 2015 represent an integrated natural system as such they have an unknown degree of mutual relationships that may not be explicitly evident from their mathematical equations sivakumar and singh 2012 therefore not using a common set of parameters throughout the calibration process convolutes the effect of a new objective function remotely sensed data with that of the additional parameters initially not considered in preceding iterations such a calibration protocol may not be ideal because it cannot identify whether the improvement in model simulation is solely due to the use of remotely sensed data 5 2 benchmarking a calibration strategy using spatially distributed remotely sensed data the substantial disparity of simulation accuracy in m4 spatial et compared to m1 basic m2 biophysics or m3 lumped et rationalizes the spatially distributed use of remotely sensed et data in hydrologic model calibration while this corroborates suggestions made in previous literature e g immerzeel and droogers 2008 rientjes et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2017 assessments in these studies were mostly based on an m3 lumped et type configuration our study is the first to identify that m3 lumped et produces an ostensibly good but actually sub optimal model state it is therefore worthwhile to review what factors undermine m3 lumped et so that one can benchmark m4 spatial et as a better approach for model calibrations especially on large spatial scales the sub optimality of m3 lumped et was apparent mainly through the distinctive decrease in its streamflow calibration performance notwithstanding the improvement it offers in et simulation section 4 1 importantly herman et al 2018 showed similar tendency with a number of optimization algorithms including nondominated sorted genetic algorithm ii and monte carlo simulations it could also be a problem specific to the source of our data modis et mu et al 2011 2013 considering the uncertainty commonly seen in all remotely sensed estimates however previous studies reported similar results calibrating respective hydrologic models with et data from the surface energy balance system sebs rientjes et al 2013 atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model herman et al 2018 and global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam lópez lópez et al 2017 tobin and bennett 2017 this was evident when models were calibrated with soil moisture data as well li et al 2018 rajib et al 2016a wanders et al 2014 given the above the sub optimality problem does not seem fundamental to the data model or optimization algorithm we suggest that the sub optimality in m3 lumped et was in part an implementation problem in this configuration s set up that requires the optimization algorithm to handle too many objectives simultaneously in the context of this study the sufi 2 parameter identification program resulted in an averaging effect while searching for a parameter combination that was optimal for all the 30 objectives or constraints section 3 5 3 eq 3 what had not been addressed in the existing literature is the inefficient use of emerging earth data resources and or inappropriate handling of model parameters e g herman et al 2018 lópez lópez et al 2017 tobin and bennett 2017 see section 5 1 which are also viable factors affecting model performance in general the potential explanations for the limited performance or sub optimality in m3 lumped et have contributed to an evolving misperception that calibration with remotely sensed et or soil moisture data may not improve streamflow simulations as a result there is a growing number of remote sensing studies that discourage the use of lowered streamflow calibration performance as a generic goodness metric to label a model s overall streamflow prediction skills kunnath poovakka et al 2016 rajib et al 2016a rientjes et al 2013 wanders et al 2014 li et al 2018 in a multi objective calibration using soil moisture and streamflow reported substantially increased streamflow accuracy when their most optimal model was verified at locations that were not included in the calibration process despite an apparently poor performance in target calibration locations this was analogous to our m3 lumped et results which had a higher kge value than m1 basic and m2 biophysics in the streamflow verification process fig 4c indicating model improvement in the right direction nonetheless continued applications of m3 lumped et given what our results suggest could produce acute problems in large scale hydrologic modeling e g emerton et al 2016 lin et al 2018 with more objectives to target and sub basins to calibrate i e a very large number of streamflow and et time series m3 lumped et might result in diminishing returns with no net improvement in water balance the m4 spatial et configuration moves beyond the averaging effect issue even though it uses the same total volume of modis datasets as m3 lumped et we therefore considered m4 spatial et an improved approach compared to m3 lumped et however it is computationally expensive to operate an m4 spatial et type setup and harness the maximum capacity of spatially distributed data by calibrating each of the sub basins individually at this point we could argue that one can still adopt m3 lumped et and make a tradeoff by accepting a calibrated model that is generally representative of internal watershed processes but relatively poor in streamflow simulation yet this argument lacks scientific integrity because it gives an impression that models with persistent problems are acceptable the tradeoff argument also weakens the value of remote sensing integrated hydrologic modeling amidst the new trend of large scale streamflow flood forecasting initiatives world wide e g li et al 2016 lin et al 2018 with the recent advancements in open access cyber enabled high performance calibration platforms such as swatshare rajib et al 2016b and their potential interoperability with observational data resources horsburgh et al 2016 morsy et al 2017 tarboton et al 2014 developing a computationally efficient reproducible workflow for the m4 spatial et type calibration configuration is no more impossible 6 summary and conclusion it is not surprising that a hydrologic model may misrepresent the true state of water and energy balances given the complexity involved in simulating watershed hydrology correctly one approach that has been increasingly used to improve simulation accuracy particularly in watersheds with abundant surface depressions is the modification of existing model frameworks to improve spatially explicit hydrologic transport between and among surface depressions and other water bodies as well as retention discharge fill spill mechanisms in this study we hypothesized that the accuracy of such a modified model can be further improved by including biophysical parameters and remotely sensed et data in the model calibration process specifically we constructed four calibration configurations of a modified swat model namely m1 basic m2 biophysics m3 lumped et and m4 spatial et with increasing number of parameters and a progressively discretized way of optimizing them using modis et data based on the outcome of this experiment the following conclusions were drawn 1 despite modifying the hydrologic transport and water retention discharge fill spill mechanism calibration of a swat model involving the traditionally used runoff routing parameters and using only streamflow data m1 basic was less accurate in its simulated water balance components namely et and streamflow than the other configurations with improved calibration methods m2 m4 2 the same model showed slightly improved et and streamflow simulations when biophysical parameters were included in the calibration process m2 biophysics while this finding confirms the sensitivity of biophysical parameters we suggest that their calibration would be effective and meaningful if the model is constrained with datasets that are more relevant to vegetation dynamics land atmosphere interaction and energy utilization processes e g et and or lai 3 regardless of the lumped nature of calibration we found that the m3 lumped et i e the m2 biophysics model calibrated with sub basin modis et data and gaged streamflow aggregated as a single optimization objective noticeably increased the accuracy of swat s et simulation compared to m1 basic and m2 biophysics this configuration also resulted in improved streamflow simulations during model verification indicating a transition of the model state towards increased predictability and reduced equifinality despite the seemingly improved water and energy balance streamflow calibration performance in m3 lumped et was distinctively lower than m1 basic and m2 biophysics configurations we argued that this sub optimality problem is not specific to a model remotely sensed dataset or optimization algorithm instead it is an implementation problem due to the aggregation of too many objectives which imparts an averaging effect on the optimized solution this may end up producing no net improvement of the model in large spatial scales 4 our results confirmed the superiority of m4 spatial et i e the model configuration with a spatially distributed approach such that each sub basin was calibrated individually over m3 lumped et for overall model accuracy although both configurations used the same total volume of remotely sensed data further a one to one comparison between the two extreme configurations i e m4 spatial et versus m1 basic indicated that an m4 type setup may exhibit reduced uncertainty in the simulation of landscape s water yield with distinctly different temporal and spatial variability of streamflow and more accurate representations of vegetation growth with respect to modis lai data we therefore conclude that modifying certain process descriptions of a hydrologic model e g hydrologic transport between surface depressions fill spill mechanism m1 basic may not sufficiently improve overall partitioning of water and energy in a watershed unless the model is calibrated with remotely sensed et data and that including biophysical parameters m4 spatial et the substantial disparity between the two extreme configurations i e m4 spatial et versus m1 basic bears immense practical implications the choice of model configurations can impact how scientists and managers quantify and interpret the hydrological and biogeochemical influence of surface depressions under different climate land use and potential depression loss restoration scenarios using m1 basic for modeling landscape hydrological and nutrient hotspots hot moments may lead to inefficient watershed management decisions therefore we suggest that the spatially distributed calibration approach using remotely sensed et data and including important biophysical parameters m4 spatial et will lead to a more accurately calibrated model that does improve the representation of a watershed s water and energy balance while our methodological insights

6912,a hydrologic model calibrated using only streamflow data can produce acceptable streamflow simulation at the watershed outlet yet unrealistic representations of water balance across the landscape recent studies have demonstrated the potential of multi objective calibration using remotely sensed evapotranspiration et and gaged streamflow data to spatially improve the water balance however methodological clarity on how to best integrate et data and model parameters in multi objective model calibration to improve simulations is lacking to address these limitations we assessed how a spatially explicit distributed calibration approach that uses 1 remotely sensed et data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and 2 frequently overlooked biophysical parameters can improve the overall predictability of two key components of the water balance streamflow and et at different locations throughout the watershed we used the soil and water assessment tool swat previously modified to represent hydrologic transport and filling spilling of landscape depressions in a large watershed of the prairie pothole region united states we employed a novel stepwise series of calibration experiments to isolate the effects on streamflow and simulated et of integrating biophysical parameters and spatially explicit remotely sensed et data into model calibration results suggest that the inclusion of biophysical parameters involving vegetation dynamics and energy utilization mechanisms tend to increase model accuracy furthermore we found that using a lumped versus a spatially explicit approach for integrating et into model calibration produces a sub optimal model state with no potential improvement in model performance across large spatial scales however when we utilized the same modis et datasets but calibrated each sub basin in the spatially explicit approach water yield prediction uncertainty decreased including a distinct improvement in the temporal and spatial accuracy of simulated et and streamflow this further resulted in a more realistic simulation of vegetation growth when compared to modis leaf area index data these findings afford critical insights into the efficient integration of remotely sensed big data into hydrologic modeling and associated watershed management decisions our approach can be generalized and potentially replicated using other hydrologic models and remotely sensed data resources and in different geophysical settings of the globe keywords modis multi objective calibration prairie pothole region swat uncertainty 1 introduction calibration of a hydrologic model involves constraining the solution space i e the range of parameter combinations to identify the most optimal parameter set that ostensibly represents watershed physics the traditional approach of calibration with gaged streamflow data may produce a pseudo accurate model showing acceptable skill for streamflow simulation at target locations while incorrectly representing internal watershed processes maneta et al 2017 rajib et al 2016a 2018a such a model giving right answers for wrong reasons a characteristic of equifinality beven 2012 beven and freer 2001 favis mortlock 2004 might lead to incorrect interpretation of a hypothesis or an unsuitable selection of land management alternatives for future scenarios the potential availability of remotely sensed streamflow estimates at ungaged locations is alluring nasa 2016 but the information contained in streamflow time series may not sufficiently capture how vertical fluxes evolve at different spatial and temporal scales within the watershed birkel et al 2014 li et al 2018 against this backdrop using spatially distributed remotely sensed estimates of water balance components e g soil moisture and evapotranspiration affords multi scale multi objective calibration of hydrologic models bai et al 2018 fatichi et al 2016 li et al 2016 which may help to remedy this equifinality or

2008 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 rientjes et al 2013 vervoort et al 2014 winsemius et al 2008 currently two primary issues exist related to the use of remotely sensed et in model calibration first reproducible methods for handling spatially distributed and widely available big data such as remotely sensed et are not prominent in the literature for example inefficient methods for using remotely sensed et data as part of a multi objective calibration of hydrologic models across a large number of sub basins or any other spatial unit e g grid cells may have resulted in the current perception that this approach improves et but may have mixed or limited influence on streamflow simulations e g lópez lópez et al 2017 tobin and bennett 2017 second most studies that have used remotely sensed et data for model calibration focus only on calibrating surface sub surface and river routing parameters e g immerzeel and droogers 2008 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 rientjes et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2017 this practice does not leverage the potential for biophysical parameters within a hydrologic model to improve the overall representation of its physical processes yang and zhang 2016 zhu and zhuang 2015 it is yet to be explored whether biophysical parameters such as those associated with vegetation dynamics land atmosphere interaction and energy utilization affect model calibration performance with or without the use of remotely sensed et data in calibration process our study fills these knowledge gaps using a modified version of the process based semi distributed hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 neitsch et al 2011 through a series of calibration configurations we investigate i the degree to which adding biophysical parameters not traditionally considered in a streamflow only calibration effects hydrologic simulation ii the difference in simulated hydrologic responses due to the inclusion of remotely sensed et in a multi objective calibration with gaged streamflow data and iii the additional change in hydrologic responses if remotely sensed et is utilized in a spatially distributed calibration approach while this study methodologically benchmarks remote sensing enabled swat calibration in a north american watershed insights provided here should be applicable for other hydrologic models and geophysical settings as well 2 study area we conducted this study on the 1670 km2 pipestem creek watershed in north dakota united states fig 1 located in the prairie pothole region in the northern great plains pipestem creek watershed landform consists of two ecoregions the high elevation missouri coteau in the west and the drift plains in the eastern part of the watershed epa 2011 the coteau landscape in particular is pockmarked with thousands of wetland depressions created by glacial retreat during the wisconsinan period phillips et al 2005 winter and rosenberry 1995 these wetlands have been variously termed prairie potholes including non floodplain wetlands nfws lane et al 2018 amongst others tiner 2003 leibowitz 2015 mushet et al 2015 here we will use the term surface depressions the surface depressions in the prairie pothole region may be permanently inundated ephemeral or completely dry year to year labaugh et al 1998 winter and rosenberry 1998 primary water input in these surface depressions is the spring snowmelt and direct precipitation as such water levels progressively drop through the summer months kantrud et al 1989 this oscillatory dry wet cycle makes et a dominant driver of water which responds to and also affects the fluctuations and successions of vegetation euliss et al 2004 gleason et al 2008 van der valk 1981 2005 van der valk and mushet 2016 van der kamp et al 2016 with all these features pipestem creek watershed is an ideal watershed for hydrologic modeling experiments 3 methodology we constructed four calibration configurations of a modified swat model evenson et al 2016 with increasing number of parameters and a progressively discretized way of optimizing them using remotely sensed et data the four configurations include i m1 basic calibration using only streamflow data evenson et al 2016 ii m2 biophysics another application of m1 incorporating biophysical parameters iii m3 lumped et multi objective calibration of m2 using both remotely sensed et and streamflow data parameters were optimized in a lumped approach commonly followed in many previous studies iv m4 spatial et the same as m3 except the parameters were optimized in a spatially distributed approach based on the outcome of these calibration experiments we quantified the effects of biophysical parameters and remotely sensed et data on simulated water balance components specifically et and streamflow to further reveal the nature of change in prediction uncertainty temporal and spatial variability of streamflow and vegetation growth we have conducted additional assessments using two configurations in the following we first outline the model and the data used then provide a detailed description of the model configurations 3 1 a modified swat model the major modeling components in swat include hydrology vegetation dynamics landscape and in stream nutrient loading stream temperature and land management gassman et al 2007 swat divides a watershed into multiple sub basins which are then further discretized into hydrologic response units hrus consisting of homogeneous land use management topographical and soil characteristics neitsch et al 2011 the modified swat model used in this study was originally developed by evenson et al 2016 with improved spatial representation and hydrologic functions evenson et al 2016 conducted a series of novel modifications in the existing swat source code neitsch et al 2011 to i enable a spatially explicit representation of surface depressions and hydrologic transport between surface depressions and uplands ii improve seepage and sub surface inflow simulation and iii facilitate the simulation of fill spill hydrologic relationships there have been several applications of the swat model to specifically understand the hydrologic effects of surface depressions e g almendinger et al 2011 evenson et al 2015 2018 liu et al 2008 rahman et al 2016 wang et al 2008 swat has also been widely used for hydrological modeling in various geophysical settings worldwide including major river basins in the united states rajib and merwade 2017 europe abbaspour et al 2015 africa schuol et al 2008 and asia islam et al 2017 thus findings from this study may be pertinent to worldwide swat model applications and at spatial scales much larger than the pipestem creek watershed 3 2 geospatial inputs and weather forcing the 30 m national elevation dataset usgs ned 2015 30 m 2011 national land cover database nlcd homer et al 2015 and 1 250 000 state soil geographic database statsgo nrcs 2015 available within swat database were the primary geospatial inputs in the modified swat model to have a spatially explicit representation of surface depressions in the swat model evenson et al 2016 first identified surface depressions using the national wetland inventory nwi http www fws gov wetlands and national hydrography dataset nhd https nhd usgs gov following lane et al 2012 and then estimated their storage capacities using a digital terrain constructed from 10 m ned e g lane and d amico 2010 this approach provided unprecedented geospatial specificity to model a watershed as discretely as possible contrasting the 1217 hrus that a swat model would produce for the pipestem creek watershed based upon ned nlcd and statsgo data modified spatial representation by evenson et al 2016 had 62 721 hrus within the same number of sub basins n 29 we used the daymet daily total precipitation and average maximum minimum temperature as the primary weather inputs thornton et al 2014 gridded data available at 1 km spatial resolution while creating ancillary weather inputs i e solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity using the swat model s built in weather generator wgn neitsch et al 2011 as we maintained identical weather inputs in all the four calibration configurations possible propagation error resulted from daymet and wgn data may have equivalent effect on the simulation results 3 3 mechanism for simulating et and vegetation dynamics we let swat estimate potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman monteith p m method such that et simulations were compatible with modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer algorithm section 3 4 2 taking this pet as the maximum permissible limit swat simulates an evaporative demand etd that is spatially across hrus and temporally along daily time steps variable swat s p m equation to estimate plant demand the transpiration component of etd requires leaf area index lai lai representing the spatio temporal dynamics of vegetation growth is simulated via a biome specific semi empirical leaf development curve with several user defined biophysical parameters like radiation use efficiency and maximum canopy height soil demand or the evaporation component of etd follows an exponential relationship with above ground vegetation also simulated by leveraging similar parameters rajib et al 2018a eventually swat uses the existing moisture content in soil profile to scale etd into et rajib and merwade 2016 this built in architecture to simulate lai and et was retained in our modified swat model 3 4 reference data for model calibration and verification 3 4 1 streamflow for calibration and verification of the modified swat model we used streamflow data from the only available us geological survey usgs gaging station at the watershed outlet fig 1 but varied how this data was included in the multi objective calibration depending on the model configuration see section 3 5 this gage had 41 estimated values over a 5 year period 753 of 1826 data points between 2009 and 2013 especially prevalent during the winter months when icy conditions prevent gage reading to avoid uncertainties implicit in statistical estimation of streamflow time series chokmani et al 2008 hamilton 2004 we only used the observed data in model calibration following evenson et al 2018 and 2016 however given the large inter annual hydrologic variability in the watershed and the prairie pothole region as a whole van der valk 2005 van der valk and mushet 2016 van der kamp et al 2016 it was deemed necessary to perform a long term verification of the calibrated model leveraging the best available data to facilitate this we included both estimated and observed streamflow data for model verification purposes 3 4 2 remotely sensed evapotranspiration and vegetation the 8 day total 1 km gridded et data from modis mod16a2 collection 5 mu et al 2013 was geo referenced and spatially aggregated into each of the 29 sub basins of the pipestem creek watershed using a semi automatic web based tool rajib et al 2018b while dynamically accounting for the heterogeneity in size shape and locations of the sub basins the tool puts area weighted average value of 8 day total et mm h20 from encompassing and or intersecting modis grid cells onto each of the sub basins despite potential inaccuracies due to spatial aggregation zhang et al 2016 this area weighted averaging is a reasonable scheme to create spatially explicit time series of remotely sensed data for hydrologic modeling purposes ershadi et al 2013 rajib et al 2018a to enable swat calibration at a daily time scale we temporally disaggregated the sub basin level 8 day total modis et data using the corresponding daily estimates from the north american land data assimilation system nldas phase 2 nasa 2017 eq 1 1 et i m et t m et i n et t n here m and n represent modis and nldas respectively t refers to the total 8 day value the index i denotes a particular day within that 8 day segment t we applied the same data processor tool to create sub basin level nldas time series from its original 12 km gridded estimates both modis and nldas estimates are based on the penman monteith p m method however assumptions on aerodynamic surface resistances as well as the sources of land use and meteorological input data in their respective algorithms are different differences between the absolute values of modis and nldas et did not affect et i m as we used nldas estimate in eq 1 only as a temporal scaling factor without altering the total amount of et estimated by modis in each 8 day window et t m therefore we labeled the modis nldas hybrid estimate et i m simply as modis et logic suggests that simulated et will follow the spatio temporal trend of reference et that constrains a hydrologic model during the calibration process modis data in our study therefore to build multiple lines of evidence on the overall improvement of the model in representing watershed characteristics and particularly the energy balance we used lai as an independent reference variable not included in the calibration process our lai based evaluation is novel because it is the first to use vegetation dynamics for cross verification when remotely sensed et is applied in model calibration previous studies on model calibration using remotely sensed et measured performance improvements based solely on simulated et outputs e g herman et al 2018 immerzeel and droogers 2008 rientjes et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2017 no other variables were considered to compare lai simulations across model configurations we obtained watershed average lai data from a 4 day total modis product mcd15a3h version 6 myneni et al 2015 creation of watershed average lai time series from the original 500 m gridded data again required employing the semi automatic data processor tool however no temporal re scaling was necessary in this case as we computed 4 day total values from swat s daily outputs to match temporal resolution of the original modis data with the advances in satellite sensor technologies and data assimilation techniques various multi source robust et products have emerged in recent years some of these relatively new et estimates are available at a daily time step not requiring any temporal re scaling disaggregation e g zhang et al 2016 2010 yet we preferred using modis et and lai data because these are open source global datasets with long term and continuous availability reasonably good spatio temporal resolution and more importantly well documented quality assessments e g mu et al 2011 2013 ruhoff et al 2013 yan et al 2016 yang et al 2006 velpuri et al 2013 because uncertainties are common in any remotely sensed product none of these datasets should be considered as actual observations 3 5 calibration configurations fig 2 schematically outlines the modeling architecture involved in the four calibration configurations namely m1 basic m2 biophysics m3 lumped et and m4 spatial et all explained below in individual subsections all calibrations were conducted at daily time step using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi version 2 in the swat cup platform abbaspour 2015 abbaspour et al 2007 to be consistent with evenson et al 2018 and 2016 each configuration went through a 3 year initialization 2006 2008 followed by a 3 year calibration 2009 2011 the iterations were divided into two successive batches sufi 2 uses latin hypercube sampling lhs to set potential parameter combinations based on the specified initial range for every calibration parameter using an inverse optimization approach sufi 2 then finds a narrower range of parameter values at the end of the preliminary batch to initiate the next batch for further iterations we selected kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 as the objective function which was maximized for streamflow and et depending on the model configuration to find the most optimal parameter set kge decomposes nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and mean squared error mse into a three dimensional criteria space and finds out a pareto front in terms of the shortest euclidean distance ed 2 kge 1 e d 1 r 1 2 μ s μ 0 1 2 σ s σ 0 1 2 where r represents the correlation μ s μ 0 and σ s σ 0 respectively represent bias and variability ratio between the simulated and observed variable μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the variable the indices s and o denote simulation and observed data respectively kge ranges from to 1 with a value closer to 1 indicates a relatively accurate model as noted above our goal was to keep the total length of the simulation consistent with previously published research on pipestem creek watershed using the same modified model e g evenson et al 2018 2016 however the need for long term verification of model outputs and the limited availability of observed streamflow data see section 3 4 1 made it challenging to follow the conventional split sample approach where model calibration and verification is conducted over two non overlapping independent time periods we therefore evaluated verified our calibrated model configurations over a 5 year period 2009 2013 despite this partial overlap with the calibration period 2009 2011 our approach resulted in an acceptable degree of independence among the calibration and verification datasets for three reasons 1 we excluded estimated streamflow data from the model calibration but included them in the verification stage 2 our model verification with streamflow and et data included two more years 2012 2013 beyond the calibration period and 3 we used lai data as a measure of cross verification to facilitate further independent evaluation and assess how a multi objective use of et and streamflow in swat calibration might change the model s response during extreme flood events we also excluded a specific portion of observed streamflow record august 2011 from the calibration period and used it for model verification 3 5 1 baseline model m1 m1 basic involved calibration only with streamflow data at the watershed outlet and included 21 parameters related to surface sub surface runoff channel routing and snow accumulation processes in the calibration fig 3 and table a1 in appendix a all of these parameters their respective initial range and the m1 configuration as a whole were identical with the calibration performed by evenson et al 2016 differing in this study only in the management of snow parameters we excluded snow parameters after the first batch of iterations to be able to compare with m4 outputs see below in section 3 5 4 m1 was our baseline to measure the degree of model improvement in subsequent configurations 3 5 2 effect of biophysical parameters m2 m2 biophysics was the same as m1 basic except with the addition of 10 parameters related to biophysical processes see fig 3 there are more than 20 such parameters in swat geodatabase neitsch et al 2011 however they are often underutilized and assigned default values the parameters we selected collectively represent a range of processes including vegetation growth land atmosphere feedback and energy use mechanisms having more parameters would push the computational overhead of our hyper resolution model 63 000 hrus beyond a workable limit initial ranges for the 10 additional parameters were set following the suggestions from swat developers abbaspour 2015 most of the contemporary swat applications including those on watersheds with abundant surface depressions e g evenson et al 2016 rahman et al 2016 ikenberry et al 2017 do not consider biophysical parameters in model calibration the underlying notion is that biophysical parameters are least sensitive for hydrologic simulation compared to those representing runoff routing and snow accumulation processes however due to the heavily conceptualized equations that swat employs to capture biophysical interactions it is possible that including the relevant parameters within a simple streamflow only calibration can make notable difference in the overall spatial hydrologic response of the model we performed the built in global sensitivity analysis scheme in sufi 2 abbaspour 2015 rajib and merwade 2016 to substantiate this notion optimizing 31 parameters through the first batch of iterations the second batch in m2 biophysics excluded the snow parameters which made it comparable with m1 basic see fig 2 thus differences in outputs between these two configurations identified the effect of biophysical parameters on model predictability 3 5 3 use of remotely sensed et data in model calibration m3 the most optimal model resulting from the first batch of iterations in m2 biophysics became the starting point for m3 lumped et fig 2 the difference between these two configurations was solely that m3 lumped et included modis et as an additional model constraint in the second and final batch of iterations the optimization algorithm sufi 2 used 30 constraints together 29 time series of modis et one for each sub basin and a single time series of streamflow data watershed outlet the 30 objective functions essentially 30 kges as shown in eq 3 were given equal weighting factor to form an aggregated value kge 3 k g e i 1 n f w f i k g e f i j 1 n e w e j k g e e j here n and w are the number of objective variables reference datasets and the weight assigned to each of them respectively the values f and e stand for streamflow and et respectively also i denotes the streamflow gaging stations and j denotes sub basins with modis et data the parameter set producing the highest kge was the most optimal one unlike the runoff routing parameters in swat the majority of its biophysical parameters cannot be defined at hru or sub basin level instead these parameters are associated with specific plant biome type and it is possible that the same biome type may exist in multiple hrus or sub basins because of this inconsistency the m3 configuration restricts every parameter so that it can only be changed in a unique way irrespective of the hru sub basin more specifically in successive iterations during the calibration a particular parameter must have an identical amount rate of change across the entire watershed and that amount rate is pre selected from a latin hypercube sampling of its initial range of values this is essentially a lumped approach notwithstanding the inclusion of spatially distributed modis et data in the calibration process hereafter referred as m3 lumped et previous studies indiscriminately applied this lumped approach even though biophysical parameters were not included in their respective calibrations consequently it became common to lump all the available et time series into a single calibration target eq 3 e g immerzeel and droogers 2008 rientjes et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2017 regardless of these limitations m3 lumped et configuration provided new insights as noted considering that the use of modis et in m3 lumped et was the only difference from m2 biophysics comparison of these two configurations can distinguish the effect of remotely sensed data from that of biophysical parameters which had not been addressed in any previous study 3 5 4 value of spatially distributed calibration using remotely sensed et m4 m3 lumped et and m4 spatial et were identical except a spatially distributed calibration approach was implemented in the m4 configuration the goal of m4 spatial et was to leverage the maximum potential of spatially distributed modis et data and allow highly discretized parameter optimization by calibrating 29 sub basins individually each sub basin had two constraints to find optimal parameters a representative time series of modis et specific to the sub basin and a time series of streamflow data at the watershed outlet lack of spatial heterogeneity in snow accumulation processes is a limitation in the current swat modeling framework all the snow parameters in swat can only be defined at watershed level neitsch et al 2011 that is why iteration of snow parameters was technically impossible in a sub basin level calibration approach such as m4 spatial et in order to have an even comparison with m4 spatial et snow parameters were not adjusted after the first batch of iterations in any of the four configurations this problem is very specific to swat continued optimization of snow parameters throughout the calibration process and that in an m4 spatial et type setup might be doable in the case of other hydrologic models 4 results 4 1 model predictability across the spectrum of calibration configurations both biophysical parameters and remotely sensed et data influenced model predictability this is evidenced by the relative change of model performance among the four configurations in terms of kge for simulated daily et at sub basin level and streamflow at the watershed outlet fig 4 a c considering the improved spatial representation seepage sub surface inflow and fill spill hydrologic simulation of surface depressions evenson et al 2016 the baseline configuration m1 should exhibit minimal inaccuracy in reproducing hydrologic processes as expected the high kge score 0 90 in m1 basic for the most optimal streamflow simulation during the calibration period fit the traditional swat evaluation rubric of a very good hydrologic model moriasi et al 2015 but pseudo accuracy was evident based on the low watershed average kge 0 60 for et demonstrating potential limitations of simulated vertical water fluxes in the m1 basic configuration this may in part be an underlying reason that the streamflow simulation in m1 basic did not perform well in the verification phase see fig 4c the pseudo accuracy was intriguing as it indicated the need for supplementing spatially explicit hydrologic transport between surface depressions and fill spill mechanisms in a hydrologic model with measures that potentially account for other process uncertainties in the model one way to address this issue was to focus on biophysical parameters inclusion of biophysical parameters in model calibration is appropriate because of the coupled relationships the vegetation and energy related processes have with the partitioning of water at different scales of a watershed the same model m1 basic showed a different and slightly improved see fig 4c model performance simply when additional biophysical parameters were included in a streamflow only calibration m2 biophysics compared to the variable spatial nature of et simulation in the m1 basic configuration with sub basins having very high 0 75 to very low 0 40 kges m2 biophysics suggested an improved spatial accuracy via more consistent kges 0 50 0 70 across the watershed fig 4b this seemingly improved model state in m2 biophysics resonated in the streamflow verification showing relatively higher kge than m1 basic fig 4c while these results confirmed the sensitivity of biophysical parameters to mediate hydrologic processes in a watershed with abundant surface depressions and fill spill phenomena fig 3 one can expect that these parameters would affect hydrologic simulations in other geophysical settings too including agricultural and forested landscapes e g quinton et al 2010 yang and zhang 2016 however it is expected that the calibration of biophysical parameters is more effective in the presence of constraint datasets relevant to their physical processes e g et and vegetation growth in the next configuration with modis et as an additional calibration target m3 lumped et we found considerable improvement in swat s et simulation fig 4a and b hypothetically improved et implies improved physical representation of the model s water balance components as such other hydrologic processes including streamflow should reflect traces of improvement too this was evident in m3 lumped et through a distinctively increased streamflow kge during the model verification although streamflow kge decreased in the calibration period compared to m1 basic and m2 biophysics fig 4c the goal of the m4 spatial et configuration was to evaluate whether using the same calibration targets of m3 lumped et in a spatially distributed approach can further improve model performance results from m4 spatial et were the most telling in terms of kge scores for both et and streamflow simulations the watershed average kge for et was 0 70 in m4 spatial et particularly contrasting to 0 60 in m1 basic and the highest among the four configurations as we moved through our calibration experiments from one level to the next m1 to m4 we identified increasing gain in the overall spatial accuracy of et simulations fig 4a and b we interpreted this drift in spatial accuracy pulling of models efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 by looking onto the spread and skewness of sub basin level kge distributions for instance the best spatial accuracy in m4 spatial et fig 4a was reflected through the smallest spread range of kges and the maximum skewness toward high kges fig 4b this evolution of model performance quantitatively showed how the state of a model can transitionally improve in predictability and shrink in equifinality with a spatially explicit et calibration in line with its spatial accuracy in et simulation m4 spatial et showed remarkably improved streamflow simulation skill during the model verification kge 0 75 fig 4c while these results collectively made m4 spatial et the superior configuration another key aspect made marked difference in the efficacy of m4 s spatially distributed calibration approach unlike m3 lumped et m4 spatial et did not show a drastic drop in streamflow calibration performance it rather retained nearly the same calibration performance as m1 basic and m2 biophysics despite a multi objective optimization with the same total volume of et data used to calibrate m3 lumped et in this way m4 spatial et fully complied with the theoretical cause and effect expectancy that an improved representation of water and energy balance should result in improved streamflow simulation as well 4 2 additional insights on hydrologic representation to further explore the overall improvements achievable through the m4 spatial et configuration below we present a holistic evaluation of its outputs focusing on three different perspectives i uncertainty in predicted water balance ii temporal and spatial variability of streamflow and iii vegetation growth here m4 spatial et is contrasted only against m1 basic given these are the two extreme configurations in terms of model accuracy 4 2 1 uncertainty in predicted water balance m4 spatial et showed substantially reduced uncertainty in simulated water yields compared to m1 fig 5 we chose water yield as a holistic index of water balance because it is the amount of water contributed to stream after the model accounts for fill spill hydrology and all hydrological losses e g to evapotranspiration and soil infiltration neitsch et al 2011 the relative uncertainty mapped in fig 5a reflects the average 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band width in calibrated water yield outputs at the sub basin level normalized with respect to the minimum and maximum band widths across all the sub basins irrespective of a particular configuration here our simulations showed consistently smaller prediction uncertainty in m4 spatial et irrespective of the location and timing of high flow events within the watershed fig 5b 4 2 2 temporal and spatial variability of streamflow we compared the temporal variability of streamflow between m1 basic and m4 spatial et in terms of their flow exceedance probability at the watershed outlet fig 6 irrespective of the flow regime high flow medium flow and low flow the most optimal streamflow output from m4 spatial et generally showed better conformity with usgs data compared to m1 basic taking into account fill spill processes during extreme events improved high flow simulations in m4 spatial et indicate enhanced functioning of the modified spatial representation and hydrologic transport proposed by evenson et al 2016 fig 6 however given the high inter annual variability of ponded area in the prairie pothole region van der valk and mushet 2016 it is not surprising that hydrologic models would struggle in reproducing average condition water balance in the watershed accordingly m1 basic and m4 spatial et both resulted in large departures from usgs data during medium flow conditions however the difference usgs minus swat was consistently smaller in the case of m4 spatial et furthermore simulated streamflow in m4 spatial et was in closer proximity with usgs data 90 of the time during the 2009 2013 period indicated by the low flow conditions in fig 6 this was expected given the influence of et on the diffusivity of soil moisture and mobility of groundwater when there is no surface runoff tobin and bennett 2017 szilagyi et al 2007 these results also afford temporal insight to the variation of streamflow kge values shown in fig 4c in addition to temporal dynamics we found prominent differences between m1 basic and m4 spatial et in the spatial variability of streamflow even when both configurations produced peak flows at the same time stamp as the usgs data fig 7 apart from this identical temporal response particularly in the two specific flood dates shown here we also noted the peak magnitudes which were distinctively more accurate in the case of m4 spatial et the combined impression from this duo i e timing and magnitude suggest that the spatial variability captured in m1 basic may have unrealistic representation of landscape response 4 2 3 model accuracy in simulating vegetation growth the traditional way of gaging the level of physical realism in a hydrologic model is to assess improvements in water balance components therefore models are often not assessed for accuracy in energy balance components although the energy balance can considerably influence water balance hurkmans et al 2008 rajib et al 2018a troch et al 2009 we considered watershed average vegetation growth lai as an indicator that implicitly represents the collective effects of improved water and energy balances in the model long et al 2014 m1 basic produced unrealistically high lai values compared to m4 spatial et and modis data fig 8 the lack of biophysical parameters in the m1 basic calibration and therefore the use of default values that for the most part stayed spatially constant across the watershed undermined the ability of the model to simulate vegetation dynamics the inaccurate lai in m1 basic indicated another persistent limitation of the model suggesting that a modified water retention discharge fill spill mechanism evenson et al 2016 may only have limited influence on other hydrologic processes in a watershed although swat s default lai development formulation was not modified in any of our model configurations based on swat s internal structure see section 3 3 the parameter values defining the shape and inflection points of the lai curve could be varied spatially in the m4 spatial et calibration and that using spatially explicit et data therefore the m4 lai values compare better with the modis lai this improved representation of vegetation dynamics in m4 spatial et compared to m1 basic was a reasonable indicator that the model was efficiently reproducing both water and energy partitioning which may affect future biogeochemical applications of the model including carbon storage and nutrient cycling 5 discussion 5 1 managing potential limitations involving remotely sensed data for calibration using remotely sensed data to calibrate a hydrologic model will inevitably produce different outputs compared to the same model that uses gaged streamflow data as the calibration objective it is questionable however whether the differences in the remote sensing integrated model emerge for right reasons to enable physically meaningful application of remotely sensed et in model calibration and therefore get the right changes in model predictability for the right reasons we took measures to overcome the following challenges 5 1 1 is multi objective calibration with et and streamflow more effective compared to using et alone simultaneous use of streamflow and et in hydrologic model calibration is recommended as a best practice e g kunnath poovakka et al 2016 rientjes et al 2013 vervoort et al 2014 studies using remotely sensed soil moisture preferred the same li et al 2018 rajib et al 2016a wanders et al 2014 a model calibrated against only et or soil moisture would produce too little or too much of a particular vertical water flux to the atmosphere or through soil horizons unless the horizontal water routing in the model are also simultaneously adjusted the outcome would be a highly equifinal model having good accuracy for a specific vertical flux but adverse or no change in streamflow simulation accuracy e g lópez lópez et al 2017 tobin and bennett 2017 wanders et al 2014 for similar reasons decoupling the horizontal water routing component is a potential reason why some current generation hybrid land surface river routing models exhibit acknowledged timing problems in vertical fluxes as well as in streamflow simulations e g lin et al 2018 therefore it is rational to accept that watershed hydrologic responses can be best captured when both the vertical and the horizontal flux components in the model are constrained with relevant calibration targets such as et and streamflow the amount of uncertainty in remotely sensed et is purportedly higher than that in gaged streamflow data vervoort et al 2014 in our initial exploration not shown we found that modis et if used from the very beginning of the calibration process inserts propagating error so that the accuracy of simulated streamflow with respect to gage station data cannot be improved beyond a certain level we also found that this model state is irreversible and may not be reinstated without changing the sequence of introducing modis et data into the calibration process therefore we hypothesized that calibrating the model first with gaged streamflow a relatively well verified in situ dataset produces a reasonable water balance that could serve as a baseline for further adjustment of hydrologic fluxes through a multi objective approach involving both streamflow and et this two step calibration is also favorable for applying other remotely sensed datasets including soil moisture for which systematic bias is a deterring factor draper et al 2009 reichle and koster 2004 simulated soil moisture output from a model that is pre calibrated against streamflow data can be used to reduce systematic bias in the remotely sensed soil moisture before it is integrated with the model through a data assimilation and or a re calibration process e g lópez lópez et al 2017 rajib et al 2016a wanders et al 2014 5 1 2 is it justified to calibrate et related parameters separately related to the two step calibration explained above it may not be physically coherent to calibrate biophysical or et related parameters separately herman et al 2018 applied remotely sensed et data to adjust only four additional parameters in a swat model excluding all the other surface subsurface and routing parameters that were initially calibrated using streamflow data in a preceding step as we performed global sensitivity analysis several parameters with apparent high sensitivity in m1 basic e g main channel manning s n were ultimately found to be less sensitive in the presence of biophysical parameters see fig 3 this provides supportive evidence that parameters in process based hydrologic models e g swat or coupled atmospheric land surface models e g wrf hydro gochis et al 2015 represent an integrated natural system as such they have an unknown degree of mutual relationships that may not be explicitly evident from their mathematical equations sivakumar and singh 2012 therefore not using a common set of parameters throughout the calibration process convolutes the effect of a new objective function remotely sensed data with that of the additional parameters initially not considered in preceding iterations such a calibration protocol may not be ideal because it cannot identify whether the improvement in model simulation is solely due to the use of remotely sensed data 5 2 benchmarking a calibration strategy using spatially distributed remotely sensed data the substantial disparity of simulation accuracy in m4 spatial et compared to m1 basic m2 biophysics or m3 lumped et rationalizes the spatially distributed use of remotely sensed et data in hydrologic model calibration while this corroborates suggestions made in previous literature e g immerzeel and droogers 2008 rientjes et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2017 assessments in these studies were mostly based on an m3 lumped et type configuration our study is the first to identify that m3 lumped et produces an ostensibly good but actually sub optimal model state it is therefore worthwhile to review what factors undermine m3 lumped et so that one can benchmark m4 spatial et as a better approach for model calibrations especially on large spatial scales the sub optimality of m3 lumped et was apparent mainly through the distinctive decrease in its streamflow calibration performance notwithstanding the improvement it offers in et simulation section 4 1 importantly herman et al 2018 showed similar tendency with a number of optimization algorithms including nondominated sorted genetic algorithm ii and monte carlo simulations it could also be a problem specific to the source of our data modis et mu et al 2011 2013 considering the uncertainty commonly seen in all remotely sensed estimates however previous studies reported similar results calibrating respective hydrologic models with et data from the surface energy balance system sebs rientjes et al 2013 atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model herman et al 2018 and global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam lópez lópez et al 2017 tobin and bennett 2017 this was evident when models were calibrated with soil moisture data as well li et al 2018 rajib et al 2016a wanders et al 2014 given the above the sub optimality problem does not seem fundamental to the data model or optimization algorithm we suggest that the sub optimality in m3 lumped et was in part an implementation problem in this configuration s set up that requires the optimization algorithm to handle too many objectives simultaneously in the context of this study the sufi 2 parameter identification program resulted in an averaging effect while searching for a parameter combination that was optimal for all the 30 objectives or constraints section 3 5 3 eq 3 what had not been addressed in the existing literature is the inefficient use of emerging earth data resources and or inappropriate handling of model parameters e g herman et al 2018 lópez lópez et al 2017 tobin and bennett 2017 see section 5 1 which are also viable factors affecting model performance in general the potential explanations for the limited performance or sub optimality in m3 lumped et have contributed to an evolving misperception that calibration with remotely sensed et or soil moisture data may not improve streamflow simulations as a result there is a growing number of remote sensing studies that discourage the use of lowered streamflow calibration performance as a generic goodness metric to label a model s overall streamflow prediction skills kunnath poovakka et al 2016 rajib et al 2016a rientjes et al 2013 wanders et al 2014 li et al 2018 in a multi objective calibration using soil moisture and streamflow reported substantially increased streamflow accuracy when their most optimal model was verified at locations that were not included in the calibration process despite an apparently poor performance in target calibration locations this was analogous to our m3 lumped et results which had a higher kge value than m1 basic and m2 biophysics in the streamflow verification process fig 4c indicating model improvement in the right direction nonetheless continued applications of m3 lumped et given what our results suggest could produce acute problems in large scale hydrologic modeling e g emerton et al 2016 lin et al 2018 with more objectives to target and sub basins to calibrate i e a very large number of streamflow and et time series m3 lumped et might result in diminishing returns with no net improvement in water balance the m4 spatial et configuration moves beyond the averaging effect issue even though it uses the same total volume of modis datasets as m3 lumped et we therefore considered m4 spatial et an improved approach compared to m3 lumped et however it is computationally expensive to operate an m4 spatial et type setup and harness the maximum capacity of spatially distributed data by calibrating each of the sub basins individually at this point we could argue that one can still adopt m3 lumped et and make a tradeoff by accepting a calibrated model that is generally representative of internal watershed processes but relatively poor in streamflow simulation yet this argument lacks scientific integrity because it gives an impression that models with persistent problems are acceptable the tradeoff argument also weakens the value of remote sensing integrated hydrologic modeling amidst the new trend of large scale streamflow flood forecasting initiatives world wide e g li et al 2016 lin et al 2018 with the recent advancements in open access cyber enabled high performance calibration platforms such as swatshare rajib et al 2016b and their potential interoperability with observational data resources horsburgh et al 2016 morsy et al 2017 tarboton et al 2014 developing a computationally efficient reproducible workflow for the m4 spatial et type calibration configuration is no more impossible 6 summary and conclusion it is not surprising that a hydrologic model may misrepresent the true state of water and energy balances given the complexity involved in simulating watershed hydrology correctly one approach that has been increasingly used to improve simulation accuracy particularly in watersheds with abundant surface depressions is the modification of existing model frameworks to improve spatially explicit hydrologic transport between and among surface depressions and other water bodies as well as retention discharge fill spill mechanisms in this study we hypothesized that the accuracy of such a modified model can be further improved by including biophysical parameters and remotely sensed et data in the model calibration process specifically we constructed four calibration configurations of a modified swat model namely m1 basic m2 biophysics m3 lumped et and m4 spatial et with increasing number of parameters and a progressively discretized way of optimizing them using modis et data based on the outcome of this experiment the following conclusions were drawn 1 despite modifying the hydrologic transport and water retention discharge fill spill mechanism calibration of a swat model involving the traditionally used runoff routing parameters and using only streamflow data m1 basic was less accurate in its simulated water balance components namely et and streamflow than the other configurations with improved calibration methods m2 m4 2 the same model showed slightly improved et and streamflow simulations when biophysical parameters were included in the calibration process m2 biophysics while this finding confirms the sensitivity of biophysical parameters we suggest that their calibration would be effective and meaningful if the model is constrained with datasets that are more relevant to vegetation dynamics land atmosphere interaction and energy utilization processes e g et and or lai 3 regardless of the lumped nature of calibration we found that the m3 lumped et i e the m2 biophysics model calibrated with sub basin modis et data and gaged streamflow aggregated as a single optimization objective noticeably increased the accuracy of swat s et simulation compared to m1 basic and m2 biophysics this configuration also resulted in improved streamflow simulations during model verification indicating a transition of the model state towards increased predictability and reduced equifinality despite the seemingly improved water and energy balance streamflow calibration performance in m3 lumped et was distinctively lower than m1 basic and m2 biophysics configurations we argued that this sub optimality problem is not specific to a model remotely sensed dataset or optimization algorithm instead it is an implementation problem due to the aggregation of too many objectives which imparts an averaging effect on the optimized solution this may end up producing no net improvement of the model in large spatial scales 4 our results confirmed the superiority of m4 spatial et i e the model configuration with a spatially distributed approach such that each sub basin was calibrated individually over m3 lumped et for overall model accuracy although both configurations used the same total volume of remotely sensed data further a one to one comparison between the two extreme configurations i e m4 spatial et versus m1 basic indicated that an m4 type setup may exhibit reduced uncertainty in the simulation of landscape s water yield with distinctly different temporal and spatial variability of streamflow and more accurate representations of vegetation growth with respect to modis lai data we therefore conclude that modifying certain process descriptions of a hydrologic model e g hydrologic transport between surface depressions fill spill mechanism m1 basic may not sufficiently improve overall partitioning of water and energy in a watershed unless the model is calibrated with remotely sensed et data and that including biophysical parameters m4 spatial et the substantial disparity between the two extreme configurations i e m4 spatial et versus m1 basic bears immense practical implications the choice of model configurations can impact how scientists and managers quantify and interpret the hydrological and biogeochemical influence of surface depressions under different climate land use and potential depression loss restoration scenarios using m1 basic for modeling landscape hydrological and nutrient hotspots hot moments may lead to inefficient watershed management decisions therefore we suggest that the spatially distributed calibration approach using remotely sensed et data and including important biophysical parameters m4 spatial et will lead to a more accurately calibrated model that does improve the representation of a watershed s water and energy balance while our methodological insights benchmarked efficient utilization of remotely sensed big data the findings further provided scientific evidence on the evolution of a hydrologic model in the continuum of equifinality acknowledgements

6913,the estimates of actual evapotranspiration e across basins and or regions are still facing some difficulties because of the complex interactions amongst the components of the land plant atmosphere system even though the basic physical mechanism of e is well understood presenting as a nonlinear relationship constrained by physical limits the budyko framework serves as a powerful tool used to estimate the averaged e at long term scale given the ability of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace in effectively simulating the terrestrial water storage change δtws at monthly scale a model to estimate e was developed based on the budyko framework with mean monthly parameter of multi years and was applied to the estimation of e for the 24 selected catchments in different climatic regions across china results indicate that for the majority of 24 catchments the positive or negative trends in precipitation p potential evapotranspiration e 0 runoff r and δtws were not statistically significant during 2003 2013 at both annual and monthly scales but the δtws occupied a large proportion in the partitioning of p into r and e at monthly scale the monthly budyko parameter showed large variation within the year and also across these 24 catchments the budyko modeled monthly e budyko e represented the grace derived ones grace e across these catchments well with both modeled e volumes and hydrograph shapes which were also consistent with grace e series except some underestimation for peak e overall the budyko e represented grace e in the arid and semi arid catchments comparatively better than it in the humid and semi humid catchments due to the larger proportion of δtws in the p partition among all the 24 selected catchments the monthly budyko type e model represented the grace e across shixiali catchment located in the hai river basin best with the correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe coefficient nsce and relative error re between grace e and simulated results being 0 996 0 988 0 033 in calibration and 0 994 0 951 0 111 in validation respectively furthermore using grace e as the benchmark values the budyko e outperformed four other global e products from the newly published global land data assimilation system with noah land surface model 2 gldas e modis modis e japanese 25 year reanalysis product jra e and zhang s method zhang e gldas e was the best of four global e products at reproducing monthly variations with relatively high r and nsce values small re while modis e showed the poorest performance in reproducing the inter annual e variations of these catchments which was reflected by low r and nsce values this extended budyko e model can apply in other similar climatic regions and also may provide skill in evaluating the water resources since the preferable accuracy of e estimate keywords budyko framework grace evapotranspiration model terrestrial water storage change water balance method climatic regions 1 introduction as one of the major components of the hydrological cycle actual evapotranspiration e plays an important role in both the catchment water balance and energy budget in the earth atmospheric system the estimates of actual e are critical for many disciplines such as hydrology meteorology agronomy and ecology priestley and taylor 1972 fisher et al 2011 however compared with the other two components precipitation p and streamflow q of the hydrologic cycle e is arguably the most challenging hydrological process because of the complex interactions amongst the components of the land plant atmosphere system xu and singh 2005 wang et al 2012 nevertheless various methods have been proposed for estimating actual e including the use of land surface hydrologic models constrained by observations e g wood et al 1992 jung et al 2010 fully coupled land atmosphere modeling in a reanalysis mode or remote sensing based approaches e g rodell 2004 mu et al 2007 2011 irmak et al 2012 yang et al 2015 ordinarily the hydrologic models and land atmosphere modeling could be limited by sparse observation sites and are difficult to upscale to regional scale vinukollu et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 while the remote sensing based techniques involve a quantification of uncertainties due to the mismatch between vegetation data with high resolution and meteorological forcing with low resolution rodell et al 2011 yang and shang 2013 long et al 2014a alternatively various evapotranspiration theories have also been widely used to e estimates at different time scales including penman s proportional hypothesis penman 1948 bouchet s complementarity hypothesis bouchet 1963 and budyko hydrothermal coupling equilibrium hypothesis budyko 1948 1974 among them budyko hypothesis describes the long term partition of p between e and runoff r as a function of the aridity index e 0 p where e 0 represents the potential evapotranspiration and has been revived in recent years arora 2002 gerrits et al 2009 wang and tang 2014 however the budyko model is only appropriate to the mean annual scale when the terrestrial water storage change δtws can be negligible in watersheds under natural condition moreover as the budyko framework is based on a steady hydro climatological condition to better overcome the limits of its concept various sub annual processes e g rooting depth and soil store dynamics yokoo et al 2008 szilagyi and jozsa 2009 donohue et al 2012 and water storage dynamics zhang et al 2008 wang 2012 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 have also been proposed in our previous study xing et al 2018a by using a data set of selected 96 catchments across china at mean annual scale a non parametric regression technique was employed to investigate the relationship of the budyko parameter with potential influencing factors including climatic seasonality e g seasonality index of precipitation catchment characteristics e g vegetation coverage and agricultural activities e g effective irrigated area ratio we found that average storm depth seasonality index of precipitation and vegetation coverage were three statistically significant factors affecting the budyko parameter recently water balance estimates at shorter term have become the main concerns in many studies the budyko type functions which is originally designed and valid for long term water balance when the change of soil water is negligible have been extended to study the relationship between the annual e p and annual e 0 p e g zhang et al 2008 tang et al 2017 furthermore the budyko framework has also been used in inter annual variability of p partition in many studies e g potter and zhang 2009 chen et al 2013 which found that soil water storage changes is an important component in inter annual variability of p partition at some catchments especially for catchments in arid regions the traditional water balance model in the form of e p r when δtws is negligible over a long period of time is the most reliable method for estimation of e at basin or regional scales and for the evaluation of e products and has also been widely used e g hobbins et al 2001 xue et al 2013 while in some cases the δtws is the determinant factor controlling the actual e process especially in warmer and drier regions and or in monthly scale xu and singh 2005 wang and alimohammadi 2012 however the estimation of monthly e is difficult for some regions where measurements are limited due to accessibility and or costs and the δtws is unknown the nasa s gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission was launched in 2002 and records monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa storage deviation from the long term mean grace recorded twsa has been recognized as its wide applications in groundwater resources monitoring famiglietti et al 2011 döll et al 2014 chao et al 2017 drought or flood monitoring long et al 2014b reager et al 2014 schumacher et al 2018 model development and calibration niu et al 2014 and the quantification of hydrologic responses to droughts and anthropogenic activities castle et al 2014 huang et al 2015 humphrey et al 2016 since the water storage is identified as a competing process of p partition into r and e the estimates of monthly e from water balance equation are obtained as residuals of δtws derived from grace as first appeared in rodell 2004 and later in other studies e g ramillien et al 2006 rodell et al 2011 xue et al 2013 syed et al 2014 billah et al 2015 previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of grace derived δtws for the estimation of actual e at basin scale recently fang et al 2016 improved budyko curve based estimates of long term water partitioning using hydrologic signatures from grace with the aid of the extended budyko model at annual scale tang et al 2017 reconstructed annual groundwater storage changes in a large scale irrigation region by using grace data and found that the integration of the developed budyko equation with the grace data provides a new way for evaluating long term groundwater depletion overall it can be concluded that there indeed exists a relationship between regional e and grace recorded twsa and budyko curve based e estimates can be improved by grace signatures note that the water and energy are balanced on a watershed at any time scale with the prerequisite of all the relevant components to be considered although the budyko hypothesis describes the long term partitioning of p whether the budyko framework can describe the partitioning of p into r e and δtws at the monthly scale is an interesting research point however to the best of our knowledge no study has investigated how grace derived δtws can be used to extend the long time budyko e model to a monthly e model in recent years several global e products from reanalysis or land surface models have been generated and widely used rodell 2004 dee and uppala 2009 some studies have evaluated various e products e g mueller et al 2011 evaluated and compared the satellite based e products land surface model lsm simulations atmospheric reanalysis e outputs e estimates based on empirical upscaling of eddy covariance flux e measurements and atmospheric water balance datasets at the global scale xue et al 2013 implemented a water balance method to evaluate four e products for two river basins in tibetan plateau li et al 2014 evaluated five existing global e products against monthly e estimated by the water balance method for four large basins on tibetan plateau andam akorful et al 2015 evaluated and combined different e estimates over volta basin west africa consequently most of the e products produced varying results when e rates are integrated over regions and over time and their usefulness are constrained by the accuracy and availability of river discharge data overall several studies have focused on the improvement of hydrological model based estimates of long term or annual water partitioning using grace derived δtws e g fang et al 2016 tang et al 2017 schumacher et al 2018 however whether the budyko framework can describe the partitioning of p into r e and δtws at the monthly scale has not been investigated in addition to what extent the e model based on the extended budyko framework and grace data can estimate e at basin or region scale should be evaluated by comparing with other e products to address these issues 24 catchments in different climatic regions of china were selected as a case study descripted in section 2 section 3 is presented to describe the methodology including the monthly budyko e model parameter estimation statistical analysis and model performance measures results are shown in section 4 the change characteristics of hydrological variables during 2003 2013 for these catchments were investigated in sections 4 1 and 4 2 then section 4 3 gives the variations in mean annul and monthly budyko parameters while the monthly e model based on the extended budyko framework and grace data was calibrated and validated in section 4 4 finally the watershed scale e estimated by the one parameter monthly budyko e model was compared with other global e products in section 4 5 discussion on the comparison of budyko e with the other actual e estimates budyko type parameters at different time scales and the model uncertainties are presented in sections 5 1 5 2 and 5 3 respectively and conclusions are drawn in section 6 an overview of the datasets procedures and models is given in the flowchart presented in fig 1 2 study area and data processing due to the shortage of observed streamflow data 24 catchments located in songhua river basin liao river basin hai river basin yellow river basin yangtze river basin pearl river basin hei river basin lancang river basin yalungzangbo river basin and southeastern basins across different climatic regions of china were finally selected as the study areas to investigate the performance of monthly budyko e model by combining grace data fig 2 shows the location of 24 selected catchments and their corresponding hydrologic control stations table 1 lists the detailed information of each study catchment these catchments were classified into four different climatic regions arid region p e 0 400 mm semi arid region 400 mm p e 0 0 mm semi humid region 0 mm p e 0 400 mm and humid region p e 0 400 mm according the standard of climate zone division furthermore for each climatic region the catchments were sorted from small to large by their drainage area the monthly observed streamflow data for the period of 2003 2013 were obtained from the ministry of water resources china daily precipitation wind speed relative humidity sunshine hours maximum and minimum temperature were collected from 255 meteorological stations on or around the selected catchments covering the same period of the streamflow data the procedure for calculating the each region average climatic variables can be seen in xing et al 2018a grace solutions swenson 2014 providing at monthly time intervals and 1 1 spatial resolution for the world were obtained from the three processing centers i e the center for space research csr at university of texas at austin geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz at german research center for geoscience and jet propulsion laboratory jpl at california institute of technology since they are relatively coarse in space and the bias or errors rain precipitation rainf evapotranspiration evap and storm surface runoff qs obtained from the outputs of gldas 2 noah land surface model lsm l4 model ek et al 2003 at a resolution of 0 25 0 25 were employed to rescale δtws to evaluate the budyko modeled monthly e we compared it with four e products from the global land data assimilation system with noah land surface model 2 gldas e modis modis e japanese 25 year reanalysis product jra e and zhang s method zhang e zhang et al 2010 using the estimated e from the water balance method as a reference detailed description of the four e datasets is given in table 2 since different e products have different spatial resolutions we interpolated all data to a standard 0 25 grid also these four e products were revised by the bias correction in order to keep the mean and variance of the e products are consistent with the grace derived e 3 methodology 3 1 budyko type evapotranspiration model at monthly scale at a natural watershed the evapotranspiration e can be obtained from the dynamic water balance 1 e p δ t w s r where p e and r are precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff respectively and δtws is the change of terrestrial water storage for long term water balance the δtws can be negligible and mean annual precipitation p is partitioned into mean annual actual evapotranspiration e and runoff r this partitioning can be described by a parsimonious water balance model i e budyko equation e p f e 0 p where e 0 refers to mean annual potential evapotranspiration several analytical equations have been proposed for the budyko curve i e budyko 1958 fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2008 wang and tang 2014 among which the model developed by fu 1981 and recommended by zhang et al 2004 is widely used and its mathematical expression of the mean annual e model is given as 2 e p 1 e 0 p 1 e 0 p ω 1 ω where ω is a catchment specific parameter which determines the evapotranspiration ratio e p for given e 0 p and modifies the partitioning of p between e and r in fact within the year the water is balanced at each given month over multi years because the average change of soil water is stable that is the model parameter should be a constant for a certain month over multi years moreover for a certain month the water availability is defined by wang 2012 as effective precipitation p e p δ t w s and monthly aridity index for multi years is defined as e 0 p e in this context p in the eq 2 should be replaced by p e then for the ith month within the year the budyko framework at monthly scale given by 3 e i p i δ t w s i 1 e 0 i p i δ t w s i 1 e 0 i p i δ t w s i ω i 1 ω i can be written as 4 e i p e i 1 e 0 i p e i 1 e 0 i p e i ω i 1 ω i where e i p e i and e 0 i p e i are mean monthly evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index for the ith month within the year respectively and ω i is the mean parameter in the budyko model for the ith month within one year during all the study period in this proposed monthly budyko model we assume that water and energy budget are balanced on a watershed or region at each given month therefore the budyko type function which represents the relationship between evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index is established if p δ t w s is over zero in order to estimate monthly e series for the study region ω i in the eq 3 was used to conduct the monthly e estimate method as 5 e i p i δ t w s i 1 e 0 i p i δ t w s i 1 e 0 i p i δ t w s i ω i 1 ω i if p i δ t w s i 0 e i 0 i f p i δ t w s i 0 where ω i in ith month within one year during all the study period is constant the parameter ω in eq 2 and ω i in eq 3 can be estimated by minimizing the root mean square error rmse between budyko modeled e and grace derived e e pe and e0 p e were calculated for the same month since pe was computed as the difference between p and grace derived δtws grace derived δtws estimates were taken as the difference between grace recorded twsa estimates at two different time periods following rodell 2004 6 δ t w s δ t twsa t i δ t twsa t i where t i δ t and t i represents the ending and starting times respectively in the time period δ t the annual and monthly e 0 were computed for each catchment by accumulating the daily values daily e 0 was computed based on the penman equation that requires data on temperature radiation relative humidity and wind speed in the form of 7 λ e 0 δ δ γ r n g γ δ γ 6 43 1 0 536 u 2 100 r h 100 e s shuttleworth 1993 where e 0 is

transformation adjusting the mean and variance of the outputs of lsms in gldas 2 to agree with the statistical properties of the gldas 2 the details see wood et al 2004 was used to correct the biases in grace products 3 3 temporal trend analysis in this paper simple linear regression method was employed to quantify the magnitude of overall trend i e the change per unit time in p e 0 r and δtws series at both annual and monthly scales which is the most frequently used method for quantifying long term trends in hydro climatic variables because of its simplicity for an unknown trend da silva 2004 the parametric t test method was used to test whether the trends are statistically significant at the 95 significance level i e p 0 05 or not p 0 05 3 4 measures of performance assessment the performance of the extended budyko model for estimating monthly e was evaluated by comparing the simulated e against e values calculated by eq 1 using the observations and grace derived δtws three statistics namely the correlation coefficient r the nash sutcliffe coefficient nsce and relative error re were used to evaluate the performance of budyko model during both the calibration 2003 1 2010 12 and validation 2011 1 2013 12 periods and are defined in the forms of 8 r i 1 m o i o s i s i 1 m o i o 2 0 5 i 1 m s i s 2 0 5 9 nsce 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 10 re i 1 m s i o i m i 1 m o i with o i 1 m o i m and s i 1 m s i m are the average of the observed variable o i and the average of the simulated variable s i i 1 2 m respectively where m is the number of time steps r is a measure of the linear correlation between observation and simulation nsce describes how well the volume and timing of the simulation compares to the observation the closer the values of r and nsce equal to 1 the better the budyko model represent in capturing inter annual variability of monthly e values calculated using the observations and grace derived δtws re describes the relative errors of budyko modeled monthly e comparing to the e values calculated by the observations and grace derived δtws the closer the re equal to 0 the better the model calibration validation is 4 results 4 1 annual terrestrial water storage change at the mean annual scale the absolute values of δtws were fairly small compared to the values of e calculated by eq 1 and r especially for the arid and semi arid basins see fig 3 for all the 24 catchments the largest absolute δtws was found in taojiang catchment 14 5 mm accounting only 1 of p located on the yangtze river basin and the smallest δtws was observed at tangnaihai catchment 0 03 mm located on the source region of yellow river basin overall δtws for all the selected catchments were very small compared with the mean annual e and r indicating that it is reasonable to neglect this term in the water balance method for estimating e at the long term scale the changing trends and their statistical significance of annual r p e 0 and δtws for the selected 24 catchments are plotted in fig 4 for the majority of these study catchments there were insignificant trends in all the four variables fig 4 a shows that there were only two catchments i e lhasa and wangjiaba have the significant downward trends in annual r for p there was only wangjiaba catchment showing the significant downward trend which is located on the huai river basin fig 4 b significant upward trend and downward trend of e 0 presented at huanyuankou catchment and haerbin catchment respectively fig 4 c while fig 4 d indicates that there were insignificant trends in annual δtws for all the 24 catchments further the most monthly r p e 0 and δtws trend analysis results for the study period were similar to those at the annual scale see tables s1 s4 in the supplementary material this finding further supports that there existed a comparatively steady water energy balance across these study catchments 4 2 mean monthly p r e 0 e and δtws change fig 5 shows the monthly variation of p r e 0 e and δtws during the study period across the selected 24 catchments it can be seen that among the 12 months almost all these variables showed clear seasonal cycles with maxima in summer and minima in winter except the qilian catchment almost all the arid and semi arid catchments showed the maximum p in july while in the humid and semi humid catchments the maximum p occurred in may or june in the humid and semi humid catchments the distribution characteristics of r during the year were similar with those of p however the values of monthly r were no more than 10 mm across xiangshuibao shixiali qingtongxia hekou and huayuankou catchments which are arid catchments located in hai river basin and yellow river basin for the arid catchments the monthly e 0 values were usually higher than the value of p while the monthly e 0 values of humid catchments were much lower than p values the variations of e during one year were uneven since the seasonality of p and e 0 the maximum e values mostly happened in june august moreover the maximum e for humid catchments was generally larger than those for the arid and semi arid catchments in the arid and semi arid catchments the values of δtws were positive from may to july and negative from october to the next february while in the humid and semi humid catchments the values of δtws were positive from january to june and negative from july to december fig 5 this phenomenon shows that these hydro climatic variables varied largely and were different between different months more importantly it can be seen from fig 5 that the absolute values of δtws were as large as e for some months with the δtws values even larger than e values in june and july across the source region of yellow river basin these results further demonstrate that the δtws occupied a large proportion in the partitioning of p into r e and therefore it should urgently be considered in the hydrological process simulation at the monthly scale 4 3 budyko parameters for the mean annual and monthly scales using long term mean annual p r and e 0 data during the study period budyko parameter ω for a specific basin was obtained by eq 2 fig 6 illustrates the long term mean annual evapotranspiration ratio e p versus dryness index e 0 p for the 24 selected catchments it is clear that the long term averaged dryness index ranged from 0 57 i e weiren catchment to 4 32 i e qilian catchment and the evapotranspiration ratio ranged from 0 28 i e qilian catchment to 0 99 i e xiangshuibao catchment it can also be seen from fig 6 that the lowest ω value occurred in the qilian catchment 1 13 and the highest ω value was found at xiangshuibao catchment 4 2 the evapotranspiration ratios can be fairly different for catchments with similar dryness index but different parameter ω e g the lhasa river basin e 0 p 1 67 ω 1 31 and huayuankou catchment e 0 p 1 66 ω 3 85 in the yellow river basin it can be concluded from figs 4 and 5 that there were clear fluctuation in the dryness index and evapotranspiration ratio at the monthly scale for each catchment therefore mean monthly budyko parameter ω rather than mean annual budyko parameter ω should be employed when the monthly e was estimated by the budyko type model using long term mean monthly p r and e 0 data during the study period budyko parameter ω for individual month was obtained by eq 3 the variation of budyko parameter ω in one year for different climate regions were demonstrated in fig 7 it can be seen that the mean monthly budyko parameter did not show any conspicuous seasonal regularity there was one peak value of budyko parameter ω across xiangshuibao shixiali catchments etc fig 7 a which occurred in july or august in some semi arid and semi humid catchments e g wangjiaba yichang and hankou catchments etc fig 7 b and c there were two or three peak values of budyko parameter while in another catchments e g tangnaihai and changdu catchments etc the parameters tended likely to increase from march or april to december during one year 4 4 monthly budyko type e model s calibration and validation using scaling factors monthly grace derived e grace e was scaled proportionally and the annual e values obtained from the scaled monthly e were consistent with the e values directly calculated by eq 1 therefore grace e was taken as the benchmark values and the observation in the following the historical records of monthly p e 0 r and grace e of 24 selected catchments over the period of 2003 2010 and 2011 2013 were selected to calibrate and validate the extended monthly budyko type e model i e eq 5 respectively model calibration was conducted by comparing the budyko model simulated e budyko e with grace e on monthly basis fig 8 illustrates the comparison of budyko e and grace e for the typical catchments with smallest and largest area in each climate region during both the calibration and validation periods also the assessment measures for model performance for each study catchment during both calibration and validation periods are summarized in table 3 it can be seen that the budyko e represented the grace e across qilian huayuankou and haerbin catchments fig 8 a b and d quite well the r and nsce of these arid and semi arid catchments were all larger than 0 74 and the absolute re were larger than 0 09 among all the study catchments the monthly budyko type e model well represented the grace e across shixiali catchment located the hai river basin with the r nsce and re between observed e and simulated results being 0 996 0 988 0 033 in calibration and 0 994 0 951 0 111 in validation respectively table 3 while in the humid and semi humid region the simulated monthly e did not represent the grace e so well fig 8 f h e g liuzhou catchment showed comparatively worst performance with r nsce and re between budyko e and grace e being 0 801 0 62 0 034 in calibration and 0 818 0 629 0 099 in validation respectively table 3 overall monthly budyko e can well represent grace e for all the 24 selected catchments it also should be noted that both budyko simulated e volumes and hydrograph shape were consistent with grace e series except some peak e which were underestimated the variations of grace derived δtws for these typical catchments were also shown in fig 8 it can be seen that most of the absolute changes of δtws were lower than 100 mm for the study period and the changes of monthly δtws were not as small as the annual δtws which can be neglected in the water balance method for estimating e in order to investigate the performance of monthly budyko e model in term of catchment area and climate sub regions the comparison between monthly budyko e and grace e across four different climate regions was demonstrated in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 a that for the arid catchments the budyko e values were very close to the grace e ones with the r 2 0 962 especially the e values from the catchment with large area e g huayuankou catchment the budyko model can also simulate grace e well in semi arid fig 9 b and semi humid catchments fig 9 c with the r 2 being 0 879 and 0 831 respectively however in the humid catchments the simulated e values were not so close to the grace e with the r 2 being 0 723 fig 9 d it can be concluded that the applicability of monthly budyko e model in the arid region was better than it in the humid region and the performance of budyko e model in the catchments with large area was better than those with small area 4 5 evaluation of monthly budyko e model by comparing with four e products using the grace e as the observation fig 10 gives the comparison of monthly grace e with budyko e gldas e modis e jra e and zhang e for the 24 selected catchments during the whole study period it can be seen that the five e estimates exhibited substantial differences between different regions the budyko e showed the best performance of these e estimates in reproducing grace e in terms of the three statistics used further the budyko e represented the grace e of the shixiali catchment located in the hai river basin quite well with the r nsce and re being 0 993 0 972 and 0 056 respectively while in the humid catchments the budyko e represented the grace e not so well the worst performance occurred in liuzhou catchment located in the pearl river basin with the r nsce and re being 0 809 0 624 and 0 06 respectively among the four e products i e gldas e modis e jra e and zhang e gldas e was the best e products in reproducing monthly grace e variations with relatively high r and nsce small re among all these catchments gldas e represented the grace e best in zhimenda catchment located in the source of yangtze river with the r nsce and re being 0 924 0 874 and 0 063 respectively while modis e showed the poorest performance in reproducing the inter annual e variations of these 24 catchments which was reflected by low nsce values and high re values fig 10 b and c for modis e jra e and zhang e all the worst performances were found at lhasa catchment located in the yalungzangbo river basin 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of budyko e with the other actual evapotranspiration estimates on basin or regional scale the traditional method to estimate actual e is through a simple water balance equation i e e p r however this approach is only appropriate to the long time scale when the δtws can be negligible for watersheds under natural condition since the grace records of monthly twsa emerged in 2002 the technique of estimating monthly e obtained from the water balance equation i e e p δtws r has become possible actually the grace estimates generally lay in the middle of the models and have been confirmed to provide skill in evaluating modeled e by various studies e g rodell 2004 ramillien et al 2006 rodell et al 2011 syed et al 2014 billah et al 2015 considering the essential identification of δtws the estimated e from the water balance method by grace and observation usually is taken as a reference to evaluate e estimates and products e g xue et al 2013 billah et al 2015 there are many hydrological models and land atmosphere models to estimate actual monthly regional e including the method based on penman e proportional hypothesis e g penman approach thornthwaite s model of evaporation inhibition and approaches based on complementary relationship e g morton s models advection aridity and like models it is worth mentioning that the penman e proportional hypothesis assumes that both water advected energy and heat storage effects are relatively small and can be ignored however estimating actual e under irregular and heterogeneous underlying surface is not straightforward mcmahon et al 2013 bouchet hypothesis states that for large homogeneous surfaces there exists a complementary relationship between potential e and actual e however the bouchet complementary relationship models rely only on the routine climatological observations while local variations such as properties of vegetation soil type basin slope etc can affect the runoff coefficient which in turn influence the local e xu and singh 2005 many studies found that those complementary relationship models are better in humid areas in temperate zone but not so good in arid and semi arid areas hobbins et al 2001 huntington et al 2011 as a very common technique to estimate long term actual e budyko type models is based on a balance between water and energy availability in a catchment budyko 1974 various sub annual processes e g water storage change rooting depth and soil store dynamics have been identified as important factors which can improve the accuracy of budyko estimates by latest studies e g yokoo et al 2008 wang 2012 in this study grace derived δtws was employed to extend the budyko model at monthly scale comparatively the extended budyko type e model showed the better performance in monthly e series across these 24 selected catchments than the other four global e products see fig 10 5 2 expression of budyko type parameters at different time scales the budyko parameter is empirical and dimensionless and plays as a controlling role on how much of the available water will be evaporated when the available energy is given budyko 1974 greve et al 2015 the parameter in the budyko framework represents the catchment characteristics which is reflected by the integrated effect of topographic controls shao et al 2012 soil properties donohue et al 2012 vegetation li et al 2013 wang and tang 2014 climatic seasonality characteristics milly 1994 streamflow regimes trancoso et al 2016 as well as relative area of ecological restoration irrigation and cultivation liang et al 2015 xing et al 2018a using the twsa amplitude as a fraction of precipitation fang et al 2016 examined the physical significance of twsa and improved the accuracy of budyko curve based estimates however all previous findings are based on the statistics of spatially distributed catchments data at the mean annual scale our present work examines the physical significance of grace derived δtws on the budyko e model extension at the monthly scale fig 6 shows that at the mean annual scale the budyko parameter ω ranged from 1 13 qilian catchment to 4 20 xiangshuibao catchment meanwhile at the monthly scale the largest ω value 6 46 occurred in april in hankou catchment and the lowest ω value 1 03 occurred in february in qilian catchment see fig 7 apparently the parameter ω of the budyko e model at different temporal scales are very different this phenomenon is not strange as many previous studies have pointed out that the effects of climatic seasonality on water balances and the importance of land use cover soil properties and topography in modulating these impacts at different temporal and spatial scales e g milly 1994 yokoo et al 2008 wang et al 2016 by incorporating dynamic ecohydrological processes into the steady state budyko model liu et al 2016 assessed the impacts of vegetation on the water balance in a temperate water limited basin and they found this way can improve the estimation of inter annual variability of the regional water balance therefore seasonality of p and e 0 or other factors e g vegetation evolution which maybe the possible causes for the variations in the mean monthly budyko parameter ω should be further investigated in future study 5 3 uncertainties in monthly budyko type e model e is difficult to measure at regional and basin scales for it links to earth s water energy and carbon cycles rodell 2004 based on a nonlinear relationship and constrained by physical limits the budyko framework has wide applications in e g assessing r or e changes at catchment roderick and farquhar 2011 van der velde et al 2013 xing et al 2018b and predicting water availability or mean annual e in ungauged basins blöschl et al 2013 xu et al 2013 greve et al 2015 however as the budyko framework is developed based on the assumption of negligible human impacts on the hydrologic cycle of a watershed the budyko model should not be applied to the watershed with huge area likely affected by anthropogenic factors in this paper the areas of 24 selected catchments are from 2 452 to 1 488 036 km2 see fig 2 and table 1 the hydrologic cycles in majority of catchments might be affected by both climate variability and human activities grace satellite mission which provides monthly twsa over a region tapley et al 2004 has been widely used in model calibration and testing niu et al 2014 and quantification of hydrologic responses to droughts and anthropogenic activities huang et al 2015 further some studies have estimated monthly e from water balance equation which is obtained as residuals of terrestrial water storage changes derived from grace e g rodell 2004 ramillien et al 2006 rodell et al 2011 xue et al 2013 syed et al 2014 billah et al 2015 however although e estimates by the water balance equation with monthly grace derived δtws have been recorded in many researches grace satellites serve information on changes in the earth s gravity field which are primarily controlled by horizontal and vertical variations in water distribution and are usually used to derive δtws at a spatial resolution of more than 200 000 km2 long et al 2014a felfelani et al 2017 in this paper the areas of catchments we selected vary from 2452 to 1 488 036 km2 see fig 2 and table 1 with only four catchments i e accounting 25 of all 24 selected catchments having the areas of over 20 000 km2 downscaling method and bias correction were employed to obtain a resolution of 0 25 0 25 grid δtws data the reference hydro climatic variables were obtained from gldas 2 and the adjusted δtws was evaluated by the water balance method at the mean annual scale see fig 3 further using a scaling factor monthly e was scaled proportionally and the annual e values obtained from the scaled monthly e were consistent with the e values directly calculated by eq 1 therefore we conclude that the grace derived δtws can effectively simulate the actual δtws across these study catchments however the performance of grace derived δtws at a spatial resolution of less than 200 000 km2 has not been systematically evaluated using the observation as the uncertainty and biases from the grace satellite data and gldas 2 product may result the unrealistic δtws and reduce the performance of the extended monthly budyko e model similar with the streamflow observation grace satellite mission provides the horizontal and vertical variations of tws caused by both climate variability and human activities reager and famiglietti 2013 felfelani et al 2017 that is as a key inputs of the monthly budyko type e model both grace e and budyko model likely suffer from their intrinsic uncertainties overall human induced tws variations are usually evaluated by calculating the difference between grace that includes the anthropogenic factors and hydrological models which simulate only the climate variability part huang et al 2015 pan et al 2016 some studies have used grace derived tws variations and surface water storage variations to obtain groundwater storage change in aquifer systems however the δtws from grace changed mostly due to human induced groundwater storage change in some regions rodell et al 2009 famiglietti et al 2011 and due to climatic events such as droughts or other specific climate variability in some other regions scanlon et al 2015 russo and lall 2017 therefore hydrological models with physical processes or other reliable observed data are required to partition the total e and or tws into separate components i e surface water soil moisture groundwater storage and snow with different causes the natural and human induced changes one parameter was employed to drive the monthly budyko type e model by using a method similar to that of zhang et al 2008 for water balance modeling over four temporal scales including mean annual annual monthly and daily in our study the one parameter e model based on budyko framework and grace data was developed to estimate the regional e at the monthly scale the budyko e represented the grace e well across the 24 selected catchments with both modeled e volumes and hydrograph shapes which were also consistent with grace e series except some underestimation for peak e fig 8 this finding is coincident with the result by chen et al 2013 which pointed out that the performance of seasonal budyko model in wet seasons was better than that in dry seasons comparing with four global e products i e gldas e modis e jra e and zhang e the one parameter budyko type e showed the best performance fig 10 and is quite acceptable for prediction for ungauged basins despite that the budyko e model represented the grace e well across the arid and semi arid catchments of china the simulated monthly e did not perform the grace derived e so well across the humid and semi humid catchments figs 8 and 9 nevertheless using e from the water balance method as the benchmark values the one parameter e model showed the best performance in reproducing e comparing with the other four e products it can be concluded that the use of budyko model provides a consistent framework for the modeling of different processes with a simple model structure 6 conclusions based on the budyko framework and grace derived δtws datasets this study developed a one parameter monthly e model to estimate regional e and applied it to the selected 24 catchments china the temporal changing characteristics of annual and monthly p r e 0 and δtws were evaluated first furthermore using grace e as the benchmark values the budyko e was evaluated by comparing with four global e products including gldas e modis e jra e and zhang e for the majority of 24 catchments there were not statistically significant trends in p e 0 r and δtws as there were no severe natural climate variabilities and indirect human impacts although δtws values were considerably small compared with the mean annual p and r values but the δtws occupied a large proportion in the partitioning of p into r e at the monthly scale and therefore should be considered in the hydrological process simulation the budyko simulated monthly e represented the grace e across the 24 selected catchments well with both simulated e volumes and hydrograph shape being consistent with grace e series except some underestimation for peak e in july and august among these catchments the budyko e best represented grace e across shixiali catchment located the hai river basin with the r nsce and re between observed e and simulated results being 0 996 0 988 0 033 in calibration and 0 994 0 951 0 111 in validation all the existing e products did not represent grace e of the 24 selected catchments well and the modis e showed the poorest performance in reproducing regional e while gldas e was the best of four e products at reproducing monthly variations with relatively high r and nsce small re the preferable performance of budyko e model further confirms its broad application in different climatic regions and the extended budyko framework combined with water storage data provides a new way for evaluating monthly e and water resources in

6913,the estimates of actual evapotranspiration e across basins and or regions are still facing some difficulties because of the complex interactions amongst the components of the land plant atmosphere system even though the basic physical mechanism of e is well understood presenting as a nonlinear relationship constrained by physical limits the budyko framework serves as a powerful tool used to estimate the averaged e at long term scale given the ability of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace in effectively simulating the terrestrial water storage change δtws at monthly scale a model to estimate e was developed based on the budyko framework with mean monthly parameter of multi years and was applied to the estimation of e for the 24 selected catchments in different climatic regions across china results indicate that for the majority of 24 catchments the positive or negative trends in precipitation p potential evapotranspiration e 0 runoff r and δtws were not statistically significant during 2003 2013 at both annual and monthly scales but the δtws occupied a large proportion in the partitioning of p into r and e at monthly scale the monthly budyko parameter showed large variation within the year and also across these 24 catchments the budyko modeled monthly e budyko e represented the grace derived ones grace e across these catchments well with both modeled e volumes and hydrograph shapes which were also consistent with grace e series except some underestimation for peak e overall the budyko e represented grace e in the arid and semi arid catchments comparatively better than it in the humid and semi humid catchments due to the larger proportion of δtws in the p partition among all the 24 selected catchments the monthly budyko type e model represented the grace e across shixiali catchment located in the hai river basin best with the correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe coefficient nsce and relative error re between grace e and simulated results being 0 996 0 988 0 033 in calibration and 0 994 0 951 0 111 in validation respectively furthermore using grace e as the benchmark values the budyko e outperformed four other global e products from the newly published global land data assimilation system with noah land surface model 2 gldas e modis modis e japanese 25 year reanalysis product jra e and zhang s method zhang e gldas e was the best of four global e products at reproducing monthly variations with relatively high r and nsce values small re while modis e showed the poorest performance in reproducing the inter annual e variations of these catchments which was reflected by low r and nsce values this extended budyko e model can apply in other similar climatic regions and also may provide skill in evaluating the water resources since the preferable accuracy of e estimate keywords budyko framework grace evapotranspiration model terrestrial water storage change water balance method climatic regions 1 introduction as one of the major components of the hydrological cycle actual evapotranspiration e plays an important role in both the catchment water balance and energy budget in the earth atmospheric system the estimates of actual e are critical for many disciplines such as hydrology meteorology agronomy and ecology priestley and taylor 1972 fisher et al 2011 however compared with the other two components precipitation p and streamflow q of the hydrologic cycle e is arguably the most challenging hydrological process because of the complex interactions amongst the components of the land plant atmosphere system xu and singh 2005 wang et al 2012 nevertheless various methods have been proposed for estimating actual e including the use of land surface hydrologic models constrained by observations e g wood et al 1992 jung et al 2010 fully coupled land atmosphere modeling in a reanalysis mode or remote sensing based approaches e g rodell 2004 mu et al 2007 2011 irmak et al 2012 yang et al 2015 ordinarily the hydrologic models and land atmosphere modeling could be limited by sparse observation sites and are difficult to upscale to regional scale vinukollu et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 while the remote sensing based techniques involve a quantification of uncertainties due to the mismatch between vegetation data with high resolution and meteorological forcing with low resolution rodell et al 2011 yang and shang 2013 long et al 2014a alternatively various evapotranspiration theories have also been widely used to e estimates at different time scales including penman s proportional hypothesis penman 1948 bouchet s complementarity hypothesis bouchet 1963 and budyko hydrothermal coupling equilibrium hypothesis budyko 1948 1974 among them budyko hypothesis describes the long term partition of p between e and runoff r as a function of the aridity index e 0 p where e 0 represents the potential evapotranspiration and has been revived in recent years arora 2002 gerrits et al 2009 wang and tang 2014 however the budyko model is only appropriate to the mean annual scale when the terrestrial water storage change δtws can be negligible in watersheds under natural condition moreover as the budyko framework is based on a steady hydro climatological condition to better overcome the limits of its concept various sub annual processes e g rooting depth and soil store dynamics yokoo et al 2008 szilagyi and jozsa 2009 donohue et al 2012 and water storage dynamics zhang et al 2008 wang 2012 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 have also been proposed in our previous study xing et al 2018a by using a data set of selected 96 catchments across china at mean annual scale a non parametric regression technique was employed to investigate the relationship of the budyko parameter with potential influencing factors including climatic seasonality e g seasonality index of precipitation catchment characteristics e g vegetation coverage and agricultural activities e g effective irrigated area ratio we found that average storm depth seasonality index of precipitation and vegetation coverage were three statistically significant factors affecting the budyko parameter recently water balance estimates at shorter term have become the main concerns in many studies the budyko type functions which is originally designed and valid for long term water balance when the change of soil water is negligible have been extended to study the relationship between the annual e p and annual e 0 p e g zhang et al 2008 tang et al 2017 furthermore the budyko framework has also been used in inter annual variability of p partition in many studies e g potter and zhang 2009 chen et al 2013 which found that soil water storage changes is an important component in inter annual variability of p partition at some catchments especially for catchments in arid regions the traditional water balance model in the form of e p r when δtws is negligible over a long period of time is the most reliable method for estimation of e at basin or regional scales and for the evaluation of e products and has also been widely used e g hobbins et al 2001 xue et al 2013 while in some cases the δtws is the determinant factor controlling the actual e process especially in warmer and drier regions and or in monthly scale xu and singh 2005 wang and alimohammadi 2012 however the estimation of monthly e is difficult for some regions where measurements are limited due to accessibility and or costs and the δtws is unknown the nasa s gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission was launched in 2002 and records monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa storage deviation from the long term mean grace recorded twsa has been recognized as its wide applications in groundwater resources monitoring famiglietti et al 2011 döll et al 2014 chao et al 2017 drought or flood monitoring long et al 2014b reager et al 2014 schumacher et al 2018 model development and calibration niu et al 2014 and the quantification of hydrologic responses to droughts and anthropogenic activities castle et al 2014 huang et al 2015 humphrey et al 2016 since the water storage is identified as a competing process of p partition into r and e the estimates of monthly e from water balance equation are obtained as residuals of δtws derived from grace as first appeared in rodell 2004 and later in other studies e g ramillien et al 2006 rodell et al 2011 xue et al 2013 syed et al 2014 billah et al 2015 previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of grace derived δtws for the estimation of actual e at basin scale recently fang et al 2016 improved budyko curve based estimates of long term water partitioning using hydrologic signatures from grace with the aid of the extended budyko model at annual scale tang et al 2017 reconstructed annual groundwater storage changes in a large scale irrigation region by using grace data and found that the integration of the developed budyko equation with the grace data provides a new way for evaluating long term groundwater depletion overall it can be concluded that there indeed exists a relationship between regional e and grace recorded twsa and budyko curve based e estimates can be improved by grace signatures note that the water and energy are balanced on a watershed at any time scale with the prerequisite of all the relevant components to be considered although the budyko hypothesis describes the long term partitioning of p whether the budyko framework can describe the partitioning of p into r e and δtws at the monthly scale is an interesting research point however to the best of our knowledge no study has investigated how grace derived δtws can be used to extend the long time budyko e model to a monthly e model in recent years several global e products from reanalysis or land surface models have been generated and widely used rodell 2004 dee and uppala 2009 some studies have evaluated various e products e g mueller et al 2011 evaluated and compared the satellite based e products land surface model lsm simulations atmospheric reanalysis e outputs e estimates based on empirical upscaling of eddy covariance flux e measurements and atmospheric water balance datasets at the global scale xue et al 2013 implemented a water balance method to evaluate four e products for two river basins in tibetan plateau li et al 2014 evaluated five existing global e products against monthly e estimated by the water balance method for four large basins on tibetan plateau andam akorful et al 2015 evaluated and combined different e estimates over volta basin west africa consequently most of the e products produced varying results when e rates are integrated over regions and over time and their usefulness are constrained by the accuracy and availability of river discharge data overall several studies have focused on the improvement of hydrological model based estimates of long term or annual water partitioning using grace derived δtws e g fang et al 2016 tang et al 2017 schumacher et al 2018 however whether the budyko framework can describe the partitioning of p into r e and δtws at the monthly scale has not been investigated in addition to what extent the e model based on the extended budyko framework and grace data can estimate e at basin or region scale should be evaluated by comparing with other e products to address these issues 24 catchments in different climatic regions of china were selected as a case study descripted in section 2 section 3 is presented to describe the methodology including the monthly budyko e model parameter estimation statistical analysis and model performance measures results are shown in section 4 the change characteristics of hydrological variables during 2003 2013 for these catchments were investigated in sections 4 1 and 4 2 then section 4 3 gives the variations in mean annul and monthly budyko parameters while the monthly e model based on the extended budyko framework and grace data was calibrated and validated in section 4 4 finally the watershed scale e estimated by the one parameter monthly budyko e model was compared with other global e products in section 4 5 discussion on the comparison of budyko e with the other actual e estimates budyko type parameters at different time scales and the model uncertainties are presented in sections 5 1 5 2 and 5 3 respectively and conclusions are drawn in section 6 an overview of the datasets procedures and models is given in the flowchart presented in fig 1 2 study area and data processing due to the shortage of observed streamflow data 24 catchments located in songhua river basin liao river basin hai river basin yellow river basin yangtze river basin pearl river basin hei river basin lancang river basin yalungzangbo river basin and southeastern basins across different climatic regions of china were finally selected as the study areas to investigate the performance of monthly budyko e model by combining grace data fig 2 shows the location of 24 selected catchments and their corresponding hydrologic control stations table 1 lists the detailed information of each study catchment these catchments were classified into four different climatic regions arid region p e 0 400 mm semi arid region 400 mm p e 0 0 mm semi humid region 0 mm p e 0 400 mm and humid region p e 0 400 mm according the standard of climate zone division furthermore for each climatic region the catchments were sorted from small to large by their drainage area the monthly observed streamflow data for the period of 2003 2013 were obtained from the ministry of water resources china daily precipitation wind speed relative humidity sunshine hours maximum and minimum temperature were collected from 255 meteorological stations on or around the selected catchments covering the same period of the streamflow data the procedure for calculating the each region average climatic variables can be seen in xing et al 2018a grace solutions swenson 2014 providing at monthly time intervals and 1 1 spatial resolution for the world were obtained from the three processing

from the water balance method as a reference detailed description of the four e datasets is given in table 2 since different e products have different spatial resolutions we interpolated all data to a standard 0 25 grid also these four e products were revised by the bias correction in order to keep the mean and variance of the e products are consistent with the grace derived e 3 methodology 3 1 budyko type evapotranspiration model at monthly scale at a natural watershed the evapotranspiration e can be obtained from the dynamic water balance 1 e p δ t w s r where p e and r are precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff respectively and δtws is the change of terrestrial water storage for long term water balance the δtws can be negligible and mean annual precipitation p is partitioned into mean annual actual evapotranspiration e and runoff r this partitioning can be described by a parsimonious water balance model i e budyko equation e p f e 0 p where e 0 refers to mean annual potential evapotranspiration several analytical equations have been proposed for the budyko curve i e budyko 1958 fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2008 wang and tang 2014 among which the model developed by fu 1981 and recommended by zhang et al 2004 is widely used and its mathematical expression of the mean annual e model is given as 2 e p 1 e 0 p 1 e 0 p ω 1 ω where ω is a catchment specific parameter which determines the evapotranspiration ratio e p for given e 0 p and modifies the partitioning of p between e and r in fact within the year the water is balanced at each given month over multi years because the average change of soil water is stable that is the model parameter should be a constant for a certain month over multi years moreover for a certain month the water availability is defined by wang 2012 as effective precipitation p e p δ t w s and monthly aridity index for multi years is defined as e 0 p e in this context p in the eq 2 should be replaced by p e then for the ith month within the year the budyko framework at monthly scale given by 3 e i p i δ t w s i 1 e 0 i p i δ t w s i 1 e 0 i p i δ t w s i ω i 1 ω i can be written as 4 e i p e i 1 e 0 i p e i 1 e 0 i p e i ω i 1 ω i where e i p e i and e 0 i p e i are mean monthly evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index for the ith month within the year respectively and ω i is the mean parameter in the budyko model for the ith month within one year during all the study period in this proposed monthly budyko model we assume that water and energy budget are balanced on a watershed or region at each given month therefore the budyko type function which represents the relationship between evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index is established if p δ t w s is over zero in order to estimate monthly e series for the study region ω i in the eq 3 was used to conduct the monthly e estimate method as 5 e i p i δ t w s i 1 e 0 i p i δ t w s i 1 e 0 i p i δ t w s i ω i 1 ω i if p i δ t w s i 0 e i 0 i f p i δ t w s i 0 where ω i in ith month within one year during all the study period is constant the parameter ω in eq 2 and ω i in eq 3 can be estimated by minimizing the root mean square error rmse between budyko modeled e and grace derived e e pe and e0 p e were calculated for the same month since pe was computed as the difference between p and grace derived δtws grace derived δtws estimates were taken as the difference between grace recorded twsa estimates at two different time periods following rodell 2004 6 δ t w s δ t twsa t i δ t twsa t i where t i δ t and t i represents the ending and starting times respectively in the time period δ t the annual and monthly e 0 were computed for each catchment by accumulating the daily values daily e 0 was computed based on the penman equation that requires data on temperature radiation relative humidity and wind speed in the form of 7 λ e 0 δ δ γ r n g γ δ γ 6 43 1 0 536 u 2 100 r h 100 e s shuttleworth 1993 where e 0 is

transformation adjusting the mean and variance of the outputs of lsms in gldas 2 to agree with the statistical properties of the gldas 2 the details see wood et al 2004 was used to correct the biases in grace products 3 3 temporal trend analysis in this paper simple linear regression method was employed to quantify the magnitude of overall trend i e the change per unit time in p e 0 r and δtws series at both annual and monthly scales which is the most frequently used method for quantifying long term trends in hydro climatic variables because of its simplicity for an unknown trend da silva 2004 the parametric t test method was used to test whether the trends are statistically significant at the 95 significance level i e p 0 05 or not p 0 05 3 4 measures of performance assessment the performance of the extended budyko model for estimating monthly e was evaluated by comparing the simulated e against e values calculated by eq 1 using the observations and grace derived δtws three statistics namely the correlation coefficient r the nash sutcliffe coefficient nsce and relative error re were used to evaluate the performance of budyko model during both the calibration 2003 1 2010 12 and validation 2011 1 2013 12 periods and are defined in the forms of 8 r i 1 m o i o s i s i 1 m o i o 2 0 5 i 1 m s i s 2 0 5 9 nsce 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 10 re i 1 m s i o i m i 1 m o i with o i 1 m o i m and s i 1 m s i m are the average of the observed variable o i and the average of the simulated variable s i i 1 2 m respectively where m is the number of time steps r is a measure of the linear correlation between observation and simulation nsce describes how well the volume and timing of the simulation compares to the observation the closer the values of r and nsce equal to 1 the better the budyko model represent in capturing inter annual variability of monthly e values calculated using the observations and grace derived δtws re describes the relative errors of budyko modeled monthly e comparing to the e values calculated by the observations and grace derived δtws the closer the re equal to 0 the better the model calibration validation is 4 results 4 1 annual terrestrial water storage change at the mean annual scale the absolute values of δtws were fairly small compared to the values of e calculated by eq 1 and r especially for the arid and semi arid basins see fig 3 for all the 24 catchments the largest absolute δtws was found in taojiang catchment 14 5 mm accounting only 1 of p located on the yangtze river basin and the smallest δtws was observed at tangnaihai catchment 0 03 mm located on the source region of yellow river basin overall δtws for all the selected catchments were very small compared with the mean annual e and r indicating that it is reasonable to neglect this term in the water balance method for estimating e at the long term scale the changing trends and their statistical significance of annual r p e 0 and δtws for the selected 24 catchments are plotted in fig 4 for the majority of these study catchments there were insignificant trends in all the four variables fig 4 a shows that there were only two catchments i e lhasa and wangjiaba have the significant downward trends in annual r for p there was only wangjiaba catchment showing the significant downward trend which is located on the huai river basin fig 4 b significant upward trend and downward trend of e 0 presented at huanyuankou catchment and haerbin catchment respectively fig 4 c while fig 4 d indicates that there were insignificant trends in annual δtws for all the 24 catchments further the most monthly r p e 0 and δtws trend analysis results for the study period were similar to those at the annual scale see tables s1 s4 in the supplementary material this finding further supports that there existed a comparatively steady water energy balance across these study catchments 4 2 mean monthly p r e 0 e and δtws change fig 5 shows the monthly variation of p r e 0 e and δtws during the study period across the selected 24 catchments it can be seen that among the 12 months almost all these variables showed clear seasonal cycles with maxima in summer and minima in winter except the qilian catchment almost all the arid and semi arid catchments showed the maximum p in july while in the humid and semi humid catchments the maximum p occurred in may or june in the humid and semi humid catchments the distribution characteristics of r during the year were similar with those of p however the values of monthly r were no more than 10 mm across xiangshuibao shixiali qingtongxia hekou and huayuankou catchments which are arid catchments located in hai river basin and yellow river basin for the arid catchments the monthly e 0 values were usually higher than the value of p while the monthly e 0 values of humid catchments were much lower than p values the variations of e during one year were uneven since the seasonality of p and e 0 the maximum e values mostly happened in june august moreover the maximum e for humid catchments was generally larger than those for the arid and semi arid catchments in the arid and semi arid catchments the values of δtws were positive from may to july and negative from october to the next february while in the humid and semi humid catchments the values of δtws were positive from january to june and negative from july to december fig 5 this phenomenon shows that these hydro climatic variables varied largely and were different between different months more importantly it can be seen from fig 5 that the absolute values of δtws were as large as e for some months with the δtws values even larger than e values in june and july across the source region of yellow river basin these results further demonstrate that the δtws occupied a large proportion in the partitioning of p into r e and therefore it should urgently be considered in the hydrological process simulation at the monthly scale 4 3 budyko parameters for the mean annual and monthly scales using long term mean annual p r and e 0 data during the study period budyko parameter ω for a specific basin was obtained by eq 2 fig 6 illustrates the long term mean annual evapotranspiration ratio e p versus dryness index e 0 p for the 24 selected catchments it is clear that the long term averaged dryness index ranged from 0 57 i e weiren catchment to 4 32 i e qilian catchment and the evapotranspiration ratio ranged from 0 28 i e qilian catchment to 0 99 i e xiangshuibao catchment it can also be seen from fig 6 that the lowest ω value occurred in the qilian catchment 1 13 and the highest ω value was found at xiangshuibao catchment 4 2 the evapotranspiration ratios can be fairly different for catchments with similar dryness index but different parameter ω e g the lhasa river basin e 0 p 1 67 ω 1 31 and huayuankou catchment e 0 p 1 66 ω 3 85 in the yellow river basin it can be concluded from figs 4 and 5 that there were clear fluctuation in the dryness index and evapotranspiration ratio at the monthly scale for each catchment therefore mean monthly budyko parameter ω rather than mean annual budyko parameter ω should be employed when the monthly e was estimated by the budyko type model using long term mean monthly p r and e 0 data during the study period budyko parameter ω for individual month was obtained by eq 3 the variation of budyko parameter ω in one year for different climate regions were demonstrated in fig 7 it can be seen that the mean monthly budyko parameter did not show any conspicuous seasonal regularity there was one peak value of budyko parameter ω across xiangshuibao shixiali catchments etc fig 7 a which occurred in july or august in some semi arid and semi humid catchments e g wangjiaba yichang and hankou catchments etc fig 7 b and c there were two or three peak values of budyko parameter while in another catchments e g tangnaihai and changdu catchments etc the parameters tended likely to increase from march or april to december during one year 4 4 monthly budyko type e model s calibration and validation using scaling factors monthly grace derived e grace e was scaled proportionally and the annual e values obtained from the scaled monthly e were consistent with the e values directly calculated by eq 1 therefore grace e was taken as the benchmark values and the observation in the following the historical records of monthly p e 0 r and grace e of 24 selected catchments over the period of 2003 2010 and 2011 2013 were selected to calibrate and validate the extended monthly budyko type e model i e eq 5 respectively model calibration was conducted by comparing the budyko model simulated e budyko e with grace e on monthly basis fig 8 illustrates the comparison of budyko e and grace e for the typical catchments with smallest and largest area in each climate region during both the calibration and validation periods also the assessment measures for model performance for each study catchment during both calibration and validation periods are summarized in table 3 it can be seen that the budyko e represented the grace e across qilian huayuankou and haerbin catchments fig 8 a b and d quite well the r and nsce of these arid and semi arid catchments were all larger than 0 74 and the absolute re were larger than 0 09 among all the study catchments the monthly budyko type e model well represented the grace e across shixiali catchment located the hai river basin with the r nsce and re between observed e and simulated results being 0 996 0 988 0 033 in calibration and 0 994 0 951 0 111 in validation respectively table 3 while in the humid and semi humid region the simulated monthly e did not represent the grace e so well fig 8 f h e g liuzhou catchment showed comparatively worst performance with r nsce and re between budyko e and grace e being 0 801 0 62 0 034 in calibration and 0 818 0 629 0 099 in validation respectively table 3 overall monthly budyko e can well represent grace e for all the 24 selected catchments it also should be noted that both budyko simulated e volumes and hydrograph shape were consistent with grace e series except some peak e which were underestimated the variations of grace derived δtws for these typical catchments were also shown in fig 8 it can be seen that most of the absolute changes of δtws were lower than 100 mm for the study period and the changes of monthly δtws were not as small as the annual δtws which can be neglected in the water balance method for estimating e in order to investigate the performance of monthly budyko e model in term of catchment area and climate sub regions the comparison between monthly budyko e and grace e across four different climate regions was demonstrated in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 a that for the arid catchments the budyko e values were very close to the grace e ones with the r 2 0 962 especially the e values from the catchment with large area e g huayuankou catchment the budyko model can also simulate grace e well in semi arid fig 9 b and semi humid catchments fig 9 c with the r 2 being 0 879 and 0 831 respectively however in the humid catchments the simulated e values were not so close to the grace e with the r 2 being 0 723 fig 9 d it can be concluded that the applicability of monthly budyko e model in the arid region was better than it in the humid region and the performance of budyko e model in the catchments with large area was better than those with small area 4 5 evaluation of monthly budyko e model by comparing with four e products using the grace e as the observation fig 10 gives the comparison of monthly grace e with budyko e gldas e modis e jra e and zhang e for the 24 selected catchments during the whole study period it can be seen that the five e estimates exhibited substantial differences between different regions the budyko e showed the best performance of these e estimates in reproducing grace e in terms of the three statistics used further the budyko e represented the grace e of the shixiali catchment located in the hai river basin quite well with the r nsce and re being 0 993 0 972 and 0 056 respectively while in the humid catchments the budyko e represented the grace e not so well the worst performance occurred in liuzhou catchment located in the pearl river basin with the r nsce and re being 0 809 0 624 and 0 06 respectively among the four e products i e gldas e modis e jra e and zhang e gldas e was the best e products in reproducing monthly grace e variations with relatively high r and nsce small re among all these catchments gldas e represented the grace e best in zhimenda catchment located in the source of yangtze river with the r nsce and re being 0 924 0 874 and 0 063 respectively while modis e showed the poorest performance in reproducing the inter annual e variations of these 24 catchments which was reflected by low nsce values and high re values fig 10 b and c for modis e jra e and zhang e all the worst performances were found at lhasa catchment located in the yalungzangbo river basin 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of budyko e with the other actual evapotranspiration estimates on basin or regional scale the traditional method to estimate actual e is through a simple water balance equation i e e p r however this approach is only appropriate to the long time scale when the δtws can be negligible for watersheds under natural condition since the grace records of monthly twsa emerged in 2002 the technique of estimating monthly e obtained from the water balance equation i e e p δtws r has become possible actually the grace estimates generally lay in the middle of the models and have been confirmed to provide skill in evaluating modeled e by various studies e g rodell 2004 ramillien et al 2006 rodell et al 2011 syed et al 2014 billah et al 2015 considering the essential identification of δtws the estimated e from the water balance method by grace and observation usually is taken as a reference to evaluate e estimates and products e g xue et al 2013 billah et al 2015 there are many hydrological models and land atmosphere models to estimate actual monthly regional e including the method based on penman e proportional hypothesis e g penman approach thornthwaite s model of evaporation inhibition and approaches based on complementary relationship e g morton s models advection aridity and like models it is worth mentioning that the penman e proportional hypothesis assumes that both water advected energy and heat storage effects are relatively small and can be ignored however estimating actual e under irregular and heterogeneous underlying surface is not straightforward mcmahon et al 2013 bouchet hypothesis states that for large homogeneous surfaces there exists a complementary relationship between potential e and actual e however the bouchet complementary relationship models rely only on the routine climatological observations while local variations such as properties of vegetation soil type basin slope etc can affect the runoff coefficient which in turn influence the local e xu and singh 2005 many studies found that those complementary relationship models are better in humid areas in temperate zone but not so good in arid and semi arid areas hobbins et al 2001 huntington et al 2011 as a very common technique to estimate long term actual e budyko type models is based on a balance between water and energy availability in a catchment budyko 1974 various sub annual processes e g water storage change rooting depth and soil store dynamics have been identified as important factors which can improve the accuracy of budyko estimates by latest studies e g yokoo et al 2008 wang 2012 in this study grace derived δtws was employed to extend the budyko model at monthly scale comparatively the extended budyko type e model showed the better performance in monthly e series across these 24 selected catchments than the other four global e products see fig 10 5 2 expression of budyko type parameters at different time scales the budyko parameter is empirical and dimensionless and plays as a controlling role on how much of the available water will be evaporated when the available energy is given budyko 1974 greve et al 2015 the parameter in the budyko framework represents the catchment characteristics which is reflected by the integrated effect of topographic controls shao et al 2012 soil properties donohue et al 2012 vegetation li et al 2013 wang and tang 2014 climatic seasonality characteristics milly 1994 streamflow regimes trancoso et al 2016 as well as relative area of ecological restoration irrigation and cultivation liang et al 2015 xing et al 2018a using the twsa amplitude as a fraction of precipitation fang et al 2016 examined the physical significance of twsa and improved the accuracy of budyko curve based estimates however all previous findings are based on the statistics of spatially distributed catchments data at the mean annual scale our present work examines the physical significance of grace derived δtws on the budyko e model extension at the monthly scale fig 6 shows that at the mean annual scale the budyko parameter ω ranged from 1 13 qilian catchment to 4 20 xiangshuibao catchment meanwhile at the monthly scale the largest ω value 6 46 occurred in april in hankou catchment and the lowest ω value 1 03 occurred in february in qilian catchment see fig 7 apparently the parameter ω of the budyko e model at different temporal scales are very different this phenomenon is not strange as many previous studies have pointed out that the effects of climatic seasonality on water balances and the importance of land use cover soil properties and topography in modulating these impacts at different temporal and spatial scales e g milly 1994 yokoo et al 2008 wang et al 2016 by incorporating dynamic ecohydrological processes into the steady state budyko model liu et al 2016 assessed the impacts of vegetation on the water balance in a temperate water limited basin and they found this way can improve the estimation of inter annual variability of the regional water balance therefore seasonality of p and e 0 or other factors e g vegetation evolution which maybe the possible causes for the variations in the mean monthly budyko parameter ω should be further investigated in future study 5 3 uncertainties in monthly budyko type e model e is difficult to measure at regional and basin scales for it links to earth s water energy and carbon cycles rodell 2004 based on a nonlinear relationship and constrained by physical limits the budyko framework has wide applications in e g assessing r or e changes at catchment roderick and farquhar 2011 van der velde et al 2013 xing et al 2018b and predicting water availability or mean annual e in ungauged basins blöschl et al 2013 xu et al 2013 greve et al 2015 however as the budyko framework is developed based on the assumption of negligible human impacts on the hydrologic cycle of a watershed the budyko model should not be applied to the watershed with huge area likely affected by anthropogenic factors in this paper the areas of 24 selected catchments are from 2 452 to 1 488 036 km2 see fig 2 and table 1 the hydrologic cycles in majority of catchments might be affected by both climate variability and human activities grace satellite mission which provides monthly twsa over a region tapley et al 2004 has been widely used in model calibration and testing niu et al 2014 and quantification of hydrologic responses to droughts and anthropogenic activities huang et al 2015 further some studies have estimated monthly e from water balance equation which is obtained as residuals of terrestrial water storage changes derived from grace e g rodell 2004 ramillien et al 2006 rodell et al 2011 xue et al 2013 syed et al 2014 billah et al 2015 however although e estimates by the water balance equation with monthly grace derived δtws have been recorded in many researches grace satellites serve information on changes in the earth s gravity field which are primarily controlled by horizontal and vertical variations in water distribution and are usually used to derive δtws at a spatial resolution of more than 200 000 km2 long et al 2014a felfelani et al 2017 in this paper the areas of catchments we selected vary from 2452 to 1 488 036 km2 see fig 2 and table 1 with only four catchments i e accounting 25 of all 24 selected catchments having the areas of over 20 000 km2 downscaling method and bias correction were employed to obtain a resolution of 0 25 0 25 grid δtws data the reference hydro climatic variables were obtained from gldas 2 and the adjusted δtws was evaluated by the water balance method at the mean annual scale see fig 3 further using a scaling factor monthly e was scaled proportionally and the annual e values obtained from the scaled monthly e were consistent with the e values directly calculated by eq 1 therefore we conclude that the grace derived δtws can effectively simulate the actual δtws across these study catchments however the performance of grace derived δtws at a spatial resolution of less than 200 000 km2 has not been systematically evaluated using the observation as the uncertainty and biases from the grace satellite data and gldas 2 product may result the unrealistic δtws and reduce the performance of the extended monthly budyko e model similar with the streamflow observation grace satellite mission provides the horizontal and vertical variations of tws caused by both climate variability and human activities reager and famiglietti 2013 felfelani et al 2017 that is as a key inputs of the monthly budyko type e model both grace e and budyko model likely suffer from their intrinsic uncertainties overall human induced tws variations are usually evaluated by calculating the difference between grace that includes the anthropogenic factors and hydrological models which simulate only the climate variability part huang et al 2015 pan et al 2016 some studies have used grace derived tws variations and surface water storage variations to obtain groundwater storage change in aquifer systems however the δtws from grace changed mostly due to human induced groundwater storage change in some regions rodell et al 2009 famiglietti et al 2011 and due to climatic events such as droughts or other specific climate variability in some other regions scanlon et al 2015 russo and lall 2017 therefore hydrological models with physical processes or other reliable observed data are required to partition the total e and or tws into separate components i e surface water soil moisture groundwater storage and snow with different causes the natural and human induced changes one parameter was employed to drive the monthly budyko type e model by using a method similar to that of zhang et al 2008 for water balance modeling over four temporal scales including mean annual annual monthly and daily in our study the one parameter e model based on budyko framework and grace data was developed to estimate the regional e at the monthly scale the budyko e represented the grace e well across the 24 selected catchments with both modeled e volumes and hydrograph shapes which were also consistent with grace e series except some underestimation for peak e fig 8 this finding is coincident with the result by chen et al 2013 which pointed out that the performance of seasonal budyko model in wet seasons was better than that in dry seasons comparing with four global e products i e gldas e modis e jra e and zhang e the one parameter budyko type e showed the best performance fig 10 and is quite acceptable for prediction for ungauged basins despite that the budyko e model represented the grace e well across the arid and semi arid catchments of china the simulated monthly e did not perform the grace derived e so well across the humid and semi humid catchments figs 8 and 9 nevertheless using e from the water balance method as the benchmark values the one parameter e model showed the best performance in reproducing e comparing with the other four e products it can be concluded that the use of budyko model provides a consistent framework for the modeling of different processes with a simple model structure 6 conclusions based on the budyko framework and grace derived δtws datasets this study developed a one parameter monthly e model to estimate regional e and applied it to the selected 24 catchments china the temporal changing characteristics of annual and monthly p r e 0 and δtws were evaluated first furthermore using grace e as the benchmark values the budyko e was evaluated by comparing with four global e products including gldas e modis e jra e and zhang e for the majority of 24 catchments there were not statistically significant trends in p e 0 r and δtws as there were no severe natural climate variabilities and indirect human impacts although δtws values were considerably small compared with the mean annual p and r values but the δtws occupied a large proportion in the partitioning of p into r e at the monthly scale and therefore should be considered in the hydrological process simulation the budyko simulated monthly e represented the grace e across the 24 selected catchments well with both simulated e volumes and hydrograph shape being consistent with grace e series except some underestimation for peak e in july and august among these catchments the budyko e best represented grace e across shixiali catchment located the hai river basin with the r nsce and re between observed e and simulated results being 0 996 0 988 0 033 in calibration and 0 994 0 951 0 111 in validation all the existing e products did not represent grace e of the 24 selected catchments well and the modis e showed the poorest performance in reproducing regional e while gldas e was the best of four e products at reproducing monthly variations with relatively high r and nsce small re the preferable performance of budyko e model further confirms its broad application in different climatic regions and the extended budyko framework combined with water storage data provides a new way for evaluating monthly e and water resources in

enhances the hydrological performance of both satellite products nse 0 856 for imerg and nse 0 840 for 3b42v7 additionally the gauge benchmarked gxaj model with 3b42v7 has limited hydrological skill

the simulations of two out of three flood events and the nse skill cores of imerg 0 581 0 901 and 3b42v7 0 795 to 0 852 are relatively lower than that of the gauge based simulation 0 753 0 969 but comparable overall the imerg and 3b43v7 satellite precipitation products can be adopted as reliable precipitation sources for hydrological simulations at daily and sub daily time scales in the study area with imerg better suited than 3b42v7 considering that the low cc values exist in both imerg and 3b42v7 products in particular at a sub daily temporal scale the gpm research community should further improve the calibration algorithms and enhance the quality of imerg products in yrsr performing bias correction of satellite precipitation products is also necessary for hydrological modelers to effectively improve their hydrological utilities keywords gpm imerg trmm tmpa satellite precipitation streamflow simulations xinanjiang hydrological model 1 introduction precipitation is one of the key variables in the hydrological cycle accurate precipitation inputs are important to hydrological models for rationally simulating the hydrological processes at the regional and basin scales hydrological simulations and predictions are no doubt a challenging task over regions without or with sparse precipitation gauge networks particularly in remote basins with complex terrain xue et al 2013b known as the cradle of chinese civilization the yellow river is the second longest river in china which supports 30 of the total population of the country and 13 of the total cultivated area zheng et al 2009 the yellow river source region yrsr is located in the northeast qinghai tibet plateau with a mean altitude of approximately 4000 m above sea level fig 1 as the water tower of the yellow river yrsr occupies 15 of the total area of the river basin but contributes approximately 35 of the total annual discharge hu et al 2011 the existing rain gauge network managed by the chinese meteorological administration cma due to the harsh environment is very sparse with a density of 1 station per 1 1 grid leading to significant difficulties for the accurate hydrological prediction and rational water resources management and operation liu et al 2017 xue et al 2013a recently satellite precipitation products such as the climate precipitation center morphing method cmorph joyce et al 2004 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network hsu et al 1997 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg hou et al 2014 have been available to the public these satellite precipitation products generally have high spatiotemporal resolutions finer than 0 25 spatial resolution and shorter than the daily temporal interval with a wide quasi global coverage broader than the 50 n 50 s latitude band wang et al 2017c and provide hydrologists with an alternative to precipitation data sources for hydrological studies in data sparse or ungauged basins among the released satellite precipitation products the tmpa precipitation estimate is regarded as one of the most reliable and extensively used products tong et al 2014 su et al 2008 the tmpa products are developed by the goddard space flight center at the national aeronautics and space administration and provide precipitation estimates from multiple satellites via a calibration based sequential scheme and monthly gauge analyses where feasible with a high spatiotemporal resolution 0 25 0 25 and 3 hourly interval and a quasi global coverage of 50 n 50 s huffman et al 2007 their post real time products versions 6 and 7 hereafter referred to as 3b42v6 and 3b42v7 have been extensively validated against ground precipitation observations and used for hydrological applications such as hydrological simulation disaster forecasting and water resources management su et al 2008 yong et al 2010 behrangi et al 2011 samaniego et al 2011 yong et al 2012 jiang et al 2012 nikolopoulos et al 2012 tarnavsky et al 2013 thiemig et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2013 xue et al 2013b behrangi et al 2014 tong et al 2014 zulkafli et al 2014 tuo et al 2016 ciabatta et al 2016 kim et al 2016 most relevant studies have demonstrated that 3b42v6 and 3b42v7 have acceptable or even satisfactory quality and hydrological utility in several parts of the world su et al 2008 yong et al 2010 behrangi et al 2011 samaniego et al 2011 nikolopoulos et al 2012 thiemig et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2013 xue et al 2013b behrangi et al 2014 tong et al 2014 zulkafli et al 2014 ciabatta et al 2016 kim et al 2016 in yrsr meng et al 2014 found that 3b42v6 is able to capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation at daily time scale hao et al 2014 evaluated the quality of 3b42v7 and three tmpa near real time products 3b42rt versions 5 6 and 7 on the basis of the verification of the cma ground precipitation data they found that 3b42v7 is significantly superior to these three near real time products jiang et al 2016 compared four satellite precipitation products and concluded that 3b42v7 and cmorph adj adjustment with ground precipitation observations perform better than their near real time products 3b42rt and cmorph su et al 2017 found that despite a light precipitation underestimation in the western mountains and a mild overestimation in the southeast 3b42v7 exhibits satisfactory performance in capturing the spatial distribution of daily average precipitation moreover the hydrological ability of tmpa products has been evaluated in yrsr recently meng et al 2014 tested the suitability of 3b42v6 in daily and monthly streamflow simulations via the coupled routing and excess storage crest hydrological model they demonstrated that 3b42v6 has a slightly inferior hydrological performance relative to the gauge based simulation hao et al 2014 reported that with the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model 3b42v7 exhibits plausible performance in daily discharge simulations whereas 3b42rt versions 5 7 products have considerably poor hydrological prediction capabilities similar to hao et al 2014 su et al 2017 used the vic model for daily streamflow simulations and the performance of the 3b42v7 based simulation with the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse of 0 83 was found to be comparable with that of the gauge based model run nse 0 90 however 3b42v7 overrates the high peak discharges and exhibits poorly in the simulation of the flood event in 2012 although the trmm mission ended on april 8 2015 tmpa products will continue to be produced in parallel with the new gpm mission until early 2018 as the successor of trmm the gpm mission officially launched in february 2014 comprises an international satellite constellation that provides global precipitation estimates with significant improvements in spatiotemporal resolution in comparison with current tmpa products the newly released imerg huffman et al 2015 obtains global precipitation estimates at fine spatiotemporal scales 0 1 0 1 and 30 min interval with further expansive quasi global coverage 60 n 60 s several initial studies have been conducted to evaluate the imerg precipitation product against the ground precipitation observations and most of them reported that imerg products generally outperform tmpa in several regions such as the usa tan et al 2017 the mekong river basin wang et al 2017b he et al 2017 west and east africa dezfuli et al 2017 india prakash et al 2016 iran sharifi et al 2016 siuki et al 2017 south korea kim et al 2017 japan kim et al 2017 mainland china tang et al 2016a guo et al 2016 the xinjiang region chen and li 2016 the qinghai tibet plateau chen and li 2016 ma et al 2016 xu et al 2017 the beijiang river basin wang et al 2017c and the coastal region wang et al 2017a of china in yrsr ma et al 2016 and tang et al 2016a reported that imerg shows an appreciably better performance than 3b42v7 at both sub daily and daily time scales however considering that imerg was released only four years ago few studies have focused on the hydrological utilities of imerg products at basin scales such as the ganjiang tang et al 2016b li et al 2017 and beijiang river basins wang et al 2017c in china the upper mekong river basin he et al 2017 the peruvian ecuadorian amazon basin zubieta et al 2017 the chindwin river basin in myanmar yuan et al 2017 and an urbanizing arid catchment in saudi arabia sharif et al 2017 most of these studies demonstrated that imerg has comparable hydrological utilities with tmpa standard products or even outperforms tmpa tang et al 2016b he et al 2017 zubieta et al 2017 wang et al 2017c nevertheless to the best of our knowledge the hydrological evaluation of imerg in yrsr has not yet been reported in addition most relevant studies in other regions evaluated the hydrological utility of imerg mainly at a daily time scale while imerg products with precipitation estimates in fine spatiotemporal resolutions are expected to be able to capture precipitation dynamics at small scales and to be reliable data sources for flood monitoring and warning therefore the hydrological utilities of imerg products should further focus on the feasibility of hydrological simulations at sub daily temporal scales this study statistically evaluated the imerg final run version 05 v05 and tmpa 3b42v7 precipitation products against the ground precipitation observations in yrsr in china subsequently this study assessed the hydrological utility of these two satellite products via a hydrological model considering that imerg is in an early phase and its calibration algorithms still need to be refined the main goals of this study are the following 1 statistically assess and compare the accuracy of the gpm era imerg precipitation estimates with that of the trmm era 3b42v7 product at daily and 3 hourly time scales in the study area and 2 comprehensively investigate the hydrological utility of imerg products in simulating historical daily streamflow processes and flood events in comparison with 3b42v7 in yrsr this study is among the early attempts tang et al 2016a ma et al 2016 to assess the latest imerg product and its hydrological feasibility in the study area we expect that the findings reported in this paper can provide useful guidelines for hydrological applications of imerg data and can also promote the improvement of imerg products in future versions 2 study area and data preparation 2 1 study area in this study the yellow river source region yrsr was defined as the area controlled by the tangnaihai hydrological station fig 1 which is located on the northeast qinghai tibet plateau and has a total drainage area of 1 22 105 km2 15 of the entire yellow river basin the altitude varies between 2677 m and 6253 m and decreases from the southwest to the northeast fig 1 the study area is situated in a semiarid climate region characterized by the typical qinghai tibet plateau climate system the mean annual air temperature ranges between 4 c and 2 c with a distinct increase from the southeast to the northeast the basin averaged mean annual precipitation is approximately 530 mm and precipitation tends to decline from the southeast 800 mm a to the northwest 200 mm a hu et al 2011 largely influenced by the southwest monsoon from the bay of bengal precipitation mainly occurs from june to october and accounts for more than 75 of the annual precipitation hu et al 2011 snowfall is mainly concentrated from november to march as the water tower of the yellow river yrsr has an annual mean runoff of 168 mm representing 35 of the total runoff of the yellow river basin zheng et al 2009 runoff in the wet season june october accounts for 70 of the annual total runoff zheng et al 2009 hu et al 2011 the basin is dominated by temperate and alpine grasslands and meadows and permanent snowpack and glaciers exist in the southern animaqing bayankala and northern qilian mountains yuan et al 2015 this region has a low population density with a total of approximately half a million inhabitants yuan et al 2015 neither large reservoirs nor large irrigation projects exist in this area therefore this study region is subject to minimal human activity and is regarded as a relatively pristine area hu et al 2011 2 2 gauge based weather data fig 1 shows that the historical meteorological data of 13 automatic weather stations in the basin fig 1 were obtained from cma these data include hourly records of precipitation and air temperature from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 hourly precipitation is automatically recorded by siphoning or tipping bucket rain gauges all weather data have undergone strict quality control by cma including checks of extreme values internal consistency and spatial consistency ren et al 2010 among these 13 weather stations 11 stations are not included in the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc gridded gauge analysis precipitation data set except for the dari dr and maduo md stations to facilitate distributed streamflow simulations the inverse distance weighting method was used to interpolate the gauge based precipitation and air temperature data to the 0 25 spatial scale the precipitation interpolation disregarded the topographical effects whereas the near surface air temperature was assumed to decrease by 0 65 c per altitude increase of 100 m su and xie 2003 yuan et al 2017 2 3 satellite precipitation products two types of satellite precipitation products namely the tmpa 3b42v7 3 hourly and imerg final run v05 half hourly precipitation products were selected for this study 2 3 1 tmpa 3b42v7 the tmpa 3b42v7 precipitation products were generated by using the trmm tmpa version 7 algorithm huffman et al 2007 tmpa can retrieve microwave infrared satellite precipitation estimates with gauge adjustments and is able to produce rational precipitation estimates in a 0 25 spatial resolution with a quasi global coverage 50 s 50 n and a 3 hourly temporal interval in this study the trmm 3b42v7 3 hourly precipitation product from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 was acquired from the precipitation measurement mission pmm website https pmm nasa gov data access downloads trmm as the local time in the study area is 8 h ahead of the universal time coordinated utc the 3b42v7 3 hourly precipitation product was converted to the precipitation estimates in accordance with the local time using the approach suggested by yuan et al 2017 furthermore the 3b42v7 3 hourly precipitation data were accumulated to daily values in accordance with the time span of the local daily precipitation collection 08 00 08 00 utc 08 00 for daily streamflow simulations 2 3 2 imerg final run v05 imerg is the level 3 precipitation estimation algorithm of gpm and is intended to inter calibrate merge and interpolate multiple satellite microwave precipitation estimates this algorithm is combined with precipitation gauge analyses microwave calibrated infrared satellite estimates and other precipitation estimators on a finer spatial resolution 0 1 with a greater coverage 60 s 60 n and a shorter time interval 30 min than those of tmpa products in this study the imerg final run v05 half hourly precipitation product from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 was obtained from the pmm website https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm to produce the imerg precipitation at a 3 hourly interval the precipitation values in the consecutive six half hourly imerg files were accumulated and the time difference between local time and utc 8 h was considered moreover the half hourly imerg data were accumulated to daily precipitation estimates to perform hydrological simulations on a spatial resolution of 0 25 the imerg precipitation product was aggregated from a 0 1 spatial resolution to 0 25 considering that four imerg grid cells are completely situated within a 0 25 grid cell four fall halfway inside and a ninth falls one quarter inside the areal weights for these imerg grid cells were assigned as 0 16 0 08 and 0 04 for precipitation aggregation respectively yuan et al 2017 2 4 discharge data the observed discharge data at the tangnaihai hydrological station fig 1 were collected from the ministry of water resources china the discharge data include the daily discharge records from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 and the flood data of three flood events september 8 october 12 2014 june 23 july 23 2015 and october 12 27 2016 the time span of the local daily discharge measurement is 08 00 08 00 utc 08 00 the time interval of the flood event data varies from 6 min to 12 h thus the linear interpolation method was used to transform the flood data into 3 hourly temporal intervals these historical streamflow data were adopted for the calibration of hydrological models 3 methodology 3 1 diagnostic statistics for evaluating satellite precipitation products on the basis of the gauge based precipitation data set the qualities of imerg and 3b42v7 satellite precipitation products were evaluated at grid and basin spatial scales first the imerg and 3b42v7 precipitation estimates at the grid cells where the weather stations are located were compared with the corresponding on site precipitation observations from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 second the basin averaged satellite precipitation time series were quantitatively assessed against the gauge based time series the evaluations were conducted at daily and 3 hourly time scales several widely used diagnostic statistics were adopted in this study the relative bias bias pearson correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were calculated in accordance with the formulas shown in table 1 bias denotes the systematic deviation rate between the satellite and gauge based precipitation cc represents the agreement between the satellite precipitation estimates and gauge observations rmse measures the average absolute error of the satellite precipitation pod which is also known as the hit rate represents the fraction of precipitation events correctly detected by the satellite among all real precipitation events far describes the fraction of false events among all the events detected by the satellite csi denotes the overall fraction of precipitation events correctly detected by the satellite 3 2 grid based xinanjiang model and hydrological simulation schemes the xinanjiang xaj model is a lumped conceptual hydrological model zhao 1992 that is broadly applied to humid and semi humid watersheds in china for flood forecasting water resources evaluation and accounting design for water quality in this study the modified version of the xaj model the grid based xaj gxaj model yuan and ren 2004 yuan et al 2005 was adopted for hydrological simulations the gxaj model simulates hydrological processes on a grid cell basis with spatially distributed atmospheric forcing data this model adopts the snow module of the hbv model bergström 1995 to calculate the snowmelt process in each grid cell through the degree day method and uses the three soil layer evapotranspiration et and saturation excess runoff schemes of the lumped xaj model zhao 1992 for actual et and runoff calculations in each grid cell for hillslope runoff concentration and streamflow routing the gxaj model adopts 1 a gravitational water reservoir with bottom and side outlets to divide the calculated total runoff into surface interflow and groundwater runoffs 2 three linear reservoirs to describe the hillslope concentration of the three runoff components in each grid cell and 3 the muskingum routing method to represent the routing effect of the river channel system connecting each grid cell the gxaj model uses gridded precipitation and potential et pe as its forcing data the daily minimum and maximum air temperature data are used to calculate the daily pe through the air temperature based hargreaves method hargreaves and samni 1982 for flood event simulations the gxaj model uses a sinusoidal function to disaggregate the daily pe into the pe values at short time intervals the gxaj model has 18 parameters in total including 3 parameters for the snow module 8 for et and runoff calculations and 7 for hillslope runoff concentration and streamflow routing the parameter values are defined to be spatially uniform in this study yrsr was divided into 250 grid cells with a 0 25 resolution three precipitation data sets were produced the gauge based gridded imerg and 3b42v7 satellite precipitation products with a 0 25 resolution these three precipitation data sets were used to drive the gxaj model to perform historical daily streamflow simulations at the tangnaihai hydrological station from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 moreover the gxaj model was used to simulate three historical flood events event i september 8 october 12 2014 event ii june 23 july 23 2015 and event iii october 12 27 2016 at a 3 hourly time interval two hydrological simulation schemes were conducted i the model parameters were calibrated by fitting the calculated streamflow time series against the observed data by using the gauge based precipitation data the gxaj model was replaced by the satellite precipitation data sets to perform daily streamflow and flood event simulations using the gauge calibrated model parameters this scheme is widely applied for hydrological simulations over gauged basins xue et al 2013b ii the model parameters were independently calibrated using the satellite precipitation data sets the product specific parameters were adopted to conduct streamflow simulations which is an alternative for hydrological applications in ungauged basins where only satellite precipitation products are available xue et al 2013b for daily streamflow simulations the calibration period was april 1 2014 to december 31 2015 and the validation period was january 1 2016 to december 31 2016 for flood event simulations the time spans of events i and ii were selected as the calibration period and the time period of event iii was used as the validation period considering that no snow cover data are available in the study area the three parameters in the snow module such as the degree day factor threshold temperature above which precipitation is rain and threshold temperature above which the snowmelt process begins were assigned a priori as 4 mm d 1 c 1 3 3 c and 0 c respectively bergström 1995 the other model parameters were calibrated with the aid of the shuffled complex evolution sce ua automatic optimization method duan et al 1992 duan et al 1993 although the maximum of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse is a commonly used objective function for hydrological model optimization it tends to provide high importance to high flows and the optimized model may not accurately capture low flow processes to search the model parameters that can comprehensively characterize both high and low flow processes we used the maximum sum of nse and log transformed nse lognse as the objective function which is given by 1 f max nse max lognse 2 nse 1 i 1 n q i s q i o 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 3 lognse 1 i 1 n log q i s log q i o 2 i 1 n log q i o log q o 2 where n is the sample size of the observed or calculated streamflow time series q i o and q i s represent the observed and calculated streamflow time series m3 s respectively and q o and log q o denote the mean observed streamflow and mean log transformed observed streamflow m3 s respectively in each simulation scheme the three sets of simulated streamflow time series using different precipitation inputs were compared with the observations to assess the hydrologic utility of the imerg and 3b42v7 products in the study area the performance of the daily streamflow simulations was evaluated using four statistical indices bias nse lognse and rmse for flood event simulations five diagnostic statistics were selected bias for runoff volume biasv nse rmse and bias for peak flow biasp and flood peak time error pte to minimize the effects of initial conditions on flood event simulations we assigned the initial snow pack depth tension water storage depths at three soil layers free water storage depth surface runoff interflow and groundwater runoff in the three linear reservoirs as the values that were calculated in the daily streamflow simulations on the date when the flood events started 4 results 4 1 evaluation of satellite precipitation products to further understand the impact of different satellite precipitation inputs on discharge simulations in the study area the qualities of the imerg and 3b42v7 satellite precipitation products were evaluated against the in situ rain gauge observations over the time span from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 such evaluations were conducted in terms of the spatial pattern of precipitation precipitation at gauge located grid cells and basin averaged precipitation 4 1 1 spatial pattern fig 2 demonstrates the spatial pattern of the gauge imerg and 3b42v7 based precipitation estimates from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 in yrsr the two satellite precipitation products show a spatial pattern similar to that of the gauge based gridded precipitation data set precipitation tends to increase from the northwest to the southeast the lowest total precipitation amount generally appears in the northwestern part of the watershed reaching 737 7 mm for imerg and 826 8 mm for 3b42v7 the amount of maximum total precipitation occurs in the southeastern grid cells of the basin with 2464 4 mm for imerg and 2488 4 mm for 3b42v7 although both satellite products represent a similar trend imerg shows a slightly drier situation in the west and a mildly wetter pattern in the east of the watershed than 3b42v7 fig 2 in addition imerg can represent more detailed spatial features of precipitation than 3b42v7 fig 2 because imerg estimates precipitation at a considerably finer resolution than 3b42v7 4 1 2 precipitation at gauge located grid cells the daily precipitation estimates from imerg and 3b42v7 at the locations of the 11 non gpcc rain gauges and two gpcc stations were derived and compared with the gauge based precipitation fig 3 a shows that the bias values of both satellite products at most weather stations are within the range of 10 to 10 except that imerg considerably overestimates precipitation at the mq station by 14 3 and 3b42v7 presents a moderate underestimation 17 0 at the hn station the cc values of both products are considerably low ranging from 0 226 to 0 461 between the imerg estimates and observations averaged cc 0 327 and from 0 194 to 0 373 for the 3b42v7 estimates against the gauge based precipitation averaged cc 0 287 in terms of rmse imerg has slightly smaller errors averaged rmse 4 85 mm than 3b42v7 averaged rmse 5 09 mm at most stations fig 3a with regard to the contingency of satellite precipitation estimates on the daily temporal scale the pod values are low at all the weather stations ranging from 0 149 to 0 246 for imerg averaged pod 0 165 and from 0 148 to 0 198 for 3b42v7 averaged pod 0 157 additionally fig 3a denotes that both imerg and 3b42v7 products have large far 0 399 and 0 396 respectively and small csi 0 148 and 0 142 respectively values implying considerable errors in the two satellite products among the 13 weather stations the dr and md stations are included in gpcc fig 3a shows that at these two stations both imerg and 3b42v7 present a relatively low systematic deviation from the gauge observations bias 3 5 and 1 2 respectively but obtain similar magnitudes of other diagnostic statistics to those at the non gpcc stations the reason is that both the imerg final run and 3b42v7 products are bias corrected using the gpcc precipitation data set on a monthly basis this condition is able to effectively reduce the systematic errors of satellite precipitation estimates at the grid cells where gpcc stations are located but may not improve other diagnostic statistics on time steps shorter than 1 month furthermore a comparison of the mean values of all the diagnostic statistics fig 3a demonstrates that imerg is generally slightly superior to 3b42v7 in daily precipitation estimation except that imerg has a mildly higher mean far value than 3b42v7 fig 3b presents the statistical indices of imerg and 3b42v7 precipitation estimates at the 11 non gpcc weather stations and two gpcc stations at a 3 hourly time scale the figure shows that the 3 hourly precipitation estimates from imerg and 3b42v7 are at the same magnitudes of bias as the daily estimates the cc values on the 3 hourly temporal scale are considerably lower than those on the daily scale and imerg provides a slightly higher cc than 3b42v7 at 10 stations the rmse values of imerg are slightly lower than those of 3b42v7 at 11 out of the 13 stations moreover compared with the daily precipitation estimates the two 3 hourly satellite products have considerably lower pod and csi values and considerably higher magnitudes of far this result implies that at the 3 hourly time scale both imerg and 3b42v7 are poor in detecting precipitation events and have considerably higher false alarm ratios the frequency distributions of daily and 3 hourly precipitation at different precipitation intensity levels were analyzed at the grid cells where the 11 non gpcc weather stations are situated fig 4 fig 4a indicates that approximately 62 0 of the observed daily precipitation is under 0 1 mm the imerg products have a slight underestimation of 3 6 and 3b42v7 presents a mild overestimation by 2 3 for daily precipitation ranging from 0 1 mm to 10 mm imerg provides an overestimation by 4 1 and 3b42v7 shows a minor underestimation of 2 1 both imerg and 3b42v7 estimate a slightly lower occurrence frequency of daily precipitation events at the range of 10 20 mm than the ground observations by contrast imerg and 3b42v7 produce a slight overestimation of 0 23 and 0 51 for daily precipitation between 20 mm and 50 mm in the case of daily precipitation exceeding 50 mm imerg slightly overestimates the occurrence frequency by 0 01 and 3b42v7 presents a minor underestimation of 0 03 in general compared with the frequency distribution of 3b42v7 the frequency distribution of imerg is relatively closer to that of the observations similarly for the 3 hourly precipitation the frequency distribution of imerg is in a slightly better agreement with the observations than that of 3b42v7 fig 4b overall a comparison of the diagnostic statistics fig 3 and precipitation frequency distributions fig 4 shows that both satellite products generally obtain similar performance in daily and 3 hourly precipitation estimations at most weather stations in the study area with imerg slightly outperforming 3b42v7 4 1 3 basin averaged precipitation the basin averaged daily and 3 hourly precipitation estimates from imerg and 3b42v7 were evaluated against the gauge based time series table 2 shows that imerg slightly underestimates the basin averaged precipitation by 3 6 and 3b42v7 presents a minor underestimation of 1 8 at both the daily and 3 hourly temporal scales the rmse values from imerg are modestly lower than those from 3b42v7 although both imerg and 3b42v7 have a low correlation with the ground precipitation at the grid scale the cc values of both products clearly increase at the basin scale with those of imerg 0 524 and 0 119 slightly higher than those of 3b42v7 0 458 and 0 094 at both the daily and 3 hourly time steps in addition the non exceedance frequency distributions of the basin averaged precipitation estimates from the three precipitation data sets were compared at the daily and 3 hourly temporal scales fig 5 a shows that both the imerg and 3b42v7 based daily precipitation frequency distributions match the gauge based precipitation with imerg in a noticeable underestimation in the daily precipitation quantile range of 99 7 99 9 and 3b42v7 in a significant overestimation at the 96 99 7 quantile level although both satellite products are in fairly good agreement with the gauge based frequency distribution at the 3 hourly temporal scale imerg slightly underestimates the basin averaged precipitation at the intermediate quantile level 75 95 and presents a minor overestimation of the extreme heavy precipitation 99 6 quantile level fig 5b similarly 3b42v7 presents a minor underestimation at the intermediate quantile level and a significant overestimation of the high precipitation quantiles 96 quantile level fig 5b table 2 and fig 5 indicate that imerg generally provides slightly more accurate daily and 3 hourly precipitation estimates than 3b42v7 at the basin scale 4 2 evaluation of hydrological simulations the gxaj model driven by the gauge imerg and 3b42v7 based precipitation data sets was used to perform daily streamflow simulations from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 and to simulate the three historical flood events at the tangnaihai hydrological station the simulated streamflow using the three different precipitation inputs was compared with the observed streamflow to evaluate the hydrological utility of satellite precipitation products 4 2 1 daily streamflow simulations fig 6 depicts the daily hydrographs at the tangnaihai station that were simulated using the three different precipitation inputs the figure demonstrates that the simulated streamflow forced by rain gauge data agrees well with the observations in the calibration period april 1 2014 to december 31 2015 displaying a minor negative bias of 5 1 and high values of nse and lognse 0 897 and 0 905 respectively table 3 when the calibrated model was subsequently validated for the period from january 1 2016 to december 31 2016 the modeling performance deteriorates with a significant runoff overestimation of 29 7 and relatively low nse and lognse 0 232 and 0 709 respectively table 3 this phenomenon has two possible reasons on the one hand the gridded precipitation data set that was derived from 13 rain gauges in this study might not sufficiently capture the spatiotemporal variation of precipitation in the yrsr in 2016 the underlying large errors in the precipitation input were able to propagate in streamflow simulations on the other hand the observed mean daily discharge in the calibration period is 605 1 m3 s whereas that in the validation period is 28 7 less 431 5 m3 s the model parameters that were calibrated in these relatively wet conditions might not adequately denote the hydrological features in dry years potentially influencing the simulation performance the gauge benchmarked gxaj model was forced by the imerg and 3b42v7 products for daily streamflow simulations for the period from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 fig 6a and table 3 indicate that the imerg and 3b42v7 based simulated daily hydrographs are in line with the measured hydrograph except for a considerable discharge overestimation in the wet season of 2016 moreover the diagnostic indices of scheme i in table 3 demonstrate that in the calibration period both the imerg and 3b42v7 forced daily streamflow simulations are in general slightly less accurate than that driven by the gauge based precipitation input but the performance of the imerg based simulation in the validation period even surpasses the model run using the gauge based precipitation data set for the entire simulation period the imerg based simulation gains a comparable skill score nse 0 810 and lognse 0 872 with the gauge based simulation nse 0 807 and lognse 0 845 and the performance of the 3b42v7 forced model run is acceptable nse 0 729 and lognse 0 786 table 3 a comparison of the discharge duration curves fig 7 a indicates that the three simulations using the gauge imerg and 3b42v7 based data sets generate the daily discharge frequency distributions that agree with the observed data nevertheless triggered by the considerable errors in precipitation inputs and the uncertainties of the hydrological model structure and parameters all the three simulation runs considerably overestimate the low flow quantiles 10 and present a slight overestimation of daily discharge at the quantile level of 50 96 the 3b42v7 forced simulation remarkably overestimates the 97 high flow quantiles and the gauge and imerg based runs significantly underestimate the high flow quantiles 96 fig 7a on the basis of the rmse statistics shown in fig 7a the gauge imerg and 3b42v7 based model runs rank first to third in terms of the performance of matching the observed discharge duration curve to further evaluate the hydrological abilities of the imerg and 3b42v7 products the gxaj model was recalibrated and validated with imerg and 3b42v7 for the same periods as scheme i fig 6b shows that the recalibration effectively improves both the imerg and 3b42v7 based simulations the statistical indices of scheme ii table 3 indicate that the recalibration in general reduces the bias values and improves nse lognse and rmse for both the calibration and validation periods notably model recalibration increases nse and lognse in the entire simulation period to 0 856 and 0 875 in the imerg based simulation and to 0 840 and 0 849 in the 3b42v7 driven case respectively exceeding those of the gauge forced model run 0 807 and 0 845 for nse and lognse respectively moreover the product specific recalibration also improves the discharge duration curves fig 7b the 3b42v7 and imerg driven simulations in particular produce slightly more precise discharge duration curves than the gauge based simulation in terms of rmse fig 7b these findings imply that the gauge based gridded precipitation data set due to the sparse precipitation gauging network may not sufficiently capture the spatiotemporal variation patterns of precipitation in the study area which would potentially influence its hydrological applicability in streamflow simulation it also reflects that the imerg and 3b43v7 satellite precipitation products can be adopted as reliable precipitation sources for rational daily streamflow simulations in yrsr overall as the successor of 3b42v7 imerg is able to provide improved daily precipitation estimates in yrsr as a result the gxaj model with these two satellite precipitation inputs can produce satisfactory daily streamflow simulations and the hydrological capability of imerg is improved 4 2 2 flood event simulations fig 8 shows the observed and simulated 3 hourly hydrographs of three historical flood events at the tangnaihai streamflow station using the gauge imerg and 3b42v7 based precipitation data inputs the hydrological performance is quantified by biasv nse rmse biasp and pte as shown in table 4 fig 8a c and table 4 demonstrate that the gxaj model with the gauge based precipitation input effectively replicates the two flood events events i and ii for calibration with nse values of 0 969 and 0 876 but its hydrological performance is comparatively low in event iii for validation nse 0 753 with a large flow overestimation in the flood rising stage besides the possible errors in the gridded precipitation data set and calibrated parameters that might influence the hydrological performance the initial conditions are non negligible impact factors reducing the initial soil storage may effectively lower the streamflow during the flood rising stage and further improve the general performance for event iii however this arbitrary adjustment of initial conditions to achieve a good fitting of the simulated hydrograph against the observed may to a large extent increase the uncertainty of flood simulations to reduce this uncertainty this study adopted the calculated state variables in the daily streamflow simulation at the date when a flood event started as the initial conditions for flood simulations forced by imerg and 3b42v7 the gxaj model with the gauge based parameters was used for flood event simulations fig 8a c and table 4 show that the simulations with 3b42v7 significantly overestimate the total streamflow of events i and ii by 16 2 and 20 5 respectively and present a minor underestimation of 7 2 in event iii the imerg based streamflow time series have smaller systematic errors than those of 3b42v7 with biasv values of 0 3 11 5 and 0 9 for events i ii and iii respectively table 4 the 3b42v7 based simulations obtain nse values of 0 777 0 702 and rmse values of 86 0 646 0 m3 s for the three flood events and the imerg driven model presents significantly high nses 0 266 0 792 and low rmses 71 9 357 3 m3 s table 4 thus in terms of nse and rmse imerg apparently outperforms 3b42v7 however the imerg based simulations are still less accurate than the gauge based simulations for events i and ii only in event iii the performance of the imerg based simulation slightly surpasses that of the gauge based one additionally a comparison of the flood peak error statistics biasp and pte in table 4 indicates that the imerg and 3b42v7 forced simulations have poorer hydrological abilities for capturing flood peaks than the gauge based simulations overall the 3 hourly 3b42v7 forced flood model ranks third behind the gauge and imerg forced models with regard to the performance of flood event simulations in scheme i in the scheme ii scenario model recalibration significantly improves the simulations of events i and ii in the calibration period fig 8d and e and the skill core of the satellite precipitation driven model runs is relatively lower than that of the gauge based model but comparable the adjusted parameter sets not only effectively offset the systematic errors of the simulated streamflow in scheme i but also remarkably increase nse and generally reduce rmse biasp and pte table 4 for both events i and ii in these two events the performance of the imerg forced simulations still surpasses that of the 3b42v7 based ones however when the recalibrated model was driven to simulate event iii for validation the modeling performances based on imerg and 3b42v7 do not improve as expected and the 3b42v7 based simulation even worsens fig 8f one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that events i and ii are flood processes formed by heavy precipitation events approximately exceeding 80 mm whereas the watershed averaged precipitation in event iii is only approximately 20 mm thus the recalibrated model is likely to rationally represent the hydrological features of big floods but may not accurately replicate flood processes arising from moderate precipitation events another explanation is that small flood simulations are more sensitive to initial soil moisture estimates than major flood simulations section 3 3 states that the initial soil moisture storage for each flood event in this study was assigned as the value of the state soil water storage that was calculated in the daily streamflow simulations on the date when the flood event started the pe coefficient of the gxaj model in the 3b42v7 and imerg based simulations in scheme ii was recalibrated to be slightly higher than that in scheme i this condition would promote et and estimate a drier initial soil moisture storage than the situation in scheme i for event iii leading to the noticeable flow underestimation in the entire flood process in general both the imerg and 3b42v7 based model runs are able to reproduce historical flood events in schemes i and ii and imerg has a better hydrological performance than 3b42v7 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of imerg and 3b42v7 based on ground precipitation observations in this study the quality of the imerg final run v05 and 3b42v7 satellite precipitation products were evaluated against the ground precipitation observations on daily and 3 hourly temporal scales this study found that both satellite products have a similarly low level of correlation with the ground precipitation with mean cc values of 0 328 and 0 287 for imerg and 3b42v7 respectively at a daily temporal scale moreover as the temporal scale decreases from daily to 3 hourly time steps the correlation values between the satellite precipitation estimates and ground observations drop sharply cc 0 061 and 0 053 for imerg and 3b42v7 respectively indicating that both 3b42v7 and imerg are poor in terms of capturing precipitation dynamics at fine temporal scales in yrsr imerg in general obtains lower values of rmse than 3b42v7 on both daily and 3 hourly time scales and imerg generally contains smaller systematic errors than 3b42v7 fig 3 additionally imerg generally outperforms 3b42v7 in detecting precipitation events at different levels fig 4 overall imerg is generally superior to 3b42v7 on grid cell scales in yrsr ma et al 2016 conducted a similar analysis in the qinghai tibet plateau which includes yrsr they concluded that in the evaluation period of april 1 september 30 2014 imerg showed a slightly better performance than 3b42v7 in the upper yellow river basin which is similar to the findings of this study in table 5 we compared our findings with the existing studies that evaluated the performance of both the imerg and tmpa precipitation estimates most of the imerg and tmpa assessment and comparison studies were reported in south and east asia although a few recent studies performed the imerg assessment in other regions such as southern canada asong et al 2017 the netherlands gaona et al 2016 saudi arabia sharif et al 2017 mexico mayor et al 2017 and the upper blue nile asin sahlu et al 2016 these studies did not evaluate the tmpa precipitation products at the same time therefore these studies were not included in table 5 in terms of bias cc rmse and pod most previous studies ma et al 2016 tang et al 2016a libertino et al 2016 sharifi et al 2016 siuki et al 2017 kim et al 2017 xu et al 2017 wang et al 2017a wang et al 2017b wang et al 2017c zubieta et al 2017 proved that the imerg final run products are generally superior to their predecessor namely tmpa 3b42v7 or 3b43 in several regions of the world which are similar to the findings of this study no significant improvements were found in imerg only in singapore tan and duan 2017 the la plata head watershed in bolivia satgé et al 2017 the chindwin river basin in myanmar yuan et al 2017 and the ganjiang river basin in china tang et al 2016b and the 3b42v7 products even outperformed imerg at daily and or monthly time scales these regions where the poor performance of imerg was reported are mostly mountainous areas with complex terrains satgé et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 tang et al 2016b except for singapore satgé et al 2017 found that in the la plata head watershed in bolivia the imerg estimates are more affected by the large local relief and low rainfall intensities than 3b42v7 this case to some degree leads to a low cc and an increase in rmse of 18 in the imerg precipitation estimates in comparison with the 3b42v7 product although imerg precipitation estimates as expected have a slightly better quality than 3b42v7 in yrsr both satellite products still poorly correlate with the ground observations and have low pod and high far values in particular at the 3 hourly time scale fig 3 dominated by temperate and alpine grasslands alpine meadows permanent snowpack and glaciers in this study yrsr is also in large topographic relief with altitudes between 2677 m and 6253 m these complex topographic conditions might significantly influence the satellite precipitation retrieval and lead to large errors in satellite estimates the findings of this study and other relevant works strengthen the urgent need to further improve gpm algorithms particularly for mid latitude alpine regions with complex terrains imerg has an advantage over 3b42v7 in providing precipitation estimates on a considerably fine spatiotemporal resolution this study compares the accuracy of the imerg and 3b42v7 precipitation products therefore the 30 min imerg final run data set was aggregated to 3 hourly and daily intervals for comparison with 3b42v7 considering that the hourly ground precipitation observations are available in this study conducting the assessment of imerg precipitation estimates on temporal intervals of less than 3 h would be desirable moreover gauged based precipitation measurements are point observations on the ground whereas both 3b42v7 and imerg estimates are precipitation values averaged on 0 25 and 0 1 grid cells from space measurements respectively thus caution should be taken when comparing points to grid averages asong et al 2017 this study evaluated the performance of imerg and 3b42v7 products in estimating the basin averaged precipitation as well results show that although imerg has slightly larger systematic errors than 3b42v7 imerg estimates have slightly higher values of cc and lower values of rmse than 3b42v7 thus imerg generally provides more accurate daily and 3 hourly precipitation estimates than 3b42v7 at the basin scale this study used the gauge based basin averaged precipitation as the benchmark for assessment the spatiotemporal variation of the local precipitation should be complex due to the large topographic relief and complicated meteorological conditions using the precipitation records at a limited number of rain gauges 13 gauges in this study to represent the basin averaged precipitation is likely to produce large errors therefore the findings of the basin scale precipitation assessment should be regarded with caution located in the qinghai tibet plateau yrsr is snow prone during the cold season an evaluation of the gpm retrieved solid precipitation estimates against the ground snowfall observations must be conducted because the latest gpm core observatory sensors were designed to be capable of detecting solid precipitation in the cold season such an assessment was not fulfilled in this study due to the lack of snowfall observation sites in the yrsr ma et al 2016 evaluated the imerg solid precipitation estimates at a snowfall experimental site in the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau which is close to our study area they found that imerg correctly captured 4 out of the 16 snowfall days in 2014 although the probability of snowfall detection was not high 25 seeing that imerg has the potential to detect solid cold season precipitation is promising conducting the snowfall measurement and assessment of the imerg solid precipitation estimates over yrsr represents our ongoing work 5 2 hydrological evaluation of imerg and 3b42v7 and effects of parameter recalibration a few previous studies have focused on the hydrological utilities of imerg products in other basins in the world in the ganjiang river basin in china tang et al 2016a conducted an early hydrological assessment of the day 1 imerg final run product by using the crest hydrological model they found that the imerg product performs comparably with the gauge reference data in daily streamflow simulations and outperforms tmpa standard products in numerous cases li et al 2017 further evaluated the feasibility of imerg products in hourly streamflow simulations in the ganjiang river basin they demonstrated that the hourly crest model forced by imerg performs at barely acceptable levels whereas the model using the gauge and radar based data sets exhibits better performance in the beijiang river basin in china daily streamflow simulations using the vic model showed that the day 1 imerg final run product presents better hydrological performance than 3b42v7 wang et al 2017c over the upper mekong river basin imerg generally produces comparable daily streamflow simulations with 3b42v7 and even outperforms 3b42v7 when the xinanjiang hydrological model uses input specifically calibrated parameters he et al 2017 zubieta et al 2017 indicated that imerg is as useful as 3b42v7 and 3b42rt in modeling streamflows in southern regions of the peruvian ecuadorian amazon basin but these data sets fail to properly simulate streamflows in northern regions yuan et al 2017 found that imerg and 3b42v7 are both feasible in streamflow simulations in the chindwin river basin in myanmar with the 3b42v7 product being better suited than imerg most of the previous studies demonstrated that imerg has comparable hydrological utilities with tmpa standard products or even outperforms tmpa tang et al 2016b he et al 2017 zubieta et al 2017 wang et al 2017c similarly this study found that the imerg in yrsr generally has a better hydrological ability than 3b42v7 at daily and sub daily time scales in both the gauge benchmarked model and input specific recalibration schemes this finding reflects that imerg products have potential for hydrological applications such as flood simulation and warning in remote regions where local rain gauge networks are sparse this study found that driven by the imerg precipitation data sets the gauge benchmarked gxaj model produces slightly poorer daily and flood event simulations than the model run with the gauge based precipitation input relative to the imerg driven model run the 3b42v7 forced simulations have inferior performance considering that hydrological models are to some degree tolerant of the errors of precipitation inputs we recalibrated the gxaj model by using the imerg and 3b42v7 precipitation data sets to partially offset the streamflow biases resulting from inaccurate satellite precipitation inputs as a result the recalibrated gxaj model generally produces significantly improved simulations in terms of most of the statistical indices and discharge duration curves to analyze the effects of model recalibration on hydrological simulations we list the calibrated gxaj model parameter values in the daily streamflow simulations by using the gauge imerg and 3b42v7 based precipitation data sets table 6 among the gxaj model parameters k the coefficient of pe is a sensitive parameter to control the total runoff and a large k is inclined to produce a high actual et and thus generate a lower total runoff the imerg and 3b42v7 based daily streamflow simulation runs using the gauge based parameters overestimate the total runoff by 1 8 and 6 6 for the calibration period and 14 5 and 21 6 for the validation period table 3 respectively model recalibration effectively dampens the magnitude of systematic errors in the daily runoff for both the calibration and validation periods by increasing k from 0 611 to 0 677 in the 3b42v7 based run and 0 671 in the imerg based run tables 3 and 6 another sensitive parameter namely sm the areal mean free water storage capacity significantly controls the magnitude of high flow and a high sm usually generates low flood peaks forced by the 3b42v7 products the gauge benchmarked gxaj model tends to overestimate most high flows in daily streamflow simulations fig 6a arising from the considerable systematic overestimation of heavy rain events in 3b42v7 fig 5a the model recalibration partially compensates for the overestimation in high flows fig 6b by increasing sm from 58 198 mm to 69 125 mm in the 3b42v7 based runs in addition table 6 demonstrates that the imerg calibrated parameters deviate less from the gauge based parameter values than the 3b42v7 calibrated ones this result implies that the compensation effect of recalibration is less pronounced in imerg than in 3b42v7 this case probably results from the situation where imerg has a slightly better quality than 3b42v7 in yrsr xue et al 2013b found that tmpa 3b42v7 is generally improved compared with its predecessor 3b42v6 in the wangchu basin of bhutan consequently a more of evident recalibration effect appears in 3b42v6 compared with 3b42v7 although model recalibration is able to partly compensate for errors in the satellite precipitation forcing and thus effectively improves the imerg and 3b42v7 based streamflow simulations in yrsr the model parameters calibrated with biased input forcing data may not sufficiently characterize the hydrological features of a watershed thus the bias correction for satellite precipitation products is suggested to be conducted in particular in regions with dense rain gauge networks this measure is effective and direct to enhance the hydrological utilities of satellite products furthermore model recalibration effect is possible to offset the current model structural deficiency i e no parameterization scheme for frozen soil thawing however the recalibrated parameter values might sometimes exceed their reasonable ranges nikolopoulos et al 2012 yong et al 2012 yuan et al 2017 therefore the recalibrated model is likely to have parameter values unrepresentative of real basin features and further lower the model s predictive capability in internal sub or ungauged basins xue et al 2013b to avoid this problem we defined the searching space of each gxaj model parameter in the sce ua optimization algorithm to be strictly within its physical range as suggested by zhao et al 1980 and zhao 1992 notably the values of the gxaj model parameters were estimated to be spatially uniform in this study which may not sufficiently represent the hydrological features in yrsr with complex climate terrain and land cover conditions in fact most model parameters have clear physical meanings and some of them are closely related to the topography land cover and soil texture characteristics shi et al 2008 proposed an empirical equation to calculate the tension water storage capacity with the topographic index yuan and ren 2009 established the relationship of the free water storage capacity sm with the maximum plant root depth and soil porosity and associated the outflow coefficients of interflow and groundwater runoff with soil particle composition information collecting detailed topography land cover and soil texture information in yrsr is desirable to derive spatially distributed parameters by using the abovementioned empirical relationships and to assess the hydrological performance using spatially uniform and spatially distributed parameter sets in addition the three parameters in the snow module were assigned a priori due to the unavailability of snow cover data in the study area among them the degree day factor is relatively sensitive and a high value of this parameter tends to accelerate the snow melting process and thus generate additional discharges in the snow melting period utilizing the satellite images to detect the snow melting dynamics and estimating the snowmelt parameters should be our focus in the future 6 summary and conclusions quickly developing satellite observation techniques have offered hydrologists an unprecedented opportunity to further estimate precipitation for hydrological applications this study statistically evaluates the accuracy of the tmpa 3b42v7 product and its latest successor namely imerg final run at daily and 3 hourly scales in the mountainous yrsr of china subsequently this study assesses their hydrological utility in daily streamflows and 3 hourly flood event simulations by using the gxaj hydrological model on the basis of the analyses in this study the following conclusions are summarized the assessment on the grid cell scale demonstrates that although both satellite products have a low correlation with the ground precipitation observations imerg has a slight enhancement of averaged cc over 3b42v7 from 0 287 to 0 328 at a daily temporal scale and from 0 053 to 0 061 at 3 hourly time step in terms of bias and rmse imerg generally deviates less from the observations than 3b42v7 in addition imerg is modestly superior to 3b42v7 with regard to the capability of capturing various levels of precipitation events the evaluation on the basin scale illustrates that although the basin averaged precipitation estimates from imerg obtain slightly higher systematic biases 3 6 than those from 3b42v7 1 8 imerg yields higher cc 0 527 and 0 119 and lower rmse 2 45 mm and 0 64 mm values than 3b42v7 cc 0 458 and 0 094 rmse 2 69 mm and 0 67 mm at both daily and 3 hourly time scales these findings show that imerg generally surpasses 3b42v7 in estimating basin averaged precipitation in yrsr this study uses the gxaj hydrological model to evaluate the hydrological abilities of the two satellite precipitation products in daily streamflow simulations the 3b42v7 based model run using the gauge benchmarked model parameters presents an acceptable hydrological simulation skill in terms of nse 0 729 whereas imerg demonstrates an improved performance 0 810 which is comparable with the gauge based simulation 0 807 input specific model recalibration effectively enhances the performance of the daily streamflow simulations using the two satellite products nse 0 856 for imerg and 0 840 for 3b42v7 in particular exceeding that of the gauge forced model run thus the imerg and 3b43v7 satellite precipitation products can be adopted as reliable precipitation sources for rational daily streamflow simulations in yrsr this study also evaluates the hydrological performance of imerg and 3b42v7 in simulating historical flood events at a sub daily temporal scale the gauge benchmarked modeling scheme shows that the 3b42v7 based model has limited hydrological skill in simulating three flood events at 3 hourly time intervals nse 0 070 to 0 702 whereas imerg has a slightly better performance nse 0 266 0 792 model recalibration significantly improves the simulations of two out of the three flood events the nse skill core of the satellite precipitation driven model runs 0 581 0 901 for imerg and 0 795 to 0 852 for 3b42v7 is relative lower than that of the gauge based model runs 0 753 0 969 but comparable overall both satellite products are feasible for flood simulations in yrsr with imerg better suited than 3b42v7 these findings provide the satellite precipitation research community with timely and valuable information on yrsr regarding the accuracy of the imerg precipitation products the imerg precipitation estimates showed significant improvement in numerous parts of the world compared with the tmpa products due to the more advanced gpm microwave imager sensor and dual frequency precipitation radar onboard the gpm satellites as well as the sophisticated calibration algorithms this improvement is also found as expected in yrsr however this study demonstrates that imerg still poorly correlates with the ground precipitation observations and has low pod and high far values in yrsr in particular at sub daily time scales as yrsr is located in a mid latitude alpine region with a complex terrain that might significantly influence the satellite precipitation retrieval the gpm research community should urgently further improve the calibration algorithms and enhance the quality of imerg products in yrsr and similar regions where local ground precipitation gauging networks are usually sparse for effective hydrological applications additionally in regions with dense rain gauge networks conducting bias correction for satellite precipitation products is necessary to effectively improve their hydrological utilities imerg has the advantage over tmpa in providing precipitation estimates at considerably finer spatial and temporal resolutions 0 1 and 30 min which is in favor of capturing small scale precipitation processes nevertheless to compare the imerg and 3b42v7 data sets this research resampled the imerg estimates from a 0 1 30 min spatiotemporal resolution to 0 25 3h and 0 25 1 d and conducted streamflow simulations at these coarse scales statistical and hydrological evaluations of imerg at fine spatiotemporal scales will be conducted in the near future moreover this study is associated with large uncertainties from precipitation interpolation resampling and hydrological modeling future work will entail quantifying these uncertainties acknowledgements this study was sponsored by the

6914,global satellite precipitation products such as tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and its successor global precipitation measurement gpm have provided hydrologists with a critical precipitation data source for hydrological applications in data sparse or ungauged basins this study conducts a comparative analysis on the quality of the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis 3b42v7 and the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg final run version 05 precipitation products and their hydrological utilities in the yellow river source region yrsr a mountainous alpine region in northwestern china from april 2014 to december 2016 results indicate that when evaluated against the ground precipitation observations imerg generally improves the daily precipitation estimates relative to its predecessor 3b42v7 in addition and the correlation coefficients ccs of imerg 0 328 and 0 527 are significantly higher at grid and basin scales than those of 3b42v7 0 287 and 0 458 however the 3 hourly precipitation estimates from both products poorly correlate with the ground observations at grid and basin scales by using the grid based xinanjiang gxaj hydrological model calibrated with the gauge based precipitation for daily streamflow simulations the 3b42v7 driven model run shows acceptable hydrological simulation skill with regard to the nash sutcliffe model

in simulating three historical flood events at 3 hourly time intervals nse 0 070 to 0 702 while imerg has a slightly better performance nse 0 266 0 792 model recalibration also significantly improves the simulations of two out of three flood events and the nse skill cores of imerg 0 581 0 901 and 3b42v7 0 795 to 0 852 are relatively lower than that of the gauge based simulation 0 753 0 969 but comparable overall the imerg and 3b43v7 satellite precipitation products can be adopted as reliable precipitation sources for hydrological simulations at daily and sub daily time scales in the study area with imerg better suited than 3b42v7 considering that the low cc values exist in both imerg and 3b42v7 products in particular at a sub daily temporal scale the gpm research community should further improve the calibration algorithms and enhance the quality of imerg products in yrsr performing bias correction of satellite precipitation products is also necessary for hydrological modelers to effectively improve their hydrological utilities keywords gpm imerg trmm tmpa satellite precipitation streamflow simulations xinanjiang hydrological model 1 introduction precipitation is one of the key variables in the hydrological cycle accurate precipitation inputs are important to hydrological models for rationally simulating the hydrological processes at the regional and basin scales hydrological simulations and predictions are no doubt a challenging task over regions without or with sparse precipitation gauge networks particularly in remote basins with complex terrain xue et al

2004 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network hsu et al 1997 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg hou et al 2014 have been available to the public these satellite precipitation products generally have high spatiotemporal resolutions finer than 0 25 spatial resolution and shorter than the daily temporal interval with a wide quasi global coverage broader than the 50 n 50 s latitude band wang et al 2017c and provide hydrologists with an alternative to precipitation data sources for hydrological studies in data sparse or ungauged basins among the released satellite precipitation products the tmpa precipitation estimate is regarded as one of the most reliable and extensively used products tong et al 2014 su et al 2008 the tmpa products are developed by the goddard space flight center at the national aeronautics and space administration and provide precipitation estimates from multiple satellites via a calibration based sequential scheme and monthly gauge analyses where feasible with a high spatiotemporal resolution 0 25 0 25 and 3 hourly interval and a quasi global coverage of 50 n 50 s huffman et al 2007 their post real time products versions 6 and 7 hereafter referred to as 3b42v6 and 3b42v7 have been extensively validated against ground precipitation observations and used for hydrological applications such as hydrological simulation disaster forecasting and water resources management su et al 2008 yong et al 2010 behrangi et al 2011 samaniego et al 2011 yong et al 2012 jiang et al 2012 nikolopoulos et al 2012 tarnavsky et al 2013 thiemig et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2013 xue et al 2013b behrangi et al 2014 tong et al 2014 zulkafli et al 2014 tuo et al 2016 ciabatta et al 2016 kim et al 2016 most relevant studies have demonstrated that 3b42v6 and 3b42v7 have acceptable or even satisfactory quality and hydrological utility in several parts of the world su et al 2008 yong et al 2010 behrangi et al 2011 samaniego et al 2011 nikolopoulos et al 2012 thiemig et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2013 xue et al 2013b behrangi et al 2014 tong et al 2014 zulkafli et al 2014 ciabatta et al 2016 kim et al 2016 in yrsr meng et al 2014 found that 3b42v6 is able to capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation at daily time scale hao et al 2014 evaluated the quality of 3b42v7 and three tmpa near real time products 3b42rt versions 5 6 and 7 on the basis of the verification of the cma ground precipitation data they found that 3b42v7 is significantly superior to these three near real time products jiang et al 2016 compared four satellite precipitation products and concluded that 3b42v7 and cmorph adj adjustment with ground precipitation observations perform better than their near real time products 3b42rt and cmorph su et al 2017 found that despite a light precipitation underestimation in the western mountains and a mild overestimation in the southeast 3b42v7 exhibits satisfactory performance in capturing the spatial distribution of daily average precipitation moreover the hydrological ability of tmpa products has been evaluated in yrsr recently meng et al 2014 tested the suitability of 3b42v6 in daily and monthly streamflow simulations via the coupled routing and excess storage crest hydrological model they demonstrated that 3b42v6 has a slightly inferior hydrological performance relative to the gauge based simulation hao et al 2014 reported that with the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model 3b42v7 exhibits plausible performance in daily discharge simulations whereas 3b42rt versions 5 7 products have considerably poor hydrological prediction capabilities similar to hao et al 2014 su et al 2017 used the vic model for daily streamflow simulations and the performance of the 3b42v7 based simulation with the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse of 0 83 was found to be comparable with that of the gauge based model run nse 0 90 however 3b42v7 overrates the high peak discharges and exhibits poorly in the simulation of the flood event in 2012 although the trmm mission ended on april 8 2015 tmpa products will continue to be produced in parallel with the new gpm mission until early 2018 as the successor of trmm the gpm mission officially launched in february 2014 comprises an international satellite constellation that provides global precipitation estimates with significant improvements in spatiotemporal resolution in comparison with current tmpa products the newly released imerg huffman et al 2015 obtains global precipitation estimates at fine spatiotemporal scales 0 1 0 1 and 30 min interval with further expansive quasi global coverage 60 n 60 s several initial studies have been conducted to evaluate the imerg precipitation product against the ground precipitation observations and most of them reported that imerg products generally outperform tmpa in several regions such as the usa tan et al 2017 the mekong river basin wang et al 2017b he et al 2017 west and east africa dezfuli et al 2017 india prakash et al 2016 iran sharifi et al 2016 siuki et al 2017 south korea kim et al 2017 japan kim et al 2017 mainland china tang et al 2016a guo et al 2016 the xinjiang region chen and li 2016 the qinghai tibet plateau chen and li 2016 ma et al 2016 xu et al 2017 the beijiang river basin wang et al 2017c and the coastal region wang et al 2017a of china in yrsr ma et al 2016 and tang et al 2016a reported that imerg shows an appreciably better performance than 3b42v7 at both sub daily and daily time scales however considering that imerg was released only four years ago few studies have focused on the hydrological utilities of imerg products at basin scales such as the ganjiang tang et al 2016b li et al 2017 and beijiang river basins wang et al 2017c in china the upper mekong river basin he et al 2017 the peruvian ecuadorian amazon basin zubieta et al 2017 the chindwin river basin in myanmar yuan et al 2017 and an urbanizing arid catchment in saudi arabia sharif et al 2017 most of these studies demonstrated that imerg has comparable hydrological utilities with tmpa standard products or even outperforms tmpa tang et al 2016b he et al 2017 zubieta et al 2017 wang et al 2017c nevertheless to the best of our knowledge the hydrological evaluation of imerg in yrsr has not yet been reported in addition most relevant studies in other regions evaluated the hydrological utility of imerg mainly at a daily time scale while imerg products with precipitation estimates in fine spatiotemporal resolutions are expected to be able to capture precipitation dynamics at small scales and to be reliable data sources for flood monitoring and warning therefore the hydrological utilities of imerg products should further focus on the feasibility of hydrological simulations at sub daily temporal scales this study statistically evaluated the imerg final run version 05 v05 and tmpa 3b42v7 precipitation products against the ground precipitation observations in yrsr in china subsequently this study assessed the hydrological utility of these two satellite products via a hydrological model considering that imerg is in an early phase and its calibration algorithms still need to be refined the main goals of this study are the following 1 statistically assess and compare the accuracy of the gpm era imerg precipitation estimates with that of the trmm era 3b42v7 product at daily and 3 hourly time scales in the study area and 2 comprehensively investigate the hydrological utility of imerg products in simulating historical daily streamflow processes and flood events in comparison with 3b42v7 in yrsr this study is among the early attempts tang et al 2016a ma et al 2016 to assess the latest imerg product and its hydrological feasibility in the study area we expect that the findings reported in this paper can provide useful guidelines for hydrological applications of imerg data and can also promote the improvement of imerg products in future versions 2 study area and data preparation 2 1 study area in this study the yellow river source region yrsr was defined as the area controlled by the tangnaihai hydrological station fig 1 which is located on the northeast qinghai tibet plateau and has a total drainage area of 1 22 105 km2 15 of the entire yellow river basin the altitude varies between 2677 m and 6253 m and decreases from the southwest to the northeast fig 1 the study area is situated in a semiarid climate region characterized by the typical qinghai tibet plateau climate system the mean annual air temperature ranges between 4 c and 2 c with a distinct increase from the southeast to the northeast the basin averaged mean annual precipitation is approximately 530 mm and precipitation tends to decline from the southeast 800 mm a to the northwest 200 mm a hu et al 2011 largely influenced by the southwest monsoon from the bay of bengal precipitation mainly occurs from june to october and accounts for more than 75 of the annual precipitation hu et al 2011 snowfall is mainly concentrated from november to march as the water tower of the yellow river yrsr has an annual mean runoff of 168 mm representing 35 of the total runoff of the yellow river basin zheng et al 2009 runoff in the wet season june october accounts for 70 of the annual total runoff zheng et al 2009 hu et al 2011 the basin is dominated by temperate and alpine grasslands and meadows and permanent snowpack and glaciers exist in the southern animaqing bayankala and northern qilian mountains yuan et al 2015 this region has a low population density with a total of approximately half a million inhabitants yuan et al 2015 neither large reservoirs nor large irrigation projects exist in this area therefore this study region is subject to minimal human activity and is regarded as a relatively pristine area hu et al 2011 2 2 gauge based weather data fig 1 shows that the historical meteorological data of 13 automatic weather stations in the basin fig 1 were obtained from cma these data include hourly records of precipitation and air temperature from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 hourly precipitation is automatically recorded by siphoning or tipping bucket rain gauges all weather data have undergone strict quality control by cma including checks of extreme values internal consistency and spatial consistency ren et al 2010 among these 13 weather stations 11 stations are not included in the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc gridded gauge analysis precipitation data set except for the dari dr and maduo md stations to facilitate distributed streamflow simulations the inverse distance weighting method was used to interpolate the gauge based precipitation and air temperature data to the 0 25 spatial scale the precipitation interpolation disregarded the topographical effects whereas the near surface air temperature was assumed to decrease by 0 65 c per altitude increase of 100 m su and xie 2003 yuan et al 2017 2 3 satellite precipitation products two types of satellite precipitation products namely the tmpa 3b42v7 3 hourly and imerg final run v05 half hourly precipitation products were selected for this study 2 3 1 tmpa 3b42v7 the tmpa 3b42v7 precipitation products were generated by using the trmm tmpa version 7 algorithm huffman et al 2007 tmpa can retrieve microwave infrared satellite precipitation estimates with gauge adjustments and is able to produce rational precipitation estimates in a 0 25 spatial resolution with a quasi global coverage 50 s 50 n and a 3 hourly temporal interval in this study the trmm 3b42v7 3 hourly precipitation product from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 was acquired from the precipitation measurement mission pmm website https pmm nasa gov data access downloads trmm as the local time in the study area is 8 h ahead of the universal time coordinated utc the 3b42v7 3 hourly precipitation product was converted to the precipitation estimates in accordance with the local time using the approach suggested by yuan et al 2017 furthermore the 3b42v7 3 hourly precipitation data were accumulated to daily values in accordance with the time span of the local daily precipitation collection 08 00 08 00 utc 08 00 for daily streamflow simulations 2 3 2 imerg final run v05 imerg is the level 3 precipitation estimation algorithm of gpm and is intended to inter calibrate merge and interpolate multiple satellite microwave precipitation estimates this algorithm is combined with precipitation gauge analyses microwave calibrated infrared satellite estimates and other precipitation estimators on a finer spatial resolution 0 1 with a greater coverage 60 s 60 n and a shorter time interval 30 min than those of tmpa products in this study the imerg final run v05 half hourly precipitation product from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 was obtained from the pmm website https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm to produce the imerg precipitation at a 3 hourly interval the precipitation values in the consecutive six half hourly imerg files were accumulated and the time difference between local time and utc 8 h was considered moreover the half hourly imerg data were accumulated to daily precipitation estimates to perform hydrological simulations on a spatial resolution of 0 25 the imerg precipitation product was aggregated from a 0 1 spatial resolution to 0 25 considering that four imerg grid cells are completely situated within a 0 25 grid cell four fall halfway inside and a ninth falls one quarter inside the areal weights for these imerg grid cells were assigned as 0 16 0 08 and 0 04 for precipitation aggregation respectively yuan et al 2017 2 4 discharge data the observed discharge data at the tangnaihai hydrological station fig 1 were collected from the ministry of water resources china the discharge data include the daily discharge records from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 and the flood data of three flood events september 8 october 12 2014 june 23 july 23 2015 and october 12 27 2016 the time span of the local daily discharge measurement is 08 00 08 00 utc 08 00 the time interval of the flood event data varies from 6 min to 12 h thus the linear interpolation method was used to transform the flood data into 3 hourly temporal intervals these historical streamflow data were adopted for the calibration of hydrological models 3 methodology 3 1 diagnostic statistics for evaluating satellite precipitation products on the basis of the gauge based precipitation data set the qualities of imerg and 3b42v7 satellite precipitation products were evaluated at grid and basin spatial scales first the imerg and 3b42v7 precipitation estimates at the grid cells where the weather stations are located were compared with the corresponding on site precipitation observations from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 second the basin averaged satellite precipitation time series were quantitatively assessed against the gauge based time series the evaluations were conducted at daily and 3 hourly time scales several widely used diagnostic statistics were adopted in this study the relative bias bias pearson correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were calculated in accordance with the formulas shown in table 1 bias denotes the systematic deviation rate between the satellite and gauge based precipitation cc represents the agreement between the satellite precipitation estimates and gauge observations rmse measures the average absolute error of the satellite precipitation pod which is also known as the hit rate represents the fraction of precipitation events correctly detected by the satellite among all real precipitation events far describes the fraction of false events among all the events detected by the satellite csi denotes the overall fraction of precipitation events correctly detected by the satellite 3 2 grid based xinanjiang model and hydrological simulation schemes the xinanjiang xaj model is a lumped conceptual hydrological model zhao 1992 that is broadly applied to humid and semi humid watersheds in china for flood forecasting water resources evaluation and accounting design for water quality in this study the modified version of the xaj model the grid based xaj gxaj model yuan and ren 2004 yuan et al 2005 was adopted for hydrological simulations the gxaj model simulates hydrological processes on a grid cell basis with spatially distributed atmospheric forcing data this model adopts the snow module of the hbv model bergström 1995 to calculate the snowmelt process in each grid cell through the degree day method and uses the three soil layer evapotranspiration et and saturation excess runoff schemes of the lumped xaj model zhao 1992 for actual et and runoff calculations in each grid cell for hillslope runoff concentration and streamflow routing the gxaj model adopts 1 a gravitational water reservoir with bottom and side outlets to divide the calculated total runoff into surface interflow and groundwater runoffs 2 three linear reservoirs to describe the hillslope concentration of the three runoff components in each grid cell and 3 the muskingum routing method to represent the routing effect of the river channel system connecting each grid cell the gxaj model uses gridded precipitation and potential et pe as its forcing data the daily minimum and maximum air temperature data are used to calculate the daily pe through the air temperature based hargreaves method hargreaves and samni 1982 for flood event simulations the gxaj model uses a sinusoidal function to disaggregate the daily pe into the pe values at short time intervals the gxaj model has 18 parameters in total including 3 parameters for the snow module 8 for et and runoff calculations and 7 for hillslope runoff concentration and streamflow routing the parameter values are defined to be spatially uniform in this study yrsr was divided into 250 grid cells with a 0 25 resolution three precipitation data sets were produced the gauge based gridded imerg and 3b42v7 satellite precipitation products with a 0 25 resolution these three precipitation data sets were used to drive the gxaj model to perform historical daily streamflow simulations at the tangnaihai hydrological station from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 moreover the gxaj model was used to simulate three historical flood events event i september 8 october 12 2014 event ii june 23 july 23 2015 and event iii october 12 27 2016 at a 3 hourly time interval two hydrological simulation schemes were conducted i the model parameters were calibrated by fitting the calculated streamflow time series against the observed data by using the gauge based precipitation data the gxaj model was replaced by the satellite precipitation data sets to perform daily streamflow and flood event simulations using the gauge calibrated model parameters this scheme is widely applied for hydrological simulations over gauged basins xue et al 2013b ii the model parameters were independently calibrated using the satellite precipitation data sets the product specific parameters were adopted to conduct streamflow simulations which is an alternative for hydrological applications in ungauged basins where only satellite precipitation products are available xue et al 2013b for daily streamflow simulations the calibration period was april 1 2014 to december 31 2015 and the validation period was january 1 2016 to december 31 2016 for flood event simulations the time spans of events i and ii were selected as the calibration period and the time period of event iii was used as the validation period considering that no snow cover data are available in the study area the three parameters in the snow module such as the degree day factor threshold temperature above which precipitation is rain and threshold temperature above which the snowmelt process begins were assigned a priori as 4 mm d 1 c 1 3 3 c and 0 c respectively bergström 1995 the other model parameters were calibrated with the aid of the shuffled complex evolution sce ua automatic optimization method duan et al 1992 duan et al 1993 although the maximum of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse is a commonly used objective function for hydrological model optimization it tends to provide high importance to high flows and the optimized model may not accurately capture low flow processes to search the model parameters that can comprehensively characterize both high and low flow processes we used the maximum sum of nse and log transformed nse lognse as the objective function which is given by 1 f max nse max lognse 2 nse 1 i 1 n q i s q i o 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 3 lognse 1 i 1 n log q i s log q i o 2 i 1 n log q i o log q o 2 where n is the sample size of the observed or calculated streamflow time series q i o and q i s represent the observed and calculated streamflow time series m3 s respectively and q o and log q o denote the mean observed streamflow and mean log transformed observed streamflow m3 s respectively in each simulation scheme the three sets of simulated streamflow time series using different precipitation inputs were compared with the observations to assess the hydrologic utility of the imerg and 3b42v7 products in the study area the performance of the daily streamflow simulations was evaluated using four statistical indices bias nse lognse and rmse for flood event simulations five diagnostic statistics were selected bias for runoff volume biasv nse rmse and bias for peak flow biasp and flood peak time error pte to minimize the effects of initial conditions on flood event simulations we assigned the initial snow pack depth tension water storage depths at three soil layers free water storage depth surface runoff interflow and groundwater runoff in the three linear reservoirs as the values that were calculated in the daily streamflow simulations on the date when the flood events started 4 results 4 1 evaluation of satellite precipitation products to further understand the impact of different satellite precipitation inputs on discharge simulations in the study area the qualities of the imerg and 3b42v7 satellite precipitation products were evaluated against the in situ rain gauge observations over the time span from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 such evaluations were conducted in terms of the spatial pattern of precipitation precipitation at gauge located grid cells and basin averaged precipitation 4 1 1 spatial pattern fig 2 demonstrates the spatial pattern of the gauge imerg and 3b42v7 based precipitation estimates from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 in yrsr the two satellite precipitation products show a spatial pattern similar to that of the gauge based gridded precipitation data set precipitation tends to increase from the northwest to the southeast the lowest total precipitation amount generally appears in the northwestern part of the watershed reaching 737 7 mm for imerg and 826 8 mm for 3b42v7 the amount of maximum total precipitation occurs in the southeastern grid cells of the basin with 2464 4 mm for imerg and 2488 4 mm for 3b42v7 although both satellite products represent a similar trend imerg shows a slightly drier situation in the west and a mildly wetter pattern in the east of the watershed than 3b42v7 fig 2 in addition imerg can represent more detailed spatial features of precipitation than 3b42v7 fig 2 because imerg estimates precipitation at a considerably finer resolution than 3b42v7 4 1 2 precipitation at gauge located grid cells the daily precipitation estimates from imerg and 3b42v7 at the locations of the 11 non gpcc rain gauges and two gpcc stations were derived and compared with the gauge based precipitation fig 3 a shows that the bias values of both satellite products at most weather stations are within the range of 10 to 10 except that imerg considerably overestimates precipitation at the mq station by 14 3 and 3b42v7 presents a moderate underestimation 17 0 at the hn station the cc values of both products are considerably low ranging from 0 226 to 0 461 between the imerg estimates and observations averaged cc 0 327 and from 0 194 to 0 373 for the 3b42v7 estimates against the gauge based precipitation averaged cc 0 287 in terms of rmse imerg has slightly smaller errors averaged rmse 4 85 mm than 3b42v7 averaged rmse 5 09 mm at most stations fig 3a with regard to the contingency of satellite precipitation estimates on the daily temporal scale the pod values are low at all the weather stations ranging from 0 149 to 0 246 for imerg averaged pod 0 165 and from 0 148 to 0 198 for 3b42v7 averaged pod 0 157 additionally fig 3a denotes that both imerg and 3b42v7 products have large far 0 399 and 0 396 respectively and small csi 0 148 and 0 142 respectively values implying considerable errors in the two satellite products among the 13 weather stations the dr and md stations are included in gpcc fig 3a shows that at these two stations both imerg and 3b42v7 present a relatively low systematic deviation from the gauge observations bias 3 5 and 1 2 respectively but obtain similar magnitudes of other diagnostic statistics to those at the non gpcc stations the reason is that both the imerg final run and 3b42v7 products are bias corrected using the gpcc precipitation data set on a monthly basis this condition is able to effectively reduce the systematic errors of satellite precipitation estimates at the grid cells where gpcc stations are located but may not improve other diagnostic statistics on time steps shorter than 1 month furthermore a comparison of the mean values of all the diagnostic statistics fig 3a demonstrates that imerg is generally slightly superior to 3b42v7 in daily precipitation estimation except that imerg has a mildly higher mean far value than 3b42v7 fig 3b presents the statistical indices of imerg and 3b42v7 precipitation estimates at the 11 non gpcc weather stations and two gpcc stations at a 3 hourly time scale the figure shows that the 3 hourly precipitation estimates from imerg and 3b42v7 are at the same magnitudes of bias as the daily estimates the cc values on the 3 hourly temporal scale are considerably lower than those on the daily scale and imerg provides a slightly higher cc than 3b42v7 at 10 stations the rmse values of imerg are slightly lower than those of 3b42v7 at 11 out of the 13 stations moreover compared with the daily precipitation estimates the two 3 hourly satellite products have considerably lower pod and csi values and considerably higher magnitudes of far this result implies that at the 3 hourly time scale both imerg and 3b42v7 are poor in detecting precipitation events and have considerably higher false alarm ratios the frequency distributions of daily and 3 hourly precipitation at different precipitation intensity levels were analyzed at the grid cells where the 11 non gpcc weather stations are situated fig 4 fig 4a indicates that approximately 62 0 of the observed daily precipitation is under 0 1 mm the imerg products have a slight underestimation of 3 6 and 3b42v7 presents a mild overestimation by 2 3 for daily precipitation ranging from 0 1 mm to 10 mm imerg provides an overestimation by 4 1 and 3b42v7 shows a minor underestimation of 2 1 both imerg and 3b42v7 estimate a slightly lower occurrence frequency of daily precipitation events at the range of 10 20 mm than the ground observations by contrast imerg and 3b42v7 produce a slight overestimation of 0 23 and 0 51 for daily precipitation between 20 mm and 50 mm in the case of daily precipitation exceeding 50 mm imerg slightly overestimates the occurrence frequency by 0 01 and 3b42v7 presents a minor underestimation of 0 03 in general compared with the frequency distribution of 3b42v7 the frequency distribution of imerg is relatively closer to that of the observations similarly for the 3 hourly precipitation the frequency distribution of imerg is in a slightly better agreement with the observations than that of 3b42v7 fig 4b overall a comparison of the diagnostic statistics fig 3 and precipitation frequency distributions fig 4 shows that both satellite products generally obtain similar performance in daily and 3 hourly precipitation estimations at most weather stations in the study area with imerg slightly outperforming 3b42v7 4 1 3 basin averaged precipitation the basin averaged daily and 3 hourly precipitation estimates from imerg and 3b42v7 were evaluated against the gauge based time series table 2 shows that imerg slightly underestimates the basin averaged precipitation by 3 6 and 3b42v7 presents a minor underestimation of 1 8 at both the daily and 3 hourly temporal scales the rmse values from imerg are modestly lower than those from 3b42v7 although both imerg and 3b42v7 have a low correlation with the ground precipitation at the grid scale the cc values of both products clearly increase at the basin scale with those of imerg 0 524 and 0 119 slightly higher than those of 3b42v7 0 458 and 0 094 at both the daily and 3 hourly time steps in addition the non exceedance frequency distributions of the basin averaged precipitation estimates from the three precipitation data sets were compared at the daily and 3 hourly temporal scales fig 5 a shows that both the imerg and 3b42v7 based daily precipitation frequency distributions match the gauge based precipitation with imerg in a noticeable underestimation in the daily precipitation quantile range of 99 7 99 9 and 3b42v7 in a significant overestimation at the 96 99 7 quantile level although both satellite products are in fairly good agreement with the gauge based frequency distribution at the 3 hourly temporal scale imerg slightly underestimates the basin averaged precipitation at the intermediate quantile level 75 95 and presents a minor overestimation of the extreme heavy precipitation 99 6 quantile level fig 5b similarly 3b42v7 presents a minor underestimation at the intermediate quantile level and a significant overestimation of the high precipitation quantiles 96 quantile level fig 5b table 2 and fig 5 indicate that imerg generally provides slightly more accurate daily and 3 hourly precipitation estimates than 3b42v7 at the basin scale 4 2 evaluation of hydrological simulations the gxaj model driven by the gauge imerg and 3b42v7 based precipitation data sets was used to perform daily streamflow simulations from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 and to simulate the three historical flood events at the tangnaihai hydrological station the simulated streamflow using the three different precipitation inputs was compared with the observed streamflow to evaluate the hydrological utility of satellite precipitation products 4 2 1 daily streamflow simulations fig 6 depicts the daily hydrographs at the tangnaihai station that were simulated using the three different precipitation inputs the figure demonstrates that the simulated streamflow forced by rain gauge data agrees well with the observations in the calibration period april 1 2014 to december 31 2015 displaying a minor negative bias of 5 1 and high values of nse and lognse 0 897 and 0 905 respectively table 3 when the calibrated model was subsequently validated for the period from january 1 2016 to december 31 2016 the modeling performance deteriorates with a significant runoff overestimation of 29 7 and relatively low nse and lognse 0 232 and 0 709 respectively table 3 this phenomenon has two possible reasons on the one hand the gridded precipitation data set that was derived from 13 rain gauges in this study might not sufficiently capture the spatiotemporal variation of precipitation in the yrsr in 2016 the underlying large errors in the precipitation input were able to propagate in streamflow simulations on the other hand the observed mean daily discharge in the calibration period is 605 1 m3 s whereas that in the validation period is 28 7 less 431 5 m3 s the model parameters that were calibrated in these relatively wet conditions might not adequately denote the hydrological features in dry years potentially influencing the simulation performance the gauge benchmarked gxaj model was forced by the imerg and 3b42v7 products for daily streamflow simulations for the period from april 1 2014 to december 31 2016 fig 6a and table 3 indicate that the imerg and 3b42v7 based simulated daily hydrographs are in line with the measured hydrograph except for a considerable discharge overestimation in the wet season of 2016 moreover the diagnostic indices of scheme i in table 3 demonstrate that in the calibration period both the imerg and 3b42v7 forced daily streamflow simulations are in general slightly less accurate than that driven by the gauge based precipitation input but the performance of the imerg based simulation in the validation period even surpasses the model run using the gauge based precipitation data set for the entire simulation period the imerg based simulation gains a comparable skill score nse 0 810 and lognse 0 872 with the gauge based simulation nse 0 807 and lognse 0 845 and the performance of the 3b42v7 forced model run is acceptable nse 0 729 and lognse 0 786 table 3 a comparison of the discharge duration curves fig 7 a indicates that the three simulations using the gauge imerg and 3b42v7 based data sets generate the daily discharge frequency distributions that agree with the observed data nevertheless triggered by the considerable errors in precipitation inputs and the uncertainties of the hydrological model structure and parameters all the three simulation runs considerably overestimate the low flow quantiles 10 and present a slight overestimation of daily discharge at the quantile level of 50 96 the 3b42v7 forced simulation remarkably overestimates the 97 high flow quantiles and the gauge and imerg based runs significantly underestimate the high flow quantiles 96 fig 7a on the basis of the rmse statistics shown in fig 7a the gauge imerg and 3b42v7 based model runs rank first to third in terms of the performance of matching the observed discharge duration curve to further evaluate the hydrological abilities of the imerg and 3b42v7 products the gxaj model was recalibrated and validated with imerg and 3b42v7 for the same periods as scheme i fig 6b shows that the recalibration effectively improves both the imerg and 3b42v7 based simulations the statistical indices of scheme ii table 3 indicate that the recalibration in general reduces the bias values and improves nse lognse and rmse for both the calibration and validation periods notably model recalibration increases nse and lognse in the entire simulation period to 0 856 and 0 875 in the imerg based simulation and to 0 840 and 0 849 in the 3b42v7 driven case respectively exceeding those of the gauge forced model run 0 807 and 0 845 for nse and lognse respectively moreover the product specific recalibration also improves the discharge duration curves fig 7b the 3b42v7 and imerg driven simulations in particular produce slightly more precise discharge duration curves than the gauge based simulation in terms of rmse fig 7b these findings imply that the gauge based gridded precipitation data set due to the sparse precipitation gauging network may not sufficiently capture the spatiotemporal variation patterns of precipitation in the study area which would potentially influence its hydrological applicability in streamflow simulation it also reflects that the imerg and 3b43v7 satellite precipitation products can be adopted as reliable precipitation sources for rational daily streamflow simulations in yrsr overall as the successor of 3b42v7 imerg is able to provide improved daily precipitation estimates in yrsr as a result the gxaj model with these two satellite precipitation inputs can produce satisfactory daily streamflow simulations and the hydrological capability of imerg is improved 4 2 2 flood event simulations fig 8 shows the observed and simulated 3 hourly hydrographs of three historical flood events at the tangnaihai streamflow station using the gauge imerg and 3b42v7 based precipitation data inputs the hydrological performance is quantified by biasv nse rmse biasp and pte as shown in table 4 fig 8a c and table 4 demonstrate that the gxaj model with the gauge based precipitation input effectively replicates the two flood events events i and ii for calibration with nse values of 0 969 and 0 876 but its hydrological performance is comparatively low in event iii for validation nse 0 753 with a large flow overestimation in the flood rising stage besides the possible errors in the gridded precipitation data set and calibrated parameters that might influence the hydrological performance the initial conditions are non negligible impact factors reducing the initial soil storage may effectively lower the streamflow during the flood rising stage and further improve the general performance for event iii however this arbitrary adjustment of initial conditions to achieve a good fitting of the simulated hydrograph against the observed may to a large extent increase the uncertainty of flood simulations to reduce this uncertainty this study adopted the calculated state variables in the daily streamflow simulation at the date when a flood event started as the initial conditions for flood simulations forced by imerg and 3b42v7 the gxaj model with the gauge based parameters was used for flood event simulations fig 8a c and table 4 show that the simulations with 3b42v7 significantly overestimate the total streamflow of events i and ii by 16 2 and 20 5 respectively and present a minor underestimation of 7 2 in event iii the imerg based streamflow time series have smaller systematic errors than those of 3b42v7 with biasv values of 0 3 11 5 and 0 9 for events i ii and iii respectively table 4 the 3b42v7 based simulations obtain nse values of 0 777 0 702 and rmse values of 86 0 646 0 m3 s for the three flood events and the imerg driven model presents significantly high nses 0 266 0 792 and low rmses 71 9 357 3 m3 s table 4 thus in terms of nse and rmse imerg apparently outperforms 3b42v7 however the imerg based simulations are still less accurate than the gauge based simulations for events i and ii only in event iii the performance of the imerg based simulation slightly surpasses that of the gauge based one additionally a comparison of the flood peak error statistics biasp and pte in table 4 indicates that the imerg and 3b42v7 forced simulations have poorer hydrological abilities for capturing flood peaks than the gauge based simulations overall the 3 hourly 3b42v7 forced flood model ranks third behind the gauge and imerg forced models with regard to the performance of flood event simulations in scheme i in the scheme ii scenario model recalibration significantly improves the simulations of events i and ii in the calibration period fig 8d and e and the skill core of the satellite precipitation driven model runs is relatively lower than that of the gauge based model but comparable the adjusted parameter sets not only effectively offset the systematic errors of the simulated streamflow in scheme i but also remarkably increase nse and generally reduce rmse biasp and pte table 4 for both events i and ii in these two events the performance of the imerg forced simulations still surpasses that of the 3b42v7 based ones however when the recalibrated model was driven to simulate event iii for validation the modeling performances based on imerg and 3b42v7 do not improve as expected and the 3b42v7 based simulation even worsens fig 8f one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that events i and ii are flood processes formed by heavy precipitation events approximately exceeding 80 mm whereas the watershed averaged precipitation in event iii is only approximately 20 mm thus the recalibrated model is likely to rationally represent the hydrological features of big floods but may not accurately replicate flood processes arising from moderate precipitation events another explanation is that small flood simulations are more sensitive to initial soil moisture estimates than major flood simulations section 3 3 states that the initial soil moisture storage for each flood event in this study was assigned as the value of the state soil water storage that was calculated in the daily streamflow simulations on the date when the flood event started the pe coefficient of the gxaj model in the 3b42v7 and imerg based simulations in scheme ii was recalibrated to be slightly higher than that in scheme i this condition would promote et and estimate a drier initial soil moisture storage than the situation in scheme i for event iii leading to the noticeable flow underestimation in the entire flood process in general both the imerg and 3b42v7 based model runs are able to reproduce historical flood events in schemes i and ii and imerg has a better hydrological performance than 3b42v7 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of imerg and 3b42v7 based on ground precipitation observations in this study the quality of the imerg final run v05 and 3b42v7 satellite precipitation products were evaluated against the ground precipitation observations on daily and 3 hourly temporal scales this study found that both satellite products have a similarly low level of correlation with the ground precipitation with mean cc values of 0 328 and 0 287 for imerg and 3b42v7 respectively at a daily temporal scale moreover as the temporal scale decreases from daily to 3 hourly time steps the correlation values between the satellite precipitation estimates and ground observations drop sharply cc 0 061 and 0 053 for imerg and 3b42v7 respectively indicating that both 3b42v7 and imerg are poor in terms of capturing precipitation dynamics at fine temporal scales in yrsr imerg in general obtains lower values of rmse than 3b42v7 on both daily and 3 hourly time scales and imerg generally contains smaller systematic errors than 3b42v7 fig 3 additionally imerg generally outperforms 3b42v7 in detecting precipitation events at different levels fig 4 overall imerg is generally superior to 3b42v7 on grid cell scales in yrsr ma et al 2016 conducted a similar analysis in the qinghai tibet plateau which includes yrsr they concluded that in the evaluation period of april 1 september 30 2014 imerg showed a slightly better performance than 3b42v7 in the upper yellow river basin which is similar to the findings of this study in table 5 we compared our findings with the existing studies that evaluated the performance of both the imerg and tmpa precipitation estimates most of the imerg and tmpa assessment and comparison studies were reported in south and east asia although a few recent studies performed the imerg assessment in other regions such as southern canada asong et al 2017 the netherlands gaona et al 2016 saudi arabia sharif et al 2017 mexico mayor et al 2017 and the upper blue nile asin sahlu et al 2016 these studies did not evaluate the tmpa precipitation products at the same time therefore these studies were not included in table 5 in terms of bias cc rmse and pod most previous studies ma et al 2016 tang et al 2016a libertino et al 2016 sharifi et al 2016 siuki et al 2017 kim et al 2017 xu et al 2017 wang et al 2017a wang et al 2017b wang et al 2017c zubieta et al 2017 proved that the imerg final run products are generally superior to their predecessor namely tmpa 3b42v7 or 3b43 in several regions of the world which are similar to the findings of this study no significant improvements were found in imerg only in singapore tan and duan 2017 the la plata head watershed in bolivia satgé et al 2017 the chindwin river basin in myanmar yuan et al 2017 and the ganjiang river basin in china tang et al 2016b and the 3b42v7 products even outperformed imerg at daily and or monthly time scales these regions where the poor performance of imerg was reported are mostly mountainous areas with complex terrains satgé et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 tang et al 2016b except for singapore satgé et al 2017 found that in the la plata head watershed in bolivia the imerg estimates are more affected by the large local relief and low rainfall intensities than 3b42v7 this case to some degree leads to a low cc and an increase in rmse of 18 in the imerg precipitation estimates in comparison with the 3b42v7 product although imerg precipitation estimates as expected have a slightly better quality than 3b42v7 in yrsr both satellite products still poorly correlate with the ground observations and have low pod and high far values in particular at the 3 hourly time scale fig 3 dominated by temperate and alpine grasslands alpine meadows permanent snowpack and glaciers in this study yrsr is also in large topographic relief with altitudes between 2677 m and 6253 m these complex topographic conditions might significantly influence the satellite precipitation retrieval and lead to large errors in satellite estimates the findings of this study and other relevant works strengthen the urgent need to further improve gpm algorithms particularly for mid latitude alpine regions with complex terrains imerg has an advantage over 3b42v7 in providing precipitation estimates on a considerably fine spatiotemporal resolution this study compares the accuracy of the imerg and 3b42v7 precipitation products therefore the 30 min imerg final run data set was aggregated to 3 hourly and daily intervals for comparison with 3b42v7 considering that the hourly ground precipitation observations are available in this study conducting the assessment of imerg precipitation estimates on temporal intervals of less than 3 h would be desirable moreover gauged based precipitation measurements are point observations on the ground whereas both 3b42v7 and imerg estimates are precipitation values averaged on 0 25 and 0 1 grid cells from space measurements respectively thus caution should be taken when comparing points to grid averages asong et al 2017 this study evaluated the performance of imerg and 3b42v7 products in estimating the basin averaged precipitation as well results show that although imerg has slightly larger systematic errors than 3b42v7 imerg estimates have slightly higher values of cc and lower values of rmse than 3b42v7 thus imerg generally provides more accurate daily and 3 hourly precipitation estimates than 3b42v7 at the basin scale this study used the gauge based basin averaged precipitation as the benchmark for assessment the spatiotemporal variation of the local precipitation should be complex due to the large topographic relief and complicated meteorological conditions using the precipitation records at a limited number of rain gauges 13 gauges in this study to represent the basin averaged precipitation is likely to produce large errors therefore the findings of the basin scale precipitation assessment should be regarded with caution located in the qinghai tibet plateau yrsr is snow prone during the cold season an evaluation of the gpm retrieved solid precipitation estimates against the ground snowfall observations must be conducted because the latest gpm core observatory sensors were designed to be capable of detecting solid precipitation in the cold season such an assessment was not fulfilled in this study due to the lack of snowfall observation sites in the yrsr ma et al 2016 evaluated the imerg solid precipitation estimates at a snowfall experimental site in the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau which is close to our study area they found that imerg correctly captured 4 out of the 16 snowfall days in 2014 although the probability of snowfall detection was not high 25 seeing that imerg has the potential to detect solid cold season precipitation is promising conducting the snowfall measurement and assessment of the imerg solid precipitation estimates over yrsr represents our ongoing work 5 2 hydrological evaluation of imerg and 3b42v7 and effects of parameter recalibration a few previous studies have focused on the hydrological utilities of imerg products in other basins in the world in the ganjiang river basin in china tang et al 2016a conducted an early hydrological assessment of the day 1 imerg final run product by using the crest hydrological model they found that the imerg product performs comparably with the gauge reference data in daily streamflow simulations and outperforms tmpa standard products in numerous cases li et al 2017 further evaluated the feasibility of imerg products in hourly streamflow simulations in the ganjiang river basin they demonstrated that the hourly crest model forced by imerg performs at barely acceptable levels whereas the model using the gauge and radar based data sets exhibits better performance in the beijiang river basin in china daily streamflow simulations using the vic model showed that the day 1 imerg final run product presents better hydrological performance than 3b42v7 wang et al 2017c over the upper mekong river basin imerg generally produces comparable daily streamflow simulations with 3b42v7 and even outperforms 3b42v7 when the xinanjiang hydrological model uses input specifically calibrated parameters he et al 2017 zubieta et al 2017 indicated that imerg is as useful as 3b42v7 and 3b42rt in modeling streamflows in southern regions of the peruvian ecuadorian amazon basin but these data sets fail to properly simulate streamflows in northern regions yuan et al 2017 found that imerg and 3b42v7 are both feasible in streamflow simulations in the chindwin river basin in myanmar with the 3b42v7 product being better suited than imerg most of the previous studies demonstrated that imerg has comparable hydrological utilities with tmpa standard products or even outperforms tmpa tang et al 2016b he et al 2017 zubieta et al 2017 wang et al 2017c similarly this study found that the imerg in yrsr generally has a better hydrological ability than 3b42v7 at daily and sub daily time scales in both the gauge benchmarked model and input specific recalibration schemes this finding reflects that imerg products have potential for hydrological applications such as flood simulation and warning in remote regions where local rain gauge networks are sparse this study found that driven by the imerg precipitation data sets the gauge benchmarked gxaj model produces slightly poorer daily and flood event simulations than the model run with the gauge based precipitation input relative to the imerg driven model run the 3b42v7 forced simulations have inferior performance considering that hydrological models are to some degree tolerant of the errors of precipitation inputs we recalibrated the gxaj model by using the imerg and 3b42v7 precipitation data sets to partially offset the streamflow biases resulting from inaccurate satellite precipitation inputs as a result the recalibrated gxaj model generally produces significantly improved simulations in terms of most of the statistical indices and discharge duration curves to analyze the effects of model recalibration on hydrological simulations we list the calibrated gxaj model parameter values in the daily streamflow simulations by using the gauge imerg and 3b42v7 based precipitation data sets table 6 among the gxaj model parameters k the coefficient of pe is a sensitive parameter to control the total runoff and a large k is inclined to produce a high actual et and thus generate a lower total runoff the imerg and 3b42v7 based daily streamflow simulation runs using the gauge based parameters overestimate the total runoff by 1 8 and 6 6 for the calibration period and 14 5 and 21 6 for the validation period table 3 respectively model recalibration effectively dampens the magnitude of systematic errors in the daily runoff for both the calibration and validation periods by increasing k from 0 611 to 0 677 in the 3b42v7 based run and 0 671 in the imerg based run tables 3 and 6 another sensitive parameter namely sm the areal mean free water storage capacity significantly controls the magnitude of high flow and a high sm usually generates low flood peaks forced by the 3b42v7 products the gauge benchmarked gxaj model tends to overestimate most high flows in daily streamflow simulations fig 6a arising from the considerable systematic overestimation of heavy rain events in 3b42v7 fig 5a the model recalibration partially compensates for the overestimation in high flows fig 6b by increasing sm from 58 198 mm to 69 125 mm in the 3b42v7 based runs in addition table 6 demonstrates that the imerg calibrated parameters deviate less from the gauge based parameter values than the 3b42v7 calibrated ones this result implies that the compensation effect of recalibration is less pronounced in imerg than in 3b42v7 this case probably results from the situation where imerg has a slightly better quality than 3b42v7 in yrsr xue et al 2013b found that tmpa 3b42v7 is generally improved compared with its predecessor 3b42v6 in the wangchu basin of bhutan consequently a more of evident recalibration effect appears in 3b42v6 compared with 3b42v7 although model recalibration is able to partly compensate for errors in the satellite precipitation forcing and thus effectively improves the imerg and 3b42v7 based streamflow simulations in yrsr the model parameters calibrated with biased input forcing data may not sufficiently characterize the hydrological features of a watershed thus the bias correction for satellite precipitation products is suggested to be conducted in particular in regions with dense rain gauge networks this measure is effective and direct to enhance the hydrological utilities of satellite products furthermore model recalibration effect is possible to offset the current model structural deficiency i e no parameterization scheme for frozen soil thawing however the recalibrated parameter values might sometimes exceed their reasonable ranges nikolopoulos et al 2012 yong et al 2012 yuan et al 2017 therefore the recalibrated model is likely to have parameter values unrepresentative of real basin features and further lower the model s predictive capability in internal sub or ungauged basins xue et al 2013b to avoid this problem we defined the searching space of each gxaj model parameter in the sce ua optimization algorithm to be strictly within its physical range as suggested by zhao et al 1980 and zhao 1992 notably the values of the gxaj model parameters were estimated to be spatially uniform in this study which may not sufficiently represent the hydrological features in yrsr with complex climate terrain and land cover conditions in fact most model parameters have clear physical meanings and some of them are closely related to the topography land cover and soil texture characteristics shi et al 2008 proposed an empirical equation to calculate the tension water storage capacity with the topographic index yuan and ren 2009 established the relationship of the free water storage capacity sm with the maximum plant root depth and soil porosity and associated the outflow coefficients of interflow and groundwater runoff with soil particle composition information collecting detailed topography land cover and soil texture information in yrsr is desirable to derive spatially distributed parameters by using the abovementioned empirical relationships and to assess the hydrological performance using spatially uniform and spatially distributed parameter sets in addition the three parameters in the snow module were assigned a priori due to the unavailability of snow cover data in the study area among them the degree day factor is relatively sensitive and a high value of this parameter tends to accelerate the snow melting process and thus generate additional discharges in the snow melting period utilizing the satellite images to detect the snow melting dynamics and estimating the snowmelt parameters should be our focus in the future 6 summary and conclusions quickly developing satellite observation techniques have offered hydrologists an unprecedented opportunity to further estimate precipitation for hydrological applications this study statistically evaluates the accuracy of the tmpa 3b42v7 product and its latest successor namely imerg final run at daily and 3 hourly scales in the mountainous yrsr of china subsequently this study assesses their hydrological utility in daily streamflows and 3 hourly flood event simulations by using the gxaj hydrological model on the basis of the analyses in this study the following conclusions are summarized the assessment on the grid cell scale demonstrates that although both satellite products have a low correlation with the ground precipitation observations imerg has a slight enhancement of averaged cc over 3b42v7 from 0 287 to 0 328 at a daily temporal scale and from 0 053 to 0 061 at 3 hourly time step in terms of bias and rmse imerg generally deviates less from the observations than 3b42v7 in addition imerg is modestly superior to 3b42v7 with regard to the capability of capturing various levels of precipitation events the evaluation on the basin scale illustrates that although the basin averaged precipitation estimates from imerg obtain slightly higher systematic biases 3 6 than those from 3b42v7 1 8 imerg yields higher cc 0 527 and 0 119 and lower rmse 2 45 mm and 0 64 mm values than 3b42v7 cc 0 458 and 0 094 rmse 2 69 mm and 0 67 mm at both daily and 3 hourly time scales these findings show that imerg generally surpasses 3b42v7 in estimating basin averaged precipitation in yrsr this study uses the gxaj hydrological model to evaluate the hydrological abilities of the two satellite precipitation products in daily streamflow simulations the 3b42v7 based model run using the gauge benchmarked model parameters presents an acceptable hydrological simulation skill in terms of nse 0 729 whereas imerg demonstrates an improved performance 0 810 which is comparable with the gauge based simulation 0 807 input specific model recalibration effectively enhances the performance of the daily streamflow simulations using the two satellite products nse 0 856 for imerg and 0 840 for 3b42v7 in particular exceeding that of the gauge forced model run thus the imerg and 3b43v7 satellite precipitation products can be adopted as reliable precipitation sources for rational daily streamflow simulations in yrsr this study also evaluates the hydrological performance of imerg and 3b42v7 in simulating historical flood events at a sub daily temporal scale the gauge benchmarked modeling scheme shows that the 3b42v7 based model has limited hydrological skill in simulating three flood events at 3 hourly time intervals nse 0 070 to 0 702 whereas imerg has a slightly better performance nse 0 266 0 792 model recalibration significantly improves the simulations of two out of the three flood events the nse skill core of the satellite precipitation driven model runs 0 581 0 901 for imerg and 0 795 to 0 852 for 3b42v7 is relative lower than that of the gauge based model runs 0 753 0 969 but comparable overall both satellite products are feasible for flood simulations in yrsr with imerg better suited than 3b42v7 these findings provide the satellite precipitation research community with timely and valuable information on yrsr regarding the accuracy of the imerg precipitation products the imerg precipitation estimates showed significant improvement in numerous parts of the world compared with the tmpa products due to the more advanced gpm microwave imager sensor and dual frequency precipitation radar onboard the gpm satellites as well as the sophisticated calibration algorithms this improvement is also found as expected in yrsr however this study demonstrates that imerg still poorly correlates with the ground precipitation observations and has low pod and high far values in yrsr in particular at sub daily time scales as yrsr is located in a mid latitude alpine region with a complex terrain that might significantly influence the satellite precipitation retrieval the gpm research community should urgently further improve the calibration algorithms and enhance the quality of imerg products in yrsr and similar regions where local ground precipitation gauging networks are usually sparse for effective hydrological applications additionally in regions with dense rain gauge networks conducting bias correction for satellite precipitation products is necessary to effectively improve their hydrological utilities imerg has the advantage over tmpa in providing precipitation estimates at considerably finer spatial and temporal resolutions 0 1 and 30 min which is in favor of capturing small scale precipitation processes nevertheless to compare the imerg and 3b42v7 data sets this research resampled the imerg estimates from a 0 1 30 min spatiotemporal resolution to 0 25 3h and 0 25 1 d and conducted streamflow simulations at these coarse scales statistical and hydrological evaluations of imerg at fine spatiotemporal scales will be conducted in the near future moreover this study is associated with large uncertainties from precipitation interpolation resampling and hydrological modeling future work will entail quantifying these uncertainties acknowledgements this study was sponsored by the
