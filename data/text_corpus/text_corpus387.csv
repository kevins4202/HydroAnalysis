1935,the computational prediction of flood dynamics is a long standing problem in hydrodynamics and hydrology until now conventional numerical models based on shallow water equations swes have been the dominant approaches here we show that by combining a data driven methodology with some general physical governing equations the resulting deep learning model can enable the prediction of the long term dynamics of dam break floods with satisfactory accuracy for this purpose we propose a deep learning model using a physics informed neural network pinn embedded in swes training data are reconstructed from prior known partial numerical solutions and a novel subregion specific sampling method that adapts well to the violent variations in flood surfaces various traditional cases of 2d dam break floods are used to illustrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed model the results show that the proposed pinn embedded model predicts the dam break flood dynamics well as observed in the numerical simulations based on swes and outperforms the pure data driven multilayer perceptron mlp model and a similar model with the traditional random sampling method we also demonstrate that the pinn embedded model improves the computational efficiency by over 3 4 orders of magnitude compared to the traditional 2d numerical solution of swes our study showcases how numerical simulation and deep learning techniques can be coupled to investigate the details of dam break floods keywords physical information neural networks subregion specific sampling method two dimensional prediction hydrodynamics dam break flood data availability i have share the link to my data and code at the attach files step 1 introduction in a flood induced dike failure or dam break event or after a sluice gate within a flood detention basin is opened a shock wave usually forms and then propagates forwards xia et al 2010 dam break flows can cause significant damage and in extreme events the loss of human life due to their high propagation speeds especially when they occur in highly populated rural or urban regions the processes of flood inundation caused by dam break flows can usually be described by two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic models xia et al 2010 wherein predicting the evolution of such processes is usually based on numerical simulations numerous numerical schemes have long been developed including advanced finite difference methods fdms luo and gao 2015 ortiz 2014 pudasaini and mergili 2019 triki 2014 finite volume methods fvms stecca et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 finite element methods fems lai and khan 2017 seyedashraf and akhtari 2017 and lagrangian methods akbari 2017 yang et al 2016 as solutions to the problem many methods are available for simulating dam break flows for example zhao et al 1996 presented a detailed review of a range of numerical methods developed for simulating dam break flows based on solving 2d shallow water equations swes nevertheless the need for the simultaneous computation of the governing equations considering the required iterations and constraints makes these numerical models computationally expensive lai and khan 2017 in addition it is costly to calibrate unknown parameters during the simulation of complex scenarios and usually needs trial and error adjusting moreover to obtain results with high accuracy these modeling techniques require extensive datasets and need to utilize finer grid forms near regions with high gradients seyedashraf et al 2018 recently artificial intelligence driven models based on various deep neural networks have had an increasing impact on assisting research inspired by their potential some studies have attempted to use alternative machine learning ml models to solve the dam break flood problem including support vector machines svms batt and stevens 2013 artificial neural networks anns kazeminezhad et al 2010 time delay neural networks sun et al 2010 radial basis functions rbfs seyedashraf et al 2018 and combinations of these techniques ebtehaj et al 2018 ml has many similarities to the data assimilation da used in the development and validation of mathematical models in meteorology geophysics and hydrology over the past decades arcucci et al 2021 geer 2021 unified ml and da under a bayesian probabilistic framework and explore the crossover between ml and da in ml the learning problem can be formulated as the process of estimating associations between inputs outputs and parameters of a system using a limited number of observations and the learning process can be summarized as the minimization of a loss function brunton et al 2020 the evolution of anns towards increasingly deep neural network architecture with improved capabilities is summarized as deep learning dl a subfield of ml janiesch et al 2021 due to their ability to learn hierarchical representations dl techniques have emerged as an alternative to numerical solvers and offer a desirable balance between accuracy and computational cost carleo et al 2019 recurrent neural networks have been proven to be a good fit for the task due to their innate ability to capture temporal correlations many remarkable studies can be referred to for example srivastava et al 2015 use a convolutional encoder decoder architecture where a long short term memory lstm module is used to propagate the latent space to a future space the expected gradients method and the additive decomposition method were adopted to decipher the machine captured patterns and inner workings of lstm networks in flood prediction jiang et al 2022 variants of this technique have been successfully applied to the long term prediction of physical systems such as sliding objects ehrhardt et al 2017 and wave propagation sorteberg et al 2020 tompson et al 2017 employed convolution neural networks cnns to speed up the projection step in fluid flow simulations fotiadis et al 2020 investigated the performance of recurrent and convolutional deep neural network architectures to predict the propagation of surface gravity waves governed by the saint venant equations wherein the datasets contained images obtained by the rendering simulation results and the comparison indicated that both architectures can be equally effective in spatiotemporal prediction unlike the traditional numerical calculation methods for dam break flood modeling driven by physical models the traditional machine learning models mentioned above are mainly driven by pure data pure data driven methods are difficult to extrapolate several models as mentioned by fotiadis et al 2020 even the well adjusted ones only extrapolate to a certain extent based on training data and their errors also increase with the extrapolation time step this inherent problem owing to the lack of physical description in pure data driven methods is also highlighted in our previous study li et al 2022 where efforts were made to train a reservoir computing echo state network rc esn for predicting wave propagation of one dimensional dam break floods but only approximately 300 time steps could be well predicted in advanced moreover in many physical and engineering scenarios the available training data are sometimes limited resulting in difficulties in training satisfactory neural network models however these training data often imply some prior knowledge the exploration of which can be beneficial for training the models for instance cai et al 2022 proposed a novel hybrid model integrated with water balance equations with a deep learning algorithm for simulating groundwater levels guided through the incorporation of existing hydrological knowledge chadalawada et al 2020 and herath et al 2021a developed a rainfall runoff modeling toolkit and extended from the machine learning rainfall runoff model induction ml rr mi towards inducing semi distributed rainfall runoff models in our previous study we directly used the time series data of flow velocities and depths obtained by numerical simulation as the training data which was purely data driven and did apply mass and momentum equations which undoubtedly was a waste of information resources li et al 2022 at the same time as herath et al 2021b suggest that forecasting and modeling are distinct the pure data driven approach adopted in the previous study produces short term predictions and lacks generic modeling capabilities in this context our paper utilizes a deep learning algorithm framework embedded with physical information called a physics informed neural network pinn to simulate a dam break flood pinns were proposed and were first applied to solve the forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations pdes such as the allen cahn equation and navier stokes equation karniadakis et al 2021 raissi et al 2020 2019 yu et al 2022 pinns combine the advantages of data driven machine learning and physical models and can train models that automatically meet physical constraints under the condition of a small amount of training data these models have better generalization performance while ensuring accuracy and can predict important physical parameters pinns have continuously been explored and applied in many engineering fields remarkable studies include sahli costabal et al 2020 in the biomedical field fang and zhan 2020 in the materials field and goswami et al 2020 in the engineering field in the field of fluid mechanics in view of the importance of incompressible navier stokes equations in fluid mechanics some recent studies have focused on the solution and application of pinns to navier stokes equations notable studies have been performed by the following scholars jin et al 2021 established pinn network models of navier stokes equations in the form of velocity pressure and velocity vorticity models and used them to solve laminar flow and channel turbulence problems in addition to viscous incompressible flows pinns have been applied to many other areas of fluid mechanics such as aerodynamics and porous media flows mao et al 2020 used pinns to solve the forward and inverse problems of euler equations for high speed aerodynamic flows however despite the potential there are two major limitations of pinns jagtap et al 2020 particularly in predicting the dynamics of dam break floods the first is the accuracy of the solution due to the inaccuracy involved in solving high dimensional nonconvex optimization problems that may result in local minima jagtap et al 2020 the second limitation is the large training cost associated with deep neural networks and the long time integration of the governing pdes in the dam break flood problem the random uniform sampling method in the computational domain cannot obtain enough residual points in the high gradient region of the flood surface limiting its prediction accuracy when the number of the required residual training points is very large in large spatial and multiscale problems such as dam break flood problems it is computationally expensive to calculate the loss and gradient in every iteration therefore in the training process finding an appropriate selection method of residual points can effectively reduce the amount of calculation and improve the accuracy of pinns mao et al 2020 showed that the proper clustering of residual training points near a high gradient region can improve the solution accuracy in that region and thus prevent the propagation of errors to the whole domain for a large scale dam break problem residual training points are added in high gradient regions to improve the accuracy of the regions faced with a large computational domain the residual in each training iteration is limited as such in this paper instead of the traditional numerical calculation method we propose a pinn model that is embedded in the swes the model is trained with data consisting of prior known partial numerical solutions random residual point resampling and the proposed subregion specific sampling methods are used to train the model and the prediction effects of pure data driven and physically driven methods are compared under the same neural network structure varieties of dam break flood scenarios are used to illustrate the performance and computational efficiency of the proposed pinn based model 2 materials and methods in this paper we use numerical methods the fvm to generate partial fluid field data of dam break floods and verify the fvm by comparing it with analytical solutions in a later benchmark case these limited data are used to train the deep learning model embedded with 2d swes to predict the fluid field distribution at any position and time it should be mentioned that ideally measurement data from flume experiments or in site surveys are a good choice for training however due to the constraint of the equipment in data resolution and sampling efficiency the amount of measurement data is far from adequate for training the model and measurement errors are inevitable arising uncertainties and difficulties in the training process therefore in this paper we mainly train a model based on data from numerical solutions the solutions of the 2d depth averaged swes are approximated by a deep neural network based pinn which takes the spatial and temporal coordinates as inputs and predicts the corresponding velocity and depth i e t x y u v h a schematic illustration of the pinn for solving swes is shown in fig 1 furthermore two methods are proposed for the selection of residual points in the calculation domain in the process of model training the first one is the random residual point resampling method and the model of this method is called pinn res as shown in fig 2 d it should be noted that the calculation domain of dam break floods is large and the total number of residual points in each training iteration is limited due to the computing capacity of computers in the evolution process of a dam break flood the gradient of the flood surface in some regions is small but in some regions it is large as shown in fig 2 a c for areas with small gradients fig 2 b a good simulation can be achieved only by collecting an appropriate number of residual points while unnecessary residual points are a waste of computing resources nevertheless for regions with large gradients fig 2 a more residual points are required than for regions with small gradients therefore fewer residual points cannot simulate the changes in this region well to enhance the solution accuracy of the pinn concerning the residual point distribution we propose a subregion specific sampling method based on computational domain division as shown in fig 2 e where the pinn model using this residual point sampling method is called pinn add 2 1 two dimensional shallow water equations swes the 2d depth averaged swes have long been the widely accepted solution for simulating dam break flood behavior the swes can be derived from integrating the navier stokes equations over the flow depth by assuming a hydrostatic pressure distribution a sufficiently small channel slope and a constant fluid density with a free surface and bottom boundary toro 2002 are widely used for governing the dam break flows and are verified by different studies with experimental and field data bellos et al 1992 valiani et al 2002 these equations are a simplified model for approximating the depth and horizontal momentum of flows which are governed by the following time dependent system of nonlinear pdes in a conservative formulation with source terms 1 u t e adv x g adv y s where t denotes time x and y are cartesian coordinates u is the vector of the conserved physical variables e adv and g adv are flux vectors in the x and y directions respectively s represents the source vector these vectors are represented by 2 u h h u h v e adv hu h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v g adv hv h u v h v 2 g h 2 2 s s 0 s f 0 g h s 0 x g h s 0 y 0 g h s fx g h s fy where h is the water depth measured from the bed u and v are the depth averaged flow velocity components along the x and y directions respectively and g 9 81 m s 2 is the acceleration due to gravity s 0 x s 0 y are the bed slopes in the x and y direction and s fx s fy is the bed friction slopes in the x and y direction respectively it should be mentioned that the source terms include the bed slopes bed friction slopes viscosity turbulence wind effects and the coriolis term however in this paper to simplify the calculation the cases considered in this paper have a smooth horizontal bottom therefore they are neglected in this paper 2 2 physics informed neural network pinn the pinn seamlessly integrates the information from both the prior known samples and pdes by embedding the pdes into the loss functions of a neural network using automatic differentiation baydin et al 2015 karniadakis et al 2021 we consider the reference sample data that is as supervised data driven parts and the residual of the 2d swes as the unsupervised physics informed part in the loss function eq 3 where the reference sample data is the partial simulation results of dam break flood in a period which is specified in the following cases and analyzed in the discussion section the solutions of the 2d depth averaged swes are approximated by a deep neural network based pinn which takes spatial and temporal coordinates as inputs and predicts the corresponding velocity and depth i e t x y u v h a schematic illustration of the pinn for solving eq 1 is shown in fig 1 which consists of a fully connected network m t x y θ with θ a set of trainable weights w and a set of biases b and the pde residual network is f m t x y θ in m t x y θ there are 3 neurons in the input layer 3 neurons in the output layer and the middle is the hidden layer the output of the i th neuron in the first hidden layer was acquired as follows 3 u i σ w ti t w xi x w yi y b i the output of the j th neuron in the second hidden layer was given as follows 4 z j σ i 1 i i w ij u i b j the output of each layer is obtained by multiplying the output of the previous layer by a weight w plus a bias b here the nonlinear activation function σ is the hyperbolic tangent function tanh consistent with jin et al 2021 the residual network has the same parameters θ as the network represented by m t x y the shared parameters θ between the neural networks m t x y and f m t x y can be learned by minimizing the loss function 5 l λ s l s λ e l e where 6 l s 1 n s n 1 n s m t s n x s n y s n m s n 2 7 l e 1 n e i 1 3 n 1 n e e i n 2 in the above equations l s and l e represent the loss function components corresponding to the reference sample data and the residual of the 2d swes n s and n e denote the number of training data for different terms t s n x s n y s n m s n n 1 n s denotes the set of sample points for m t x y m s n u s n v s n h s n t is the given velocity and flow depth at the n th reference sample point and e i n represents the residual of the i th equation at the n th residual point in the entire domain for f m t x y in order to compute the residuals of the swe e 1 to e 3 the partial differential operators are computed using automatic differentiation ad which can be directly formulated in the deep learning framework e g using torch autograd in pytorch the weighting coefficients λ s and λ e are used to balance different terms of the loss function and accelerate convergence in the training process jin et al 2021 have relevant analysis in their study and also put forward the strategy of dynamic weight coefficient to simplify our paper adopted the simple fixed weighting coefficients λ s λ e 1 an adaptive optimization algorithm adam kingma and ba 2015 is used to minimize the loss function in eq 5 the parameters of the neural networks are randomly initialized using the xavier scheme glorot and bengio 2010 the solutions are obtained when the training of this network converges i e the total loss function reaches a very small value to implement the pinn efficiently several software libraries chen et al 2020 hennigh et al 2021 koryagin et al 2019 lu et al 2021 were specifically designed for physics informed machine learning based on the current machine learning libraries abadi et al 2016 chollet 2015 paszke et al 2019 in this paper we implement our algorithms using deepxde lu et al 2021 based on pytorch paszke et al 2019 2 3 residual point sampling method usually residual points are randomly sampled in the computational domain the deepxde lu et al 2021 provides three possible strategies 1 specify the residual points at the beginning of training and never change them 2 randomly select different residual points in each optimization iteration and 3 adaptively improve the location of the residual points during training for the dam break flood problem in this paper to obtain a better prediction effect it is necessary to increase the density of residual points and expand the sampling range of residual points in the computational domain so that the sampling residual points can be as close as possible to the points that can express the free surface variation in the dam break flood here we use the latter two residual point sampling strategies for the second strategy we perform random resampling every 100 optimization iterations as shown in fig 2 d and the pinn using this residual point sampling method is called pinn res we propose a subregion specific sampling method based on computational domain division as shown in fig 2 e where the pinn model using this residual point sampling method is called pinn add first the residual points are uniformly sampled in the computational domain to train the pinn model the computing domain including the time domain is divided then the trained model is used to predict the dense points in each divided region and calculate the residuals the residuals of all regions are sorted and the ten points n 1 n 10 with the largest residuals are selected and added to the initial residual points for model training as illustrated in fig 2 c the above steps are repeated until the average residual value of the ten points with the largest residuals is less than ε the prediction performance of the model is evaluated by the mean squared error mse and root mean square error rmse which are expressed as 8 mse 1 n i 1 z x i a n x i p r 2 9 rmse i 1 n x i a n x i p r 2 n where x a n and x p r represent the analytical and predicted values respectively and n is the number of outputs 3 results three classic cases are introduced to illustrate the proposed method as shown in fig 3 a c the first traditional dam break case has analytical solutions which will be used to provide reference data for the pinn model in section 3 1 benchmark test to verify the effect of the model in section 3 2 all three cases use numerical solutions to provide reference data the propagation directions of the three dam break waves gradually increase which is used to verify the model s ability to capture wave propagation in multiple directions 3 1 benchmark test to show how the pinn based model is trained to predict dam break floods the traditional case with analytical solutions in fig 3 a is used as a benchmark test the calculation conditions of this example are as follows the canal is l 1000 m long and 100 m wide and the dam body is located at x 500 m the dam thickness is ignored when t 0 the dam bursts instantly the river is flat bottom and frictionless the upstream and left and right banks are fixed wall boundaries and the downstream bank is a free outflow boundary the initial conditions are as follows the upstream water level h l is 5 0 m the downstream water level h r is 0 2 m and the flow velocity is 0 although the dam break flood process under the simplified condition is quite different from the actual dam break flood process on real terrain it can be used to test the accuracy of the mathematical model because of the existence of accurate analytical solutions therefore this example is widely used to verify the dynamics numerical model of swes lhomme et al 2010 xia et al 2010 in this case partial analytical solutions for 2d dam break floods are taken as reference samples for network training and the network prediction results are compared with them to verify the feasibility of the proposed method used to solve the dam break problem stoker 1992 derived an analytical solution of one dimensional instantaneous total dam break flow in a flat bottom frictionless rectangular section and in a prismatic channel the analytical solution can be found in supplementary a seyedashraf et al 2018 used the multilayer perceptron mlp system to train and solve twenty nine dam break scenarios and the results indicate that the mlp system is capable of modeling the shock and rarefaction wave information and propagation in this paper we compare the proposed method with the mlp model and the model is trained by the following parameters t is the time parameter and x and y are the distance parameters moreover the flow velocity in the x direction u the flow velocity in the y direction v and the flow depth h are considered the model outputs details of the trained mlp model can be found in supplementary b along with this paper in the analytical solution of the 2d dam break flood 5000 points in the first 10 s are selected as reference sample data for subsequent network model training the selected residual points are shown in fig 3 d f using the same reference sample we trained the mlp pinn res and pinn add models and compared their predictive effects within 100 s of the dam break flood they use the same number of network layers and nodes i e an input layer with 3 neurons an output layer with 3 neurons and four hidden layers with 50 neurons the training processes of the three individual models are as follows the training epoch of mlp is 100 pinn res trained 30 000 epochs and randomly resampled residual points every 100 epochs pinn add trained 3000 epochs then increased the residual points and trained 3000 epochs again until the average residual value of the 10 residual points with the largest residuals was less than ε 0 15 as shown in fig 3 d f fig 4 a d shows the corresponding loss functions for the three methods fig 4 a shows the mse loss of mlp as the training epoch changes fig 4 b shows the physical loss l e and reference sample loss l s of pinn res l e 1 l e 2 and l e 3 represent the loss of e 1 e 2 and e 3 given by the physical equation in fig 1 respectively l su l sv and l sh represent the loss of the flow velocity and flow depth given by the reference sample in fig 1 the mse loss variation as demonstrated in fig 4 a d implies that when pinn res converges the error is 10 10 2 greater than the error of pinn add after convergence and the accuracy of pinn add is better fig 4 e g shows the change in the total rmse of the predicted results with the prediction time at the flume locations of y 20 m y 50 m and y 80 m by the three methods the results demonstrate that the rmse of all three methods increases gradually with increasing prediction time while the rmse of pinn res increases from 20 50 s but improves after that in general the prediction error of mlp is greater than that of the other two methods and the prediction error of pinn add increases slightly fig 4 h j shows the errors of the flow velocity and flow depth predicted by the three methods fig 4 h shows the rmse values of flow velocity u in the x direction predicted by the three methods and the curve trend is similar to the total rmse value in fig 4 e g fig 4 i shows the rmse values of the flow velocity v in the y direction predicted by the three methods the errors of the three methods are all very small and mlp and pinn add are almost in good agreement with the analytical solutions results fig 4 j shows the rmse values of the flow depth h predicted by the three methods in which pinn performs better than mlp from the perspective of the total error flow velocity error and flow depth error the prediction effect of pinn is better than that of the mlp model among them the overall prediction error of pinn add is smaller than that of pinn res particularly for the prediction of the flow velocity but in the prediction of the flow depth the pinn add error increases with elapsed time to further compare the prediction effect we show a comparison of the predicted values of the three methods and the analytical solution in fig 5 at several moments and the location of y 50 in the first ten seconds the prediction results of both pinn methods are almost consistent with the analytical solution while the prediction effect of mlp is insufficient with the increase in prediction time the error between the predicted results of the three methods and the analytical solution increases in the flow velocity u prediction along the x direction the prediction results of mlp have a large error and both the prediction results of pinn res and pinn add have some errors with the analytical solutions it is obvious that mlp is difficult to achieve accurate prediction outside of training data however the results obtained by pinn add are much closer to the analytical solutions in the flow velocity v prediction along the y direction the prediction errors of the three methods are relatively small and the prediction results of pinn res and mlp are consistent with the analytical solution while the prediction results of pinn res have small errors in some positions for the prediction of flow depth h it can be seen that the mlp results are very different from the pinn results and the flow depth predicted by mlp is almost stagnant it is suggested that pinn res is more accurate in predicting the overall trend of the flow depth and pinn add can better capture shock waves 3 2 case studies the above prediction results using partial analytical solutions as reference data for model training prove the feasibility of using partially known data to predict the velocity and flow depth of a dam break flood however in many practical cases there is no corresponding analytical solution therefore it is no longer applicable to use a partial analytical solution as reference data for model training therefore partial flow velocity and flow depth results obtained by the fvm with numerical flux function of lax friedrichs type karthik 2022 are used as reference data for model training moreover it can be seen from fig 5 that the numerical solution is consistent with the analytical solution we use the partial results of the fvm as the reference data the other three dam break flood cases that are different from the abovementioned benchmark test are used to illustrate the model performance as shown in fig 3 a c the first dam break flood case in fig 3 a is similar to the benchmark test where the initial flow depth changes but the other conditions remain constant the initial water depth upstream is 6 m and the initial water depth downstream is 0 5 m in the second dam break flood case the water wave is shown in fig 3 b where the initial flow velocity is 0 and the initial flow depth is as follows 10 h x y 5 5 e x p x 500 2 y 50 2 10 3 we use 5000 points in the first ten seconds of the fvm as the reference data in the first case ε 0 31 when pinn add is executed 162 times adding 1620 residual points the average residual values of the ten maximum error points are less than ε other parts including the network structure network parameter initialization the optimization algorithm and so on are consistent with the parts of the previous partial analytical solution as the reference sample fig 6 a c shows the rmse prediction results of pinn res and pinn add in which res fvm and add fvm represent the error between the prediction results and the numerical solutions of pinn res and pinn add respectively as the prediction time increases the error increases gradually this implies that the prediction effect of flow velocity v and flow depth h is better the rmse of flow velocity u is larger especially for pinn res the prediction error of pinn add is smaller than that of pinn res for both the velocity and flow depth fig 6 d supports this finding in more detail the pinn add prediction results are in good agreement with the numerical solution especially in the prediction of flow velocity u in addition to the 2d dam break flood case in a rectangular flume fig 3 b we similarly predict the velocity and flow depth of the sudden release of a 2d water wave the fvm is also used to solve the case to obtain reference data for neural network training and comparison verification using the first ten seconds of numerical solution data as reference data the neural network is trained to predict the flow velocity and depth for 50 s in this case ε 0 024 is used when pinn add is executed 60 times adding 600 residual points the average residual values of the ten maximum error points are less than ε other parts including the network structure network parameter initialization the optimization algorithm and so on are consistent with the parts of the previous partial analytical solution as the reference sample fig 7 a c shows the rmse prediction results of pinn res and pinn add where res fvm and add fvm represent the error between the numerical results and the prediction solutions of pinn res and pinn add respectively this implies that with the increase in prediction time the prediction errors of the two models increase but the errors of pinn add are smaller than those of pinn res for both velocity prediction and flow depth prediction the rmse of the flow velocities is greater fig 7 d and fig 7 e show a comparison of the prediction results and fvm solution results when t 4 0499 s and t 15 3050 s respectively the prediction at t 4 4099 s is closer to the numerical solution than that at t 15 3050 s when t 15 3050 s the prediction results of flow velocity u and flow depth h are satisfactory but there is a certain error between flow velocity v and the numerical solution as seen from the rmse and the 2d prediction chart at the two moments pinn add has a better prediction effect than pinn res in the third dam break flood case a rectangular water column is released as shown in fig 3 c where the computing domain is 0 300 m 0 300 m the initial flow velocity is 0 and the initial flow depth is as follows 11 h x y 5 x y 100 200 2 0 2 x y o t h e r w i s e compared with the previous two cases the central rectangular dam break has velocity and flow depth changes in both directions therefore we use 93 123 points in the first twenty seconds of the fvm as the reference data considering that more residual points need to be added in this case pinn res trained 4100 epochs and randomly resampled residual points every 10 epochs pinn add trained 10 epochs then increased the residual points and trained 10 epochs again until the average residual value of the 20 residual points with the largest residuals was less than ε 0 15 when pinn add is executed 575 times adding 11 500 residual points the average residual values of the twenty maximum error points are less than ε other parts including the network structure network parameter initialization the optimization algorithm and so on are consistent with the benchmark test fig 8 a c shows the rmse prediction results of pinn res and pinn add where res fvm and add fvm represent the error between the numerical results and the prediction solutions of pinn res and pinn add respectively fig 8 d and fig 8 e show a comparison of the prediction results and fvm solution results when t 11 5112 s and t 15 3651 s respectively the rmse of both methods increases with the change of time and the rmse of flow depth at the initial moment is larger which may be caused by insufficient reference points at the initial moment in the first 20 s the rmse of pinn add is smaller than that of pinn res in fig 8 d the flow depth predicted by pinn add is closer to fvm than that predicted by pinn res especially the shape of the dam break wave which further indicates that pinn add can capture dam break wave characteristics better than pinn res after 20 s pinn res has a smaller rmse than pinn add because pinn res trains more residual points which makes it more consistent with the overall trend of dam break 4 discussions 4 1 comparison of the computational efficiency of the fvm pinn res and pinn add models it should be mentioned that the benchmark test and the three cases in this paper are simple scenarios of the dam break flood problem which can be easily solved using mature numerical models a question arises regarding the motivation of this paper why would we train a neural network for such simple cases with additional effort in this context we discuss the computational efficiency of the conventional fvm based numerical model and the proposed pinn based deep learning model the computational efficiency of a model can be evaluated by the computational complexity of the algorithm and the operation time in solving the same cases in this section we first compare the computational complexity of the fvm pinn res and pinn add models here the number of floating point operations flops molchanov et al 2017 is used to measure the computational complexity of the model for fully connected layers we compute flops as 9 f l o p s 2 i 1 o where i is the input dimension and o is the output dimension both pinn res and pinn add in this paper adopt the same network structure that is a fully connected network with four hidden layers the dimensions of the input and output layers are 3 and the dimensions of the hidden layer are 50 therefore the number of flops for pinn res and pinn add is 15397 for the numerical model the fvm based model is implemented in the matlab environment we use qian s method qian 2015 to calculate its number of flops the source code of which is open to the public in matlab central file exchange the results show that the total number of flops of the fvm is 57 204 455 in addition to flops after the network is trained we also compare the operation time of pinn prediction with fvm prediction as shown in fig 9 c while keeping the location point and time calculated by the pinn and fvm models consistent once the pinn based model finishes training the computational complexities of pinn res and pinn add are significantly less than that of the fvm and the prediction speeds of pinn res and pinn add are greatly improved compared with those of the fvm which are about 0 024 μ s per element and time step that is they are 3 orders of magnitude faster than the fvm considering the reduction in complexity and the operation time we confirm that the pinn based deep learning model has an obvious acceleration of over 3 4 orders of magnitude in computational efficiency compared to the traditional 2d fvm based numerical model 4 2 predictive effects of pinn res with the number of residual points and reference points as mentioned above the numbers of residual points and reference points are critical for model training to determine the predictive effects of pinn res with the numbers of residual points and reference points we use the analytic solution of dam break floods as an example in this section the prediction points are taken every second for every meter in the x direction and y direction the temporal mean rmse with the number of residual points is shown in fig 9 a the number of residual points here ranges from 50 to 15 000 the shaded regions represent one standard deviation from five independent runs with independent initial network parameters the number of reference points was set to 5 000 the result illustrates that an increase in residual points can improve the prediction effect to a certain extent among which the effect on the flow depth is more obvious similarly we investigate the prediction error with respect to the number of reference points in fig 9 b here the number of residual points is fixed at 10 000 the temporal mean rmse values of the velocity and flow depth solutions for pinn res with different reference points are given in table 1 the table and image suggest that the prediction effect is not solely related to the total number of reference points the number of input parameters of the model is three and the number of parameters has an impact on the prediction effect generally increasing the number of any parameter can improve the prediction accuracy to a certain extent 4 3 limitation and future work the method proposed in this paper still has some shortcomings which will be continuously improved in future work first in terms of application scenarios the method presented in this paper is only suitable for the simplest frictionless horizontal dam break problem and further research is needed to expand for naturally complex flows with complex topography such as multiphase flow problems and to realize the application of the method in solving real events the innovative physics based mass flow model by pudasaini and mergili 2019 as well as the application in solving real mass flow events such as mergili et al s mergili et al 2020a 2020b and allen et al s allen et al 2022 studies should be considered to better describe the real and complex multi phase mass flows in flood simulation under complex mountainous areas terrain needs to be taken into account which can be added as the input of the model meanwhile considering the difficulty in obtaining high precision terrain information the highest accuracy of the subregional adaptive sampling method proposed in this paper can only reach the accuracy of terrain information in this paper the vertically evenly distributed swe is embedded into the model to simulate dam break floods the three dimensional navier stokes equations can also be directly used to simulate dam break floods by writing the three dimensional equation into the loss function in the specific approach of the model the weight coefficient of the loss function has not been optimized in this paper which will be improved in future work to improve the accuracy of the model in addition the swe equation used in this paper is not scaled prior to computing the loss function the magnitude difference between flow velocity and flow depth may affect the effect of the model which would also be explored in subsequent studies moreover for the simulation of large scale disasters such as dam break floods the computational efficiency of the method in this paper still needs to be significantly improved and more reasonable subregional training and adaptive sampling methods can be adopted at the same time in terms of the evaluation of model effect only rmse was used in this paper to analyze the prediction accuracy but there are more evaluation indexes for hydrological models such as nash sutcliffe nse and mean absolute relative error mare chadalawada and babovic 2019 therefore the ongoing research still needs to evaluate the prediction effect of the model from various evaluation indexes furthermore the method still needs a certain amount of reference data for network training the results of numerical simulations are mainly used here instead of real experimental data our future research will consider using real data or adding other constraints such as initial conditions and boundary conditions to avoid using reference data these other constraints can also be expressed by embedding loss functions in addition the experimental data have measurement errors and other uncertain factors which are likely to have an impact on model training and these are problems to be solved in subsequent research 5 conclusions in this paper we propose a 2d dam break flood evolution prediction model based on the pinn two training methods residual point resampling and subregion specific sampling are used to predict the evolution of dam break floods the prediction results of pure data driven and physics combined models with the same network structure are compared on this basis the prediction of a dam break flood using a partial numerical solution is further realized moreover the prediction effect is analyzed for other initial flow depths such as water wave cases the summary is as follows 1 the 2d dam break flood prediction model based on pinn proposed in this paper can predict the evolution of dam break floods well with partially known reference data 2 with the same neural network structure and reference training data the dam break flood prediction model considering physical information performs better than the pure data driven model especially the prediction results outside the known reference data 3 the two residual point sampling methods mentioned in this paper can both predict the evolution of large scale disasters such as dam break floods under the condition of sampling a limited number of residual points in the computational domain well among them the resampling method can better predict the overall trend of flood evolution especially for positions with relatively gentle flood changes for locations where the flood violently changes the subregion specific sampling method is better 4 for practical cases such as dam break floods there is a lack of large reliable data for neural network training by using partially reliable numerical solutions as reference sample data the dam break flood prediction model based on a pinn can realize efficient prediction although the pinn res and pinn add models in this paper should have good accuracy and are efficient in the task of predicting dam break floods they still have great room for improvement in application scenarios model design model evaluation and other aspects and have great

1935,the computational prediction of flood dynamics is a long standing problem in hydrodynamics and hydrology until now conventional numerical models based on shallow water equations swes have been the dominant approaches here we show that by combining a data driven methodology with some general physical governing equations the resulting deep learning model can enable the prediction of the long term dynamics of dam break floods with satisfactory accuracy for this purpose we propose a deep learning model using a physics informed neural network pinn embedded in swes training data are reconstructed from prior known partial numerical solutions and a novel subregion specific sampling method that adapts well to the violent variations in flood surfaces various traditional cases of 2d dam break floods are used to illustrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed model the results show that the proposed pinn embedded model predicts the dam break flood dynamics well as observed in the numerical simulations based on swes and outperforms the pure data driven multilayer perceptron mlp model and a similar model with the traditional random sampling method we also demonstrate that the pinn embedded model improves the computational efficiency by over 3 4 orders of magnitude compared to the traditional 2d numerical solution of swes our study showcases how numerical simulation and deep learning techniques can be coupled to investigate the details of dam break floods keywords physical information neural networks subregion specific sampling method two dimensional prediction hydrodynamics dam break flood data availability i have share the link to my data and code at the attach files step 1 introduction in a flood induced dike failure or dam break event or after a sluice gate within a flood detention basin is opened a shock wave usually forms and then propagates forwards xia et al 2010 dam break flows can cause significant damage and in extreme events the loss of human life due to their high propagation speeds especially when they occur in highly populated rural or urban regions the processes of flood inundation caused by dam break flows can usually be described by two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic models xia et al 2010 wherein predicting the evolution of such processes is usually based on numerical simulations numerous numerical schemes have long been developed including advanced finite difference methods fdms luo and gao 2015 ortiz 2014 pudasaini and mergili 2019 triki 2014 finite volume methods fvms stecca et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 finite element methods fems lai and khan 2017 seyedashraf and akhtari 2017 and lagrangian methods akbari 2017 yang et al 2016 as solutions to the problem many methods are available for simulating dam break flows for example zhao et al 1996 presented a detailed review of a range of numerical methods developed for simulating dam break flows based on solving 2d shallow water equations swes nevertheless the need for the simultaneous computation of the governing equations considering the required iterations and constraints makes these numerical models computationally expensive lai and khan 2017 in addition it is costly to calibrate unknown parameters during the simulation of complex scenarios and usually needs trial and error adjusting moreover to obtain results with high accuracy these modeling techniques require extensive datasets and need to utilize finer grid forms near regions with high gradients seyedashraf et al 2018 recently artificial intelligence driven models based on various deep neural networks have had an increasing impact on assisting research inspired by their potential some studies have attempted to use alternative machine learning ml models to solve the dam break flood problem including support vector machines svms batt and stevens 2013 artificial neural networks anns kazeminezhad et al 2010 time delay neural networks sun et al 2010 radial basis functions rbfs seyedashraf et al 2018 and combinations of these techniques ebtehaj et al 2018 ml has many similarities to the data assimilation da used in the development and validation of mathematical models in meteorology geophysics and hydrology over the past decades arcucci et al 2021 geer 2021 unified ml and da under a bayesian probabilistic framework and explore the crossover between ml and da in ml the learning problem can be formulated as the process of estimating associations between inputs outputs and parameters of a system using a limited number of observations and the learning process can be summarized as the minimization of a loss function brunton et al 2020 the evolution of anns towards increasingly deep neural network architecture with improved capabilities is summarized as deep learning dl a subfield of ml janiesch et al 2021 due to their ability to learn hierarchical representations dl techniques have emerged as an alternative to numerical solvers and offer a desirable balance between accuracy and computational cost carleo et al 2019 recurrent neural networks have been proven to be a good fit for the task due to their innate ability to capture temporal correlations many remarkable studies can be referred to for example srivastava et al 2015 use a convolutional encoder decoder architecture where a long short term memory lstm module is used to propagate the latent space to a future space the expected gradients method and the additive decomposition method were adopted to decipher the machine captured patterns and inner workings of lstm networks in flood prediction jiang et al 2022 variants of this technique have been successfully applied to the long term prediction of physical systems such as sliding objects ehrhardt et al 2017 and wave propagation sorteberg et al 2020 tompson et al 2017 employed convolution neural networks cnns to speed up the projection step in fluid flow simulations fotiadis et al 2020 investigated the performance of recurrent and convolutional deep neural network architectures to predict the propagation of surface gravity waves governed by the saint venant equations wherein the datasets contained images obtained by the rendering simulation results and the comparison indicated that both architectures can be equally effective in spatiotemporal prediction unlike the traditional numerical calculation methods for dam break flood modeling driven by physical models the traditional machine learning models mentioned above are mainly driven by pure data pure data driven methods are difficult to extrapolate several models as mentioned by fotiadis et al 2020 even the well adjusted ones only extrapolate to a certain extent based on training data and their errors also increase with the extrapolation time step this inherent problem owing to the lack of physical description in pure data driven methods is also highlighted in our previous study li et al 2022 where efforts were made to train a reservoir computing echo state network rc esn for predicting wave propagation of one dimensional dam break floods but only approximately 300 time steps could be well predicted in advanced moreover in many physical and engineering scenarios the available training data are sometimes limited resulting in difficulties in training satisfactory neural network models however these training data often imply some prior knowledge the exploration of which can be beneficial for training the models for instance cai et al 2022 proposed a novel hybrid model integrated with water balance equations with a deep learning algorithm for simulating groundwater levels guided through the incorporation of existing hydrological knowledge chadalawada et al 2020 and herath et al 2021a developed a rainfall runoff modeling toolkit and extended from the machine learning rainfall runoff model induction ml rr mi towards inducing semi distributed rainfall runoff models in our previous study we directly used the time series data of flow velocities and depths obtained by numerical simulation as the training data which was purely data driven and did apply mass and momentum equations which undoubtedly was a waste of information resources li et al 2022 at the same time as herath et al 2021b suggest that forecasting and modeling are distinct the pure data driven approach adopted in the previous study produces short term predictions and lacks generic modeling capabilities in this context our paper utilizes a deep learning algorithm framework embedded with physical information called a physics informed neural network pinn to simulate a dam break flood pinns were proposed and were first applied to solve the forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations pdes such as the allen cahn equation and navier stokes equation karniadakis et al 2021 raissi et al 2020 2019 yu et al 2022 pinns combine the advantages of data driven machine learning and physical models and can train models that automatically meet physical constraints under the condition of a small amount of training data these models have better generalization performance while ensuring accuracy and can predict important physical parameters pinns have continuously been explored and applied in many engineering fields remarkable studies include sahli costabal et al 2020 in the biomedical field fang and zhan 2020 in the materials field and goswami et al 2020 in the engineering field in the field of fluid mechanics in view of the importance of incompressible navier stokes equations in fluid mechanics some recent studies have focused on the solution and application of pinns to navier stokes equations notable studies have been performed by the following scholars jin et al 2021 established pinn network models of navier stokes equations in the form of velocity pressure and velocity vorticity models and used them to solve laminar flow and channel turbulence problems in addition to viscous incompressible flows pinns have been applied to many other areas of fluid mechanics such as aerodynamics and porous media flows mao et al 2020 used pinns to solve the forward and inverse problems of euler equations for high speed aerodynamic flows however despite the potential there are two major limitations of pinns jagtap et al 2020 particularly in predicting the dynamics of dam break floods the first is the accuracy of the solution due to the inaccuracy involved in solving high dimensional nonconvex optimization problems that may result in local minima jagtap et al 2020 the second limitation is the large training cost associated with deep neural networks and the long time integration of the governing pdes in the dam break flood problem the random uniform sampling method in the computational domain cannot obtain enough residual points in the high gradient region of the flood surface limiting its prediction accuracy when the number of the required residual training points is very large in large spatial and multiscale problems such as dam break flood problems it is computationally expensive to calculate the loss and gradient in every iteration therefore in the training process finding an appropriate selection method of residual points can effectively reduce the amount of calculation and improve the accuracy of pinns mao et al 2020 showed that the proper clustering of residual training points near a high gradient region can improve the solution accuracy in that region and thus prevent the propagation of errors to the whole domain for a large scale dam break problem residual training points are added in high gradient regions to improve the accuracy of the regions faced with a large computational domain the residual in each training iteration is limited as such in this paper instead of the traditional numerical calculation method we propose a pinn model that is embedded in the swes the model is trained with data consisting of prior known partial numerical solutions random residual point resampling and the proposed subregion specific sampling methods are used to train the model and the prediction effects of pure data driven and physically driven methods are compared under the same neural network structure varieties of dam break flood scenarios are used to illustrate the performance and computational efficiency of the proposed pinn based model 2 materials and methods in this paper we use numerical methods the fvm to generate partial fluid field data of dam break floods and verify the fvm by comparing it with analytical solutions in a later benchmark case these limited data are used to train the deep learning model embedded with 2d swes to predict the fluid field distribution at any position and time it should be mentioned that ideally measurement data from flume experiments or in site surveys are a good choice for training however due to the constraint of the equipment in data resolution and sampling efficiency the amount of measurement data is far from adequate for training the model and measurement errors are inevitable arising uncertainties and difficulties in the training process therefore in this paper we mainly train a model based on data from numerical solutions the solutions of the 2d depth averaged swes are approximated by a deep neural network based pinn which takes the spatial and temporal coordinates as inputs and predicts the corresponding velocity and depth i e t x y u v h a schematic illustration of the pinn for solving swes is shown in fig 1 furthermore two methods are proposed for the selection of residual points in the calculation domain in the process of model training the first one is the random residual point resampling method and the model of this method is called pinn res as shown in fig 2 d it should be noted that the calculation domain of dam break floods is large and the total number of residual points in each training iteration is limited due to the computing capacity of computers in the evolution process of a dam break flood the gradient of the flood surface in some regions is small but in some regions it is large as shown in fig 2 a c for areas with small gradients fig 2 b a good simulation can be achieved only by collecting an appropriate number of residual points while unnecessary residual points are a waste of computing resources nevertheless for regions with large gradients fig 2 a more residual points are required than for regions with small gradients therefore fewer residual points cannot simulate the changes in this region well to enhance the solution accuracy of the pinn concerning the residual point distribution we propose a subregion specific sampling method based on computational domain division as shown in fig 2 e where the pinn model using this residual point sampling method is called pinn add 2 1 two dimensional shallow water equations swes the 2d depth averaged swes have long been the widely accepted solution for simulating dam break flood behavior the swes can be derived from integrating the navier stokes equations over the flow depth by assuming a hydrostatic pressure distribution a sufficiently small channel slope and a constant fluid density with a free surface and bottom boundary toro 2002 are widely used for governing the dam break flows and are verified by different studies with experimental and field data bellos et al 1992 valiani et al 2002 these equations are a simplified model for approximating the depth and horizontal momentum of flows which are governed by the following time dependent system of nonlinear pdes in a conservative formulation with source terms 1 u t e adv x g adv y s where t denotes time x and y are cartesian coordinates u is the vector of the conserved physical variables e adv and g adv are flux vectors in the x and y directions respectively s represents the source vector these vectors are represented by 2 u h h u h v e adv hu h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v g adv hv h u v h v 2 g h 2 2 s s 0 s f 0 g h s 0 x g h s 0 y 0 g h s fx g h s fy where h is the water depth measured from the bed u and v are the depth averaged flow velocity components along the x and y directions respectively and g 9 81 m s 2 is the acceleration due to gravity s 0 x s 0 y are the bed slopes in the x and y direction and s fx s fy is the bed friction slopes in the x and y direction respectively it should be mentioned that the source terms include the bed slopes bed friction slopes viscosity turbulence wind effects and the coriolis term however in this paper to simplify the calculation the cases considered in this paper have a smooth horizontal bottom therefore they are neglected in this paper 2 2 physics informed neural network pinn the pinn seamlessly integrates the information from both the prior known samples and pdes by embedding the pdes into the loss functions of a neural network using automatic differentiation baydin et al 2015 karniadakis et al 2021 we consider the reference sample data that is as supervised data driven parts and the residual of the 2d swes as the unsupervised physics informed part in the loss function eq 3 where the reference sample data is the partial simulation results of dam break flood in a period which is specified in the following cases and analyzed in the discussion section the solutions of the 2d depth averaged swes are approximated by a deep neural network based pinn which takes spatial and temporal coordinates as inputs and predicts the corresponding velocity and depth i e t x y u v h a schematic illustration of the pinn for solving eq 1 is shown in fig 1 which consists of a fully connected network m t x y θ with θ a set of trainable weights w and a set of biases b and the pde residual network is f m t x y θ in m t x y θ there are 3 neurons in the input layer 3 neurons in the output layer and the middle is the hidden layer the output of the i th neuron in the first hidden layer was acquired as follows 3 u i σ w ti t w xi x w yi y b i the output of the j th neuron in the second hidden layer was given as follows 4 z j σ i 1 i i w ij u i b j the output of each layer is obtained by multiplying the output of the previous layer by a weight w plus a bias b here the nonlinear activation function σ is the hyperbolic tangent function tanh consistent with jin et al 2021 the residual network has the same parameters θ as the network represented by m t x y the shared parameters θ between the neural networks m t x y and f m t x y can be learned by minimizing the loss function 5 l λ s l s λ e l e where 6 l s 1 n s n 1 n s m t s n x s n y s n m s n 2 7 l e 1 n e i 1 3 n 1 n e e i n 2 in the above equations l s and l e represent the loss function components corresponding to the reference sample data and the residual of the 2d swes n s and n e denote the number of training data for different terms t s n x s n y s n m s n n 1 n s denotes the set of sample points for m t x y m s n u s n v s n h s n t is the given velocity and flow depth at the n th reference sample point and e i n represents the residual of the i th equation at the n th residual point in the entire domain for f m t x y in order to compute the residuals of the swe e 1 to e 3 the partial differential operators are computed using automatic differentiation ad which can be directly formulated in the deep learning framework e g using torch autograd in pytorch the weighting coefficients λ s and λ e are used to balance different terms of the loss function and accelerate convergence in the training process jin et al 2021 have relevant analysis in their study and also put forward the strategy of dynamic weight coefficient to simplify our paper adopted the simple fixed weighting coefficients λ s λ e 1 an adaptive optimization algorithm adam kingma and ba 2015 is used to minimize the loss function in eq 5 the parameters of the neural networks are randomly initialized using the xavier scheme glorot and bengio 2010 the solutions are obtained when the training of this network converges i e the total loss function reaches a very small value to implement the pinn efficiently several software libraries chen et al 2020 hennigh et al 2021 koryagin et al 2019 lu et al 2021 were specifically designed for physics informed machine learning based on the current machine learning libraries abadi et al 2016 chollet 2015 paszke et al 2019 in this paper we implement our algorithms using deepxde lu et al 2021 based on pytorch paszke et al 2019 2 3 residual point sampling method usually residual points are randomly sampled in the computational domain the deepxde lu et al 2021 provides three possible strategies 1 specify the residual points at the beginning of training and never change them 2 randomly select different residual points in each optimization iteration and 3 adaptively improve the location of the residual points during training for the dam break flood problem in this paper to obtain a better prediction effect it is necessary to increase the density of residual points and expand the sampling range of residual points in the computational domain so that the sampling residual points can be as close as possible to the points that can express the free surface variation in the dam break flood here we use the latter two residual point sampling strategies for the second strategy we perform random resampling every 100 optimization iterations as shown in fig 2 d and the pinn using this residual point sampling method is called pinn res we propose a subregion specific sampling method based on computational domain division as shown in fig 2 e where the pinn model using this residual point sampling method is called pinn add first the residual points are uniformly sampled in the computational domain to train the pinn model the computing domain including the time domain is divided then the trained model is used to predict the dense points in each divided region and calculate the residuals the residuals of all regions are sorted and the ten points n 1 n 10 with the largest residuals are selected and added to the initial residual points for model training as illustrated in fig 2 c the above steps are repeated until the average residual value of the ten points with the largest residuals is less than ε the prediction performance of the model is evaluated by the mean squared error mse and root mean square error rmse which are expressed as 8 mse 1 n i 1 z x i a n x i p r 2 9 rmse i 1 n x i a n x i p r 2 n where x a n and x p r represent the analytical and predicted values respectively and n is the number of outputs 3 results three classic cases are introduced to illustrate the proposed method as shown in fig 3 a c the first traditional dam break case has analytical solutions which will be used to provide reference data for the pinn model in section 3 1 benchmark test to verify the effect of the model in section 3 2 all three cases use numerical solutions to provide reference data the propagation directions of the three dam break waves gradually increase which is used to verify the model s ability to capture wave propagation in multiple directions 3 1 benchmark test to show how the pinn based model is trained to predict dam break floods the traditional case with analytical solutions in fig 3 a is used as a benchmark test the calculation conditions of this example are as follows the canal is l 1000 m long and 100 m wide and the dam body is located at x 500 m the dam thickness is ignored when t 0 the dam bursts instantly the river is flat bottom and frictionless the upstream and left and right banks are fixed wall boundaries and the downstream bank is a free outflow boundary the initial conditions are as follows the upstream water level h l is 5 0 m the downstream water level h r is 0 2 m and the flow velocity is 0 although the dam break flood process under the simplified condition is quite different from the actual dam break flood process on real terrain it can be used to test the accuracy of the mathematical model because of the existence of accurate analytical solutions therefore this example is widely used to verify the dynamics numerical model of swes lhomme et al 2010 xia et al 2010 in this case partial analytical solutions for 2d dam break floods are taken as reference samples for network training and the network prediction results are compared with them to verify the feasibility of the proposed method used to solve the dam break problem stoker 1992 derived an analytical solution of one dimensional instantaneous total dam break flow in a flat bottom frictionless rectangular section and in a prismatic channel the analytical solution can be found in supplementary a seyedashraf et al 2018 used the multilayer perceptron mlp system to train and solve twenty nine dam break scenarios and the results indicate that the mlp system is capable of modeling the shock and rarefaction wave information and propagation in this paper we compare the proposed method with the mlp model and the model is trained by the following parameters t is the time parameter and x and y are the distance parameters moreover the flow velocity in the x direction u the flow velocity in the y direction v and the flow depth h are considered the model outputs details of the trained mlp model can be found in supplementary b along with this paper in the analytical solution of the 2d dam break flood 5000 points in the first 10 s are selected as reference sample data for subsequent network model training the selected residual points are shown in fig 3 d f using the same reference sample we trained the mlp pinn res and pinn add models and compared their predictive effects within 100 s of the dam break flood they use the same number of network layers and nodes i e an input layer with 3 neurons an output layer with 3 neurons and four hidden layers with 50 neurons the training processes of the three individual models are as follows the training epoch of mlp is 100 pinn res trained 30 000 epochs and randomly resampled residual points every 100 epochs pinn add trained 3000 epochs then increased the residual points and trained 3000 epochs again until the average residual value of the 10 residual points with the largest residuals was less than ε 0 15 as shown in fig 3 d f fig 4 a d shows the corresponding loss functions for the three methods fig 4 a shows the mse loss of mlp as the training epoch changes fig 4 b shows the physical loss l e and reference sample loss l s of pinn res l e 1 l e 2 and l e 3 represent the loss of e 1 e 2 and e 3 given by the physical equation in fig 1 respectively l su l sv and l sh represent the loss of the flow velocity and flow depth given by the reference sample in fig 1 the mse loss variation as demonstrated in fig 4 a d implies that when pinn res converges the error is 10 10 2 greater than the error of pinn add after convergence and the accuracy of pinn add is better fig 4 e g shows the change in the total rmse of the predicted results with the prediction time at the flume locations of y 20 m y 50 m and y 80 m by the three methods the results demonstrate that the rmse of all three methods increases gradually with increasing prediction time while the rmse of pinn res increases from 20 50 s but improves after that in general the prediction error of mlp is greater than that of the other two methods and the prediction error of pinn add increases slightly fig 4 h j shows the errors of the flow velocity and flow depth predicted by the three methods fig 4 h shows the rmse values of flow velocity u in the x direction predicted by the three methods and the curve trend is similar to the total rmse value in fig 4 e g fig 4 i shows the rmse values of the flow velocity v in the y direction predicted by the three methods the errors of the three methods are all very small and mlp and pinn add are almost in good agreement with the analytical solutions results fig 4 j shows the rmse values of the flow depth h predicted by the three methods in which pinn performs better than mlp from the perspective of the total error flow velocity error and flow depth error the prediction effect of pinn is better than that of the mlp model among them the overall prediction error of pinn add is smaller than that of pinn res particularly for the prediction of the flow velocity but in the prediction of the flow depth the pinn add error increases with elapsed time to further compare the prediction effect we show a comparison of the predicted values of the three methods and the analytical solution in fig 5 at several moments and the location of y 50 in the first ten seconds the prediction results of both pinn methods are almost consistent with the analytical solution while the prediction effect of mlp is insufficient with the increase in prediction time the error between the predicted results of the three methods and the analytical solution increases in the flow velocity u prediction along the x direction the prediction results of mlp have a large error and both the prediction results of pinn res and pinn add have some errors with the analytical solutions it is obvious that mlp is difficult to achieve accurate prediction outside of training data however the results obtained by pinn add are much closer to the analytical solutions in the flow velocity v prediction along the y direction the prediction errors of the three methods are relatively small and the prediction results of pinn res and mlp are consistent with the analytical solution while the prediction results of pinn res have small errors in some positions for the prediction of flow depth h it can be seen that the mlp results are very different from the pinn results and the flow depth predicted by mlp is almost stagnant it is suggested that pinn res is more accurate in predicting the overall trend of the flow depth and pinn add can better capture shock waves 3 2 case studies the above prediction results using partial analytical solutions as reference data for model training prove the feasibility of using partially known data to predict the velocity and flow depth of a dam break flood however in many practical cases there is no corresponding analytical solution therefore it is no longer applicable to use a partial analytical solution as reference data for model training therefore partial flow velocity and flow depth results obtained by the fvm with numerical flux function of lax friedrichs type karthik 2022 are used as reference data for model training moreover it can be seen from fig 5 that the numerical solution is consistent with the analytical solution we use the partial results of the fvm as the reference data the other three dam break flood cases that are different from the abovementioned benchmark test are used to illustrate the model performance as shown in fig 3 a c the first dam break flood case in fig 3 a is similar to the benchmark test where the initial flow depth changes but the other conditions remain constant the initial water depth upstream is 6 m and the initial water depth downstream is 0 5 m in the second dam break flood case the water wave is shown in fig 3 b where the initial flow velocity is 0 and the initial flow depth is as follows 10 h x y 5 5 e x p x 500 2 y 50 2 10 3 we use 5000 points in the first ten seconds of the fvm as the reference data in the first case ε 0 31 when pinn add is executed 162 times adding 1620 residual points the average residual values of the ten maximum error points are less than ε other parts including the network structure network parameter initialization the optimization algorithm and so on are consistent with the parts of the previous partial analytical solution as the reference sample fig 6 a c shows the rmse prediction results of pinn res and pinn add in which res fvm and add fvm represent the error between the prediction results and the numerical solutions of pinn res and pinn add respectively as the prediction time increases the error increases gradually this implies that the prediction effect of flow velocity v and flow depth h is better the rmse of flow velocity u is larger especially for pinn res the prediction error of pinn add is smaller than that of pinn res for both the velocity and flow depth fig 6 d supports this finding in more detail the pinn add prediction results are in good agreement with the numerical solution especially in the prediction of flow velocity u in addition to the 2d dam break flood case in a rectangular flume fig 3 b we similarly predict the velocity and flow depth of the sudden release of a 2d water wave the fvm is also used to solve the case to obtain reference data for neural network training and comparison verification using the first ten seconds of numerical solution data as reference data the neural network is trained to predict the flow velocity and depth for 50 s in this case ε 0 024 is used when pinn add is executed 60 times adding 600 residual points the average residual values of the ten maximum error points are less than ε other parts including the network structure network parameter initialization the optimization algorithm and so on are consistent with the parts of the previous partial analytical solution as the reference sample fig 7 a c shows the rmse prediction results of pinn res and pinn add where res fvm and add fvm represent the error between the numerical results and the prediction solutions of pinn res and pinn add respectively this implies that with the increase in prediction time the prediction errors of the two models increase but the errors of pinn add are smaller than those of pinn res for both velocity prediction and flow depth prediction the rmse of the flow velocities is greater fig 7 d and fig 7 e show a comparison of the prediction results and fvm solution results when t 4 0499 s and t 15 3050 s respectively the prediction at t 4 4099 s is closer to the numerical solution than that at t 15 3050 s when t 15 3050 s the prediction results of flow velocity u and flow depth h are satisfactory but there is a certain error between flow velocity v and the numerical solution as seen from the rmse and the 2d prediction chart at the two moments pinn add has a better prediction effect than pinn res in the third dam break flood case a rectangular water column is released as shown in fig 3 c where the computing domain is 0 300 m 0 300 m the initial flow velocity is 0 and the initial flow depth is as follows 11 h x y 5 x y 100 200 2 0 2 x y o t h e r w i s e compared with the previous two cases the central rectangular dam break has velocity and flow depth changes in both directions therefore we use 93 123 points in the first twenty seconds of the fvm as the reference data considering that more residual points need to be added in this case pinn res trained 4100 epochs and randomly resampled residual points every 10 epochs pinn add trained 10 epochs then increased the residual points and trained 10 epochs again until the average residual value of the 20 residual points with the largest residuals was less than ε 0 15 when pinn add is executed 575 times adding 11 500 residual points the average residual values of the twenty maximum error points are less than ε other parts including the network structure network parameter initialization the optimization algorithm and so on are consistent with the benchmark test fig 8 a c shows the rmse prediction results of pinn res and pinn add where res fvm and add fvm represent the error between the numerical results and the prediction solutions of pinn res and pinn add respectively fig 8 d and fig 8 e show a comparison of the prediction results and fvm solution results when t 11 5112 s and t 15 3651 s respectively the rmse of both methods increases with the change of time and the rmse of flow depth at the initial moment is larger which may be caused by insufficient reference points at the initial moment in the first 20 s the rmse of pinn add is smaller than that of pinn res in fig 8 d the flow depth predicted by pinn add is closer to fvm than that predicted by pinn res especially the shape of the dam break wave which further indicates that pinn add can capture dam break wave characteristics better than pinn res after 20 s pinn res has a smaller rmse than pinn add because pinn res trains more residual points which makes it more consistent with the overall trend of dam break 4 discussions 4 1 comparison of the computational efficiency of the fvm pinn res and pinn add models it should be mentioned that the benchmark test and the three cases in this paper are simple scenarios of the dam break flood problem which can be easily solved using mature numerical models a question arises regarding the motivation of this paper why would we train a neural network for such simple cases with additional effort in this context we discuss the computational efficiency of the conventional fvm based numerical model and the proposed pinn based deep learning model the computational efficiency of a model can be evaluated by the computational complexity of the algorithm and the operation time in solving the same cases in this section we first compare the computational complexity of the fvm pinn res and pinn add models here the number of floating point operations flops molchanov et al 2017 is used to measure the computational complexity of the model for fully connected layers we compute flops as 9 f l o p s 2 i 1 o where i is the input dimension and o is the output dimension both pinn res and pinn add in this paper adopt the same network structure that is a fully connected network with four hidden layers the dimensions of the input and output layers are 3 and the dimensions of the hidden layer are 50 therefore the number of flops for pinn res and pinn add is 15397 for the numerical model the fvm based model is implemented in the matlab environment we use qian s method qian 2015 to calculate its number of flops the source code of which is open to the public in matlab central file exchange the results show that the total number of flops of the fvm is 57 204 455 in addition to flops after the network is trained we also compare the operation time of pinn prediction with fvm prediction as shown in fig 9 c while keeping the location point and time calculated by the pinn and fvm models consistent once the pinn based model finishes training the computational complexities of pinn res and pinn add are significantly less than that of the fvm and the prediction speeds of pinn res and pinn add are greatly improved compared with those of the fvm which are about 0 024 μ s per element and time step that is they are 3 orders of magnitude faster than the fvm considering the reduction in complexity and the operation time we confirm that the pinn based deep learning model has an obvious acceleration of over 3 4 orders of magnitude in computational efficiency compared to the traditional 2d fvm based numerical model 4 2 predictive effects of pinn res with the number of residual points and reference points as mentioned above the numbers of residual points and reference points are critical for model training to determine the predictive effects of pinn res with the numbers of residual points and reference points we use the analytic solution of dam break floods as an example in this section the prediction points are taken every second for every meter in the x direction and y direction the temporal mean rmse with the number of residual points is shown in fig 9 a the number of residual points here ranges from 50 to 15 000 the shaded regions represent one standard deviation from five independent runs with independent initial network parameters the number of reference points was set to 5 000 the result illustrates that an increase in residual points can improve the prediction effect to a certain extent among which the effect on the flow depth is more obvious similarly we investigate the prediction error with respect to the number of reference points in fig 9 b here the number of residual points is fixed at 10 000 the temporal mean rmse values of the velocity and flow depth solutions for pinn res with different reference points are given in table 1 the table and image suggest that the prediction effect is not solely related to the total number of reference points the number of input parameters of the model is three and the number of parameters has an impact on the prediction effect generally increasing the number of any parameter can improve the prediction accuracy to a certain extent 4 3 limitation and future work the method proposed in this paper still has some shortcomings which will be continuously improved in future work first in terms of application scenarios the method presented in this paper is only suitable for the simplest frictionless horizontal dam break problem and further research is needed to expand for naturally complex flows with complex topography such as multiphase flow problems and to realize the application of the method in solving real events the innovative physics based mass flow model by pudasaini and mergili 2019 as well as the application in solving real mass flow events such as mergili et al s mergili et al 2020a 2020b and allen et al s allen et al 2022 studies should be considered to better describe the real and complex multi phase mass flows in flood simulation under complex mountainous areas terrain needs to be taken into account which can be added as the input of the model meanwhile considering the difficulty in obtaining high precision terrain information the highest accuracy of the subregional adaptive sampling method proposed in this paper can only reach the accuracy of terrain information in this paper the vertically evenly distributed swe is embedded into the model to simulate dam break floods the three dimensional navier stokes equations can also be directly used to simulate dam break floods by writing the three dimensional equation into the loss function in the specific approach of the model the weight coefficient of the loss function has not been optimized in this paper which will be improved in future work to improve the accuracy of the model in addition the swe equation used in this paper is not scaled prior to computing the loss function the magnitude difference between flow velocity and flow depth may affect the effect of the model which would also be explored in subsequent studies moreover for the simulation of large scale disasters such as dam break floods the computational efficiency of the method in this paper still needs to be significantly improved and more reasonable subregional training and adaptive sampling methods can be adopted at the same time in terms of the evaluation of model effect only rmse was used in this paper to analyze the prediction accuracy but there are more evaluation indexes for hydrological models such as nash sutcliffe nse and mean absolute relative error mare chadalawada and babovic 2019 therefore the ongoing research still needs to evaluate the prediction effect of the model from various evaluation indexes furthermore the method still needs a certain amount of reference data for network training the results of numerical simulations are mainly used here instead of real experimental data our future research will consider using real data or adding other constraints such as initial conditions and boundary conditions to avoid using reference data these other constraints can also be expressed by embedding loss functions in addition the experimental data have measurement errors and other uncertain factors which are likely to have an impact on model training and these are problems to be solved in subsequent research 5 conclusions in this paper we propose a 2d dam break flood evolution prediction model based on the pinn two training methods residual point resampling and subregion specific sampling are used to predict the evolution of dam break floods the prediction results of pure data driven and physics combined models with the same network structure are compared on this basis the prediction of a dam break flood using a partial numerical solution is further realized moreover the prediction effect is analyzed for other initial flow depths such as water wave cases the summary is as follows 1 the 2d dam break flood prediction model based on pinn proposed in this paper can predict the evolution of dam break floods well with partially known reference data 2 with the same neural network structure and reference training data the dam break flood prediction model considering physical information performs better than the pure data driven model especially the prediction results outside the known reference data 3 the two residual point sampling methods mentioned in this paper can both predict the evolution of large scale disasters such as dam break floods under the condition of sampling a limited number of residual points in the computational domain well among them the resampling method can better predict the overall trend of flood evolution especially for positions with relatively gentle flood changes for locations where the flood violently changes the subregion specific sampling method is better 4 for practical cases such as dam break floods there is a lack of large reliable data for neural network training by using partially reliable numerical solutions as reference sample data the dam break flood prediction model based on a pinn can realize efficient prediction although the pinn res and pinn add models in this paper should have good accuracy and are efficient in the task of predicting dam break floods they still have great room for improvement in application scenarios model design model evaluation and other aspects and have great

1936,rivers are the main way of mobilizing transforming and transporting of dissolved organic carbon to the ocean thus largely determining the features of the carbon cycle on the arctic shelf and in the arctic ocean as a whole seasonal variations in dissolved organic matter dom fluxes from land to sea have been well documented in the siberian river s deltas yet remarkably little is known about how dom varies with hydrograph within the rivers main stems the distribution of dom and its optical characteristics as well as the co2 fluxes between river water and the atmosphere in the main channel and tributaries of siberian rivers such as the lena the ob and the anadyr in summer july were studied the aim of this study was to investigate spatial changes in dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and dom composition based on its absorption properties along the riverine main stem to compare the dynamics of doc concentration and dom properties in different siberian rivers and to reveal the main factors determining its variability to evaluate the relationship of dom with carbonate chemistry of riverine waters the observed spatial variability of the investigated parameters in the river channel was strongly influenced by the river hydrograph along with landscape and geographical features of its catchment area the phase of river runoff differed significantly in the same time period in different river sections thus largely determining the quantitative and qualitative variations in the composition of dom in the ob river the inflow of water from its largest tributary the irtysh river is also an important factor of spatial variations during the summer low flow period less aromatic dom was found in river waters it was more photodegraded with a relatively low molecular weight of compounds compared to the high water period such dynamics is one of the factors that alter the carbonate chemistry of waters as well as the magnitude and direction of co2 fluxes between river water and the atmosphere higher doc concentrations and higher aromatic dom were found in the ob river waters compared to the waters of permafrost rivers the lena and the anadyr rivers which was caused by higher soil organic carbon content and its greater availability determined by the state of permafrost located in the river s watersheds a strong correlation between doc concentrations and the colored fraction of dom was established thus confirming the possibility of using the latter as a proxy of doc concentrations in siberian rivers the unique information obtained on the properties and variability dom which enters the rivers in different flow phases along the main stem allows a more accurate evaluation of the effect of changing climate on biogeochemical cycles in the arctic keywords siberian rivers dissolved organic carbon optical indices of dissolved organic matter carbonate system co2 fluxes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers are one of the main factors defining the hydrological and hydrochemical patterns of shelf seas their influence is most important on the artic shelf the arctic ocean that occupies only 1 of the world ocean volume receives 10 of the global river runoff aagaard and carmack 1989 anderson and amon 2015 rivers are the main way of mobilizing transforming and transporting of dissolved organic carbon doc to the ocean thus largely determining the features of carbon cycle on the arctic shelf and in the arctic ocean as a whole consequently the arctic ocean is an important global sink for terrestrial dissolved organic matter dom receiving more dom per unit volume than any other ocean basin in the world opsahl et al 1999 historical observations and climate model simulations demonstrate that the annual discharge of freshwater from the arctic rivers has increased significantly over the past several decades peterson et al 2002 shiklomanov et al 2021 the growing impact of the riverine water with high concentrations of dissolved carbon and strongly supersaturated by carbon dioxide co2 relative to the atmosphere may be an important component of future climate changes in the arctic region this influence is particularly relevant for the arctic ecosystems which are most vulnerable and sensitive to environmental changes that are most rapid in this region amap 2013 2017 2018 it should be noted that the catchment area of the arctic rivers is predominantly underlain by permafrost containing a huge pool of organic matter om hugelius et al 2020 pokrovsky et al 2015 schuur et al 2015 speetjens et al 2022 strauss et al 2016 2021 as the global climate warms there is a concern that thawing permafrost will expose om that was previously protected from decomposition causing a positive permafrost carbon feedback to climate hugelius et al 2014 schuur et al 2008 2015 part of the ancient permafrost om is transferred to the arctic rivers and further into the arctic ocean feng et al 2013 wild et al 2019 dom one of the key components of river runoff has a complex effect on aquatic ecosystems the scientific community has been widely discussing the potential role of terrigenous dom in modifying co2 fluxes both in river waters and on the arctic shelf chupakova et al 2018 denfeld et al 2013 pugach et al 2018 different mechanisms of dom transformation have been investigated photo and biodegradation both into smaller organic fractions and into the final product co2 zepp et al 1998 cory et al 2007 2014 2015 hansell et al 2004 holmes et al 2008 osburn et al 2009 spencer et al 2009 mann et al 2012 shirokova et al 2017 ward et al 2017 other ways of dom influencing on the aquatic ecosystems both protective functions that shield the biota from excessive solar radiation and the limiting factors that reduce availability of photosynthetically active radiation necessary for photosynthesis have also been studied coble 2007 burenkov et al 2001 the qualitative composition is the most important characteristic of dom since it allows evaluating its potential and the rate of degradation in rivers and further on in the arctic shelf optical characteristics of dom such as absorption coefficients and spectral slopes can serve as proxies for dom molecular weight and aromaticity which in turn can help to characterize the lability of dom coch et al 2019 helms et al 2008 neff et al 2006 spencer et al 2009 striegl et al 2005 weishaar et al 2003 a number of studies on the chromophorous properties of dom have been carried out in the largest arctic rivers to examine the ability of optical measurements to provide meaningful insights into terrigenous carbon export patterns and biogeochemical cycling across broad spatial scales in the arctic neff et al 2006 osburn et al 2009 stedmon et al 2011 fichot et al 2013 walker et al 2013 dubinenkov et al 2015 mann et al 2016 griffin et al 2018 and references therein the overwhelming part of these studies has been focused on in the deltas of the largest arctic rivers however the knowledge on the spatial variability across river s continuum is limited wherein the shallow streams and the river channel itself are the hot spots of om mobilization and transformation denfeld et al 2013 lauerwald et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 a large portion of freshly mobilized doc is rapidly lost in the upper reaches of the watersheds associated with substantial co2 release that is not accounted for in current carbon budgets raymond et al 2013 kaiser et al 2017 therefore studies of these inland waters provide for an extensive insight into the nature and extent of dom changes under the influence of numerous environmental factors several previous studies have been made on the spatial distribution and correlation between dom and its optical properties in the main channels of siberian arctic rivers neff et al 2006 mann et al 2012 2015 spencer et al 2015 frey et al 2016 perminova et al 2019 krickov et al 2021 pipko et al 2021 they are mostly based on the data obtained in the kolyma river waters only the three most recent works have discussed some optical characteristics of dom in separate sections of the main channel of two great siberian rivers the ob and the lena thus a comprehensive analysis of the features of doc spatial dynamics of and the qualitative composition of dom in the most full flowing part of the great siberian rivers the middle and lower reaches of the ob and lena rivers has not been performed studies of dom and its optical indices have not previously been carried out for the waters of the anadyr river here we study doc concentrations and dom characteristics in the main stems of three siberian rivers the ob river limited spread of continuous permafrost in the catchment area the lena and the anadyr rivers watersheds predominantly underlain by continuous permafrost in the course of most relevant hydrological periods seasonal floods and summer base flow the aim of this study is 1 to investigate spatial changes in doc concentrations and dom composition based on its absorption properties along the riverine main stem throughout the summer base flow season and seasonal flood 2 to compare the dynamics of doc concentration and dom properties in different siberian rivers and to reveal the main factors determining its variability 3 to evaluate the relationship of dom with carbonate chemistry of riverine waters 2 study area the studies were carried out in the lower and middle reaches of the lena river and its tributaries the aldan and the vilyui in july 2017 as well as in the lower and middle reaches

main runoff is formed in the mountains of the south eastern siberia in the lower reaches the maximum water discharge exceeds the annual average by 4 5 times forest fires most frequent in the catchment area of the river s middle reaches can play a potential role in the dynamics of carbon fluxes a significant amount of carbon is contained in permafrost soils of boreal forest ecosystems filipchuk et al 2020 where it is currently protected from decomposition the fires destroy the moss and surface organic layers of soil resulting in better absorption of solar radiation and thus allowing the heat to penetrate into deeper soil layers genet et al 2013 chen et al 2021 increased frequency of fires in the arctic tundra accelerates the northward migration of boreal trees which can accelerate the positive feedback associated with the release of carbon from the permafrost jafarov et al 2013 chen et al 2021 at the same time a number of researchers suppose that fires can sequester the total amount of dissolved organic carbon entering aquatic ecosystems by reducing the volume of biomass in the water catchment areas i e by burning out the topsoil amon et al 2012 vonk et al 2015 filipchuk

discharge exceeds the annual average by 2 6 times https arcticgreatrivers org data the floods in the middle ob start in the second half of april and in the lower ob in late april they continue due to

with a 1 cm quartz cuvette over the spectral range from 200 to 600 nm at 1 nm intervals milli q millipore water was used as the reference for all samples measurements were made after samples were equilibrated to the laboratory temperature in order to minimize temperature effects several optical indices were calculated to investigate dom characteristics including absorption coefficients at 254 nm a 254 spectral slopes s275 295 and s350 400 the spectral slope ratio sr calculated as the ratio between s275 295 and s350 400 and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva the absorption coefficient a λ m 1 was calculated using equation a λ 2 303aλ l where aλ is optical density at wavelength λ and l is the cuvette path length in meters the absorption coefficients at 254 nm a 254 were chosen to quantify the concentrations of cdom frey et al 2016 cdom spectral slopes were calculated within log transformed absorption spectra as a λ a λref e s λ λref where a λ is the absorption coefficient at a specified wavelength a λref is the absorption coefficient at reference wavelength λref and s is a spectral slope helms et al 2008 s275 295 differs between cdom sources and has been shown to be inversely correlated to the average molecular weight of dom the slope of the short wavelength range 275 295 nm can be measured with high precision appears to be particularly sensitive to shifts in molecular weight or dom sources or both helms et al 2008 in general s275 295 values of the high molecular weight fraction of the cdom pool are lower and indicative of a terrestrial dom sources whereas s275 295 values of the low molecular weight fractions are generally higher and indicative of a more degraded and or autochthonous source helms et al 2008 stedmon et al 2011 fichot et al 2013 walker et al 2013 s350 400 is also sensitive to the shift of molecular weight and its higher values indicate lower weight decreasing aromaticity and higher bioavailability of dom helms et al 2008 hansen et al 2016 bruhn et al 2021 lower s350 400 values are also associated with higher heterotrophic microbial activity matsuoka et al 2015 sr is negatively correlated to dom molecular weight and aromaticity higher sr values are associated with photodegradation and microbial alteration of dom as well as its high bioavailability helms et al 2008 speetjens et al 2022 it should be noted that frey et al 2016 found that the relationship between bioavailable dom concentrations and sr showed a distinct negative trend in some inland waters suva is defined as the uv absorbance of a water sample at 254 nm normalized for doc concentration and used to estimate the degree of aromaticity in bulk cdom weishaar et al 2003 since aromatic compounds absorb more light in the uv visible region of the spectrum higher suva values indicate increased aromaticity from allochthonous inputs and lower suva values indicate a decrease in aromaticity and a more autochthonous or modified terrestrial cdom source weishaar et al 2003 walker et al 2013 ph was measured on board using potentiometric technique dickson and goyet 1994 on the nbs scale using a combined electrode calibrated against hanna buffer solutions ph 4 00 7 03 9 22 at 20 c accuracy of ph measurements was 0 02 ph units total alkalinity at was determined on board using titration technique a sample of 25 ml of water was titrated with 0

precision of 3 μmol kg 1 exact concentration of hcl for alkalinity determination was found using titration with a standard solution of na2co3 prepared by a weight of na2co3 of 99 995 purity dickson and goyet 1994 pavlova et al 2008 other carbonate system parameters dissolved co2 and partial pressure of co2 pco2 were calculated using co2sys program version 2 3 pierrot et al 2006 water air co2 fluxes were calculated according to wanninkhof 2014 hourly wind speed was used data on discharges at gauging stations were taken from the websites arcticgro shiklomanov et al 2021 arcticrims https rims unh edu and federal agency for water resources of the russian federation https gmvo skniivh ru mean annual air temperatures of drainage basins were taken from https psl noaa gov soil characteristics from national soil atlas of the russian federation https soil db ru soilatlas 3 2 statistical analyses normality of data sets was tested using the kolmogorov smirnov normality statistical test k s test to determine the difference in means of two populations we applied the welch s two sample t test to measure the relationship between two variables we used the pearson s correlation coefficient for normally distributed data and the spearman rank correlation if the data were not normally distributed 4 results concentrations of doc and optical characteristics of dom in the main stem and in some largest tributaries of the lena and the ob rivers as well as in waters of the anadyr river were identified in the course of this research analysis of the river hydrograph shows that the research carried out in the main channel of the rivers covered different phases of the discharge figs 2 3 the anadyr river was an exception the river was characterized by increased water content throughout the whole study area summer rain floods overlapped with the snow melting in the upper reaches of the river doc concentrations in the lena river waters decreased markedly from south to north fig 4 and the largest variations were identified in the middle reaches table 2 in contrast increased doc concentrations were found in the northward direction of the ob with maximum values in the waters of its main tributary the irtysh fig 4 the maximum variability was identified in the middle reaches table 2 comparison of spectral characteristics of dom showed both their significant dynamics in the main stems of individual rivers and significant differences between the rivers absorption of dom a 254 was significantly higher in the ob waters compared to the lena and anadyr rivers it also showed heterogeneity in different sections of the rivers and their tributaries fig 5 table 2 other calculated spectral characteristics of dom were also significantly different both in the waters of three different rivers and in individual sections of each river and its tributaries fig 5 table 2 the values of cdom in the rivers and tributaries showed a similar distribution to doc revealing a stable correlation between these parameters though of different intensity depending on the river section fig 6 the correlation coefficient between doc and cdom in river waters was 0 97 for the entire set of data in the ob s main stem the correlation coefficient between doc and cdom was 0 97 in the middle reaches also 0 97 and in the lower reaches it comprised 0 31 in the lena s main stem it was 0 96 in the middle reaches 0 85 and 0 93 in the lower reaches thus the minimum correlation coefficients were calculated for the waters of the lower ob and middle reaches of the lena fig 6 comparison of doc and cdom in the same value range in the different rivers shows that cdom is slightly depleted in the lena river which is visible in the lower cdom to doc ratio fig 6 the relationships between doc and cdom for the ob and lena samples exhibit positive intercepts on the y axis and thus indicate nonchromophoric fractions of doc in the ob and lena which are equivalent to 1 46 mg l 1 and 1 30 mg l 1 respectively similar landscape geographical characteristics of the lena and anadyr rivers catchment areas the identified similarity of dom absorption spectra in the waters of these rivers and a strong correlation between doc and cdom in the lena river waters allowed calculating doc values for the anadyr river waters using an equation that links doc and cdom values in the lena river waters the calculated mean doc concentration in the main stem of the anadyr river was 6 23 mg l 1 with a variability range from 5 51 to 7 43 mg l 1 the minimum doc concentration was calculated for the belaya river which is a mountain tributary of the anadyr river table 2 the values of carbonate system parameters dissolved co2 and at observed in the river waters were significantly different both in different rivers and in individual sections of each river table 2 fig 4 the highest mean and absolute values of dissolved co2 and at were measured in the waters of the ob river with continuous permafrost covering only a small area of the basin the minimum mean and absolute co2 and at values were identified in the waters of the anadyr river with the catchment area completely underlain by continuous permafrost 5 discussion 5 1 spatial variability of doc and optical characteristics of dom in the rivers 5 1 1 the lena river the study showed a large variability in the content and composition of dom in the waters of siberian rivers in summer july as previously stated the study in the main stem of the lena river was carried out throughout its middle and lower reaches absolute and mean values as well as the value amplitudes of the surveyed parameters were maximal in the middle reaches figs 4 5 table 2 taking into account the lack of significant spatial variability in vegetation types and permafrost in the river basin table 1 fig 1 dynamics of the river hydrograph was taken as the main reason for spatial variability studies in the middle reaches of the river coincided with the beginning of a high summer rainfall flood fig 3 high rainfall floods are characteristic of this season s water regime of the lena river which is formed under the influence of the vitim and olekma its right bank tributaries sokolov 1952 however the summer rain flood was particularly intense in july 2017 surpassing the summer flood volumes the water level during the rain flood was almost twice as high as the long term average for 2000 2021 and approached the absolute maximum for this period in this section https allrivers info gauging station tabaga as a consequence of monsoon rains the main stem rapidly received a large amount of fresh dom from various sources due to the high connectivity of the hydrological network during this period optimal temperatures and vegetation conditions the air temperature was maximal accompanied by an increase in the depth of seasonally thawed layers high productivity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and near maximum microbial activity shogren et al 2020 predicted increases in the amount and frequency of summer rainfall are expected to increase om fluxes in arctic catchment areas beel et al 2021 it is important to note that the middle section of the river receives the biggest number of large tributaries forming the main part of the river flow at the same time in the middle reaches not including the left bank vilyui runoff the mountainous right bank part accounts for 96 of the runoff kosheleva et al 2006 thus the mountainous topography was also an additional factor accelerating the transit of dom into the middle reaches of the river rapid flush out of large amounts of carbon from the upper organogenic soil horizons and short residence time of dom in the river determined its characteristics a large amount of labile high aromatic and high molecular weight terrigenous dom including freshly formed one entered the main river channel in its middle reaches this is evidenced by both high absorption coefficients in the shortwave spectrum range and minimal spectral slopes and their ratios doc concentrations were maximal in this section of the river table 2 the presence of labile dom was also confirmed by the highest values of pco2 as well as by the minimum concentrations of dissolved oxygen thus indicating intensive processes of om degradation pipko et al 2021 lower s350 400 values were also observed here indicating high microbial activity matsuoka et al 2015 we can suppose that the presence of fresher dom could also be caused to some extent by extensive development of ic in the catchment area of the river middle reaches fig 1 the ic is most exposed to thermal impacts and contains a large amount of ancient labile om vonk et al 2015 given the maximum seasonal air temperatures and the high hydrological connectivity of the river network during the rains it can be assumed that a part of this freshly released carbon can be transported into the lena river channel thus this section is also likely to receive the permafrost dom from the upper horizons of ic that avoided the thawing freezing cycle in the previous periods the presence of discontinuous permafrost in the upper reaches of the river fig 1 table 1 may also have contributed to the increase in doc concentrations in the middle reaches of the lena river during the flood event high variability of the studied parameters in the river s middle reaches was partly determined by the water characteristics of its largest tributaries the vilyui swampy in yakut https water rf ru and the aldan a rocky place in evenki https water rf ru despite the fact that in contrast to the waters of the lena middle reaches the hydrograph in the mouths of these rivers corresponded to the summer base flow fig 3 the doc concentrations measured in the aldan and the vilyui differed more than by the factor of two and other optical parameters were also significantly different figs 4 5 table 2 comparison of the optical characteristics showed that the aldan waters along with low concentrations of doc caused by the runoff phase and by the soil features and the catchment area landscape the aldan flows mainly in mountainous terrain with very few swamps in the river basin contained the minimal amount of cdom for the entire lena river catchment area increased values of s275 295 and minimal suva indicated a lower content of aromatic compounds in the dom composition and its lower molecular weight maximum sr values also indicated a lower molecular weight and probably its higher bioavailability in comparison with dom in the vilyui waters table 2 which confirms the differences in sources of dom and degrees of dom degradation during the study period the aldan waters were characterized by extremely low content of suspended particulate matter along with minimal concentrations of doc pipko et al 2021 which triggered more intense photodegradation of dom and contributed to the development of primary production processes the detected high values of s275 295 the highest for all watercourses under study and reduced suva could be also caused by the presence of autochthonous dom the data showing the development of photosynthetic activity in the summer season in the amga river the largest left bank tributary of the aldan river gabyshev and gabysheva 2011 indirectly prove the probability of autochthonous matter contribution to the aldan dom pool thus the observed distribution of spectral characteristics may have been caused by intra vitam excretions of algae and macrophytes low s350 400 and high sr bruhn et al 2021 matsuoka et al 2015 speetjens et al 2022 similar compounds may also appear in the aquatic environment after plant death for example as a result of lysis and autolysis of phytoplankton cells matsuoka et al 2015 novikov and kharlamova 2016 the vilyui is a tributary of the lowland left bank part of the lena basin it flows through a wide swampy lowland and has a low and wide floodplain channel https water rf ru the presence of peat lands and continuous contact with the soil cover provide for increased concentrations of dissolved minerals and organic substances in the left bank tributaries kosheleva et al 2006 consequently the waters of this tributary contain higher content of dom and its colored fraction table 2 the fivefold excess of suspended particulate matter concentration and more than twofold excess of doc in the vilyui waters compared to the aldan pipko et al 2021 could be one of the factors reducing the level of dom photodegradation in this tributary table 2 compared to the middle reaches doc and cdom decreased in the lower reaches table 2 combined with increasing s275 295 and decreasing suva our results are indicative of a progressive photochemical degradation of dom downstream helms et al 2008 the highest values of s350 400 observed here could be indicative of lower microbial activity matsuoka et al 2015 taking into account the significant homogeneity of the vegetation cover poor tundra vegetation only in the northern coastal part of the basin and the presence of discontinuous permafrost only in the upper reaches of the river fig 1 the observed significant changes in characteristics of the main stem waters were caused by the river hydrograph in the lower reaches the study included the samples of summer base flow in which dom is more degraded as a result of transformation in deep soil layers and due to longer residence time in the riverine water moreover the flood waters showed weaker correlations between doc and cdom fig 6 caused by rapid flush out of fresh dom from different parts of the catchment area its rapid entry directly into the waters of the main channel without significant transformation in the course of transportation and the influence of large tributaries with individual sets of inherent spectral characteristics 5 1 2 the ob river analysis of doc spatial distribution and dom optical characteristics in the ob river main stem showed significant quantitative differences doc concentrations in two river sections differed almost by a factor of two and cdom content in the lower reaches was twice as high as its concentration in the middle reaches table 2 to some extent these dynamics were caused by the river hydrograph fig 3 unlike the lena where the spring summer flood has a very distinctive character very intense and short in time the ob flood is characterized by a wide and long peak in the middle reaches of the ob we studied the waters entering the rivers during recession of spring summer flood and in the lower reaches the work was carried out during the peak of spring summer flood fig 3 in the lower reaches we studied the waters that entered the river during the period of intense thawing of the upper layer of peat and forest litter of wetland forests and increased removal of om from the swamps the most important source of dom berezin and parshina 2017 inflow of the irtysh waters was yet another important modulating factor perminova et al 2019 pipko et al 2019 kolesnichenko et al 2021 at the confluence its contribution accounted for about ¼ of the water flow 6 4 thousand m3 sec 1 at khanty mansiysk and 24 2 thousand m3 sec 1 at belogorye fig 3 the irtysh waters were more turbid with a large amount of dom table 2 differences between the ob and irtysh waters were identified even visually fig 7 observed optical characteristics table 2 indicated that qualitative composition of dom in the lower and middle reaches of the ob was also different thus on average the waters in the lower reaches contained more aromatic dom with relatively higher molecular weight compared to those in the middle reaches table 2 but it is important to emphasize that the freshest high molecular weight dom s275 295 values were the lowest here ranging from 13 4 to 13 7 10 3 nm 1 was found in the lower part of the middle reaches before the ob river s confluence with the irtysh river which is maximally influenced by peat bogs high dispersion of optical characteristics fig 5 confirms the diversity of dom sources in this section of the river this fact reaffirms the conclusion made in perminova et al 2019 that the freshest terrigenous dom enters the river from peatlands differences in the qualitative composition of dom between different river sections were caused by the presence of flood related dom in the lower reaches partially transformed as a result of prolonged presence in the main stem and by the irtysh waters with distinctive characteristics table 2 the gradual transition of water regime in the middle reaches of the river in the phase of summer low water when the surface runoff from swamps decreased dramatically berezin and parshina 2017 and the infiltration of solutions into the soil increased with an increase in the depth of seasonal thaw layer also determined the observed spatial variability in general probable increasing of dom bioavailability in the middle reaches increased values of sr and decreased values of s350 400 speetjens et al 2022 may result from its degradation and decrease in molecular weight and aromaticity higher values of s275 295 and lower suva and due to a more important role of bacteria in the production of dom during the recession of the flood kaiser et al 2017 matsuoka et al 2015 dom produced by them is bioavailable and is utilized fast enough kawasaki and benner 2006 kaiser et al 2017 absence of the swamps and higher groundwater input in the south of the study area pipko et al 2019 also caused changes in dom composition table 2 the maximal differences in dom content were found in the ob tributaries the irtysh and the tom rivers table 2 figs 4 6 flat relief and excessive moisture of the irtysh river s drainage basin cause wide distribution of swamps and lakes during the study the irtysh waters were still characterized by high water content but the flow rate was lower in comparison with the flood peak 5980 and 8990 m3 sec 1 respectively as noted above the highest concentrations of doc were found in the irtysh waters among the rivers of the ob catchment area the high values were determined by characteristics of the catchment soils where the content of organic carbon in the upper layer was estimated as ultrahigh https soil db ru soilatlas as well as by the river s hydrograph moreover the irtysh is exposed to a significant anthropogenic load it is polluted with phenols and petroleum products mikhailova and chemagin 2016 radelyuk et al 2022 according to table 2 and the previously mentioned data perminova et al 2019 pipko et al 2019 the irtysh waters had an expected impact on optical characteristics of dom in the ob downstream waters in the tom river studies were conducted during the summer low flow conditions fig 3 concentrations of doc and cdom in the tributary were minimal for the investigated waters according to spectral characteristics dom composition was characterized by lower molecular weight compared to other watercourses as well as the highest bioavailability and low aromaticity table 2 distribution of optical characteristics of dom indicated that the sources of dom in the tom river differed from other waters of the ob basin the tom feeding regime was also significantly different from the rest of the basin the area of swamps and peat lands was minimal here and the contribution of groundwater which is rather high in the tom became even more significant during the decrease of surface runoff autochthonous dom is assumed to play a significant role in the composition of dom in this tributary just like in the case of the aldan increased role of primary production processes was confirmed by chlorophyll a concentrations measured during the studies pipko et al 2019 its concentrations in the tom waters exceeded its content in the ob main channel more than threefold 49 µg l 1 and 16 µg l 1 respectively at the same time the degree of water saturation with oxygen exceeded 106 which is also indicative of intensive om production 5 1 3 the anadyr river studies in the river were conducted during the period of snow melting that coincided with rain flooding thus resulting in increased water level of the river dudarev et al 2015 the cdom values was approximately 1 3 times as low as compared to lena river floodwaters and less than a half as high compared to the ob river waters table 2 as noted above close correlation between doc and cdom in the river waters fig 4 as well as the similarity of absorption spectra fig 5a and the similarity of landscape geographical characteristics location of the lena and anadyr basins in zone of widespread permafrost fig 1 allowed us to calculate doc content in the anadyr waters via the equation linking doc and cdom in the lena river in july 2017 table 2 it should be noted that these are the first estimates of doc content in waters of the east siberian permafrost anadyr river small variations in doc and optical indices of dom were found in the main stem of the anadyr river table 2 figs 4 5 it can probably be attributed to the smaller river length and its catchment area its location in the same climatic zone with the same vegetation type as well as the high extent of permafrost in the entire basin nevertheless the minimum values of cdom and doc in the belaya river one of the large tributaries of the anadyr river were detected according to optical characteristics low aromatic and low molecular weight dom was found in the tributary table 2 the observed dynamics were caused by the reduced water discharge in the belaya river corresponding to the summer low water period as well as the low content of om in the soils of its catchment due to the thin organic layer and minimal presence of swamps https soil db ru soilatlas 5 2 comparison of dom variability and its optical characteristics in rivers as noted above catchment areas of the studied rivers differed significantly primarily in the extension of permafrost in the catchment as well as in a number of other landscape and geographic characteristics table 1 the lena and the anadyr basins share some similarities they as so called permafrost rivers with the permafrost undelaying up to 100 and maat below zero the ob basin has striking differences the continuous permafrost covers about 1 of the area and the maat is above zero comparison of average doc concentrations and spectral characteristics of dom in the summer season july showed that the content of doc and cdom in the ob river was maximal among the three rivers suva values were also maximal in the ob waters while the s275 295 and sr values were minimal thus indicating the presence of fresher high molecular weight and more aromatic dom in the ob waters compared to the lena and anadyr waters during the surveyed period table 2 a few factors contributed to that 1 higher pool of om in soils high and ultra high levels https soil db ru soilatlas determined by the presence of a large peatlands in the ob catchment table 1 the permafrost zone of the ob river drainage basin shows the highest soil carbon pools exceeding the values of 70 kg m 2 in the 0 1 m layer and reaching the values of 150 260 kg m 2 in the 0 3 m layer hugelius et al 2014 moreover in the main part of the ob basin the level of organic carbon in the upper humus accumulative soil horizons is estimated as very high and ultra high from 7 to 20 to over 20 https soil db ru soilatlas note that the presence of swamps as shown in frey and smith 2005 has a determining effect on the dom content in river waters provided that maat is above 2 c table 1 2 higher availability of soil om as continuous permafrost is practically absent both maat and summer temperatures are higher and the warm period is longer in the ob catchment it is important to note that in june and july 2016 the gauging station salekhard fig 1 registered an absolute maximum of air temperature for the last 8 years 29 c on june 20 31 c on july 17 the average monthly temperature in july was also maximal for this period 20 c compared with annual average of 15 c this also contributed to the increased availability of soil carbon its involvement in transport processes and the increased concentrations of doc and cdom in the ob waters in july 2016 3 the ob hydrograph is characterized by extended flooding and high water level during the whole summer period which causes permanent transport of large amounts of dom into the river from hydromorphic landscapes swamps and wide flat floodplains widely spread in the ob basin prokushkin et al 2017 during the high water period the average concentrations of doc and cdom in the two permafrost rivers lena and anadyr were similar and approximately by the factor 1 5 to 2 as low as the same parameters in the ob water table 2 the spectral slope s275 295 in the flood period for all rivers was lower thus indicating a high molecular weight of compounds and a lower degree of their photodegradation in this season compared to the period of low water at the same time sr values in the lena waters reached maximum values for the main stem of the investigated rivers excluding tributaries which could be indicative of increased bioavailability of dom helms et al 2008 speetjens et al 2022 unlike the ob waters where there is no sharp contrast in s275 295 values between the lower and middle reaches the lena lower reaches according to optical characteristics contained the most photodegraded dom with the lowest molecular weight and low aromaticity thus these characteristics were dramatically different from those of flood related dom table 2 it should be noted that studies in the lena river middle reaches were initiated at the beginning of summer flood when the fresh dom that recently entered the main stem had not yet been processed by the river biota or decomposed due to the light exposure at the same time the regulating influence of wide swampy floodplain and the buffer effect of active soil layer the depth of which is not limited by continuous permafrost played a significant role in a more uniform distribution of the molecular characteristics of dom in the ob river catchment as noted above the flood waters of the permafrost lena and anadyr rivers turned out to be the most similar in their quantitate characteristics moreover the doc values and dom spectral characteristics measured in the kolyma river during the low water period july 2009 were close to the low water values of the lena river and its tributaries the vilyui and the aldan this confirms the presence of unified characteristics of the permafrost rivers determined by the landscape and geographical characteristics of the catchment area observed west to east decreasing pattern of doc concentration in the riverine waters 10 11 7 54 and 6 23 mg l 1 for flood waters of the ob the lena and the anadyr confirms the previously discovered tendency prokushkin et al 2011 associated primarily with a more significant pool and availability of organic carbon in the catchment soils of western so called permafrost free rivers it should be noted that both the spring freshet and the summer flood are also identified at the river deltas but the waters in this area are already more transformed and distant from the sources which does not provide reliable data on the qualitative characteristics of doc entering the river for example the main volume of water enters the lena in the upper and middle reaches in the lower reaches the lena does not receive any major inflows therefore it is necessary to work along the river channel in order to more reliably assess the characteristics of the dom entering the river taking into account different landscape forms as well as different runoff phases in the same season 5 3 relationships of dom with carbonate parameters and fluxes of co2 between water and the atmosphere dissolved co2 concentrations in rivers result from an interplay between inorganic carbon fixation via aquatic primary production aquatic mineralization of terrestrial and autochthonic organic matter import via terrestrial waters soil waters and groundwaters exchange with the atmosphere carbonate silicate mineral weathering and carbonates precipitation jones et al 2003 cory et al 2014 hotchkiss et al 2015 over the past decade conceptual model of the role of freshwater ecosystems in larger carbon budgets has moved beyond defining inland waters as passive pipes a significant portion of co2 is produced directly in the river and the percentage of co2 emissions from aquatic metabolism increases with stream size hotchkiss et al 2015 co2 is typically supersaturated in stream and river ecosystems due to the instream rate of organic matter decomposition routinely exceeding photosynthetic uptake and because terrestrial water flowing to the channel is often co2 rich jones et al 2003 doc is one of important drivers of high co2 concentrations in the riverine waters which influence these values through the photooxidaton photo alteration and microbial respiration ward et al 2017 it was shown that the bacterial metabolism in large part might be based on the doc photoproducts and often bacterioplankton respiration fueled by doc is dominating the co2 production in the water column allesson et al 2016 yang et al 2015 close relationship between doc and the concentrations of dissolved co2 in river waters is evidenced by strong positive correlation between these parameters in the waters of surveyed rivers table 3 moreover the strong correlations were also found between co2 concentrations and the qualitative characteristics of dom spectral indices a 254 s275 295 suva which allowed us to conclude that the co2 content is significantly determined by the dom lability the established relationships confirm that the concentrations of dissolved co2 positively correlate with high molecular weight and highly aromatic fresh dom in the river waters table 3 all three siberian rivers supplied of co2 into the atmosphere during the warm season the waters of their main stems were supersaturated many fold in the ob with co2 table 4 the tom tributary was an exception since the processes of photosynthesis prevailed over destruction of om pipko et al 2019 note that spatial distribution of co2 partial pressure pco2 in the river s main stem is strongly influenced by the degrading permafrost in the catchment area eroding permafrost is not only source of dom but of co2 as well since co2 is the result of the most intensive degradation of permafrost om in streams and other small watercourses which rapidly supply the om decomposition products to the large river denfeld et al 2013 striegl et al 2005 loiko et al 2017 pipko et al 2019 the calculated average fco2 values between the lena river waters and atmosphere in the lower reaches table 4 as well as in the main stem the average out gassing rate was 25 4 mmol m 2 day 1 were comparable to the fluxes in water atmosphere system during the summer base flow period in the main stem of another permafrost river the kolyma river 29 2 mmol m 2 day 1 and expectedly lower than the values calculated for the lena river waters during the spring flood season vorobyev et al 2021 at the same time the fluxes of co2 between the ob waters and the atmosphere in the summer season of 2016 85 0 mmol m 2 day 1 were more than three times as high as the co2 fluxes calculated for the lena river waters this difference in fco2 values was primarily caused by higher oversaturation with co2 of the ob river waters this oversaturation was caused by the high content of om as well as co2 in soils of the ob river catchment area and presence of extensive peat bogs in particular by the world s largest vasyugan mire with enormous reserves of labile om perminova et al 2019 hugelius et al 2014 2020 availability of soil om in the ob river basin was also much higher both due to the warmer climate and to the different state of permafrost in the catchment in contrast to the east siberian rivers which are underlain mainly by continuous permafrost the ob basin is dominated by discontinuous massive island and island permafrost more affected by climate change at the same time as shown in loiko et al 2017 pipko et al 2019 pokrovsky et al 2015 the most significant biogeochemical consequences of permafrost degradation which lead to an increase in the co2 content in inland waters are observed in the zone of discontinuous permafrost presence of flood waters along a major part of the surveyed ob main stem determined by the hydrograph features was yet another factor causing the increased content of dissolved co2 the minimum values of co2 fluxes in the water atmosphere system calculated for the anadyr river waters were also determined by a number of factors the most significant being low values of dissolved inorganic and organic carbon in the river waters as well as low wind speeds tables 2 4 6 conclusions this study investigates the distribution of doc optical characteristics of dom and co2 fluxes between river water and the atmosphere in the main stem and tributaries of siberian rivers during the summer season the observed spatial variability of the studied parameters in the river main stem was strongly influenced by the riverine hydrograph along with the landscape geographical features of the watershed area the phase of river runoff differs significantly in the same time period in different parts of the river thus largely determining the quantitative and qualitative variations in the composition of dom dynamics of the dom optical characteristics in the river main stem may exceed their variations between different rivers during transition from the high water phase to the summer low flow period the doc and cdom contents decreased twofold during summer base flow conditions less aromatic and more photodegraded dom with a relatively low molecular weight of compounds was found in river waters these differences were most obvious in the lena river waters which was primarily caused by the short residence time of fresh mobilized dom in the soils and river waters in its middle reaches the quantitative and qualitative dom variability was found to be one of the drivers changing the carbonate chemistry of the waters as well as the magnitude and direction of co2 fluxes between the river water and the atmosphere throughout the main stem the waters of the siberian rivers were a source of co2 into the atmosphere higher doc concentrations and higher aromatic dom were found in the ob river waters compared to the waters of permafrost rivers the lena and the anadyr rivers which was caused by higher soil organic carbon content and its greater availability determined by the state of permafrost located in the river s watersheds the data presented in this paper are only a snapshot that shows the state of surveyed river ecosystems however we believe that the results of the study are important both for assessing and for predicting the dynamics of carbon export to the arctic shelf with river runoff depending on the state of permafrost in the catchment area of a particular river and for assessing the carbon balance directly in the channel of each river an understanding of how instream processes alter dom quantity and quality prior to its discharge to the ocean is essential to better anticipate the potential effects of future climate change on the arctic carbon fluxes credit

1936,rivers are the main way of mobilizing transforming and transporting of dissolved organic carbon to the ocean thus largely determining the features of the carbon cycle on the arctic shelf and in the arctic ocean as a whole seasonal variations in dissolved organic matter dom fluxes from land to sea have been well documented in the siberian river s deltas yet remarkably little is known about how dom varies with hydrograph within the rivers main stems the distribution of dom and its optical characteristics as well as the co2 fluxes between river water and the atmosphere in the main channel and tributaries of siberian rivers such as the lena the ob and the anadyr in summer july were studied the aim of this study was to investigate spatial changes in dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and dom composition based on its absorption properties along the riverine main stem to compare the dynamics of doc concentration and dom properties in different siberian rivers and to reveal the main factors determining its variability to evaluate the relationship of dom with carbonate chemistry of riverine waters the observed spatial variability of the investigated parameters in the river channel was strongly influenced by the river hydrograph along with landscape and geographical features of its catchment area the phase of river runoff differed significantly in the same time period in different river sections thus largely determining the quantitative and qualitative variations in the composition of dom in the ob river the inflow of water from its largest tributary the irtysh river is also an important factor of spatial variations during the summer low flow period less aromatic dom was found in river waters it was more photodegraded with a relatively low molecular weight of compounds compared to the high water period such dynamics is one of the factors that alter the carbonate chemistry of waters as well as the magnitude and direction of co2 fluxes between river water and the atmosphere higher doc concentrations and higher aromatic dom were found in the ob river waters compared to the waters of permafrost rivers the lena and the anadyr rivers which was caused by higher soil organic carbon content and its greater availability determined by the state of permafrost located in the river s watersheds a strong correlation between doc concentrations and the colored fraction of dom was established thus confirming the possibility of using the latter as a proxy of doc concentrations in siberian rivers the unique information obtained on the properties and variability dom which enters the rivers in different flow phases along the main stem allows a more accurate evaluation of the effect of changing climate on biogeochemical cycles in the arctic keywords siberian rivers dissolved organic carbon optical indices of dissolved organic matter carbonate system co2 fluxes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers are one of the main factors defining the hydrological and hydrochemical patterns of shelf seas their influence is most important on the artic shelf the arctic ocean that occupies only 1 of the world ocean volume receives 10 of the global river runoff aagaard and carmack 1989 anderson and amon 2015 rivers are the main way of mobilizing transforming and transporting of dissolved organic carbon doc to the ocean thus largely determining the features of carbon cycle on the arctic shelf and in the arctic ocean as a whole consequently the arctic ocean is an important global sink for terrestrial dissolved organic matter dom receiving more dom per unit volume than any other ocean basin in the world opsahl et al 1999 historical observations and climate model simulations demonstrate that the annual discharge of freshwater from the arctic rivers has increased significantly over the past several decades peterson et al 2002 shiklomanov et al 2021 the growing impact of the riverine water with high concentrations of dissolved carbon and strongly supersaturated by carbon dioxide co2 relative to the atmosphere may be an important component of future climate changes in the arctic region this influence is particularly relevant for the arctic ecosystems which are most vulnerable and sensitive to environmental changes that are most rapid in this region amap 2013 2017 2018 it should be noted that the catchment area of the arctic rivers is predominantly underlain by permafrost containing a huge pool of organic matter om hugelius et al 2020 pokrovsky et al 2015 schuur et al 2015 speetjens et al 2022 strauss et al 2016 2021 as the global climate warms there is a concern that thawing permafrost will expose om that was previously protected from decomposition causing a positive permafrost carbon feedback to climate hugelius et al 2014 schuur et al 2008 2015 part of the ancient permafrost om is transferred to the arctic rivers and further into the arctic ocean feng et al 2013 wild et al 2019 dom one of the key components of river runoff has a complex effect on aquatic ecosystems the scientific community has been widely discussing the potential role of terrigenous dom in modifying co2 fluxes both in river waters and on the arctic shelf chupakova et al 2018 denfeld et al 2013 pugach et al 2018 different mechanisms of dom transformation have been investigated photo and biodegradation both into smaller organic fractions and into the final product co2 zepp et al 1998 cory et al 2007 2014 2015 hansell et al 2004 holmes et al 2008 osburn et al 2009 spencer et al 2009 mann et al 2012 shirokova et al 2017 ward et al 2017 other ways of dom influencing on the aquatic ecosystems both protective functions that shield the biota from excessive solar radiation and the limiting factors that reduce availability of photosynthetically active radiation necessary for photosynthesis have also been studied coble 2007 burenkov et al 2001 the qualitative composition is the most important characteristic of dom since it allows evaluating its potential and the rate of degradation in rivers and further on in the arctic shelf optical characteristics of dom such as absorption coefficients and spectral slopes can serve as proxies for dom molecular weight and aromaticity which in turn can help to characterize the lability of dom coch et al 2019 helms et al 2008 neff et al 2006 spencer et al 2009 striegl et al 2005 weishaar et al 2003 a number of studies on the chromophorous properties of dom have been carried out in the largest arctic rivers to examine the ability of optical measurements to provide meaningful insights into terrigenous carbon export patterns and biogeochemical cycling across broad spatial scales in the arctic neff et al 2006 osburn et al 2009 stedmon et al 2011 fichot et al 2013 walker et al 2013 dubinenkov et al 2015 mann et al 2016 griffin et al 2018 and references therein the overwhelming part of these studies has been focused on in the deltas of the largest arctic rivers however the knowledge on the spatial variability across river s continuum is limited wherein the shallow streams and the river channel itself are the hot spots of om mobilization and transformation denfeld et al 2013 lauerwald et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 a large portion of freshly mobilized doc is rapidly lost in the upper reaches of the watersheds associated with substantial co2 release that is not accounted for in current carbon budgets raymond et al 2013 kaiser et al 2017 therefore studies of these inland waters provide for an extensive insight into the nature and extent of dom changes under the influence of numerous environmental factors several previous studies have been made on the spatial distribution and correlation between dom and its optical properties in the main channels of siberian arctic rivers neff et al 2006 mann et al 2012 2015 spencer et al 2015 frey et al 2016 perminova et al 2019 krickov et al 2021 pipko et al 2021 they are mostly based on the data obtained in the kolyma river waters only the three most recent works have discussed some optical characteristics of dom in separate sections of the main channel of two great siberian rivers the ob and the lena thus a comprehensive analysis of the features of doc spatial dynamics of and the qualitative composition of dom in the most full flowing part of the great siberian rivers the middle and lower reaches of the ob and lena rivers has not been performed studies of dom and its optical indices have not previously been carried out for the waters of the anadyr river here we study doc concentrations and dom characteristics in the main stems of three siberian rivers the ob river limited spread of continuous permafrost in the catchment area the lena and the anadyr rivers watersheds predominantly underlain by continuous permafrost in the course of most relevant hydrological periods seasonal floods and summer base flow the aim of this study is 1 to investigate spatial changes in doc concentrations and dom composition based on its absorption properties along the riverine main stem throughout the summer base flow season and seasonal flood 2 to compare the dynamics of doc concentration and dom properties in different siberian rivers and to reveal the main factors determining its variability 3 to evaluate the relationship of dom with carbonate chemistry of riverine waters 2 study area the studies were carried out in the lower and middle reaches of the lena river and its tributaries the aldan and the vilyui in july 2017 as well as in the lower and middle reaches of the ob river and its tributaries the irtysh and the tom in july 2016 comparative analysis also relied on the anadyr river research materials obtained in july 2013 fig 1 two east siberian rivers the lena and the anadyr are predominantly located in the zone of continuous permafrost and are characterized by dry and cold climate which markedly differs from climatic conditions of the west siberian ob river fig 1 table 1 the great east siberian lena river is the largest river in yakutia and the third largest river in russia in terms of the basin area after the ob and the yenisei table 1 https water rf ru it flows through taiga crosses the forest tundra and tundra in its lower reaches staying within the boundaries of permafrost zone a significant part of the permafrost in its catchment area is represented by high glacial rocks ice complex ic strauss et al 2021 which are most susceptible to thermal impacts particularly to the current climate warming the lena river hydrograph includes high spring flood summer low flow conditions late summer autumn floods and winter low water periods fig 2 short and rapid spring flood is caused by the continental climate and widespread permafrost the main runoff is formed in the mountains of the south eastern siberia in the lower reaches the maximum water discharge exceeds the annual average by 4 5 times forest fires most frequent in the catchment area of the river s middle reaches can play a potential role in the dynamics of carbon fluxes a significant amount of carbon is contained in permafrost soils of boreal forest ecosystems filipchuk et al 2020 where it is currently protected from decomposition the fires destroy the moss and surface organic layers of soil resulting in better absorption of solar radiation and thus allowing the heat to penetrate into deeper soil layers genet et al 2013 chen et al 2021 increased frequency of fires in the arctic tundra accelerates the northward migration of boreal trees which can accelerate the positive feedback associated with the release of carbon from the permafrost jafarov et al 2013 chen et al 2021 at the same time a number of researchers suppose that fires can sequester the total amount of dissolved organic carbon entering aquatic ecosystems by reducing the volume of biomass in the water catchment areas i e by burning out the topsoil amon et al 2012 vonk et al 2015 filipchuk

that permafrost extent in the anadyr watershed is slightly less 90 such change is related to the contemporary amplified rise in arctic temperatures martens et al 2022 like that of the lena river the anadyr hydrograph is characterized by high and short spring freshet period fig 2 in its lower reaches the maximum water discharge exceeds the average annual water discharge by five times the average annual air temperature in the river basin is substantially below zero and the warm period of the year is very short table 1 the anadyr drainage basin corresponds to mountain ecoregions table 1 and the permafrost peatlands wetscape was found only in the anadyr lowlands bring et al 2016 waters of the great west siberian ob river fig 1 drain the warmer and wetter region where there are numerous peatlands and swamps in contrast to the first two rivers the ob river crosses a permafrost gradient from isolated to discontinuous and continuous permafrost continuous permafrost is found only in the north of its catchment and occupies less than 1 of its territory the southern part of the ob watershed is permafrost free table 1 fig 1 the ob basin is one of the largest basins in the world being the third largest by area dobrovolski 2011 in the south of western siberia the ob river crosses the steppe and forest steppe zones below novosibirsk it flows through the taiga zone among swamps and marshlands and then through tundra in the lower reaches table 1 average carbon stock in the biomass of boreal forests in the ob catchment area is the highest among the surveyed watersheds reaching 100

1800000 km2 which covers almost 2 3 of the west siberia lowland territory kremenetski et al 2003 olefeldt et al 2021 the vasyugan mire occupying 55 000 km2 is the largest swamp in the northern hemisphere and is a giant store of organic carbon it continues to grow actively with the peat layer in it reaching 12 m in thickness the growth of the peat layer is up to 2 62 mm per year and the rate of organic carbon accumulation is on average 30 40 g c per year per square meter savichev and paromov 2014 the ob s hydrograph is smoother than that of eastern siberian rivers fig 2 and is characterized by lower and extended spring summer floods increased summer autumn runoff and quite low winter base flow periods in the upper reaches there are two flood waves each of them with the maximum water discharge the first wave is caused by melting snow on the plain the second in june and july is caused by melting of mountain snow and glaciers in the lower reaches the maximum water discharge exceeds the annual average by 2 6 times https arcticgreatrivers org data the floods in the middle ob start in the second half of april and in the lower ob in late april they continue due to rain floods unsimultaneously coming from different parts of the basin and under the regulating influence of the floodplain during the whole warm period of the year frequent and severe fires ponomarev et al 2018 have an impact on the ob watershed affecting the soil carbon pool the irtysh river the largest tributary of the ob river fig 1 flows through a wide valley up to 20 35 km in the russian part of the basin climate in the greater part of the irtysh basin is continental characterized by long cold winters and relatively warm hot in the south summers widespread swamps and lakes are caused by flat terrain and excessive moisture swampiness in some areas exceeds 50 water regime in the upper reaches of the river is characterized by spring freshet with sudden level rises and summer floods which sometimes exceed the spring flooding discharge in the middle and lower reaches of the river the water regime acquires the features of west siberian rivers spring floods merging with summer floods continue until autumn while a summer low water period is practically non existent the tom river is a right bank tributary of the ob river it is mostly a mountainous country with the riverbed turning into a broad floodplain only in the lower reaches near the tomsk the tom is characterized by a relatively short 90 days spring summer flood period accounts for 70 of the annual flow rainwater feeding of the river is 25 40 snow feeding is 35 55 and ground waters contribute 25 35 of the annual discharge the catchment area is located in taiga forest steppe and steppe the climate is continental with mean annual temperature below zero table 1 3 methods 3 1 field methods and hydrochemistry the waters of three arctic siberian rivers were studied in july during the period of absolute maximum of annual air temperatures in the catchment areas comprehensive studies of the lena main channel water in the middle and lower reaches the boundary between them being defined by the confluence of the vilyui its left bank tributary were carried out in july 2017 fig 1 the research work was performed from a small vessel nikol in the river fairway in the depth range of 7 28 m water samples were collected from the surface and near bottom horizons two of 33 complex stations were sampled in the mouths of the aldan and vilyui tributaries five and three kilometers away from the confluence fig 1 the research work in the main channel of the ob river was carried out in july 2016 along the 2671 km latitudinal transect on the route salekhard tomsk on board the motor vessel om 341 middle reaches and lower reaches were studied the border between them being defined by confluence of the irtysh river as well as the mouths of the irtysh and tom fig 1 forty one comprehensive stations were sampled two of them in the irtysh and tom in july 2013 the research was carried out on a 237 km section of the anadyr river main stem as well as in its tributary the belaya river fig 1 on board the riverboat mirny water samples were collected using 5l niskin bottles at a depth of 1 m after collection water samples were filtered through whatman 0 7 μm gf f filters doc samples were acidified with hcl to ph 2 and stored refrigerated and in the dark until analysis in 60 ml nalgene high density polyethylene bottles doc measurements were performed via high temperature combustion using a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer alling et al 2010 ultraviolet visible absorption spectra of colored dom cdom was measured on filtered precombusted whatman 0 7 μm gf f unacidified waters using a unico 2804 spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cuvette over the spectral range from 200 to 600 nm at 1 nm intervals milli q millipore water was used as the reference for all samples measurements were made after samples were equilibrated to the laboratory temperature in order to minimize temperature effects several optical indices were calculated to investigate dom characteristics including absorption coefficients at 254 nm a 254 spectral slopes s275 295 and s350 400 the spectral slope ratio sr calculated as the ratio between s275 295 and s350 400 and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva the absorption coefficient a λ m 1 was calculated using equation a λ 2 303aλ l where aλ is optical density at wavelength λ and l is the cuvette path length in meters the absorption coefficients at 254 nm a 254 were chosen to quantify the concentrations of cdom frey et al 2016 cdom spectral slopes were calculated within log transformed absorption spectra as a λ a λref e s λ λref where a λ is the absorption coefficient at a specified wavelength a λref is the absorption coefficient at reference wavelength λref and s is a spectral slope helms et al 2008 s275 295 differs between cdom sources and has been shown to be inversely correlated to the average molecular weight of dom the slope of the short wavelength range 275 295 nm can be measured with high precision appears to be particularly sensitive to shifts in molecular weight or dom sources or both helms et al 2008 in general s275 295 values of the high molecular weight fraction of the cdom pool are lower and indicative of a terrestrial dom sources whereas s275 295 values of the low molecular weight fractions are generally higher and indicative of a more degraded and or autochthonous source helms et al 2008 stedmon et al 2011 fichot et al 2013 walker et al 2013 s350 400 is also sensitive to the shift of molecular weight and its higher values indicate lower weight decreasing aromaticity and higher bioavailability of dom helms et al 2008 hansen et al 2016 bruhn et al 2021 lower s350 400 values are also associated with higher heterotrophic microbial activity matsuoka et al 2015 sr is negatively correlated to dom molecular weight and aromaticity higher sr values are associated with photodegradation and microbial alteration of dom as well as its high bioavailability helms et al 2008 speetjens et al 2022 it should be noted that frey et al 2016 found that the relationship between bioavailable dom concentrations and sr showed a distinct negative trend in some inland waters suva is defined as the uv absorbance of a water sample at 254 nm normalized for doc concentration and used to estimate the degree of aromaticity in bulk cdom weishaar et al 2003 since aromatic compounds absorb more light in the uv visible region of the spectrum higher suva values indicate increased aromaticity from allochthonous inputs and lower suva values indicate a decrease in aromaticity and a more autochthonous or modified terrestrial cdom source weishaar et al 2003 walker et al 2013 ph was measured on board using potentiometric technique dickson and goyet 1994 on the nbs scale using a combined electrode calibrated against hanna buffer

precision of 3 μmol kg 1 exact concentration of hcl for alkalinity determination was found using titration with a standard solution of na2co3 prepared by a weight of na2co3 of 99 995 purity dickson and goyet 1994 pavlova et al 2008 other carbonate system parameters dissolved co2 and partial pressure of co2 pco2 were calculated using co2sys program version 2 3 pierrot et al 2006 water air co2 fluxes were calculated according to wanninkhof 2014 hourly wind speed was used data on discharges at gauging stations were taken from the websites arcticgro shiklomanov et al 2021 arcticrims https

characteristics from national soil atlas of the russian federation https soil db ru soilatlas 3 2 statistical analyses normality of data sets was tested using the kolmogorov smirnov normality statistical test k s test to determine the difference in means of two populations we applied the welch s two sample t test to measure the relationship between two variables we used the pearson s correlation coefficient for normally distributed data and the spearman rank correlation if the data were not normally distributed 4 results concentrations of doc and optical characteristics of dom in the main stem and in some largest tributaries of the lena and the ob rivers as well as in waters of the anadyr river were identified in the course of this research analysis of the river hydrograph shows that the research carried out in the main channel of the rivers covered different phases of the discharge figs 2 3 the anadyr river was an exception the river was characterized by increased water content throughout the whole study area summer rain floods overlapped with the snow melting in the upper reaches of the river doc concentrations in the lena river waters decreased markedly from south to north fig 4 and the largest variations were identified in the middle reaches table 2 in contrast increased doc concentrations were found in the northward direction of the ob with maximum values in the waters of its main tributary the irtysh fig 4 the maximum variability was identified in the middle reaches table 2 comparison of spectral characteristics of dom showed both their significant dynamics in the main stems of individual rivers and significant differences between the rivers absorption of dom a 254 was significantly higher in the ob waters compared to the lena and anadyr rivers it also showed heterogeneity in different sections of the rivers and their tributaries fig 5 table 2 other calculated spectral characteristics of dom were also significantly different both in the waters of three different rivers and in individual sections of each river and its tributaries fig 5 table 2 the values of cdom in the rivers and tributaries showed a similar distribution to doc revealing a stable correlation between these parameters though of different intensity depending on the river section fig 6 the correlation coefficient between doc and cdom in river waters was 0 97 for the entire set of data in the ob s main stem the correlation coefficient between doc and cdom was 0 97 in the middle reaches also 0 97 and in the lower reaches it comprised 0 31 in the lena s main stem it was 0 96 in the middle reaches 0 85 and 0 93 in the lower reaches thus the minimum correlation coefficients were calculated for the waters of the lower ob and middle reaches of the lena fig 6 comparison of doc and cdom in the same value range in the different rivers shows that cdom is slightly depleted in the lena river which is visible in the lower cdom to doc ratio fig 6 the relationships between doc and cdom for the ob and lena samples exhibit positive intercepts on the y axis and thus indicate nonchromophoric fractions of doc in the ob and lena which are equivalent to 1 46 mg l 1 and 1 30 mg l 1 respectively similar landscape geographical characteristics of the lena and anadyr rivers catchment areas the identified similarity of dom absorption spectra in the waters of these rivers and a strong correlation between doc and cdom in the lena river waters allowed calculating doc values for the anadyr river waters using an equation that links doc and cdom values in the lena river waters the calculated mean doc concentration in the main stem of the anadyr river was 6 23 mg l 1 with a variability range from 5 51 to 7 43 mg l 1 the minimum doc concentration was calculated for the belaya river which is a mountain tributary of the anadyr river table 2 the values of carbonate system parameters dissolved co2 and at observed in the river waters were significantly different both in different rivers and in individual sections of each river table 2 fig 4 the highest mean and absolute values of dissolved co2 and at were measured in the waters of the ob river with continuous permafrost covering only a small area of the basin the minimum mean and absolute co2 and at values were identified in the waters of the anadyr river with the catchment area completely underlain by continuous permafrost 5 discussion 5 1 spatial variability of doc and optical characteristics of dom in the rivers 5 1 1 the lena river the study showed a large variability in the content and composition of dom in the waters of siberian rivers in summer july as previously stated the study in the main stem of the lena river was carried out throughout its middle and lower reaches absolute and mean values as well as the value amplitudes of the surveyed parameters were maximal in the middle reaches figs 4 5 table 2 taking into account the lack of significant spatial variability in vegetation types and permafrost in the river basin table 1 fig 1 dynamics of the river hydrograph was taken as the main reason for spatial variability studies in the middle reaches of the river coincided with the beginning of a high summer rainfall flood fig 3 high rainfall floods are characteristic of this season s water regime of the lena river which is formed under the influence of the vitim and olekma its right bank tributaries sokolov 1952 however the summer rain flood was particularly intense in july 2017 surpassing the summer flood volumes the water level during the rain flood was almost twice as high as the long term average for 2000 2021 and approached the absolute maximum for this period in this section https allrivers info gauging station tabaga as a consequence of monsoon rains the main stem rapidly received a large amount of fresh dom from various sources due to the high connectivity of the hydrological network during this period optimal temperatures and vegetation conditions the air temperature was maximal accompanied by an increase in the depth of seasonally thawed layers high productivity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and near maximum microbial activity shogren et al 2020 predicted increases in the amount and frequency of summer rainfall are expected to increase om fluxes in arctic catchment areas beel et al 2021 it is important to note that the middle section of the river receives the biggest number of large tributaries forming the main part of the river flow at the same time in the middle reaches not including the left bank vilyui runoff the mountainous right bank part accounts for 96 of the runoff kosheleva et al 2006 thus the mountainous topography was also an additional factor accelerating the transit of dom into the middle reaches of the river rapid flush out of large amounts of carbon from the upper organogenic soil horizons and short residence time of dom in the river determined its characteristics a large amount of labile high aromatic and high molecular weight terrigenous dom including freshly formed one entered the main river channel in its middle reaches this is evidenced by both high absorption coefficients in the shortwave spectrum range and minimal spectral slopes and their ratios doc concentrations were maximal in this section of the river table 2 the presence of labile dom was also confirmed by the highest values of pco2 as well as by the minimum concentrations of dissolved oxygen thus indicating intensive processes of om degradation pipko et al 2021 lower s350 400 values were also observed here indicating high microbial activity matsuoka et al 2015 we can suppose that the presence of fresher dom could also be caused to some extent by extensive development of ic in the catchment area of the river middle reaches fig 1 the ic is most exposed to thermal impacts and contains a large amount of ancient labile om vonk et al 2015 given the maximum seasonal air temperatures and the high hydrological connectivity of the river network during the rains it can be assumed that a part of this freshly released carbon can be transported into the lena river channel thus this section is also likely to receive the permafrost dom from the upper horizons of ic that avoided the thawing freezing cycle in the previous periods the presence of discontinuous permafrost in the upper reaches of the river fig 1 table 1 may also have contributed to the increase in doc concentrations in the middle reaches of the lena river during the flood event high variability of the studied parameters in the river s middle reaches was partly determined by the water characteristics of its largest tributaries the vilyui swampy in yakut https water rf ru and the aldan a rocky place in evenki https water rf ru despite the fact that in contrast to the waters of the lena middle reaches the hydrograph in the mouths of these rivers corresponded to the summer base flow fig 3 the doc concentrations measured in the aldan and the vilyui differed more than by the factor of two and other optical parameters were also significantly different figs 4 5 table 2 comparison of the optical characteristics showed that the aldan waters along with low concentrations of doc caused by the runoff phase and by the soil features and the catchment area landscape the aldan flows mainly in mountainous terrain with very few swamps in the river basin contained the minimal amount of cdom for the entire lena river catchment area increased values of s275 295 and minimal suva indicated a lower content of aromatic compounds in the dom composition and its lower molecular weight maximum sr values also indicated a lower molecular weight and probably its higher bioavailability in comparison with dom in the vilyui waters table 2 which confirms the differences in sources of dom and degrees of dom degradation during the study period the aldan waters were characterized by extremely low content of suspended particulate matter along with minimal concentrations of doc pipko et al 2021 which triggered more intense photodegradation of dom and contributed to the development of primary production processes the detected high values of s275 295 the highest for all watercourses under study and reduced suva could be also caused by the presence of autochthonous dom the data showing the development of photosynthetic activity in the summer season in the amga river the largest left bank tributary of the aldan river gabyshev and gabysheva 2011 indirectly prove the probability of autochthonous matter contribution to the aldan dom pool thus the observed distribution of spectral characteristics may have been caused by intra vitam excretions of algae and macrophytes low s350 400 and high sr bruhn et al 2021 matsuoka et al 2015 speetjens et al 2022 similar compounds may also appear in the aquatic environment after plant death for example as a result of lysis and autolysis of phytoplankton cells matsuoka et al 2015 novikov and kharlamova 2016 the vilyui is a tributary of the lowland left bank part of the lena basin it flows through a wide swampy lowland and has a low and wide floodplain channel https water rf ru the presence of peat lands and continuous contact with the soil cover provide for increased concentrations of dissolved minerals and organic substances in the left bank tributaries kosheleva et al 2006 consequently the waters of this tributary contain higher content of dom and its colored fraction table 2 the fivefold excess of suspended particulate matter concentration and more than twofold excess of doc in the vilyui waters compared to the aldan pipko et al 2021 could be one of the factors reducing the level of dom photodegradation in this tributary table 2 compared to the middle reaches doc and cdom decreased in the lower reaches table 2 combined with increasing s275 295 and decreasing suva our results are indicative of a progressive photochemical degradation of dom downstream helms et al 2008 the highest values of s350 400 observed here could be indicative of lower microbial activity matsuoka et al 2015 taking into account the significant homogeneity of the vegetation cover poor tundra vegetation only in the northern coastal part of the basin and the presence of discontinuous permafrost only in the upper reaches of the river fig 1 the observed significant changes in characteristics of the main stem waters were caused by the river hydrograph in the lower reaches the study included the samples of summer base flow in which dom is more degraded as a result of transformation in deep soil layers and due to longer residence time in the riverine water moreover the flood waters showed weaker correlations between doc and cdom fig 6 caused by rapid flush out of fresh dom from different parts of the catchment area its rapid entry directly into the waters of the main channel without significant transformation in the course of transportation and the influence of large tributaries with individual sets of inherent spectral characteristics 5 1 2 the ob river analysis of doc spatial distribution and dom optical characteristics in the ob river main stem showed significant quantitative differences doc concentrations in two river sections differed almost by a factor of two and cdom content in the lower reaches was twice as high as its concentration in the middle reaches table 2 to some extent these dynamics were caused by the river hydrograph fig 3 unlike the lena where the spring summer flood has a very distinctive character very intense and short in time the ob flood is characterized by a wide and long peak in the middle reaches of the ob we studied the waters entering the rivers during recession of spring summer flood and in the lower reaches the work was carried out during the peak of spring summer flood fig 3 in the lower reaches we studied the waters that entered the river during the period of intense thawing of the upper layer of peat and forest litter of wetland forests and increased removal of om from the swamps the most important source of dom berezin and parshina 2017 inflow of the irtysh waters was yet another important modulating factor perminova et al 2019 pipko et al 2019 kolesnichenko et al 2021 at the confluence its contribution accounted for about ¼ of the water flow 6 4 thousand m3 sec 1 at khanty mansiysk and 24 2 thousand m3 sec 1 at belogorye fig 3 the irtysh waters were more turbid with a large amount of dom table 2 differences between the ob and irtysh waters were identified even visually fig 7 observed optical characteristics table 2 indicated that qualitative composition of dom in the lower and middle reaches of the ob was also different thus on average the waters in the lower reaches contained more aromatic dom with relatively higher molecular weight compared to those in the middle reaches table 2 but it is important to emphasize that the freshest high molecular weight dom s275 295 values were the lowest here ranging from 13 4 to 13 7 10 3 nm 1 was found in the lower part of the middle reaches before the ob river s confluence with the irtysh river which is maximally influenced by peat bogs high dispersion of optical characteristics fig 5 confirms the diversity of dom sources in this section of the river this fact reaffirms the conclusion made in perminova et al 2019 that the freshest terrigenous dom enters the river from peatlands differences in the qualitative composition of dom between different river sections were caused by the presence of flood related dom in the lower reaches partially transformed as a result of prolonged presence in the main stem and by the irtysh waters with distinctive characteristics table 2 the gradual transition of water regime in the middle reaches of the river in the phase of summer low water when the surface runoff from swamps decreased dramatically berezin and parshina 2017 and the infiltration of solutions into the soil increased with an increase in the depth of seasonal thaw layer also determined the observed spatial variability in general probable increasing of dom bioavailability in the middle reaches increased values of sr and decreased values of s350 400 speetjens et al 2022 may result from its degradation and decrease in molecular weight and aromaticity higher values of s275 295 and lower suva and due to a more important role of bacteria in the production of dom during the recession of the flood kaiser et al 2017 matsuoka et al 2015 dom produced by them is bioavailable and is utilized fast enough kawasaki and benner 2006 kaiser et al 2017 absence of the swamps and higher groundwater input in the south of the study area pipko et al 2019 also caused changes in dom composition table 2 the maximal differences in dom content were found in the ob tributaries the irtysh and the tom rivers table 2 figs 4 6 flat relief and excessive moisture of the irtysh river s drainage basin cause wide distribution of swamps and lakes during the study the irtysh waters were still characterized by high water content but the flow rate was lower in comparison with the flood peak 5980 and 8990 m3 sec 1 respectively as noted above the highest concentrations of doc were found in the irtysh waters among the rivers of the ob catchment area the high values were determined by characteristics of the catchment soils where the content of organic carbon in the upper layer was estimated as ultrahigh https soil db ru soilatlas as well as by the river s hydrograph moreover the irtysh is exposed to a significant anthropogenic load it is polluted with phenols and petroleum products mikhailova and chemagin 2016 radelyuk et al 2022 according to table 2 and the previously mentioned data perminova et al 2019 pipko et al 2019 the irtysh waters had an expected impact on optical characteristics of dom in the ob downstream waters in the tom river studies were conducted during the summer low flow conditions fig 3 concentrations of doc and cdom in the tributary were minimal for the investigated waters according to spectral characteristics dom composition was characterized by lower molecular weight compared to other watercourses as well as the highest bioavailability and low aromaticity table 2 distribution of optical characteristics of dom indicated that the sources of dom in the tom river differed from other waters of the ob basin the tom feeding regime was also significantly different from the rest of the basin the area of swamps and peat lands was minimal here and the contribution of groundwater which is rather high in the tom became even more significant during the decrease of surface runoff autochthonous dom is assumed to play a significant role in the composition of dom in this tributary just like in the case of the aldan increased role of primary production processes was confirmed by chlorophyll a concentrations measured during the studies pipko et al 2019 its concentrations in the tom waters exceeded its content in the ob main channel more than threefold 49 µg l 1 and 16 µg l 1 respectively at the same time the degree of water saturation with oxygen exceeded 106 which is also indicative of intensive om production 5 1 3 the anadyr river studies in the river were conducted during the period of snow melting that coincided with rain flooding thus resulting in increased water level of the river dudarev et al 2015 the cdom values was approximately 1 3 times as low as compared to lena river floodwaters and less than a half as high compared to the ob river waters table 2 as noted above close correlation between doc and cdom in the river waters fig 4 as well as the similarity of absorption spectra fig 5a and the similarity of landscape geographical characteristics location of the lena and anadyr basins in zone of widespread permafrost fig 1 allowed us to calculate doc content in the anadyr waters via the equation linking doc and cdom in the lena river in july 2017 table 2 it should be noted that these are the first estimates of doc content in waters of the east siberian permafrost anadyr river small variations in doc and optical indices of dom were found in the main stem of the anadyr river table 2 figs 4 5 it can probably be attributed to the smaller river length and its catchment area its location in the same climatic zone with the same vegetation type as well as the high extent of permafrost in the entire basin nevertheless the minimum values of cdom and doc in the belaya river one of the large tributaries of the anadyr river were detected according to optical characteristics low aromatic and low molecular weight dom was found in the tributary table 2 the observed dynamics were caused by the reduced water discharge in the belaya river corresponding to the summer low water period as well as the low content of om in the soils of its catchment due to the thin organic layer and minimal presence of swamps https soil db ru soilatlas 5 2 comparison of dom variability and its optical characteristics in rivers as noted above catchment areas of the studied rivers differed significantly primarily in the extension of permafrost in the catchment as well as in a number of other landscape and geographic characteristics table 1 the lena and the anadyr basins share some similarities they as so called permafrost rivers with the permafrost undelaying up to 100 and maat below zero the ob basin has striking differences the continuous permafrost covers about 1 of the area and the maat is above zero comparison of average doc concentrations and spectral characteristics of dom in the summer season july showed that the content of doc and cdom in the ob river was maximal among the three rivers suva values were also maximal in the ob waters while the s275 295 and sr values were minimal thus indicating the presence of fresher high molecular weight and more aromatic dom in the ob waters compared to the lena and anadyr waters during the surveyed period table 2 a few factors contributed to that 1 higher pool of om in soils high and ultra high levels https soil db ru soilatlas determined by the presence of a large peatlands in the ob catchment table 1 the permafrost zone of the ob river drainage basin shows the highest soil carbon pools exceeding the values of 70 kg m 2 in the 0 1 m layer and reaching the values of 150 260 kg m 2 in the 0 3 m layer hugelius et al 2014 moreover in the main part of the ob basin the level of organic carbon in the upper humus accumulative soil horizons is estimated as very high and ultra high from 7 to 20 to over 20 https soil db ru soilatlas note that the presence of swamps as shown in frey and smith 2005 has a determining effect on the dom content in river waters provided that maat is above 2 c table 1 2 higher availability of soil om as continuous permafrost is practically absent both maat and summer temperatures are higher and the warm period is longer in the ob catchment it is important to note that in june and july 2016 the gauging station salekhard fig 1 registered an absolute maximum of air temperature for the last 8 years 29 c on june 20 31 c on july 17 the average monthly temperature in july was also maximal for this period 20 c compared with annual average of 15 c this also contributed to the increased availability of soil carbon its involvement in transport processes and the increased concentrations of doc and cdom in the ob waters in july 2016 3 the ob hydrograph is characterized by extended flooding and high water level during the whole summer period which causes permanent transport of large amounts of dom into the river from hydromorphic landscapes swamps and wide flat floodplains widely spread in the ob basin prokushkin et al 2017 during the high water period the average concentrations of doc and cdom in the two permafrost rivers lena and anadyr were similar and approximately by the factor 1 5 to 2 as low as the same parameters in the ob water table 2 the spectral slope s275 295 in the flood period for all rivers was lower thus indicating a high molecular weight of compounds and a lower degree of their photodegradation in this season compared to the period of low water at the same time sr values in the lena waters reached maximum values for the main stem of the investigated rivers excluding tributaries which could be indicative of increased bioavailability of dom helms et al 2008 speetjens et al 2022 unlike the ob waters where there is no sharp contrast in s275 295 values between the lower and middle reaches the lena lower reaches according to optical characteristics contained the most photodegraded dom with the lowest molecular weight and low aromaticity thus these characteristics were dramatically different from those of flood related dom table 2 it should be noted that studies in the lena river middle reaches were initiated at the beginning of summer flood when the fresh dom that recently entered the main stem had not yet been processed by the river biota or decomposed due to the light exposure at the same time the regulating influence of wide swampy floodplain and the buffer effect of active soil layer the depth of which is not limited by continuous permafrost played a significant role in a more uniform distribution of the molecular characteristics of dom in the ob river catchment as noted above the flood waters of the permafrost lena and anadyr rivers turned out to be the most similar in their quantitate characteristics moreover the doc values and dom spectral characteristics measured in the kolyma river during the low water period july 2009 were close to the low water values of the lena river and its tributaries the vilyui and the aldan this confirms the presence of unified characteristics of the permafrost rivers determined by the landscape and geographical characteristics of the catchment area observed west to east decreasing pattern of doc concentration in the riverine waters 10 11 7 54 and 6 23 mg l 1 for flood waters of the ob the lena and the anadyr confirms the previously discovered tendency prokushkin et al 2011 associated primarily with a more significant pool and availability of organic carbon in the catchment soils of western so called permafrost free rivers it should be noted that both the spring freshet and the summer flood are also identified at the river deltas but the waters in this area are already more transformed and distant from the sources which does not provide reliable data on the qualitative characteristics of doc entering the river for example the main volume of water enters the lena in the upper and middle reaches in the lower reaches the lena does not receive any major inflows therefore it is necessary to work along the river channel in order to more reliably assess the characteristics of the dom entering the river taking into account different landscape forms as well as different runoff phases in the same season 5 3 relationships of dom with carbonate parameters and fluxes of co2 between water and the atmosphere dissolved co2 concentrations in rivers result from an interplay between inorganic carbon fixation via aquatic primary production aquatic mineralization of terrestrial and autochthonic organic matter import via terrestrial waters soil waters and groundwaters exchange with the atmosphere carbonate silicate mineral weathering and carbonates precipitation jones et al 2003 cory et al 2014 hotchkiss et al 2015 over the past decade conceptual model of the role of freshwater ecosystems in larger carbon budgets has moved beyond defining inland waters as passive pipes a significant portion of co2 is produced directly in the river and the percentage of co2 emissions from aquatic metabolism increases with stream size hotchkiss et al 2015 co2 is typically supersaturated in stream and river ecosystems due to the instream rate of organic matter decomposition routinely exceeding photosynthetic uptake and because terrestrial water flowing to the channel is often co2 rich jones et al 2003 doc is one of important drivers of high co2 concentrations in the riverine waters which influence these values through the photooxidaton photo alteration and microbial respiration ward et al 2017 it was shown that the bacterial metabolism in large part might be based on the doc photoproducts and often bacterioplankton respiration fueled by doc is dominating the co2 production in the water column allesson et al 2016 yang et al 2015 close relationship between doc and the concentrations of dissolved co2 in river waters is evidenced by strong positive correlation between these parameters in the waters of surveyed rivers table 3 moreover the strong correlations were also found between co2 concentrations and the qualitative characteristics of dom spectral indices a 254 s275 295 suva which allowed us to conclude that the co2 content is significantly determined by the dom lability the established relationships confirm that the concentrations of dissolved co2 positively correlate with high molecular weight and highly aromatic fresh dom in the river waters table 3 all three siberian rivers supplied of co2 into the atmosphere during the warm season the waters of their main stems were supersaturated many fold in the ob with co2 table 4 the tom tributary was an exception since the processes of photosynthesis prevailed over destruction of om pipko et al 2019 note that spatial distribution of co2 partial pressure pco2 in the river s main stem is strongly influenced by the degrading permafrost in the catchment area eroding permafrost is not only source of dom but of co2 as well since co2 is the result of the most intensive degradation of permafrost om in streams and other small watercourses which rapidly supply the om decomposition products to the large river denfeld et al 2013 striegl et al 2005 loiko et al 2017 pipko et al 2019 the calculated average fco2 values between the lena river waters and atmosphere in the lower reaches table 4 as well as in the main stem the average out gassing rate was 25 4 mmol m 2 day 1 were comparable to the fluxes in water atmosphere system during the summer base flow period in the main stem of another permafrost river the kolyma river 29 2 mmol m 2 day 1 and expectedly lower than the values calculated for the lena river waters during the spring flood season vorobyev et al 2021 at the same time the fluxes of co2 between the ob waters and the atmosphere in the summer season of 2016 85 0 mmol m 2 day 1 were more than three times as high as the co2 fluxes calculated for the lena river waters this difference in fco2 values was primarily caused by higher oversaturation with co2 of the ob river waters this oversaturation was caused by the high content of om as well as co2 in soils of the ob river catchment area and presence of extensive peat bogs in particular by the world s largest vasyugan mire with enormous reserves of labile om perminova et al 2019 hugelius et al 2014 2020 availability of soil om in the ob river basin was also much higher both due to the warmer climate and to the different state of permafrost in the catchment in contrast to the east siberian rivers which are underlain mainly by continuous permafrost the ob basin is dominated by discontinuous massive island and island permafrost more affected by climate change at the same time as shown in loiko et al 2017 pipko et al 2019 pokrovsky et al 2015 the most significant biogeochemical consequences of permafrost degradation which lead to an increase in the co2 content in inland waters are observed in the zone of discontinuous permafrost presence of flood waters along a major part of the surveyed ob main stem determined by the hydrograph features was yet another factor causing the increased content of dissolved co2 the minimum values of co2 fluxes in the water atmosphere system calculated for the anadyr river waters were also determined by a number of factors the most significant being low values of dissolved inorganic and organic carbon in the river waters as well as low wind speeds tables 2 4 6 conclusions this study investigates the distribution of doc optical characteristics of dom and co2 fluxes between river water and the atmosphere in the main stem and tributaries of siberian rivers during the summer season the observed spatial variability of the studied parameters in the river main stem was strongly influenced by the riverine hydrograph along with the landscape geographical features of the watershed area the phase of river runoff differs significantly in the same time period in different parts of the river thus largely determining the quantitative and qualitative variations in the composition of dom dynamics of the dom optical characteristics in the river main stem may exceed their variations between different rivers during transition from the high water phase to the summer low flow period the doc and cdom contents decreased twofold during summer base flow conditions less aromatic and more photodegraded dom with a relatively low molecular weight of compounds was found in river waters these differences were most obvious in the lena river waters which was primarily caused by the short residence time of fresh mobilized dom in the soils and river waters in its middle reaches the quantitative and qualitative dom variability was found to be one of the drivers changing the carbonate chemistry of the waters as well as the magnitude and direction of co2 fluxes between the river water and the atmosphere throughout the main stem the waters of the siberian rivers were a source of co2 into the atmosphere higher doc concentrations and higher aromatic dom were found in the ob river waters compared to the waters of permafrost rivers the lena and the anadyr rivers which was caused by higher soil organic carbon content and its greater availability determined by the state of permafrost located in the river s watersheds the data presented in this paper are only a snapshot that shows the state of surveyed river ecosystems however we believe that the results of the study are important both for assessing and for predicting the dynamics of carbon export to the arctic shelf with river runoff depending on the state of permafrost in the catchment area of a particular river and for assessing the carbon balance directly in the channel of each river an understanding of how instream processes alter dom quantity and quality prior to its discharge to the ocean is essential to better anticipate the potential effects of future climate change on the arctic carbon fluxes credit

1937,material transport and transformations in mangrove wetlands are closely related to seawater groundwater mixing processes which can influence mangrove growth and development therefore a clearer understanding of groundwater and salt transport dynamics in aquifers beneath mangrove wetlands is needed to accurately estimate chemical fluxes to mangrove ecosystems we established a multi level groundwater monitoring profile in a mangrove wetland and constructed a numerical model of tidally driven groundwater flow and salt transport that was calibrated to salinity and pore water pressure model results indicated that 99 of groundwater discharge to the mangrove wetland was saltwater and that this discharge accounted for 33 of total discharge over a spring neap tidal cycle tidal creeks that cross cut the wetland received the remaining 67 of total discharge seawater infiltration from tidal action across the wetland formed a subsurface saltwater freshwater mixing zone with a geometry that followed the undulation of a high permeably layer at depth model sensitivity tests showed that salinity distributions and groundwater discharge patterns were controlled strongly by wetland topography and anisotropy model cases with a gently sloping and flat mangrove platform led to substantially less salt mass in the subsurface compared to the base case with mangrove topographic relief models with lower anisotropy allowed salt to penetrate through the high permeability layer to the base of the aquifer the spatial patterns of fresh and saline groundwater discharge and mixing processes within mangrove wetlands as shown in this study may have implications for mangrove tree nutrient availability and for the prevalence and spatial distribution of mangroves along coastlines keywords mangrove wetland saltwater freshwater mixing submarine groundwater discharge groundwater flow and salt transport modeling multi level groundwater monitoring profile salinity dependent ecosystem data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd contributes large quantities of dissolved constituents to coastal waters along coastlines worldwide and is composed of recirculated saline saline sgd and fresh groundwater fresh sgd moore 2010 robinson et al 2018 santos et al 2021 fresh sgd can be highly enriched in dissolved matter relative to surface water weinstein et al 2011 and affects coastal ecosystem stability functioning and productivity santos et al 2021 conversely in the opposite direction the landward movement of saltwater e g due to sea level rise can alter pore water chemistry in wetland soils leading to coastal forest loss expansion of invasive species and other adverse impacts tully et al 2019 mangrove wetlands as the only land sea boundary forest are sensitive to both groundwater and salinity alongi and brinkman 2011 therefore it is important to characterize the magnitudes and spatial patterns of fresh and saline sgd for understanding whole ecosystem scale chemical budgets in mangrove environments further improved insight into aquifer salinity distributions in mangrove wetlands is critical for better understanding controls on the structure and extent of mangrove forests studies of coastal groundwater systems have primarily focused on sandy shorelines robinson et al 2018 geng et al 2020 and these studies have found that freshwater and saltwater flow paths in permeable aquifers are highly complex due to the combined influences of tides waves and variations in topography geology and the terrestrial hydraulic gradient burnett et al 2006 santos et al 2009 greskowiak 2014 heiss 2014 robinson et al 2014 geng et al 2020 this complexity can lead to the formation of salt fingers which cause groundwater to discharge above the low tide line greskowiak 2014 shen et al 2016 shen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a b studies have also quantified groundwater surface water exchanges in salt marshes with similar characteristics to mangroves moffett et al 2012 hou et al 2022 xin et al 2022 however most salt marsh studies are based on theoretical modeling wilson and morris 2012 xin et al 2012 although previous salt marsh studies provide important insight into fluid exchange patterns in mangroves calibrated models are needed to better characterize groundwater discharge patterns and volumes for coastal aquifers composed of fine sediments recent field studies have quantified fluid exchanges across the aquifer ocean interface in mangrove wetlands li et al 2022 measured vertical hydraulic gradients and used darcy s law to estimate exchange rates at multiple points across a mangrove platform tait et al 2017 employed a radium mass balance in multiple mangroves along the australian coastline and estimated groundwater discharge rates ranging from 1 5 to 30 9 cm d more recent studies have observed tidally driven groundwater exchange rates within the same range wadnerkar et al 2021 when accounting for the global area of mangroves tait et al 2017 estimated that groundwater discharge from mangroves is approximately a fifth of global riverine freshwater flows these studies revealed important insights into volumes and the probable range of total fresh and saline fluid exchanges that can occur in mangrove systems however owing to measurement approaches these studies were unable to compartmentalize fresh and saline groundwater discharge components or characterize spatial patterns in fresh and saline discharge studies within the past decade have used numerical models to characterize pore water flow paths and discharge profiles in mangrove aquifers xia and li 2012 combined a numerical model with field measurements to show that groundwater discharged from a mangrove into an adjacent tidal river through a high permeability zone that outcropped into the surface water simulations performed by xiao et al 2019a further demonstrated the importance of geologic layering on pore water flow velocities in mangroves flow velocities were significantly higher in a horizontally continuous sand layer compared to an overlying mud layer in a numerical model of a mangrove system in china xia and li 2012 found that the tidally averaged discharge profile was similar to typical fluid exchange profiles along aquifer ocean interfaces with infiltration near the high tide line and discharge at the low tide mark although groundwater flow and total sgd patterns in mangroves have been well characterized in these studies aquifer salinity distributions have not been explored in detail there are also limited studies exploring subsurface flow and transport in mangroves with calibrated numerical models e g xiao et al 2019a which leaves gaps in process based understanding of fluid exchanges and material transport in mangrove aquifers the shortage of field studies investigating pore water salinity in mangroves is likely due to the difficulty of accessing instrumenting and traversing mangrove platforms owing to dense vegetation and extensive root systems mangrove roots can alter salinity gradients and brackish flow patterns due to salt rejection and evapotranspiration mcgowan and martin 2007 these complexities pose logistical and measurement challenges when investigating salinity distributions in the mangrove subsurface nevertheless a targeted field investigation of pore water salinity distributions in a mangrove aquifer is needed to better understand the connection between land and sea within these hydrologically and biologically active systems the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize spatial and temporal patterns of pore water salinity and fresh and saline sgd in mangrove aquifers influenced by tides and 2 obtain a mechanistic understanding of the role of wetland topography and anisotropy in permeability on sgd and saltwater freshwater mixing in mangrove aquifers to achieve these goals we installed a multi level groundwater monitoring profile in a mangrove wetland and constructed a variable density variably saturated numerical groundwater model the results are the first to demonstrate spatial and temporal patterns of fresh and saline sgd and pore water salinity distributions and dynamics in mangrove aquifers 2 field site and measurements 2 1 study area this study was conducted in a mangrove wetland located in dongzhai harbor a semi enclosed bay with a surface area of 5400 ha located in the northeastern hainan island of china the bay was formed by subsidence during the 1605 qiongzhou earthquake fig 1 a yan et al 2021 the site is the first and largest mangrove forest nature reserve in china with 1750 ha of mangrove forests distributed in the shoals of the intertidal zone dongzhai harbor has a typical tropical monsoon marine climate with an average annual rainfall of 1 816 mm and an average annual temperature of 23 1 c chen 2020 the site has irregular semi diurnal tides and a tidal range of 1 9 m between mean higher high water mhhw 2 1 m and mean lower low water mllw 0 2 m mean sea level is 1 3 m above the local tidal datum at the porchin tidal station national marine data and information service nmdis hainan which is used as the reference elevation in this study surface water salinity gradually increases from 20 ppt in tidal channels in the upper harbor to 35 ppt in pochin bay outside of the harbor the perimeter of dongzhai harbor is underlain by a shallow 30 m thick unconfined quaternary aquifer of clayey sand the neogene confined aquifer lies below the unconfined aquifer and is composed mainly of sandy conglomerate and clastic rock 2 2 sampling profile the field site is near large mariculture ponds 19 59 11 04 n 110 34 18 36 e and is a typical mangrove wetland dominated by the mangrove species rhizophora stylosa two existing domestic wells of 8 m depth border the site one 600 m to the north gw1 and one 800 m to the south gw2 fig 1a these wells were used to assign the landward model boundary condition see section 3 2 there are four tidal creeks tc that surround the site with channel depths of 3 m tc1 2 5 m tc2 2 m tc3 and 0 5 m tc4 fig 1b a 220 m east west multi level sampling profile was installed across the mangrove and comprised 11 multi level sampling sites spaced 20 30 m apart each sampling site was a well cluster system with eight wells installed to different depths in a 1 4 m diameter circulator configuration fig 1b for a total of 88 sampling ports the center well was the deepest 20 m reaching aquifer base with the surrounding wells screened clockwise at depths of 1 m 3 m 6 m 9 m 12 m 15 m and 18 m before the sampling profile was established a 21 m sediment core was taken by a drilling rig 4 m east of sampling well s11 the bottom of the core corresponded to the top of the basement clastic rock thus it represents the full stratigraphic profile and sediment characteristics of the unconfined aquifer at the sampling site the purpose of the core was to provide a lithologic reference for drill cuttings retrieved during the installation of the monitoring wells the multi level sampling profile was installed from october 28 2019 to november 15 2019 the wells were constructed of pvc pipe od 32 mm id 28 mm with 70 cm screens wrapped in a double layer of pet gauze an auger and water jet was used to drill the boreholes and minimize damage to mangrove trees the lithology of the mangrove sediments was logged at each site as the drill cuttings emerged at the top of the borehole once the target depth was achieved the well casing was inserted into the borehole and 2 5 l of course sand was poured down the annular space to increase hydraulic connection between the screen and aquifer the land surface surrounding the well was covered with clay and silt to prevent preferential flow along the casing during high tide after installation compressed air was used to clean all well screens and flush out residual fine sediments and groundwater inside the casing a 10 mm polyurethane pipe was then inserted down the well to the screen for sampling 2 3 field measurements groundwater samples were collected during three periods august 21 2020 august 29 2020 january 9 2021 and july 28 2021 july 30 2021 corresponding to 10 15 and 21 months after the well transect was installed the 10 month period between transect installation and the first sampling event ensured that sediment had sufficient time to settle around the well casings to prevent preferential flow from the surface to the screens during inundating tides a total of 13 groundwater sample sets were collected during daily high or low tide preliminary sampling indicated that the subsurface salinity distribution did not change over a tidal cycle thus the reported cross sections represent snapshots of salinity over a tidal cycle four eight channel peristaltic pumps were used to sample pore water for a total of 88 groundwater samples collected at each sampling event n 1 036 total samples the pump rate was limited to 100 ml min to reduce the possibility of drawing in pore water from nearby sample ports during each sampling event one surface water sample was also collected near s1 salinity was measured with a calibrated portable multimeter model hq40d hach company and is reported as parts per thousand ppt in addition during the first sampling period four in situ loggers model 3001 solinst levelogger ltc were deployed to measure hydraulic head at 5 min intervals in wells s1 21 s6 3 s9 21 and s11 21 number after the site number indicates well depth the loggers were placed at the bottom of well screens to prevent interference during pumping the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer was determined from sediment debris flushed out of boreholes during well installation as well as regional geological data the aquifer is composed a silty mud layer layer 1 a silty clay layer layer 2 a medium fine sand layer layer 3 of variable depth a slit clay layer layer 4 and a shell clastic rock layer not shown which is the effective base of the unconfined aquifer fig 2 falling head tests were used to measure the hydraulic conductivity of each of the four layers due to many mangrove roots and animal burrows in the top silty mud layer alongi and sasekumar 1992 the hydraulic conductivity k of layer 1 was relatively high at 1 0 2 8 m d the measured k value of the silty clay sediment in layer 2 and 4 was 0 1 0 5 m d and 3 6 7 2 m d for the medium to fine sand layer layer 3 the anisotropy coefficient of each layer was determined during model calibration table 2 the topography along the sampling profile was measured by combining differential leveling and 3d lidar the 3d lidar data was used to translate the relative heights from the level measurements to the local tidal datum the elevation survey indicated that the highest elevation between s1 s11 was 1 8 m near s8 and the lowest elevation was 0 8 m near tc4 at s11 the overall slope of the mangrove platform was approximately 0 01 3 numerical model a variably saturated variable density groundwater flow and solute transport model was constructed of the groundwater system at the field site to support the interpretation of observations and provide insight into mangrove wetland groundwater discharge patterns the subsurface flow code pflotran hammond et al 2014 was employed to simulate porous flow and salt transport in the same 2d cross shore aquifer section as the sampling profile pflotran solves the partial differential equations governing flow and solute transport in saturated and unsaturated porous media using a finite volume approach and a fully implicit newton raphson algorithm within pflotran the van genuchten model is used to represent the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation the storage and release of water due to sediment compressibility reeves et al 2000 wilson and gardner 2006 was not considered because xin et al 2009 found that fluxes due to sediment compressibility in tidally influenced systems are negligible when the k value is above 10 6 m s and the k values in the present study were above that threshold with the modeling framework described below the simulations were able to capture tidally driven flow and saltwater freshwater mixing processes within the multi layered mangrove aquifer 3 1 model framework the model domain extended 80 m seaward of s1 and 330 m landward of s11 fig 2 the inland extent of the model was set to where the ratio of the amplitude of hydraulic head fluctuations in the aquifer to the tidal amplitude decreased to 1 ferris 1952 todd and mays 2004 the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer underlying the mangrove was based on the borehole and falling head test data collected across the sampling profile fig 2 borehole records show that the top elevation of the clastic rock at the bottom of the aquifer varies by less than 2 m in the vertical direction along the length of the sampling transect therefore the bottom of the model was set as a horizontal impermeable boundary the model grid was refined near the land surface in the intertidal zone where groundwater flow velocities and concentration gradients were higher within this zone the horizontal and vertical grid sizes were 0 5 m and 0 0625 m respectively grid cell size in the deeper areas of the aquifer and areas landward of the intertidal zone reached a maximum of 0 5 and 10 m in the vertical and horizontal directions respectively established guidelines recommend the péclet number pe δ l α l 4 and courant number cr v δ t δ l 1 be below threshold values to minimize numerical oscillations chang and wang 2002 voss and provost 2002 in these criteria δ l is the distance between two adjacent element faces α l is the longitudinal dispersivity and v is the fluid velocity in the subtidal and intertidal zone the maximum cr is about 0 13 satisfying the criteria seaward of x 250 m the maximum pe in the x and z directions are 3 3 and 0 5 respectively satisfying the pe condition landward of x 250 m the maximum pe in the x and z directions are 10 and 0 5 respectively although the pe in the x direction exceeds the critical value in the far landward section of the model domain we tested the grid size within the x 250 m range of the model and found that reducing the grid length in the x direction to 0 5 m significantly increased model run time while having no discernible impact on the flow field and salt distribution 3 2 boundary conditions boundary conditions were assigned to capture the dominate hydrologic forcings at the study site the landward vertical boundary was set as a hydrostatic pressure boundary equivalent to a hydraulic head of 2 6 m above the tidal datum the assigned head was based on the average terrestrial hydraulic gradient 0 2 measured at gw1 and gw2 during the first sampling period see fig 1a for well locations a tidally resolved time varying specified pressure boundary dirichlet type was assigned to the intertidal zone to mimic tidal forcing and a seepage face was allowed to form on the mangrove surface the seepage face boundary was implemented by setting saturated surface grid cells above the tide level to atmospheric pressure and unsaturated boundary nodes above the tide level to no flow the left vertical and bottom boundary as well as the non inundating land surface were treated as no flow boundaries the time varying specified pressure at the aquifer ocean interface was assigned according to the tidally varying water depth at each inundated model cell because the model required long real world runtimes to reach dynamic steady state six tidal constituents with the largest amplitudes at the site were used to develop a continuous synthetic tidal signal to drive the model the synthetic tidal signal during the one year sampling period adequately matched the measured tides fig s1 the tidal constituents used to generate the tidal signal were obtained by fitting harmonic constituents to measured tidal stage data from the porchin tidal station the included constituents are the principal lunar diurnal o1 lunar solar diurnal k1 principal lunar semidiurnal m2 principal solar semidiurnal s2 lunar elliptic semidiurnal n2 and principal solar diurnal p1 table 1 the following formula was used with the 6 constituents h t h datum i 1 6 a i c o s ω i t θ i where h t m is the tide level varying with time t d and h msl m is the tidal datum for each tidal constituent i a m is the amplitude ω rad d is the tidal angular frequency and θ rad is the phase the transport boundary condition along the aquifer ocean interface was zero concentration gradient for outward flow and a constant concentration of 30 ppt for inward flow the specified concentration of 30 ppt was the average seawater salinity measured in the surface water near s1 during the full monitoring period a constant concentration of 1 ppt was set along the landward vertical boundary all no flow boundaries were set to zero solute flux 3 3 model parameters and model cases this study considers one base model and 4 case models the base model is calibrated to measurements fig 2 and its parameters are shown in table 2 all parameters in table 2 were constant across model cases except for the horizontal and vertical permeability of layers 1 and 2 which were modified in select model cases since only the top silty mud layer layer 1 became unsaturated at low tide the water retention parameters of the deeper layers did not affect model results the measured vertical anisotropy of layers 2 and 4 is small 0 05 likely due to the 1605 earthquake that formed the harbor following the shaking pore space between the silt and clay particles in layers 2 and 4 likely decreased due to grain settlement manga and wang 2015 resulting in tightly packed sediment and high anisotropy the case models were designed to analyze the influence of two key factors on groundwater discharge and pore water salinity in mangrove wetlands topography case t and anisotropy case p two model cases were run for each factor tested fig s1 sensitivity to mangrove wetland topography was evaluated by simplifying the intertidal topography to a constant slope in the first case t case t1 model and setting the intertidal topography to a flat profile in case t2 in the two case p models anisotropy was varied to test sensitivity to animal burrows and sediment compaction following the 1605 earthquake in case p1 the anisotropy of layer 1 was increased to characterize the influence of animal burrows on increasing the permeability of the top aquifer layer the vertical permeability of layer 1 in the base model was high to account for animal burrows thus in case p1 the vertical permeability of layer 1 was reduced relative to the base model from 3 15 10 12 to 3 15 10 13 m2 layer 1 kz kx changed from 1 0 to 0 1 model case p2 was designed to evaluate the influence of layer 2 anisotropy that was likely elevated due sediment compaction from the 1605 earthquake to reflect conditions not influenced by enhanced compaction the vertical permeability of layer 2 was increased slightly relative to the base model from 1 05 10 14 to 2 10 10 14 m2 layer 2 kz kx changed from 0 05 to 0 1 we note that the chosen anisotropy values are a first order estimate of the impacts of animal burrows and earthquake compaction as we lack measurements of burrow geometry and density at the field site as well as permeability measurements before the earthquake initial salinity distributions were adjusted in each model case to decrease the runtime required to reach quasi steady state fig s3 model results were independent of initial salinity distributions which was confirmed by running the simulations long enough until salinities stabilized in the base case model the initial salinity distribution was set similar to the measured salinity distribution as that distribution required the shortest simulation time to reach quasi steady state as fig s2 shows quasi steady conditions were achieved when long term total salt mass reached an asymptote all models ran with 48 intel xeon platinum 8260 cores on the massachusetts green high performance computing cluster tx e1 reuther et al 2018 for the base model with 61 480 active cells and a time step length of one hour the model required a real world runtime of 96 000 days to achieve quasi steady state fig s3 which translated to 115 h of computation time on the cluster exchange profiles streamlines and flow vectors are reported as the average tidally averaged flows over two adjacent spring tides august 19 2020 to september 2 2020 4 results and discussion 4 1 field observations 4 1 1 pore pressure pore pressure in the aquifer responded to both tides and groundwater pumping during sample collection fig 3 shows pore pressure measured in four wells during a period when the wells were pumped intermittently the rapid drop in pore pressure in wells s1 21 s9 21 s11 21 reflected times when water was pumped from the wells to collect pore water samples the rate of recovery to the initial pressure in each well was indicative of the permeability of the material surrounding the wells screens well s1 21 had the slowest recovery and thus was installed in lower permeability material the positive pore pressure spikes in s11 21 were caused by insertion and removal of the pumping hose during sample collection the relative difference in pore pressure between wells at 21 m depth at either end of the sampling transect indicated that the flow direction near the base of the aquifer was from land to the ocean in addition when sea level was below the land surface the low permeability of layer 1 and the relatively flat mangrove surface caused the water table to drop slowly levanon et al 2017 marois and stecher 2020 resulting in nearly constant pore pressure in well s6 3 over tidal cycles 4 1 2 salinity distributions the measured salinities revealed a region of elevated salinity overlaying fresh groundwater fig 4 shows salinity distributions at the 13 sampling times values between sample screens were estimated by interpolating salinity using the ordinary kriging method fig 4b the bottom of the saltwater freshwater mixing zone was consistent with the spatial extent and shape of the high permeability sand layer extending from onshore to offshore figs 2 and 4 freshwater from inland preferentially flowed through the high k layer layer 3 instead of layers 1 and 2 with lower permeability the freshwater flowing quickly though layer 3 transported salt that diffused across the layer 2 3 boundary seaward in effect the high k layer acted as a barrier to downward salt transport because salt was entrained into the freshwater in the high k layer and flushed seaward brackish pore water extended to a depth of 8 12 m between s1 and s5 and then increased in depth gradually to 20 m between s6 to s9 the depth to the bottom of mixing zone then decreased from s9 to s11 fig 4 salinity fluctuations over the 1 year sampling period were generally minor with an average coefficient of variation of salinity below 0 2 across all 88 ports fig s4 salinity at the marine and inland ends of the transect exhibited relatively larger fluctuations the coefficient of variation in these sections of the aquifer were greater than 0 5 fig s4 at the inland end the overall salinity below 12 m depth in wells s10 and s11 decreased over time a possible reason for this change may be due to irregular inland water pumping from nearby aquaculture which may have lowered the freshwater hydraulic gradient during the first sampling periods allowing saline water to intrude inland shi and jiao 2014 before returning to base line conditions there was no observed seasonal trend in subsurface salinity across the sampling periods measured salinities showed that salt accumulated near the rhizophora stylosa mangrove root system which typically extended to a depth of 3 m below the ground surface several pore water samples from wells s3 s9 within this shallow zone were 2 10 ppt higher than surface water these higher salinities were due to transpiration by the mangroves and exclusion of salt during water uptake by the mangrove roots yan and guizhu 2007 4 2 base model 4 2 1 comparison to field measurements simulated salinities at times corresponding to the first 8 sampling events are shown in fig 5 model cross sections corresponding to the other 7 sampling events are not shown because modeled salinity distributions did not change with time the overall modeled salinity distribution was similar to the measurements shown in fig 4 comparison between the measured and simulated values at the sample ports showed that 71 of the simulated salinities were within the 5 ppt confidence interval r squared of 0 83 mean error of 3 3 ppt and that the overall fitting results were good fig 6 large deviations from the measured values were mainly concentrated between sampling sites s9 and s11 where the model underestimated salinities there was excellent agreement from s1 s8 in which the mean error was 1 ppt for all depths additionally both our measurements and the simulated salinities indicated that a lower saltwater freshwater interface was absent below the mangrove wetland figs 4 and 5 the lack of a lower interface was due to the high permeability layer which formed a hydraulic barrier to downward flow of saltwater under the bay immediately adjacent to the mangrove platform fig s5 illustrates that a traditional saltwater freshwater interface forms without the high permeability layer highlighting the importance of the layered geology at this site measured and modeled pore water pressures were compared to provide further insight into the reliability of the model to simulate the groundwater flow system at the dongzhai harbor mangrove site both the measured and simulated pore pressure exhibited small oscillations in response to the overlying tidal forcing fig 7 a d the amplitude of the measured oscillations were slightly larger than those modeled likely because the predicted tidal signal applied in the model was dampened relative to the actual tidal water levels fig 7e interestingly the peaks in measured and modeled pressure for wells s1 21 and s11 21 were in phase with both occurring approximately one hour after high tide despite being on opposite ends of the transect fig 7a and e the similar lag time was likely due to the tidal creek tc4 that flowed adjacent to s11 fig 1 the sediments beneath the platform can be regarded as a u shaped aquifer zhang et al 2020 because tc3 tc2 and tc4 bound the mangrove platform on three sides with this configuration of tidal creeks the distance from tc4 to s11 was approximately the same as the distance from tc3 to s1 as a result periodic pressure fluctuations from tides propagated the same distance to s1 and s11 producing similar lag times there was some discrepancy in observed and modeled pore pressure phases in wells s6 3 and s9 21 fig 7b and c measured pore pressures in both wells responded instantaneously to rising tide levels while simulated pressures lagged the tide by approximately one hour the explanation for the measured instantaneous responses at these two wells is unclear but may be related to small scale tidal channels that were not incorporated into the model and that led to high hydraulic connection of these wells to surface water 4 2 2 total sgd and spatial fluid exchange patterns given that the model satisfactorily reproduced the measured salinity distribution salinity dynamics and pore water pressures we used the model to quantify total sgd and evaluate spatial variability in sgd net outflow averaged across two spring tidal cycles new moon to full moon was 0 40 m2 d per meter length of shoreline net outflow was higher at the two spring tides 0 48 m2 d and 0 47 m2 d relative to neap tides 0 35 m2 d and 0 28 m2 d owing to a stronger land sea hydraulic gradient from the lower tide levels at spring tide the modeled outflow of 0 40 m2 d was about one tenth of the net outflow of 3 94 m2 d simulated in xia and li 2012 for a different mangrove forest in dongzhai harbor this difference is likely due to the more permeable sediments in the mangrove in xia and li 2012 in that study a high permeability zone was only 1 5 m below the surficial low permeability layer compared to 10 m in this study the high permeably layer in xia and li 2012 also acted to channel water from land to the bay because it outcropped across the bottom of the seafloor at our site the high permeability layer continued offshore thus all sgd exited the aquifer through silty clay sgd was compartmentalized into three main zones based on the dominant characteristic along the aquifer ocean interface most mangrove trees at the site were located on the mangrove platform and the seaward boundary of the platform was located at site s1 at an elevation of 1 3 m relative to the local tidal datum equivalent to 0 m msl hence the intersection of msl and the land surface defined the boundary between a below msl zone and a mangrove zone fig 8 b the landward boundary of the mangrove zone was where the platform elevation was 1 8 m farther inland a third zone tc4 tidal creek 4 spanned across the tidal creek that flows perpendicular to the sampling transect between wells s10 and s11 the locations of the three zones are depicted in fig 8b of the 0 40 m2 d of net outflow 45 entered the below msl zone 33 discharged into the mangrove zone and the remaining 22 discharged into tc4 zone table s1 sgd into the tidal creeks along the sampling profile was computed to estimate the total volumetric discharge into tidal creeks in dongzhai harbor the below msl zone can be classified as a tidal creek as tidal creek 3 bounds the west edge of the mangrove wetland thus the sgd rate into the below msl zone and tc4 zone 0 14 m2 d can be taken as an estimate of the sgd rate for tidal creeks surrounding the harbor extrapolating over the mangrove area 1750 ha in dongzhai harbor and considering the density of tidal creeks within the same area 0 002 m m2 estimated from remote sensing images we estimate a total discharge of 4 9 103 m3 d into tidal creeks in the region this compares with 1 2 104 m3 d directly into mangrove forest platforms thus discharge to mangrove platforms may be 2 5 times higher than to tidal creeks in dongzhai harbor the spatially averaged net outflow rate m d into the tidal creeks along the sampling transect i e the average rate in the below msl zone and tc4 zone and mangrove zone were compared to results of previous studies investigating fluid exchanges in mangroves table 3 shows that net outflow at our site was at the lower range measured in other studies however at our site there was significant spatial variability in net outflow inflow rates across the ocean aquifer interface and this variability was highest where there was high topographic relief fig 8a for instance from 76 m x 84 m net outflow reached 4 10 3 m d which was about 6 fold higher than the spatially averaged rate of 6 7 10 4 m d the locally elevated discharge rates more closely approximated the mean rate 3 9 10 3 m d across all previous studies these results indicate that high spatial variability of discharge rates should be considered when quantifying spatially averaged net outflow from mangroves estimates of average net outflow obtained from point measurements along more easily accessible mangrove edges e g wang et al 2022 may over or under estimate outflow depending on local topographic relief and site conditions to further examine sgd patterns we analyzed the freshwater discharge profile along the mangrove aquifer interface freshwater discharge at each model cell was calculated by multiplying total discharge at the cell by the cell s fraction of freshwater over two adjacent spring tides 42 of freshwater discharged to the below msl zone 57 of freshwater discharged to the tc4 zone and only 1 of freshwater discharged to the mangrove zone fig 8a fresh components thus discharge within the mangrove wetland was almost entirely tidally driven saline groundwater circulation of the small volume of freshwater that discharged to the mangrove zone much of it was focused near s3 and s5 at the edges of a mass of circulating saltwater fig 8a c these areas were directly above the crest of the undulating high permeability layer where freshwater continued an upward and seaward trajectory to the surface fig 8c half 51 of seawater that infiltrated into the mangrove zone discharged out of the same zone the remaining 49 discharged to tidal creeks seawater that infiltrated the mangrove zone circulated rapidly through the root zone layer 1 as shown by the tidally averaged streamlines in fig 8c the residence time of circulating saltwater in the root zone 1 000 days was significantly shorter than in the less permeable sediments of layer 2 10 000 days however a significant fraction 90 of seawater that infiltrated the mangrove zone circulated only within layer 1 with only 10 flowing into layer 2 this indicates that most saline groundwater that discharged to the mangrove platform had a relatively short residence time and flowed only through the upper few meters of the aquifer the size of the saltwater freshwater mixing area subsurface where salinity was between 10 and 90 seawater salinity in the aquifer varied by less than 1 m2 in response to tidal stage 12 h and fortnightly spring neap cycling in tidal amplitude fig s6 the mixing zone was stable due in part due to the small amount of seawater that flowed from layer 1 to layer 2 where a large proportion of the mixing zone was located the second factor that contributed to stable salinities was the low permeability of layer 2 which led to a negligible salinity change over the timescales of the overlying tidal forcing fig s6 4 3 effects of topography and anisotropy on seawater groundwater mixing 4 3 1 topography mangrove topography was a major control affecting subsurface salinity distributions compared to the base case model case t1 uniform slope and model case t2 platform resulted in substantially less salt mass in the subsurface fig 9 saline pore water in the case with a uniform slope extended to a depth of only 5 m below the surface fig 9b the results in the case with a platform were similar however a circular mass of saltwater formed below the area extending from the shoreface slope to a distance of 50 m inland fig 9c the flow vectors in fig 9c show that the inland extent of saltwater at x 50 m was bounded by a zone of upward flowing fresh groundwater that was forced out of the high permeability layer due to the bend in the layer s geometry previous studies have explored the effects of multiple topographic profiles with uniform slopes on flow and transport in homogeneous sandy beach aquifers evans et al 2020 greskowiak 2014 the studies revealed that topography has a controlling effect on subsurface salinity distributions in this study we demonstrate that the topographic profile in mangroves is similarly important for flow and mixing our results also capture the combined effects of topography and lithology in both model cases with a constant slope and flat platform the absence of local topographic relief produced a weak hydraulic gradient driving circulating saline flow as a result downward circulating salt was unable to penetrate into the lower permeability material in layer 2 fig 9b c the behavior of the low permeability layer as a physical barrier to downward migration of salt is similar to the findings of zhang et al 2021b in which simulations of salt transport in a beach aquifer showed that downward salt transport was restricted by the presence of a low permeability layer models with a uniform slope case t1 and flat platform case t2 both resulted in salt fingers in layer 1 that extended to the bottom of the layer fig 9b c salt fingers formed in the upper 3 m of the aquifer in case t1 uniform slope and upper 5 m in case t2 platform upward flow of freshwater between salt fingers produced in a pattern of fluctuating proportion of fresh sgd for both topographic profiles fig 9a although fresh discharge between salt fingers produced a spatially variable fresh discharge pattern total sgd was more spatially uniform than the base model because there was no local relief in either topographic scenario fig 9a previous studies have shown that vertical accretion rates can vary spatially within a single mangrove with higher rates in areas where the density of mangrove trees is higher krauss et al 2017 mcivor et al 2013 the spatially heterogeneous vertical accretion rates can result in topographic relief across mangrove wetlands considering these previous findings as well as contrast in sgd patterns between the base case fig 8b and case t2 fig 9b our results suggest that higher topographic relief resulting from variable accretion would increase local hydraulic gradients and drive saltwater deeper into the mangrove subsurface 4 3 2 vertical anisotropy the subsurface salinity distribution was generally insensitive to anisotropy of layer 1 while groundwater discharge exhibited greater variability compared to the base model an increase of anisotropy of layer 1 from 1 0 to 0 1 case p1 representing weaker development of vertical burrow channels in the surface layer resulted in a slight overall decrease in salinity in shallow sediments under the bay and negligible change elsewhere fig 10 b conversely the groundwater discharge pattern was muted and total discharge decreased by 40 0 054 m2 d relative to the base case due to the lower vertical permeability of layer 1 fig 10a in model case p2 where the anisotropy of layer 2 was decreased from 0 05 to 0 1 to reflect more typical anisotropic conditions i e no additional compaction from the 1605 earthquake both groundwater salinity and discharge patterns deviated substantially from the base model fig 10a and c with only a slightly lower anisotropy i e higher vertical permeability in layer 2 more saline groundwater entered the high permeability layer which prevented the preferential seaward flow of freshwater this eliminated the hydraulic barrier effect of the high permeability layer and allowed saltwater to flow to the base of the aquifer apart from a freshwater zone below the inland area of the mangrove x 175 m saltwater occupied the entirety of the aquifer system as a result all freshwater discharged near the high tide line at x 220 m fig 10a interestingly total inflow and outflow patterns were nearly identical to the base model across the mangrove platform despite the large differences in salinity distributions the overlapping exchange profiles in fig 10a are a consequence of the shallow saltwater circulation patterns below the platform in both models as discussed previously most discharge to the mangrove in the base model was saltwater that circulated only though layer 1 which was predominantly saline in model case p2 the bulk of saltwater circulation was also confined to layer 1 thus the spatial discharge patterns were similar as a result total discharge to surface water in case p2 was about the same 94 of base as the base model 3 81 10 1 m2 d vs 4 04 10 1 m2 d respectively table s1 and s2 these results indicate that based on our model setup even a minor environmental change to anisotropy can have a strong impact on subsurface salinity distributions and fresh discharge patterns but may not be a major control on total groundwater discharge from mangroves 4 4 implications for understanding mangrove ecosystem responses the salinity distributions and discharge patterns shown in this study can be used to provide insight into how mangroves may respond to storm events satellite images taken before and after typhoon rammasun that passed through the study site in 2014 showed that mangrove growth near s3 and s5 has been gradually deteriorating since the storm fig s5 the optimal growth conditions for seedlings of the dominant mangrove species at the site rhizophora stylosa are where pore water is 5 ppt kodikara et al 2017 the present study showed there are high pore water salinities 20 ppt in the area of the mangrove forest that was damaged by the typhoon this suggests that mangrove recovery following the storm was inhibited by high pore water salinities that inhibited growth of mangrove seedlings moreover the damaged mangrove area is in a zone of groundwater discharge fig 8c and groundwater discharging from mangroves can serve as a source of heavy metals li et al 2022 which can negatively impact mangrove growth and development sandilyan and kathiresan 2014 yan et al 2017 thus the accumulation of contaminants in the mangrove root zone may have led to mangroves trees that were of poor health and thus vulnerable to damage by storm activity the results of this study may therefore provide a baseline for better understanding the role of subsurface hydrology and redox processes on affecting mangrove resilience to coastal storms and recovery following environmental perturbations 4 5 model limitations the objective of this study was to investigate salinity distributions and fresh and saline groundwater discharge patterns in a mangrove aquifer system while the measured and modeled salinities matched well over the measurement period there are factors that can affect aquifer salinity and groundwater discharge over periods that were not considered in this study additionally we did not measure groundwater discharge at the site thus the modeled discharges and salinity distributions are based on a number of simplifying model assumptions the models did not consider seasonal variations to freshwater hydraulic head fang et al 2022 liu et al 2016 or the effects of pumping on water levels xiao et al 2021 in highly permeable beach aquifers these transient hydrologic forcings can lead to dynamic intertidal saltwater freshwater mixing zones and time varying discharge rates across sediment water interfaces however such responses are likely less pronounced in low permeability mangroves compared to sandy beaches as was the case at our field site this study also neglected evapotranspiration and salt rejection by mangroves mcgowan and martin 2007 which increases the salinity of pore water surrounding mangrove roots as shown in this study potentially affecting density driven flow patterns in addition benthic burrows were not explicitly resolved xin et al 2009 and preferential flow through such burrows can affect tidally driven seawater circulation xiao et al 2019b although these mechanisms and features were not represented in our models the simulations reproduced the measured salinities and pore pressures indicating that the model sufficiently captured the key hydrological processes and geologic structure controlling flow and salt transport in the mangrove subsurface 5 conclusion this study combined numerical variable density variably saturated groundwater flow and salt transport models with high resolution pore water sampling to examine salinity distributions and submarine groundwater discharge patterns in a mangrove aquifer influenced by tides a cross shore multi level groundwater monitoring profile was used to measure salinity and pore pressure through three sampling periods over one year salinity and pore pressure measurements and lithologic data were used to calibrate models for exploring the influence of mangrove topography and anisotropy on saltwater freshwater mixing and fresh and saline groundwater discharge patterns in the mangrove wetland both the measurements and models showed that a saltwater freshwater mixing zone formed below the mangrove platform due to seawater infiltration and mixing with underlying fresh groundwater the bottom of the mixing zone was bounded by a high permeability sand layer that channeled freshwater offshore and served as a hydraulic barrier to downward salt transport the sediment water interface below mean sea level received the highest proportion 45 of total groundwater discharge followed by the mangrove platform 33 and a nearby tidal creek 22 only 1 of fresh groundwater discharged to the mangrove platform indicating that discharge to the mangrove ecosystem was nearly all tidally driven saline circulation moreover 90 of saline discharge to the mangrove platform circulated only within the shallow mangrove root layer with only 10 entering deeper strata model sensitivity tests showed that saltwater freshwater mixing and groundwater discharge patterns were sensitive to mangrove topography and aquifer anisotropy topographic surfaces with little to no relief resulted in muted discharge profiles and substantially less salt mass in the aquifer due to weaker local topographically driven hydraulic gradients analysis of controls of aquifer anisotropy demonstrated the potentially important role of a recent earthquake on sediment compaction and subsurface salinity patterns at the field site these insights of the spatial variability of aquifer salinity and fresh and saline groundwater discharge patterns may aid in preserving and managing

1937,material transport and transformations in mangrove wetlands are closely related to seawater groundwater mixing processes which can influence mangrove growth and development therefore a clearer understanding of groundwater and salt transport dynamics in aquifers beneath mangrove wetlands is needed to accurately estimate chemical fluxes to mangrove ecosystems we established a multi level groundwater monitoring profile in a mangrove wetland and constructed a numerical model of tidally driven groundwater flow and salt transport that was calibrated to salinity and pore water pressure model results indicated that 99 of groundwater discharge to the mangrove wetland was saltwater and that this discharge accounted for 33 of total discharge over a spring neap tidal cycle tidal creeks that cross cut the wetland received the remaining 67 of total discharge seawater infiltration from tidal action across the wetland formed a subsurface saltwater freshwater mixing zone with a geometry that followed the undulation of a high permeably layer at depth model sensitivity tests showed that salinity distributions and groundwater discharge patterns were controlled strongly by wetland topography and anisotropy model cases with a gently sloping and flat mangrove platform led to substantially less salt mass in the subsurface compared to the base case with mangrove topographic relief models with lower anisotropy allowed salt to penetrate through the high permeability layer to the base of the aquifer the spatial patterns of fresh and saline groundwater discharge and mixing processes within mangrove wetlands as shown in this study may have implications for mangrove tree nutrient availability and for the prevalence and spatial distribution of mangroves along coastlines

coastlines worldwide and is composed of recirculated saline saline sgd and fresh groundwater fresh sgd moore 2010 robinson et al 2018 santos et al 2021 fresh sgd can be highly enriched in dissolved matter relative to surface water weinstein et al 2011 and affects coastal ecosystem stability functioning and productivity santos et al 2021 conversely in the opposite direction the landward movement of saltwater e g due to sea level rise can alter pore water chemistry in wetland soils leading to coastal forest loss expansion of invasive species and other adverse impacts tully et al 2019 mangrove wetlands as the only land sea boundary forest are sensitive to both groundwater and salinity alongi and brinkman 2011 therefore it is important to characterize the magnitudes and spatial patterns of fresh and saline sgd for understanding whole ecosystem scale chemical budgets in mangrove environments further improved insight into aquifer salinity distributions in mangrove wetlands is critical for better understanding controls on the structure and extent of mangrove forests studies of coastal groundwater systems have primarily focused on sandy shorelines robinson et al 2018 geng et al 2020 and these studies have found that freshwater and saltwater flow paths in permeable aquifers are highly complex due to the combined influences of tides waves and variations in topography geology and the terrestrial hydraulic gradient burnett et al 2006 santos et al 2009 greskowiak 2014 heiss 2014 robinson et al 2014 geng et al 2020 this complexity can lead to the formation of salt fingers which cause groundwater to discharge above the low tide line greskowiak 2014 shen et al 2016 shen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a b studies have also quantified groundwater surface water exchanges in salt marshes with similar characteristics to mangroves moffett et al 2012 hou et al 2022 xin et al 2022 however most salt marsh studies are based on theoretical modeling wilson and morris 2012 xin et al 2012 although previous salt marsh studies provide important insight into fluid exchange patterns in mangroves calibrated models are needed to better characterize groundwater discharge patterns and volumes for coastal aquifers composed of fine sediments recent field studies have quantified fluid exchanges across the aquifer ocean interface in mangrove wetlands li et al 2022 measured vertical hydraulic gradients and used darcy s law to estimate exchange rates at multiple points across a mangrove platform tait et al 2017 employed a radium mass balance in multiple mangroves along the australian coastline and estimated groundwater discharge rates ranging from 1 5 to 30 9 cm d more recent studies have observed tidally driven groundwater exchange rates within the same range wadnerkar et al 2021 when accounting for the global area of mangroves tait et al 2017 estimated that groundwater discharge from mangroves is approximately a fifth of global riverine freshwater flows these studies revealed important insights into volumes and the probable range of total fresh and saline fluid exchanges that can occur in mangrove systems however owing to measurement approaches these studies were unable to compartmentalize fresh and saline groundwater discharge components or characterize spatial patterns in fresh and saline discharge studies within the past decade have used numerical models to characterize pore water flow paths and discharge profiles in mangrove aquifers xia and li 2012 combined a numerical model with field measurements to show that groundwater discharged from a mangrove into an adjacent tidal river through a high permeability zone that outcropped into the surface water simulations performed by xiao et al 2019a further demonstrated the importance of geologic layering on pore water flow velocities in mangroves flow velocities were significantly higher in a horizontally continuous sand layer compared to an overlying mud layer in a numerical model of a mangrove system in china xia and li 2012 found that the tidally averaged discharge profile was similar to typical fluid exchange profiles along aquifer ocean interfaces with infiltration near the high tide line and discharge at the low tide mark although groundwater flow and total sgd patterns in mangroves have been well characterized in these studies aquifer salinity distributions have not been explored in detail there are also limited studies exploring subsurface flow and transport in mangroves with calibrated numerical models e g xiao et al 2019a which leaves gaps in process based understanding of fluid exchanges and material transport in mangrove aquifers the shortage of field studies investigating pore water salinity in mangroves is likely due to the difficulty of accessing instrumenting and traversing mangrove platforms owing to dense vegetation and extensive root systems mangrove roots can alter salinity gradients and brackish flow patterns due to salt rejection and evapotranspiration mcgowan and martin 2007 these complexities pose logistical and measurement challenges when investigating salinity distributions in the mangrove subsurface nevertheless a targeted field investigation of pore water salinity distributions in a mangrove aquifer is needed to better understand the connection between land and sea within these hydrologically and biologically active systems the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize spatial and temporal patterns of pore water salinity and fresh and saline sgd in mangrove aquifers influenced by tides and 2 obtain a mechanistic understanding of the role of wetland topography and anisotropy in permeability on sgd and saltwater freshwater mixing in mangrove aquifers to achieve these goals we installed a multi level groundwater monitoring profile in a mangrove wetland and constructed a variable density variably saturated numerical groundwater model the results are the first to demonstrate spatial and temporal patterns of fresh and saline sgd and pore water salinity distributions and dynamics in mangrove aquifers 2 field site and measurements 2 1 study area this study was conducted in a mangrove wetland located in dongzhai harbor a semi enclosed bay with a surface area of 5400 ha located in the northeastern hainan island of china the bay was formed by subsidence during the 1605 qiongzhou earthquake fig 1 a yan et al 2021 the site is the first and largest mangrove forest nature reserve in china with 1750 ha of mangrove forests distributed in the shoals of the intertidal zone dongzhai harbor has a typical tropical monsoon marine climate with an average annual rainfall of 1 816 mm and an average annual temperature of 23 1 c chen 2020 the site has irregular semi diurnal tides and a tidal range of 1 9 m between mean higher high water mhhw 2 1 m and mean lower low water mllw 0 2 m mean sea level is 1 3 m above the local tidal datum at the porchin tidal station national marine data and information service nmdis hainan which is used as the reference elevation in this study surface water salinity gradually increases from 20 ppt in tidal channels in the upper harbor to 35 ppt in pochin bay outside of the harbor the perimeter of dongzhai harbor is underlain by a shallow 30 m thick unconfined quaternary aquifer of clayey sand the neogene confined aquifer lies below the unconfined aquifer and is composed mainly of sandy conglomerate and clastic rock 2 2 sampling profile the field site is near large mariculture ponds 19 59 11 04 n 110 34 18 36 e and is a typical mangrove wetland dominated by the mangrove species rhizophora stylosa two existing domestic wells of 8 m depth border the site one 600 m to the north gw1 and one 800 m to the south gw2 fig 1a these wells were used to assign the landward model boundary condition see section 3 2 there are four tidal creeks tc that surround the site with channel depths of 3 m tc1 2 5 m tc2 2 m tc3 and 0 5 m tc4 fig 1b a 220 m east west multi level sampling profile was installed across the mangrove and comprised 11 multi level sampling sites spaced 20 30 m apart each sampling site was a well cluster system with eight wells installed to different depths in a 1 4 m diameter circulator configuration fig 1b for a total of 88 sampling ports the center well was the deepest 20 m reaching aquifer base with the surrounding wells screened clockwise at depths of 1 m 3 m 6 m 9 m 12 m 15 m and 18 m before the sampling profile was established a 21 m sediment core was taken by a drilling rig 4 m east of sampling well s11 the bottom of the core corresponded to the top of the basement clastic rock thus it represents the full stratigraphic profile and sediment characteristics of the unconfined aquifer at the sampling site the purpose of the core was to provide a lithologic reference for drill cuttings retrieved during the installation of the monitoring wells the multi level sampling profile was installed from october 28 2019 to november 15 2019 the wells were constructed of pvc pipe od 32 mm id 28 mm with 70 cm screens wrapped in a double layer of pet gauze an auger and water jet was used to drill the boreholes and minimize damage to mangrove trees the lithology of the mangrove sediments was logged at each site as the drill cuttings emerged at the top of the borehole once the target depth was achieved the well casing was inserted into the borehole and 2 5 l of course sand was poured down the annular space to increase hydraulic connection between the screen and aquifer the land surface surrounding the well was covered with clay and silt to prevent preferential flow along the casing during high tide after installation compressed air was used to clean all well screens and flush out residual fine sediments and groundwater inside the casing a 10 mm polyurethane pipe was then inserted down the well to the screen for sampling 2 3 field measurements groundwater samples were collected during three periods august 21 2020 august 29 2020 january 9 2021 and july 28 2021 july 30 2021 corresponding to 10 15 and 21 months after the well transect was installed the 10 month period between transect installation and the first sampling event ensured that sediment had sufficient time to settle around the well casings to prevent preferential flow from the surface to the screens during inundating tides a total of 13 groundwater sample sets were collected during daily high or low tide preliminary sampling indicated that the subsurface salinity distribution did not change over a tidal cycle thus the reported cross sections represent snapshots of salinity over a tidal cycle four eight channel peristaltic pumps were used to sample pore water for a total of 88 groundwater samples collected at each sampling event n 1 036 total samples the pump rate was limited to 100 ml min to reduce the possibility of drawing in pore water from nearby sample ports during each sampling event one surface water sample was also collected near s1 salinity was measured with a calibrated portable multimeter model hq40d hach company and is reported as parts per thousand ppt in addition during the first sampling period four in situ loggers model 3001 solinst levelogger ltc were deployed to measure hydraulic head at 5 min intervals in wells s1 21 s6 3 s9 21 and s11 21 number after the site number indicates well depth the loggers were placed at the bottom of well screens to prevent interference during pumping the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer was determined from sediment debris flushed out of boreholes during well installation as well as regional geological data the aquifer is composed a silty mud layer layer 1 a silty clay layer layer 2 a medium fine sand layer layer 3 of variable depth a slit clay layer layer 4 and a shell clastic rock layer not shown which is the effective base of the unconfined aquifer fig 2 falling head tests were used to measure the hydraulic conductivity of each of the four layers due to many mangrove roots and animal burrows in the top silty mud layer alongi and sasekumar 1992 the hydraulic conductivity k of layer 1 was relatively high at 1 0 2 8 m d the measured k value of the silty clay sediment in layer 2 and 4 was 0 1 0 5 m d and 3 6 7 2 m d for the medium to fine sand layer layer 3 the anisotropy coefficient of each layer was determined during model calibration table 2 the topography along the sampling profile was measured by combining differential leveling and 3d lidar the 3d lidar data was used to translate the relative heights from the level measurements to the local tidal datum the elevation survey indicated that the highest elevation between s1 s11 was 1 8 m near s8 and the lowest elevation was 0 8 m near tc4 at s11 the overall slope of the mangrove platform was approximately 0 01 3 numerical model a variably saturated variable density groundwater flow and solute transport model was constructed of the groundwater system at the field site to support the interpretation of observations and provide insight into mangrove wetland groundwater discharge patterns the subsurface flow code pflotran hammond et al 2014 was employed to simulate porous flow and salt transport in the same 2d cross shore aquifer section as the sampling profile pflotran solves the partial differential equations governing flow and solute transport in saturated and unsaturated porous media using a finite volume approach and a fully implicit newton raphson algorithm within pflotran the van genuchten model is used to represent the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation the storage and release of water due to sediment compressibility reeves et al 2000 wilson and gardner 2006 was not considered because xin et al 2009 found that fluxes due to sediment compressibility in tidally influenced systems are negligible when the k value is above 10 6 m s and the k values in the present study were above that threshold with the modeling framework described below the simulations were able to capture tidally driven flow and saltwater freshwater mixing processes within the multi layered mangrove aquifer 3 1 model framework the model domain extended 80 m seaward of s1 and 330 m landward of s11 fig 2 the inland extent of the model was set to where the ratio of the amplitude of hydraulic head fluctuations in the aquifer to the tidal amplitude decreased to 1 ferris 1952 todd and mays 2004 the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer underlying the mangrove was based on the borehole and falling head test data collected across the sampling profile fig 2 borehole records show that the top elevation of the clastic rock at the bottom of the aquifer varies by less than 2 m in the vertical direction along the length of the sampling transect therefore the bottom of the model was set as a horizontal impermeable boundary the model grid was refined near the land surface in the intertidal zone where groundwater flow velocities and concentration gradients were higher within this zone the horizontal and vertical grid sizes were 0 5 m and 0 0625 m respectively grid cell size in the deeper areas of the aquifer and areas landward of the intertidal zone reached a maximum of 0 5 and 10 m in the vertical and horizontal directions respectively established guidelines recommend the péclet number pe δ l α l 4 and courant number cr v δ t δ l 1 be below threshold values to minimize numerical oscillations chang and wang 2002 voss and provost 2002 in these criteria δ l is the distance between two adjacent element faces α l is the longitudinal dispersivity and v is the fluid velocity in the subtidal and intertidal zone the maximum cr is about 0 13 satisfying the criteria seaward of x 250 m the maximum pe in the x and z directions are 3 3 and 0 5 respectively satisfying the pe condition landward of x 250 m the maximum pe in the x and z directions are 10 and 0 5 respectively although the pe in the x direction exceeds the critical value in the far landward section of the model domain we tested the grid size within the x 250 m range of the model and found that reducing the grid length in the x direction to 0 5 m significantly increased model run time while having no discernible impact on the flow field and salt distribution 3 2 boundary conditions boundary conditions were assigned to capture the dominate hydrologic forcings at the study site the landward vertical boundary was set as a hydrostatic pressure boundary equivalent to a hydraulic head of 2 6 m above the tidal datum the assigned head was based on the average terrestrial hydraulic gradient 0 2 measured at gw1 and gw2 during the first sampling period see fig 1a for well locations a tidally resolved time varying specified pressure boundary dirichlet type was assigned to the intertidal zone to mimic tidal forcing and a seepage face was allowed to form on the mangrove surface the seepage face boundary was implemented by setting saturated surface grid cells above the tide level to atmospheric pressure and unsaturated boundary nodes above the tide level to no flow the left vertical and bottom boundary as well as the non inundating land surface were treated as no flow boundaries the time varying specified pressure at the aquifer ocean interface was assigned according to the tidally varying water depth at each inundated model cell because the model required long real world runtimes to reach dynamic steady state six tidal constituents with the largest amplitudes at the site were used to develop a continuous synthetic tidal signal to drive the model the synthetic tidal signal during the one year sampling period adequately matched the measured tides fig s1 the tidal constituents used to generate the tidal signal were obtained by fitting harmonic constituents to measured tidal stage data from the porchin tidal station the included constituents are the principal lunar diurnal o1 lunar solar diurnal k1 principal lunar semidiurnal m2 principal solar semidiurnal s2 lunar elliptic semidiurnal n2 and principal solar diurnal p1 table 1 the following formula was used with the 6 constituents h t h datum i 1 6 a i c o s ω i t θ i where h t m is the tide level varying with time t d and h msl m is the tidal datum for each tidal constituent i a m is the amplitude ω rad d is the tidal angular frequency and θ rad is the phase the transport boundary condition along the aquifer ocean interface was zero concentration gradient for outward flow and a constant concentration of 30 ppt for inward flow the specified concentration of 30 ppt was the average seawater salinity measured in the surface water near s1 during the full monitoring period a constant concentration of 1 ppt was set along the landward vertical boundary all no flow boundaries were set to zero solute flux 3 3 model parameters and model cases this study considers one base model and 4 case models the base model is calibrated to measurements fig 2 and its parameters are shown in table 2 all parameters in table 2 were constant across model cases except for the horizontal and vertical permeability of layers 1 and 2 which were modified in select model cases since only the top silty mud layer layer 1 became unsaturated at low tide the water retention parameters of the deeper layers did not affect model results the measured vertical anisotropy of layers 2 and 4 is small 0 05 likely due to the 1605 earthquake that formed the harbor following the shaking pore space between the silt and clay particles in layers 2 and 4 likely decreased due to grain settlement manga and wang 2015 resulting in tightly packed sediment and high anisotropy the case models were designed to analyze the influence of two key factors on groundwater discharge and pore water salinity in mangrove wetlands topography case t and anisotropy case p two model cases were run for each factor tested fig s1 sensitivity to mangrove wetland topography was evaluated by simplifying the intertidal topography to a constant slope in the first case t case t1 model and setting the intertidal topography to a flat profile in case t2 in the two case p models anisotropy was varied to test sensitivity to animal burrows and sediment compaction following the 1605 earthquake in case p1 the anisotropy of layer 1 was increased to characterize the influence of animal burrows on increasing the permeability of the top aquifer layer the vertical permeability of layer 1 in the base model was high to account for animal burrows thus in case p1 the vertical permeability of layer 1 was reduced relative to the base model from 3 15 10 12 to 3 15 10 13 m2 layer 1 kz kx changed from 1 0 to 0 1 model case p2 was designed to evaluate the influence of layer 2 anisotropy that was likely elevated due sediment compaction from the 1605 earthquake to reflect conditions not influenced by enhanced compaction the vertical permeability of layer 2 was increased slightly relative to the base model from 1 05 10 14 to 2 10 10 14 m2 layer 2 kz kx changed from 0 05 to 0 1 we note that the chosen anisotropy values are a first order estimate of the impacts of animal burrows and earthquake compaction as we lack measurements of burrow geometry and density at the field site as well as permeability measurements before the earthquake initial salinity distributions were adjusted in each model case to decrease the runtime required to reach quasi steady state fig s3 model results were independent of initial salinity distributions which was confirmed by running the simulations long enough until salinities stabilized in the base case model the initial salinity distribution was set similar to the measured salinity distribution as that distribution required the shortest simulation time to reach quasi steady state as fig s2 shows quasi steady conditions were achieved when long term total salt mass reached an asymptote all models ran with 48 intel xeon platinum 8260 cores on the massachusetts green high performance computing cluster tx e1 reuther et al 2018 for the base model with 61 480 active cells and a time step length of one hour the model required a real world runtime of 96 000 days to achieve quasi steady state fig s3 which translated to 115 h of computation time on the cluster exchange profiles streamlines and flow vectors are reported as the average tidally averaged flows over two adjacent spring tides august 19 2020 to september 2 2020 4 results and discussion 4 1 field observations 4 1 1 pore pressure pore pressure in the aquifer responded to both tides and groundwater pumping during sample collection fig 3 shows pore pressure measured in four wells during a period when the wells were pumped intermittently the rapid drop in pore pressure in wells s1 21 s9 21 s11 21 reflected times when water was pumped from the wells to collect pore water samples the rate of recovery to the initial pressure in each well was indicative of the permeability of the material surrounding the wells screens well s1 21 had the slowest recovery and thus was installed in lower permeability material the positive pore pressure spikes in s11 21 were caused by insertion and removal of the pumping hose during sample collection the relative difference in pore pressure between wells at 21 m depth at either end of the sampling transect indicated that the flow direction near the base of the aquifer was from land to the ocean in addition when sea level was below the land surface the low permeability of layer 1 and the relatively flat mangrove surface caused the water table to drop slowly levanon et al 2017 marois and stecher 2020 resulting in nearly constant pore pressure in well s6 3 over tidal cycles 4 1 2 salinity distributions the measured salinities revealed a region of elevated salinity overlaying fresh groundwater fig 4 shows salinity distributions at the 13 sampling times values between sample screens were estimated by interpolating salinity using the ordinary kriging method fig 4b the bottom of the saltwater freshwater mixing zone was consistent with the spatial extent and shape of the high permeability sand layer extending from onshore to offshore figs 2 and 4 freshwater from inland preferentially flowed through the high k layer layer 3 instead of layers 1 and 2 with lower permeability the freshwater flowing quickly though layer 3 transported salt that diffused across the layer 2 3 boundary seaward in effect the high k layer acted as a barrier to downward salt transport because salt was entrained into the freshwater in the high k layer and flushed seaward brackish pore water extended to a depth of 8 12 m between s1 and s5 and then increased in depth gradually to 20 m between s6 to s9 the depth to the bottom of mixing zone then decreased from s9 to s11 fig 4 salinity fluctuations over the 1 year sampling period were generally minor with an average coefficient of variation of salinity below 0 2 across all 88 ports fig s4 salinity at the marine and inland ends of the transect exhibited relatively larger fluctuations the coefficient of variation in these sections of the aquifer were greater than 0 5 fig s4 at the inland end the overall salinity below 12 m depth in wells s10 and s11 decreased over time a possible reason for this change may be due to irregular inland water pumping from nearby aquaculture which may have lowered the freshwater hydraulic gradient during the first sampling periods allowing saline water to intrude inland shi and jiao 2014 before returning to base line conditions there was no observed seasonal trend in subsurface salinity across the sampling periods measured salinities showed that salt accumulated near the rhizophora stylosa mangrove root system which typically extended to a depth of 3 m below the ground surface several pore water samples from wells s3 s9 within this shallow zone were 2 10 ppt higher than surface water these higher salinities were due to transpiration by the mangroves and exclusion of salt during water uptake by the mangrove roots yan and guizhu 2007 4 2 base model 4 2 1 comparison to field measurements simulated salinities at times corresponding to the first 8 sampling events are shown in fig 5 model cross sections corresponding to the other 7 sampling events are not shown because modeled salinity distributions did not change with time the overall modeled salinity distribution was similar to the measurements shown in fig 4 comparison between the measured and simulated values at the sample ports showed that 71 of the simulated salinities were within the 5 ppt confidence interval r squared of 0 83 mean error of 3 3 ppt and that the overall fitting results were good fig 6 large deviations from the measured values were mainly concentrated between sampling sites s9 and s11 where the model underestimated salinities there was excellent agreement from s1 s8 in which the mean error was 1 ppt for all depths additionally both our measurements and the simulated salinities indicated that a lower saltwater freshwater interface was absent below the mangrove wetland figs 4 and 5 the lack of a lower interface was due to the high permeability layer which formed a hydraulic barrier to downward flow of saltwater under the bay immediately adjacent to the mangrove platform fig s5 illustrates that a traditional saltwater freshwater interface forms without the high permeability layer highlighting the importance of the layered geology at this site measured and modeled pore water pressures were compared to provide further insight into the reliability of the model to simulate the groundwater flow system at the dongzhai harbor mangrove site both the measured and simulated pore pressure exhibited small oscillations in response to the overlying tidal forcing fig 7 a d the amplitude of the measured oscillations were slightly larger than those modeled likely because the predicted tidal signal applied in the model was dampened relative to the actual tidal water levels fig 7e interestingly the peaks in measured and modeled pressure for wells s1 21 and s11 21 were in phase with both occurring approximately one hour after high tide despite being on opposite ends of the transect fig 7a and e the similar lag time was likely due to the tidal creek tc4 that flowed adjacent to s11 fig 1 the sediments beneath the platform can be regarded as a u shaped aquifer zhang et al 2020 because tc3 tc2 and tc4 bound the mangrove platform on three sides with this configuration of tidal creeks the distance from tc4 to s11 was approximately the same as the distance from tc3 to s1 as a result periodic pressure fluctuations from tides propagated the same distance to s1 and s11 producing similar lag times there was some discrepancy in observed and modeled pore pressure phases in wells s6 3 and s9 21 fig 7b and c measured pore pressures in both wells responded instantaneously to rising tide levels while simulated pressures lagged the tide by approximately one hour the explanation for the measured instantaneous responses at these two wells is unclear but may be related to small scale tidal channels that were not incorporated into the model and that led to high hydraulic connection of these wells to surface water 4 2 2 total sgd and spatial fluid exchange patterns given that the model satisfactorily reproduced the measured salinity distribution salinity dynamics and pore water pressures we used the model to quantify total sgd and evaluate spatial variability in sgd net outflow averaged across two spring tidal cycles new moon to full moon was 0 40 m2 d per meter length of shoreline net outflow was higher at the two spring tides 0 48 m2 d and 0 47 m2 d relative to neap tides 0 35 m2 d and 0 28 m2 d owing to a stronger land sea hydraulic gradient from the lower tide levels at spring tide the modeled outflow of 0 40 m2 d was about one tenth of the net outflow of 3 94 m2 d simulated in xia and li 2012 for a different mangrove forest in dongzhai harbor this difference is likely due to the more permeable sediments in the mangrove in xia and li 2012 in that study a high permeability zone was only 1 5 m below the surficial low permeability layer compared to 10 m in this study the high permeably layer in xia and li 2012 also acted to channel water from land to the bay because it outcropped across the bottom of the seafloor at our site the high permeability layer continued offshore thus all sgd exited the aquifer through silty clay sgd was compartmentalized into three main zones based on the dominant characteristic along the aquifer ocean interface most mangrove trees at the site were located on the mangrove platform and the seaward boundary of the platform was located at site s1 at an elevation of 1 3 m relative to the local tidal datum equivalent to 0 m msl hence the intersection of msl and the land surface defined the boundary between a below msl zone and a mangrove zone fig 8 b the landward boundary of the mangrove zone was where the platform elevation was 1 8 m farther inland a third zone tc4 tidal creek 4 spanned across the tidal creek that flows perpendicular to the sampling transect between wells s10 and s11 the locations of the three zones are depicted in fig 8b of the 0 40 m2 d of net outflow 45 entered the below msl zone 33 discharged into the mangrove zone and the remaining 22 discharged into tc4 zone table s1 sgd into the tidal creeks along the sampling profile was computed to estimate the total volumetric discharge into tidal creeks in dongzhai harbor the below msl zone can be classified as a tidal creek as tidal creek 3 bounds the west edge of the mangrove wetland thus the sgd rate into the below msl zone and tc4 zone 0 14 m2 d can be taken as an estimate of the sgd rate for tidal creeks surrounding the harbor extrapolating over the mangrove area 1750 ha in dongzhai harbor and considering the density of tidal creeks within the same area 0 002 m m2 estimated from remote sensing images we estimate a total discharge of 4 9 103 m3 d into tidal creeks in the region this compares with 1 2 104 m3 d directly into mangrove forest platforms thus discharge to mangrove platforms may be 2 5 times higher than to tidal creeks in dongzhai harbor the spatially averaged net outflow rate m d into the tidal creeks along the sampling transect i e the average rate in the below msl zone and tc4 zone and mangrove zone were compared to results of previous studies investigating fluid exchanges in mangroves table 3 shows that net outflow at our site was at the lower range measured in other studies however at our site there was significant spatial variability in net outflow inflow rates across the ocean aquifer interface and this variability was highest where there was high topographic relief fig 8a for instance from 76 m x 84 m net outflow reached 4 10 3 m d which was about 6 fold higher than the spatially averaged rate of 6 7 10 4 m d the locally elevated discharge rates more closely approximated the mean rate 3 9 10 3 m d across all previous studies these results indicate that high spatial variability of discharge rates should be considered when quantifying spatially averaged net outflow from mangroves estimates of average net outflow obtained from point measurements along more easily accessible mangrove edges e g wang et al 2022 may over or under estimate outflow depending on local topographic relief and site conditions to further examine sgd patterns we analyzed the freshwater discharge profile along the mangrove aquifer interface freshwater discharge at each model cell was calculated by multiplying total discharge at the cell by the cell s fraction of freshwater over two adjacent spring tides 42 of freshwater discharged to the below msl zone 57 of freshwater discharged to the tc4 zone and only 1 of freshwater discharged to the mangrove zone fig 8a fresh components thus discharge within the mangrove wetland was almost entirely tidally driven saline groundwater circulation of the small volume of freshwater that discharged to the mangrove zone much of it was focused near s3 and s5 at the edges of a mass of circulating saltwater fig 8a c these areas were directly above the crest of the undulating high permeability layer where freshwater continued an upward and seaward trajectory to the surface fig 8c half 51 of seawater that infiltrated into the mangrove zone discharged out of the same zone the remaining 49 discharged to tidal creeks seawater that infiltrated the mangrove zone circulated rapidly through the root zone layer 1 as shown by the tidally averaged streamlines in fig 8c the residence time of circulating saltwater in the root zone 1 000 days was significantly shorter than in the less permeable sediments of layer 2 10 000 days however a significant fraction 90 of seawater that infiltrated the mangrove zone circulated only within layer 1 with only 10 flowing into layer 2 this indicates that most saline groundwater that discharged to the mangrove platform had a relatively short residence time and flowed only through the upper few meters of the aquifer the size of the saltwater freshwater mixing area subsurface where salinity was between 10 and 90 seawater salinity in the aquifer varied by less than 1 m2 in response to tidal stage 12 h and fortnightly spring neap cycling in tidal amplitude fig s6 the mixing zone was stable due in part due to the small amount of seawater that flowed from layer 1 to layer 2 where a large proportion of the mixing zone was located the second factor that contributed to stable salinities was the low permeability of layer 2 which led to a negligible salinity change over the timescales of the overlying tidal forcing fig s6 4 3 effects of topography and anisotropy on seawater groundwater mixing 4 3 1 topography mangrove topography was a major control affecting subsurface salinity distributions compared to the base case model case t1 uniform slope and model case t2 platform resulted in substantially less salt mass in the subsurface fig 9 saline pore water in the case with a uniform slope extended to a depth of only 5 m below the surface fig 9b the results in the case with a platform were similar however a circular mass of saltwater formed below the area extending from the shoreface slope to a distance of 50 m inland fig 9c the flow vectors in fig 9c show that the inland extent of saltwater at x 50 m was bounded by a zone of upward flowing fresh groundwater that was forced out of the high permeability layer due to the bend in the layer s geometry previous studies have explored the effects of multiple topographic profiles with uniform slopes on flow and transport in homogeneous sandy beach aquifers evans et al 2020 greskowiak 2014 the studies revealed that topography has a controlling effect on subsurface salinity distributions in this study we demonstrate that the topographic profile in mangroves is similarly important for flow and mixing our results also capture the combined effects of topography and lithology in both model cases with a constant slope and flat platform the absence of local topographic relief produced a weak hydraulic gradient driving circulating saline flow as a result downward circulating salt was unable to penetrate into the lower permeability material in layer 2 fig 9b c the behavior of the low permeability layer as a physical barrier to downward migration of salt is similar to the findings of zhang et al 2021b in which simulations of salt transport in a beach aquifer showed that downward salt transport was restricted by the presence of a low permeability layer models with a uniform slope case t1 and flat platform case t2 both resulted in salt fingers in layer 1 that extended to the bottom of the layer fig 9b c salt fingers formed in the upper 3 m of the aquifer in case t1 uniform slope and upper 5 m in case t2 platform upward flow of freshwater between salt fingers produced in a pattern of fluctuating proportion of fresh sgd for both topographic profiles fig 9a although fresh discharge between salt fingers produced a spatially variable fresh discharge pattern total sgd was more spatially uniform than the base model because there was no local relief in either topographic scenario fig 9a previous studies have shown that vertical accretion rates can vary spatially within a single mangrove with higher rates in areas where the density of mangrove trees is higher krauss et al 2017 mcivor et al 2013 the spatially heterogeneous vertical accretion rates can result in topographic relief across mangrove wetlands considering these previous findings as well as contrast in sgd patterns between the base case fig 8b and case t2 fig 9b our results suggest that higher topographic relief resulting from variable accretion would increase local hydraulic gradients and drive saltwater deeper into the mangrove subsurface 4 3 2 vertical anisotropy the subsurface salinity distribution was generally insensitive to anisotropy of layer 1 while groundwater discharge exhibited greater variability compared to the base model an increase of anisotropy of layer 1 from 1 0 to 0 1 case p1 representing weaker development of vertical burrow channels in the surface layer resulted in a slight overall decrease in salinity in shallow sediments under the bay and negligible change elsewhere fig 10 b conversely the groundwater discharge pattern was muted and total discharge decreased by 40 0 054 m2 d relative to the base case due to the lower vertical permeability of layer 1 fig 10a in model case p2 where the anisotropy of layer 2 was decreased from 0 05 to 0 1 to reflect more typical anisotropic conditions i e no additional compaction from the 1605 earthquake both groundwater salinity and discharge patterns deviated substantially from the base model fig 10a and c with only a slightly lower anisotropy i e higher vertical permeability in layer 2 more saline groundwater entered the high permeability layer which prevented the preferential seaward flow of freshwater this eliminated the hydraulic barrier effect of the high permeability layer and allowed saltwater to flow to the base of the aquifer apart from a freshwater zone below the inland area of the mangrove x 175 m saltwater occupied the entirety of the aquifer system as a result all freshwater discharged near the high tide line at x 220 m fig 10a interestingly total inflow and outflow patterns were nearly identical to the base model across the mangrove platform despite the large differences in salinity distributions the overlapping exchange profiles in fig 10a are a consequence of the shallow saltwater circulation patterns below the platform in both models as discussed previously most discharge to the mangrove in the base model was saltwater that circulated only though layer 1 which was predominantly saline in model case p2 the bulk of saltwater circulation was also confined to layer 1 thus the spatial discharge patterns were similar as a result total discharge to surface water in case p2 was about the same 94 of base as the base model 3 81 10 1 m2 d vs 4 04 10 1 m2 d respectively table s1 and s2 these results indicate that based on our model setup even a minor environmental change to anisotropy can have a strong impact on subsurface salinity distributions and fresh discharge patterns but may not be a major control on total groundwater discharge from mangroves 4 4 implications for understanding mangrove ecosystem responses the salinity distributions and discharge patterns shown in this study can be used to provide insight into how mangroves may respond to storm events satellite images taken before and after typhoon rammasun that passed through the study site in 2014 showed that mangrove growth near s3 and s5 has been gradually deteriorating since the storm fig s5 the optimal growth conditions for seedlings of the dominant mangrove species at the site rhizophora stylosa are where pore water is 5 ppt kodikara et al 2017 the present study showed there are high pore water salinities 20 ppt in the area of the mangrove forest that was damaged by the typhoon this suggests that mangrove recovery following the storm was inhibited by high pore water salinities that inhibited growth of mangrove seedlings moreover the damaged mangrove area is in a zone of groundwater discharge fig 8c and groundwater discharging from mangroves can serve as a source of heavy metals li et al 2022 which can negatively impact mangrove growth and development sandilyan and kathiresan 2014 yan et al 2017 thus the accumulation of contaminants in the mangrove root zone may have led to mangroves trees that were of poor health and thus vulnerable to damage by storm activity the results of this study may therefore provide a baseline for better understanding the role of subsurface hydrology and redox processes on affecting mangrove resilience to coastal storms and recovery following environmental perturbations 4 5 model limitations the objective of this study was to investigate salinity distributions and fresh and saline groundwater discharge patterns in a mangrove aquifer system while the measured and modeled salinities matched well over the measurement period there are factors that can affect aquifer salinity and groundwater discharge over periods that were not considered in this study additionally we did not measure groundwater discharge at the site thus the modeled discharges and salinity distributions are based on a number of simplifying model assumptions the models did not consider seasonal variations to freshwater hydraulic head fang et al 2022 liu et al 2016 or the effects of pumping on water levels xiao et al 2021 in highly permeable beach aquifers these transient hydrologic forcings can lead to dynamic intertidal saltwater freshwater mixing zones and time varying discharge rates across sediment water interfaces however such responses are likely less pronounced in low permeability mangroves compared to sandy beaches as was the case at our field site this study also neglected evapotranspiration and salt rejection by mangroves mcgowan and martin 2007 which increases the salinity of pore water surrounding mangrove roots as shown in this study potentially affecting density driven flow patterns in addition benthic burrows were not explicitly resolved xin et al 2009 and preferential flow through such burrows can affect tidally driven seawater circulation xiao et al 2019b although these mechanisms and features were not represented in our models the simulations reproduced the measured salinities and pore pressures indicating that the model sufficiently captured the key hydrological processes and geologic structure controlling flow and salt transport in the mangrove subsurface 5 conclusion this study combined numerical variable density variably saturated groundwater flow and salt transport models with high resolution pore water sampling to examine salinity distributions and submarine groundwater discharge patterns in a mangrove aquifer influenced by tides a cross shore multi level groundwater monitoring profile was used to measure salinity and pore pressure through three sampling periods over one year salinity and pore pressure measurements and lithologic data were used to calibrate models for exploring the influence of mangrove topography and anisotropy on saltwater freshwater mixing and fresh and saline groundwater discharge patterns in the mangrove wetland both the measurements and models showed that a saltwater freshwater mixing zone formed below the mangrove platform due to seawater infiltration and mixing with underlying fresh groundwater the bottom of the mixing zone was bounded by a high permeability sand layer that channeled freshwater offshore and served as a hydraulic barrier to downward salt transport the sediment water interface below mean sea level received the highest proportion 45 of total groundwater discharge followed by the mangrove platform 33 and a nearby tidal creek 22 only 1 of fresh groundwater discharged to the mangrove platform indicating that discharge to the mangrove ecosystem was nearly all tidally driven saline circulation moreover 90 of saline discharge to the mangrove platform circulated only within the shallow mangrove root layer with only 10 entering deeper strata model sensitivity tests showed that saltwater freshwater mixing and groundwater discharge patterns were sensitive to mangrove topography and aquifer anisotropy topographic surfaces with little to no relief resulted in muted discharge profiles and substantially less salt mass in the aquifer due to weaker local topographically driven hydraulic gradients analysis of controls of aquifer anisotropy demonstrated the potentially important role of a recent earthquake on sediment compaction and subsurface salinity patterns at the field site these insights of the spatial variability of aquifer salinity and fresh and saline groundwater discharge patterns may aid in preserving and managing mangroves and other coastal ecosystems threatened by sea level rise and coastal population growth credit authorship contribution statement kang peng conceptualization investigation methodology formal

1938,bioretention systems are widely used to mitigate the adverse effects of urbanization on the hydrological cycle vegetation plays a key role in the hydrological performance of bioretention systems however few model studies have focused on the effects of vegetation dynamics on performance in this study we propose an eco hydrological model of bioretention systems by coupling a vegetation growth model with a hydrological model the eco hydrological model was verified using 2 year observed data on vegetation coverage soil moisture water depths in the gravel layer and outflow rates of a bioretention system in shenzhen china based on the validated model scenarios were designed to simulate seasonal or interannual changes in vegetation coverage and evaluate their influence on the hydrological performance of the bioretention system the results indicate that i the model is able to explicitly describe vegetation dynamics and hydrological processes of the system and the nash sutcliffe efficiency of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth in the gravel layer and outflow rates range from 0 6 to 0 9 ii vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration volume are moderately or highly sensitive to most parameters of the vegetation module the volume of exfiltration into the surrounding soil and outflow are sensitive to three parameters potential maximum vegetation coverage fcmax potential heat units required for maturation phu and accumulated heat units at the beginning of vegetation coverage decline hupoint in the months with a long antecedent dry period and iii the seasonal and interannual variation in vegetation mainly affects soil moisture and evapotranspiration in addition the variations affect exfiltration and outflow for rainfall events with a long antecedent dry period 9 d therefore an eco hydrological model that considers the influence of vegetation dynamics can be used to evaluate the long term hydrological performance of bioretention systems this study investigated the performance of one species canna indica l further studies are necessary to prove the adaptability of the model to bioretention systems with other vegetation types in different climatic zones keywords bioretention hydrological model vegetation model low impact development data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction excessive urbanization has significantly deteriorated natural hydrological regimes baek et al 2015 yin et al 2021 and low impact development lid principles have been proposed to mitigate the adverse effects of urbanization garcia cuerva et al 2018 zhang and chui 2020 bioretention systems are among the most widely used lid facilities liu et al 2021 sharma and malaviya 2021 the main functions of bioretention systems are to reduce outflow increase evapotranspiration and exfiltrate water into the surrounding soil ahiablame et al 2012 eckart et al 2017 a bioretention system is mainly composed of a ponding layer a soil layer with vegetation and a gravel layer chahal et al 2016 houdeshel et al 2015 johnson and hunt 2016 many experimental studies have shown that vegetation plays an influential role in the hydrological performance of bioretention systems ali et al 2021 skorobogatov et al 2020 for example vegetation can improve evapotranspiration and restore the water storage potential of the soil layer vijayaraghavan et al 2021 reducing the outflow volume of bioretention systems during subsequent rainfall events ali et al 2021 therefore considering the influence of vegetation in models is necessary for evaluating hydrological performance models have been used to simulate the hydrological performance of bioretention systems eckart et al 2017 kaykhosravi et al 2018 in which the effects of vegetation dynamics on performance have been considered commonly used models such as the lid module in swmm and sustain indirectly consider the influence of vegetation by setting a constant rate or a time series of potential rates to simulate evapotranspiration rossman and huber 2016 shoemaker et al 2009 drainmod and hydrus have been used for hydrological simulations of bioretention systems lisenbee et al 2020 li et al 2020a li et al 2020b drainmod generalizes the influence of vegetation by calculating evapotranspiration skaggs 2008 without distinguishing between transpiration and evaporation skaggs 2008 hydrus uses the leaf area index or vegetation coverage to separate potential evapotranspiration into transpiration and evaporation the leaf area index is entered by the user or calculated by inputting vegetation height or vegetation coverage šimůnek et al 2005 models can also describe vegetation growth for example the century model century crop environment resource synthesis ceres and erosion productivity impact calculator epic century simulates vegetation production in grasslands crops and forests production is calculated as an empirical function of soil temperature available water and a self shading factor and an assumption is that incoming solar radiation does not contribute significantly to variability parton et al 1993 phenological development and growth in ceres are specified by cultivar specific genetic coefficients that depend on photoperiod thermal time temperature response and dry matter partitioning eitzinger et al 2004 ceres has been developed for cereal crops such as ceres wheat ceres maize and ceres rice epic simulates annual and perennial vegetation such as crops grasses and trees driven by meteorological factors such as solar radiation and temperature epic simulates biomass and leaf area index according to growth parameters and hydrological conditions sharpley and williams 1990 the crop growth model in epic provides a reference for simulating vegetation changes in bioretention systems however few studies have investigated the application of vegetation models to the simulation of hydrological performance in bioretention systems in this study we propose an eco hydrological model of a bioretention system by coupling a vegetation model with a hydrological model the vegetation module simulates the seasonal and interannual variations in vegetation in response to meteorological and hydrological conditions by referring to epic the crop growth model sharpley and williams 1990 the hydrological module describes the water flow processes in different layers of bioretention systems the two modules are coupled through interactions among vegetation coverage soil moisture and evapotranspiration in addition we conducted a two year observation of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth in the gravel layer and outflow rates of a bioretention system in shenzhen china therefore this study aims to i verify the proposed eco hydrological model of the bioretention system based on observed data ii identify the sensitivity of parameters in the vegetation module to the hydrological performance of the bioretention system and iii evaluate the effects of seasonal and interannual variation in vegetation on hydrological performance 2 material and methods 2 1 site description shenzhen china has a southern subtropical monsoon climate the bioretention system was located at peking university shenzhen graduate school 22 35 n 113 58 e and had a surface area of 15 m2 fig 1 a from top to bottom the bioretention system comprised three layers a 100 mm ponding layer a 500 mm soil layer and a 300 mm gravel layer fig 1 b the soil layer comprised typical bioretention media 9 clay 31 silt and 60 sand and canna indica l the gravel layer was filled with gravels 1 3 cm in diameter a perforated drainage pipe with an upturned elbow was arranged at the bottom of the gravel layer to create a 300 mm internal water storage zone a piece of permeable geotextile was placed between the soil and gravel layers to prevent sediment from entering and clogging the perforated drainage pipe the system was designed to treat runoff from an adjacent road with a catchment area of 90 m2 the confluence ratio ratio of the catchment area to the bioretention system area was 6 1 runoff entered the bioretention system through the stormwater pipe ponding layer soil layer and gravel layer and part of the runoff was discharged into the rainwater well fig 1 c 2 2 data collection data for model calibration and validation were collected over 2 years from september 2019 to january 2022 a weather station hobo u30 onset inc usa was placed near the bioretention system to collect rainfall solar radiation air temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure and relative humidity at 10 min intervals twelve soil moisture sensors envidata dt imko inc germany were buried evenly to monitor changes in soil moisture

meteorological bureau the input data required for the scenario simulations comprised rainfall solar radiation air temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure and the dew point from 2008 to 2018 2 3 model description the eco hydrological bioretention system model was mainly composed of vegetation growth and hydrological modules fig 2 2 3 1 vegetation growth module the vegetation growth module is

series and considers the water balance within the layers and the water flux exchange among layers the ponding layer receives rainfall runoff from the surrounding catchment fig 2 ponding layer the evaporation rate of water in the ponding layer was simulated using the penman monteith formula allen et al 1998 when the surface ponding depth exceeded a given threshold of the overflow depth the runoff flowed into the gravel layer through the orifice of the overflow pipe the overflow rate was computed using the orifice flow formula shown in eq 9 jan and nguyen 2010 9 q overflow k 3600 ζ a 2 g

soil layer receives the infiltration flux from the ponding layer and loses water due to percolation into the gravel layer and evapotranspiration into the atmosphere fig 2 soil layer the infiltration

the shuttleworth wallace model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 was used to simulate the evapotranspiration of the soil layer because of significant seasonal changes in vegetation the radiation reaching the soil was calculated using beer s law and the leaf area index was replaced by 1 6 times vegetation coverage which was obtained by field monitoring the gravel layer receives percolation flux from the soil layer and overflow flux from the ponding layer and loses water due to exfiltration into the surrounding soil outflow to the municipal pipe network and water evaporation in the gravel layer fig 2 gravel layer for exfiltration the green ampt approach was used for simulation eq 12 heber green and ampt 1911 12 f exfil k k 4 s 1 ϕ 4 θ 40 d 3 k ψ 4 f 4 k where fexfil k d3 k and f4 k are the

kpa 2 3 3 model coupling the model inputs were meteorological data such as rainfall solar radiation air temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure and relative humidity the bioretention inflow rate was calculated according to the rainfall and catchment area the model outputs were the vegetation coverage soil moisture of the soil layer water depths of the gravel layer and the volume of evapotranspiration exfiltration and outflow in the bioretention system the vegetation growth and hydrological modules were coupled because they can describe the interactions among vegetation coverage soil moisture and evapotranspiration specifically vegetation coverage in the vegetation growth module affects evapotranspiration in the hydrological module by changing the proportion of radiation distribution between the canopy and the soil moreover the soil moisture in the hydrological module affects vegetation coverage in this study the time step was 5 min 2 4 methods of model evaluation 2 4 1 method of model calibration and validation the model was calibrated and verified using measured vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rates notably the change in water depths of the gravel layer is mainly affected by the processes of exfiltration and evaporation at the layer during dry periods the goodness of fit of the model was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 15 nse 1 t 1 n x obs t x sim t 2 t 1 n x obs t x obs 2 where xobs t xsim t and x obs are the observed values simulated values and mean of the observed values respectively and n is the number of observed values the trial and error method was used to narrow the ranges of the model parameters and the values of the calibrated parameters were then obtained using the genetic algorithm ga single objective optimization model in matlab2019 b the singe objective was sum of nse values of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rates the population size was 200 and the initial population ranges of the parameters were listed in table 1 the other settings were default settings after approximately 100 iterations during the calibration period ga reached the end condition i e function tolerance was lower than 0 001 after ga reached the end condition we used the parameter values obtained by ga to calculate the nse values of indicators vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rates during the calibration period if not all nse values were greater than 0 5 during the calibration period we would use ga again for a new round of model verification if all nse values were greater than 0 5 during the calibration period we would continue to calculate the nse values during the validation period if not all nse values were greater than 0 5 during the validation period we would use ga again for a new round of model verification until the nse values during the calibration and validation periods were all greater than 0 5 2 4 2 method of uncertainty analysis the parameter uncertainty analysis was based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue algorithm beven and binley 1992 the uncertainties of all calibrated parameters listed in table 1 were analyzed the glue method included several steps 1 monte carlo sampling from feasible parameter ranges with uniform distribution the parameter ranges were listed in table 1 10 000 samples for each parameter were retained 2 specification of the likelihood objective function of behavioral parameter sets and a threshold of behavioral parameter sets in the study the nse values of the vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate were chosen as the likelihood objective functions the threshold of likelihood objective function was set to 0 5 only when all nse values i e nse of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate in the calibration and validation periods were all greater than 0 5 the corresponding parameter sets were divided into behavioral parameter sets otherwise the run was considered to be non behavioral and that parameter set was removed from further analysis the threshold for determining the behavioral solutions was subjectively defined here 3 calculation of likelihood values in behavioral parameter sets 4 rescaling of these values to formulate a cumulative distribution derivation of quantiles of uncertainty from the cumulative distribution as a note since each behavioral parameter set corresponds to four nse values i e nse of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate we calculated the average of these four nses in each behavioral parameter set as the likelihood value for rescaling the 90 confidence intervals of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate at any time step during the calibration and validation periods were applied to analyze the model prediction uncertainty respectively containing ratio cr was chosen to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model simulation the cr is the ratio of the number of the observed data enveloped by its confidence interval to the total number of the measured data the closer cr is to 100 the better the simulation cr was calculated as follows 16 cr n e n 100 where n is number of the measured values ne is number of the measured values enveloped by its confidence interval 2 4 3 method of parameters sensitivity analysis we used a local sensitivity analysis method for the sensitivity analysis of the vegetation parameters when one of the parameters in the vegetation module was selected to perform the sensitivity analysis the other parameters remained unchanged the parameters were perturbed using a fixed step size of 10 the disturbance changes were as follows 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 and 50 of the initial value the initial values of each vegetation parameter are listed in table 1 the parameter value for each operation is the initial value of the parameter plus the disturbance change the model was run once for each parameter disturbance change and the disturbance and simulation of the other vegetation parameters were performed in sequence the output values of the average vegetation coverage evapotranspiration volume exfiltration volume and outflow volume at the annual and monthly scales were used as the basis for the sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the annual evapotranspiration volume to the vegetation parameter ah1 was used as an example first we used the initial value of ah1 to calculate the output value of annual evapotranspiration volume y0 next the value of ah1 was assigned to the initial value plus the disturbance change and other parameters were fixed simultaneously we ran the model and obtained the corresponding output value of the annual evapotranspiration volume yj yj 1 after each assignment of ah1 the number of modeling runs m was 12 finally the sensitivity of the annual evapotranspiration volume to ah1 was obtained using eq 17 average value of the elementary effect s was used to evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters eq 17 17 s 0 m 1 y j 1 y j y 0 p j 1 p j m 1 where yj and yj 1 are the output values of the jth and j 1st operations of the model respectively y0 is the initial value of the calculation result pj and pj 1 are the percentages of the jth and j 1st operations of the model respectively and m is the number of modeling runs the sensitivity of the parameters was divided into five categories i 0 s 0 001 insensitivity ii 0 001 s 0 05 small to negligible iii 0 05 s 0 2 medium iv 0 2 s 1 high and v s 1 very high s denotes the absolute value in s 2 5 simulation scenarios design four scenarios were designed to display the differences in the hydrological performance of the bioretention system with or without simulating seasonal or interannual changes in vegetation coverage in scenarios s base and s fixed the simulation duration was set to 1 year we selected meteorological data for a normal year 2012 in shenzhen as the input in scenario s base the vegetation module was used to simulate the variation in vegetation coverage the value of fcmax was set to 1 and the other parameter values of the vegetation module in s base are shown in table 1 in scenario s fixed the vegetation coverage was assumed to be constant fc 0 5 without using the vegetation module the parameters of the hydrological modules in the s base and s fixed models were the same table 1 the influence of seasonal variations in vegetation on hydrological performance was evaluated by comparing the differences in simulation results between scenarios s base and s fixed in the y base and y fixed scenarios the simulation duration was set to 11 years we selected meteorological data for 2008 2018 in shenzhen as inputs in the y based scenario the vegetation module was used to simulate the variation in vegetation coverage the value of fcmax was set as 1 and the other parameter values of the vegetation module in the y based scenario are shown in table 1 in scenario y fixed the vegetation coverage of each year from 2008 to 2018 was set to be the same as that in 2012 without using the vegetation module and the vegetation coverage of 2012 was obtained using scenario y base the parameters of the hydrological modules in the y base and y fixed models were the same table 1 the influence of interannual variations in vegetation on hydrological performance was evaluated by comparing the differences in simulation results between the y base and y fixed scenarios 3 results and discussion 3 1 model verification parameters

in the validation respectively fig 3 the model performed well in simulating the vegetation dynamics and hydrological processes of the bioretention system for vegetation coverage and soil moisture the rise and fall processes of the simulated values are consistent with the measured values fig 3 a1 a2 b1 b2 for the water depth in the gravel layer during the rising stage of water depth in the gravel layer the simulated values are basically consistent with the measured values and in the falling stage the decline rates of simulation values are slightly lower than the measured values generally the simulation of the water depth in the gravel layer is acceptable fig 3 c1 c2 for the outflow rates the rise and fall processes of the simulated outflow rates are basically consistent with that of the measured outflow rates during rainfall events although the simulation of individual flow peaks requires improvement fig 3 d1 d2 3 1 2 uncertainty analysis for parameters uncertainty 142 behavioral parameter sets were obtained the posterior distributions of each vegetation and hydrological modules parameters considered in this model are shown in fig a 1 and fig a 2 respectively sharp and peaked distributions are associated with well identifiable parameters and flat distributions indicate high parameter uncertainty specifically the interval length i e interval between 5 quintiles and 95 quantiles of the vegetation module parameters tb fcmax hupoint and to and the hydrological module parameters η3d hco θfc ф2 and k2s are reduced from priori uncertainty bounds from such distributions parameter estimates can be unambiguously inferred as model values in addition compared with the above parameters the other parameters are equally distributed in the entire ranges considered implying a little effect on the simulation of the model for predictions uncertainty the 90 confidence intervals of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate due to parameter uncertainty were shown in fig 3 respectively the cr values of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate during the calibration period are 83 95 60 and 74 respectively the corresponding cr values are 94 60 60 and 63 during the validation period respectively at least 60 of observations that are contained in the 90 confidence intervals it indicates that the model can be used for eco hydrological simulation in bioretention systems in addition the 90 confidence intervals of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate cannot include all measured values it means that parameter variability alone cannot compensate for other sources of error e g measured data and model structure errors 3 1 3 sensitivity analysis of vegetation module parameters we used measured meteorological data e g rainfall and air temperature and inflow rates in 2020 the annual rainfall was 1773 9 mm and the annual average daily temperature was 23 9 c according to the duration of the antecedent dry period rainfall events 5 mm in 2020 were divided into 73 rainfall events with antecedent dry periods of less than 3 d and 24 rainfall events with antecedent dry periods of more than 3 d the sensitivity analysis of the vegetation module parameters to vegetation coverage and hydrological performance i e evapotranspiration exfiltration and outflow at the annual and monthly scales is as follows the sensitivities of the annual simulation results show that i for the simulated vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration volume most vegetation module parameters except for ah1 and gmhu have medium or high levels of sensitivity specifically fcmax to hupoint tb and phu are highly sensitive parameters and ah2 ah3 and ad are moderately sensitive parameters however ii for the simulated exfiltration and outflow volume all parameters have small or negligible sensitivity fig 4 a furthermore the parameters were divided into three categories according to their sensitivities to the monthly simulation results fig 4 b1 b4 i fcmax hupoint and phu considerably affect not only vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration in most months but also exfiltration and outflow in some months for example fcmax is a moderately or highly sensitive parameter to vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration and is a moderately sensitive parameter to exfiltration and outflow in november ii to tb ad and ah2 are moderately highly or very highly sensitive parameters to vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration in some months whereas they are insensitive to exfiltration and outflow and iii ah1 ah3 and gmhu are small to negligible or insensitive parameters to vegetation coverage and hydrological performance in all months vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration are sensitive to most parameters whether on a monthly or annual scale this finding indicates that the parameters particularly fcmax phu hupoint tb and ad of the vegetation module be estimated as accurately as possible when simulating vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration on monthly or annual scales in addition several parameters ah1 ah3 and gmhu are insensitive to vegetation coverage and hydrological performance and their values can be set according to relevant references such as the epic model documentation sharpley and williams 1990 the monthly exfiltration and outflow volumes are moderately or highly sensitive to fcmax phu and hupoint in months with long antecedent dry periods vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration are the most sensitive to these three parameters therefore these three parameters are more likely to change the evapotranspiration volume and then affect the exfiltration and outflow volumes moreover a long antecedent dry period is necessary for exfiltration and outflow volumes to be sensitive to vegetation parameters an explanation for this result is that vegetation parameters can affect soil moisture through evapotranspiration during dry periods and exfiltration and outflow during rainfall events for example there were two rainfall events 19 and 47 mm on november 10 and 20 respectively and the antecedent dry periods of both rainfall events were approximately 10 d during such a long dry period the difference in vegetation coverage caused by the sensitive parameters fcmax phu and hupoint will significantly affect evapotranspiration exfiltration and outflow in the rainy season frequent rainfall and short antecedent dry periods mostly 3 d although vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration are also sensitive to the parameters fcmax phu and hupoint and the temperature and solar radiation are higher than those in november there is insufficient time for evapotranspiration to change the value of soil moisture thus the parameters cannot affect the volume of exfiltration and outflow moreover the annual exfiltration and outflow volumes are insensitive to all vegetation parameters although some rainfall events with long antecedent dry periods were included in the annual simulation the number of such rainfall events was lower than that of events with large rainfall and short antecedent dry periods the difference in the volume of exfiltration or outflow which is mainly generated during rainfall events with a long antecedent dry period is much less than the annual exfiltration or outflow volume these results indicate that when conducting hydrological simulations during the study period with a long antecedent dry time the values of the three vegetation parameters fcmax phu and hupoint are influential 3 2 simulation of seasonal variations in vegetation and hydrological performance 3 2 1 differences in vegetation coverage between s base and s fixed rainfall has experienced significant seasonal changes in this area the annual rainfall was 1932 9 mm in 2012 rainfall in the rainy season april september was far greater than that in the dry season january march and october december accounting for 80 4 of annual rainfall the monthly average temperature was the lowest in january 13 7 c and the highest in august 29 9 c the change in solar radiation was similar to that in temperature monthly total solar radiation was the lowest in january 202 1 mj m2 and the highest in july 472 7 mj m2 fig 5 vegetation coverage of the bioretention system varied monthly in the s base scenario fig 6 a1 the vegetation coverage was 0 1 before february and then gradually increased reached a maximum of 0 96 in october and then falls rapidly in scenario s fixed an assumption was that vegetation coverage was a constant that did not change with the season fc 0 5 vegetation coverage was obviously different between the s fixed and s base scenarios the differences were divided into three categories fig 6 a2 i vegetation coverage s fixed was greater than vegetation coverage s base from january to april and december the average differences in vegetation coverage in january and february were the largest with a value of 0 4 ii vegetation coverage s fixed was less than vegetation coverage s base from june to october the average difference in september was the largest 0 46 and iii the average value of vegetation coverage s fixed was close to that of vegetation coverage s base in may and november and the daily differences varied significantly for example the daily differences ranged from 0 18 to 0 11 in may 3 2 2 differences in hydrological performance between s base and s fixed the maximum minimum and average evapotranspiration volumes in scenario s base were 3 72 mm d 0 05 mm d and 1 14 mm d respectively the daily evapotranspiration volume was less than 0 25 mm d from january to february increased from march to september and decreased rapidly from october to december fig 6 b1 daily evapotranspiration fluctuated violently from june to october the differences in the daily evapotranspiration volume between scenarios s fixed and s base were divided into two types fig 6 b2 i daily evapotranspiration volume s fixed was greater than daily evapotranspiration volume s base from january to april and december the average difference in daily evapotranspiration in march is the largest 0 5 mm d the maximum percentage of daily evapotranspiration difference is as high as 283 2 on january 3 note the percentage of daily evapotranspiration difference is equal to the daily evapotranspiration volume difference divided by the daily evapotranspiration volume of scenario s based and ii daily evapotranspiration volume s fixed was less than daily evapotranspiration volume s base from june to october the average difference in evapotranspiration in september was the largest 1 mm d the maximum percentage of the daily evapotranspiration difference was 41 4 on september 28 the maximum minimum and average soil moisture values in the s base scenario were 36 4 18 4 and 29 respectively soil moisture had obvious peaks during rainfall events and gradually decreased at intervals between rainfall events the difference in soil moisture between s base and s fixed gradually became obvious with an increase in drought time and after a light rain the soil moisture quickly returned to basically the same level as in october fig 6 c1 the differences in soil moisture were divided into two categories fig 6 c2 i soil moisture s fixed was greater than soil moisture s base from may to november the average difference in soil moisture in october was the largest 2 25 and the maximum percentage of daily soil moisture difference was 17 7 on october 25 note the percentage of daily soil moisture difference is equal to the daily soil moisture difference divided by the daily soil moisture of scenario s based ii soil moisture s fixed was less than soil moisture s base from january to april and december the average difference in march was the largest 0 5 the maximum percentage of daily soil moisture difference was 5 2 on march 30 the maximum and average exfiltration volumes in s base were 60 mm d and 18 8 mm d respectively exfiltration occurs for more than half a year usually during rainfall events and 1 3 d after the events the differences in the daily exfiltration volume between s fixed and s base were evident in rainfall events with a long antecedent dry period fig 6 d1 the differences were divided into two categories fig 6 d2 i daily exfiltration volume s fixed was greater than daily exfiltration volume s base from june to october the average difference in exfiltration volume in october was the largest 4 mm d the maximum daily exfiltration difference on october 27 was 13 6 mm d and the corresponding percentage of difference was as high as 531 6 note the percentage of daily exfiltration difference is equal to the daily exfiltration difference divided by the daily exfiltration volume of scenario s based and ii daily exfiltration volume s fixed was less than daily exfiltration volume s base from january to march and december the average difference in exfiltration volume in march was the largest 1 7 mm d the maximum daily exfiltration difference was on march 31 7 7 mm d and the corresponding percentage of difference was 20 the maximum and average outflow volumes in scenario s base were 1150 mm d and 17 9 mm d respectively outflows occurred for approximately 10 of the year fig 6 e1 the differences in the outflow volume between s fixed and s base were divided into two categories fig 6 e2 i daily outflow volume s fixed was greater than the daily outflow volume s base in january february april november and december and ii daily outflow volume s fixed was less than daily outflow volume s base from june to august and october the maximum daily outflow difference on august 16 was 2 5 mm d and the corresponding percentage of difference was 31 7 note the percentage of daily outflow difference is equal to the daily outflow difference divided by the daily outflow volume of scenario s based 3 2 3 effects of seasonal variation in vegetation on hydrological performance regarding the difference in evapotranspiration vegetation coverage determines the energy distribution ratio of transpiration and evaporation therefore different vegetation coverages have different evapotranspiration volumes under the same climate conditions moreover increases in temperature and solar radiation are conducive to an increase in evapotranspiration therefore climate conditions can also affect the difference in evapotranspiration under the same vegetation coverage difference for example the absolute value of the vegetation coverage difference in january and september was basically the same fig 6 a2 whereas the temperature and solar radiation in september were far greater than those in january fig 5 making the absolute value of the evapotranspiration difference in september greater than that in january fig 6 b2 the difference in soil moisture is mainly controlled by evapotranspiration when the monthly rainfall is not high this situation occurs mainly in dry seasons for example the monthly rainfall in january and march was 45 1 mm and 38 3 mm respectively and the absolute value of the average difference in soil moisture in march was greater than that in january fig 6 c2 because the difference in evapotranspiration in march was greater than that in january fig 6 b2 moreover the difference in soil moisture is mainly controlled by rainfall in months with frequent rainfall this situation mainly occurs during the rainy season for example the differences in evapotranspiration in march and april were similar fig 6 b2 but the difference in soil moisture in april was smaller than that in march fig 6 c2 this phenomenon can be explained by the frequent rainfall in april and the soil moisture loss caused by evapotranspiration can be quickly supplemented by rainfall therefore the differences in soil moisture between the two months were small the differences in exfiltration and outflow are both related to soil moisture and rainfall during rainfall events runoff that could not be stored in the soil layer percolated into the gravel layer and flowed out of the bioretention system through exfiltration and outflow soil moisture determines water storage in the soil layer therefore it can affect the volume of exfiltration and outflow moreover if the rainfall is too low to cause exfiltration or outflow even if the difference in soil moisture is large there is no difference in exfiltration or outflow fig 6 d2 e2 seasonal variations in vegetation and their effects on the hydrological performance of bioretention systems were simulated better by s base than by s fixed 3 3 simulation of interannual variations in vegetation and hydrological performance 3 3 1 differences in vegetation coverage between y base and y fixed rainfall experienced large interannual changes in this area from 2008 to 2018 the annual rainfall was greater than 2000 mm in 2008 and 2016 and was 1126 mm in 2011 rainfall during the same month in different years also varied significantly for example rainfall in june 2008 was as high as 1177 6 mm and that in june 2014 was 129 3 mm annual average temperature and total solar radiation in the region had little interannual changes with the average value of 23 54 c and 3952 6 mj m2 respectively however the monthly average temperature varied significantly throughout the year for example the maximum monthly average temperature from 2008 to 2018 was 30 2 c in august 2011 and the minimum monthly average temperature was 12 2 c in january 2011 the monthly total solar radiation in this area had similar dynamics to those of the temperature and was the lowest level in january 2016 and the highest level in may 2018 189 6 mj m2 and 501 9 mj m2 respectively fig 7 in scenario y base vegetation coverage began to increase in different months january april in different years the vegetation coverage reached a maximum and remained unchanged between august and october the vegetation coverage started to decrease in october or november and then decreased to the lowest coverage fig 8 a1 vegetation coverage set by scenario y fixed decreased to the minimum earlier than that of scenario y base in 2013 and 2014 began to increase later and then decreased to the minimum later than that of scenario y base in 2008 2010 and 2017 2018 the vegetation coverage of y fixed and y base were basically the same in 2011 2012 and 2015 2016 the differences in vegetation coverage between the y fixed and y base were divided into three categories fig 8 a2 i monthly vegetation coverage y fixed was less than monthly vegetation coverage y based during vegetation growth stages and greater than that in y based during decay stages for example the difference in monthly vegetation coverage in april 2009 and november 2009 was 0 1 and 0 29 respectively ii monthly vegetation coverage y fixed was greater than monthly vegetation coverage y based during vegetation growth stages and less than that in y based during decay stages for example the difference in monthly vegetation coverage in may and december 2014 was 0 1 and 0 2 respectively and iii the differences were small and negligible in 2011 2012 the vegetation growth differs by year because of the influence of temperature precipitation and phenology jolly and running 2003 piao et al 2019 3 3 2 differences in hydrological performance between y base and y fixed because of low rainfall solar radiation and vegetation coverage evapotranspiration volumes in the dry season october march are far less than those in the rainy season april september the maximum and minimum evapotranspiration volume in scenario y base were 79 13 mm month in august 2011 and 2 16 mm month in february 2009 respectively the average evapotranspiration volume in the y base scenario was 32 68 mm month fig 8 b1 the differences in evapotranspiration between y base and y fixed were divided into three categories fig 8 b2 i monthly evapotranspiration volume y fixed was greater than the monthly evapotranspiration volume y base in rainy seasons and less than that in y base in dry seasons for example the differences in june 2014 and december 2014 were 4 23 mm month and 5 33 mm month respectively and the corresponding percentage of difference in june 2014 and december 2014 was 10 3 and 20 8 respectively note the percentage of monthly evapotranspiration difference is equal to the monthly evapotranspiration volume difference divided by the monthly evapotranspiration volume of scenario y based ii monthly evapotranspiration volume y fixed was less than monthly evapotranspiration volume y base in rainy seasons and was greater than that in y base in dry seasons for example the differences in april 2009 and december 2009 were 4 65 mm month and 9 33 mm month respectively the corresponding percentage of difference in april 2009 and december 2009 was 25 8 and 89 7 respectively and iii the differences were small enough to be ignored in 2011 2012 the maximum minimum and average soil moisture values in the y based scenario were 31 1 15 9 and 27 3 respectively fig 8 c1 the differences in monthly soil moisture were divided into three categories fig 8 c2 i monthly soil moisture y fixed was greater than monthly soil moisture y base for example the difference in soil moisture reached 1 2 in january 2014 and the corresponding percentage of difference was 4 7 note the percentage of monthly soil moisture difference is equal to the monthly soil moisture difference divided by the monthly soil moisture of scenario y based ii the monthly soil moisture y fixed was less than monthly soil moisture y base for example the difference reached 2 7 in january 2011 and the corresponding percentage of difference was 10 7 and iii there was no difference less than 0 2 in soil moisture namely all rainy seasons and some months with frequent rainfall in dry seasons such as september 2012 and march 2013 monthly exfiltration volume varied significantly by month the maximum and average exfiltration volume in scenario y base were 1224 79 mm month and 384 94 mm month respectively fig 8 d1 the differences in the monthly exfiltration volume between the y base and y fixed scenarios were divided into three types fig 8 d2 i monthly exfiltration volume y fixed was greater than monthly exfiltration volume y base in rainy seasons and less than that in y base in dry seasons for example the differences in april 2010 and february 2011 were 7 02 mm month and 15 1 mm month respectively the corresponding percentage of difference in april 2010 and february 2011 was 1 4 and 51 3 respectively note the percentage of monthly exfiltration difference is equal to the monthly exfiltration volume difference divided by the monthly exfiltration volume of scenario y based ii monthly exfiltration volume y fixed was less than monthly exfiltration volume y base in rainy seasons and greater than that in y base in dry seasons for example the differences in june 2014 and january 2015 were 3 68 mm month and 10 87 mm month respectively the corresponding percentage of difference in june 2014 and january 2015 were 0 7 and 30 5 respectively and iii the differences were less than 1 5 mm month monthly outflow volumes varied significantly the maximum and average outflow volume in scenario y base were 5552 07 mm month and 325 74 mm month respectively fig 8 e1 the differences in monthly outflow volume between scenario y base and y fixed were divided into three types fig 8 e2 i monthly outflow volume y fixed was less than the monthly outflow volume y base such as in december 2009 the difference was 10 22 mm month the corresponding percentage of difference was 20 note the percentage of monthly outflow difference is equal to the monthly outflow volume difference divided by the monthly outflow volume of scenario y based ii monthly outflow volume y fixed was greater than monthly outflow volume y base such as in february 2014 the difference was 8 4 mm month the corresponding percentage of difference was 5 8 and iii basically no differences between the two scenarios were observed 3 3 3 effects of interannual variation in vegetation on hydrological performance maximum vegetation coverage was mainly affected by water and temperature stresses owing to sufficient rainfall and appropriate temperatures during the growth stage of each year in the study area annual maximum vegetation coverage was basically the same however interannual differences in vegetation coverage occurred during the early growth and decay stages fig 8 a1 a2 for example because the monthly average temperature in january 2011 was 12 2 c and not suitable for vegetation growth the time for a new round of vegetation growth was delayed the average monthly temperature in january 2017 was 18 1 c the vegetation began a new round of growth soon after the end of the prior growth cycle figs 7 and 8 a1 the difference in monthly evapotranspiration was accompanied by a difference in vegetation coverage in the rainy and dry seasons fig 8 a2 b2 the difference in soil moisture is not only related to the difference in evapotranspiration but also to rainfall in the dry season rather than in the rainy season the difference in evapotranspiration affected the difference in soil moisture fig 8 b2 c2 the reason for this phenomenon is that in the dry season there is little rainfall and a long antecedent dry period and the loss of soil water is mainly caused by evapotranspiration therefore the difference in evapotranspiration can easily lead to differences in soil moisture the differences in the exfiltration and outflow volumes are both related to the antecedent dry period and rainfall amount when the rainfall amount is sufficiently large to generate exfiltration the longer the antecedent dry period the greater the difference in the exfiltration volume when the antecedent dry period was more than 9 d there was a significant difference in the exfiltration volume between the y base and y fixed scenarios fig 9 a the same conclusion applies to the difference in outflow volume fig 9 b for example in february 2011 the difference in soil moisture was large 1 4 but the rainfall was 36 2 mm which was sufficient to generate exfiltration but insufficient to generate outflow therefore there was only a significant difference in exfiltration 15 1 mm but no outflow occurred fig 8 c2 e2 interannual simulations may cause inaccurate simulations of hydrological performance if the influence of interannual changes in vegetation is not considered in the study area y base better simulated the interannual variations in vegetation and its effects on the hydrological performance of bioretention systems than y fixed did 3 4 limitations of the eco hydrological bioretention system model overall the model is able to simulate the effects of vegetation dynamics on the hydrological performance of layered bioretention systems however this model has limitations and requires further improvement this model is a water balance model which considers that moisture in the soil layer is uniformly distributed the model cannot simulate the change of soil moisture in a vertical profile if it is necessary to simulate the profile distribution of soil moisture in future researches the richard equation can be added to the model besides the model used a simplification of the epic crop growth module to simulate changes in canna indica l a perennial herb in a bioretention system under a southern subtropical monsoon climate generally epic simulates many other perennial vegetation types in temperate subtropical and tropical regions bernardos et al 2001 jia et al 2012 kamali et al 2018 therefore collecting additional growth data e g vegetation coverage of other commonly used vegetation types in bioretention systems is necessary to prove the adaptability of the model to different vegetation types and climatic zones 4 conclusions an eco hydrological bioretention system model was proposed by coupling vegetation growth and hydrological models the model was verified using 2 years of observed data on vegetation dynamics and hydrological performance of a bioretention system in shenzhen china the main results are summarized as follow the proposed model simulates vegetation coverage changes and the water balance in different layers of the bioretention system and considers the interaction between vegetation dynamics and moisture in the soil layer the nse values of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth in the gravel layer and outflow rate were all above 0 6 thus the model performed well in the simulation of both the vegetation dynamics and hydrological processes of the bioretention system vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration volume were sensitive to most parameters of the vegetation module whether on a monthly or annual scale moreover the monthly volume of exfiltration into the surrounding soil and outflow were sensitive to fcmax phu and hupoint during months with long dry periods these parameters must be accurately estimated particularly when simulating monthly exfiltration and outflow with an increase or decrease in vegetation coverage evapotranspiration increases or decreases and soil moisture exfiltration and outflow may decrease or increase seasonal and interannual variations in vegetation mainly affect soil moisture and evapotranspiration these variations also affect exfiltration and outflow for rainfall events with long antecedent dry weather conditions this model can be used to evaluate the long term hydrological performance of bioretention systems considering the influence of vegetation dynamics further studies are required to demonstrate the adaptability of this model to bioretention systems with different vegetation types and climatic zones

1938,bioretention systems are widely used to mitigate the adverse effects of urbanization on the hydrological cycle vegetation plays a key role in the hydrological performance of bioretention systems however few model studies have focused on the effects of vegetation dynamics on performance in this study we propose an eco hydrological model of bioretention systems by coupling a vegetation growth model with a hydrological model the eco hydrological model was verified using 2 year observed data on vegetation coverage soil moisture water depths in the gravel layer and outflow rates of a bioretention system in shenzhen china based on the validated model scenarios were designed to simulate seasonal or interannual changes in vegetation coverage and evaluate their influence on the hydrological performance of the bioretention system the results indicate that i the model is able to explicitly describe vegetation dynamics and hydrological processes of the system and the nash sutcliffe efficiency of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth in the gravel layer and outflow rates range from 0 6 to 0 9 ii vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration volume are moderately or highly sensitive to most parameters of the vegetation module the volume of exfiltration into the surrounding soil and outflow are sensitive to three parameters potential maximum vegetation coverage fcmax potential heat units required for maturation phu and accumulated heat units at the beginning of vegetation coverage decline hupoint in the months with a long antecedent dry period and iii the seasonal and interannual variation in vegetation mainly affects soil moisture and evapotranspiration in addition the variations affect exfiltration and outflow for rainfall events with a long antecedent dry period 9 d therefore an eco hydrological model that considers the influence of vegetation dynamics can be used to evaluate the long term hydrological performance of bioretention systems this study investigated the performance of one species canna indica l further studies are necessary to prove the adaptability of the model to bioretention systems with other vegetation types in

layer a soil layer with vegetation and a gravel layer chahal et al 2016 houdeshel et al 2015 johnson and hunt 2016 many experimental studies have shown that vegetation plays an influential role in the hydrological performance of bioretention systems ali et al 2021 skorobogatov et al 2020 for example vegetation can improve evapotranspiration and restore the water storage potential of the soil layer vijayaraghavan et al 2021 reducing the outflow volume of bioretention systems during subsequent rainfall events ali et al 2021 therefore considering the influence of vegetation in models is necessary for evaluating hydrological performance models have been used to simulate the hydrological performance of bioretention systems eckart et al 2017 kaykhosravi et al 2018 in which the effects of vegetation dynamics on performance have been considered commonly used models such as the lid module in swmm and sustain indirectly consider the influence of vegetation by setting a constant rate or a

cereal crops such as ceres wheat ceres maize and ceres rice epic simulates annual and perennial vegetation such as crops grasses and trees driven by meteorological factors such as solar radiation and temperature epic simulates biomass and leaf area index according to growth parameters and hydrological conditions sharpley and williams 1990 the crop growth model in epic provides a reference for simulating vegetation changes in bioretention systems however few studies have investigated the application of vegetation models to the simulation of hydrological performance in bioretention systems in this study we propose an eco hydrological model of a bioretention system by coupling a vegetation model with a hydrological model the vegetation module simulates the seasonal and interannual variations in vegetation in response to meteorological and hydrological conditions by referring to epic the crop growth model sharpley and williams 1990 the hydrological module describes the water flow processes in different layers of bioretention systems the two modules are coupled through interactions among vegetation coverage soil moisture and evapotranspiration in addition we conducted a two year observation of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth in the gravel layer and outflow rates of a bioretention system in shenzhen china therefore this study aims to i verify the proposed eco hydrological model of the bioretention system based on observed data ii identify the sensitivity of parameters in the vegetation module to the hydrological performance of the bioretention system and iii evaluate the effects of seasonal and interannual variation in vegetation on hydrological performance 2 material and methods 2 1 site description shenzhen china has a southern subtropical monsoon climate the bioretention system was located at peking university shenzhen graduate school 22 35 n 113 58 e and had a surface area of 15 m2 fig 1 a from top to bottom the bioretention system comprised three layers a 100 mm ponding layer a 500 mm soil layer and a 300 mm gravel layer fig 1 b the soil layer comprised typical bioretention media 9 clay 31 silt and 60 sand and canna indica l the gravel layer was filled with gravels 1 3 cm in diameter a perforated drainage pipe with an upturned elbow was arranged at the bottom of the gravel layer to create a 300 mm internal water storage zone a piece of permeable geotextile was placed between the soil and gravel layers to prevent sediment from entering and clogging the perforated drainage pipe the system was designed to treat runoff from an adjacent road with a catchment area of 90 m2 the confluence ratio ratio of the catchment area to the bioretention system area was 6 1 runoff entered the bioretention system through the stormwater pipe ponding layer soil layer and gravel layer and part of the runoff was discharged into the rainwater well fig 1 c 2 2 data collection data for model calibration and

data for soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer outflow rates and vegetation coverage were used for model verification the data for the scenario simulations were collected from the shenzhen meteorological bureau the input data required for the scenario simulations comprised rainfall solar radiation air temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure and the dew point from 2008 to 2018 2 3 model description the eco hydrological bioretention system model was mainly composed of vegetation growth and hydrological modules fig 2 2 3 1 vegetation growth module the vegetation growth module is

evaporation rate of water in the ponding layer was simulated using the penman monteith formula allen et al 1998 when the surface ponding depth exceeded a given threshold of the overflow depth the runoff flowed into the gravel layer through the orifice of the overflow pipe the overflow rate was computed using the orifice flow formula shown in eq 9 jan and nguyen 2010 9 q overflow k 3600 ζ a 2 g

soil layer receives the infiltration flux from the ponding layer and loses water due to percolation into the gravel layer and evapotranspiration into the atmosphere fig 2 soil layer the infiltration

the shuttleworth wallace model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 was used to simulate the evapotranspiration of the soil layer because of significant seasonal changes in vegetation the radiation reaching the soil was calculated using beer s law and the leaf area index was replaced by 1 6 times vegetation coverage which was obtained by field monitoring the gravel layer receives percolation flux from the soil layer and overflow flux from the ponding layer and loses water due to exfiltration into the surrounding soil outflow to the municipal pipe network and water evaporation in the gravel layer

kpa 2 3 3 model coupling the model inputs were meteorological data such as rainfall solar radiation air temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure and relative humidity the bioretention inflow rate was calculated according to the rainfall and catchment area the model outputs were the vegetation coverage soil moisture of the soil layer water depths of the gravel layer and the volume of evapotranspiration exfiltration and outflow in the bioretention system the vegetation growth and hydrological modules were coupled because they can describe the interactions among vegetation coverage soil moisture and evapotranspiration specifically vegetation coverage in the vegetation growth module affects evapotranspiration in the hydrological module by changing the proportion of radiation distribution between the canopy and the soil moreover the soil moisture in the hydrological module affects vegetation coverage in this study the time step was 5 min 2 4 methods of model evaluation 2 4 1 method of model calibration and validation the model was calibrated and verified using measured vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rates notably the change in water depths of the gravel layer is mainly affected by the processes of exfiltration and evaporation at the layer during dry periods the goodness of fit of the model was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 15 nse 1 t 1 n x obs t x sim t 2 t 1 n x obs t x obs 2 where xobs t xsim t and x obs are the observed values simulated values and mean of the observed values respectively and n is the number of observed values the trial and error method was used to narrow the ranges of the model parameters and the values of the calibrated parameters were then obtained using the genetic algorithm ga single objective optimization model in matlab2019 b the singe objective was sum of nse values of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rates the population size was 200 and the initial population ranges of the parameters were listed in table 1 the other settings were default settings after approximately 100 iterations during the calibration period ga reached the end condition i e function tolerance was lower than 0 001 after ga reached the end condition we used the parameter values obtained by ga to calculate the nse values of indicators vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rates during the calibration period if not all nse values were greater than 0 5 during the calibration period we would use ga again for a new round of model verification if all nse values were greater than 0 5 during the calibration period we would continue to calculate the nse values during the validation period if not all nse values were greater than 0 5 during the validation period we would use ga again for a new round of model verification until the nse values during the calibration and validation periods were all greater than 0 5 2 4 2 method of uncertainty analysis the parameter uncertainty analysis was based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue algorithm beven and binley 1992 the uncertainties of all calibrated parameters listed in table 1 were analyzed the glue method included several steps 1 monte carlo sampling from feasible parameter ranges with uniform distribution the parameter ranges were listed in table 1 10 000 samples for each parameter were retained 2 specification of the likelihood objective function of behavioral parameter sets and a threshold of behavioral parameter sets in the study the nse values of the vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate were chosen as the likelihood objective functions the threshold of likelihood objective function was set to 0 5 only when all nse values i e nse of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate in the calibration and validation periods were all greater than 0 5 the corresponding parameter sets were divided into behavioral parameter sets otherwise the run was considered to be non behavioral and that parameter set was removed from further analysis the threshold for determining the behavioral solutions was subjectively defined here 3 calculation of likelihood values in behavioral parameter sets 4 rescaling of these values to formulate a cumulative distribution derivation of quantiles of uncertainty from the cumulative distribution as a note since each behavioral parameter set corresponds to four nse values i e nse of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate we calculated the average of these four nses in each behavioral parameter set as the likelihood value for rescaling the 90 confidence intervals of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate at any time step during the calibration and validation periods were applied to analyze the model prediction uncertainty respectively containing ratio cr was chosen to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model simulation the cr is the ratio of the number of the observed data enveloped by its confidence interval to the total number of the measured data the closer cr is to 100 the better the simulation cr was calculated as follows 16 cr n e n 100 where n is number of the measured values ne is number of the measured values enveloped by its confidence interval 2 4 3 method of parameters sensitivity analysis we used a local sensitivity analysis method for the sensitivity analysis of the vegetation parameters when one of the parameters in the vegetation module was selected to perform the sensitivity analysis the other parameters remained unchanged the parameters were perturbed using a fixed step size of 10 the disturbance changes were as follows 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 and 50 of the initial value the initial values of each vegetation parameter are listed in table 1 the parameter value for each operation is the initial value of the parameter plus the disturbance change the model was run once for each parameter disturbance change and the disturbance and simulation of the other vegetation parameters were performed in sequence the output values of the average vegetation coverage evapotranspiration volume exfiltration volume and outflow volume at the annual and monthly scales were used as the basis for the sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the annual evapotranspiration volume to the vegetation parameter ah1 was used as an example first we used the initial value of ah1 to calculate the output value of annual evapotranspiration volume y0 next the value of ah1 was assigned to the initial value plus the disturbance change and other parameters were fixed simultaneously we ran the model and obtained the corresponding output value of the annual evapotranspiration volume yj yj 1 after each assignment of ah1 the number of modeling runs m was 12 finally the sensitivity of the annual evapotranspiration volume to ah1 was obtained using eq 17 average value of the elementary effect s was used to evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters eq 17 17 s 0 m 1 y j 1 y j y 0 p j 1 p j m 1 where yj and yj 1 are the output values of the jth and j 1st operations of the model respectively y0 is the initial value of the calculation result pj and pj 1 are the percentages of the jth and j 1st operations of the model respectively and m is the number of modeling runs the sensitivity of the parameters was divided into five categories i 0 s 0 001 insensitivity ii 0 001 s 0 05 small to negligible iii 0 05 s 0 2 medium iv 0 2 s 1 high and v s 1 very high s denotes the absolute value in s 2 5 simulation scenarios design four scenarios were designed to display the differences in the hydrological performance of the bioretention system with or without simulating seasonal or interannual changes in vegetation coverage in scenarios s base and s fixed the simulation duration was set to 1 year we selected meteorological data for a normal year 2012 in shenzhen as the input in scenario s base the vegetation module was used to simulate the variation in vegetation coverage the value of fcmax was set to 1 and the other parameter values of the vegetation module in s base are shown in table 1 in scenario s fixed the vegetation coverage was assumed to be constant fc 0 5 without using the vegetation module the parameters of the hydrological modules in the s base and s fixed models were the same table 1 the influence of seasonal variations in vegetation on hydrological performance was evaluated by comparing the differences in simulation results between scenarios s base and s fixed in the y base and y fixed scenarios the simulation duration was set to 11 years we selected meteorological data for 2008 2018 in shenzhen as inputs in the y based scenario the vegetation module was used to simulate the variation in vegetation coverage the value of fcmax was set as 1 and the other parameter values of the vegetation module in the y based scenario are shown in table 1 in scenario y fixed the vegetation coverage of each year from 2008 to 2018 was set to be the same as that in 2012 without using the vegetation module and the vegetation coverage of 2012 was obtained using scenario y base the parameters of the hydrological modules in the y base and y fixed models were the same table 1 the influence of interannual variations in vegetation on hydrological performance was evaluated by comparing the differences in simulation results between the y base and y fixed scenarios 3 results and discussion 3 1 model verification parameters uncertainty and sensitivity analysis 3 1 1 model calibration and validation during the calibration period september 2019 december 2020 the highest monthly average temperature was 30 6 c in july 2020 and the lowest monthly average temperature was 16 7 c in december 2020 the days of different rainfall sizes were as follows light rain 10 mm 25 d moderate rain 10 25 mm 52 d heavy rain 25 50 mm 17 d rainstorm 50 100 mm 9 d and heavy rainstorm 100 250 mm 1 d the eco hydrological bioretention system model was calibrated based on measured data i e vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth in the gravel layer outflow rate and meteorological data during calibration the nse values of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth in the gravel layer and outflow rate were 0 66 0 912 0 815 and 0 703 respectively the calibration parameters are listed in table 1 the model was validated for the period between january 2021 and january 2022 the highest monthly average temperature was 29 5 c in july 2021 and the lowest monthly average temperature was 14 6 c in january 2021 the days of different rainfall sizes were as follows light rain 10 mm 61 d moderate rain 10 25 mm 43 d heavy rain 25 50 mm 9 d rainstorm 50 100 mm 7 d and heavy rainstorm 100 250 mm 2 d the nse values of the vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth in the gravel layer and outflow rate were 0 93 0 792 0 76 and 0 6 in the validation respectively fig 3 the model performed well in simulating the vegetation dynamics and hydrological processes of the bioretention system for vegetation coverage and soil moisture the rise and fall processes of the simulated values are consistent with the measured values fig 3 a1 a2 b1 b2 for the water depth in the gravel layer during the rising stage of water depth in the gravel layer the simulated values are basically consistent with the measured values and in the falling stage the decline rates of simulation values are slightly lower than the measured values generally the simulation of the water depth in the gravel layer is acceptable fig 3 c1 c2 for the outflow rates the rise and fall processes of the simulated outflow rates are basically consistent with that of the measured outflow rates during rainfall events although the simulation of individual flow peaks requires improvement fig 3 d1 d2 3 1 2 uncertainty analysis for parameters uncertainty 142 behavioral parameter sets were obtained the posterior distributions of each vegetation and hydrological modules parameters considered in this model are shown in fig a 1 and fig a 2 respectively sharp and peaked distributions are associated with well identifiable parameters and flat distributions indicate high parameter uncertainty specifically the interval length i e interval between 5 quintiles and 95 quantiles of the vegetation module parameters tb fcmax hupoint and to and the hydrological module parameters η3d hco θfc ф2 and k2s are reduced from priori uncertainty bounds from such distributions parameter estimates can be unambiguously inferred as model values in addition compared with the above parameters the other parameters are equally distributed in the entire ranges considered implying a little effect on the simulation of the model for predictions uncertainty the 90 confidence intervals of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate due to parameter uncertainty were shown in fig 3 respectively the cr values of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate during the calibration period are 83 95 60 and 74 respectively the corresponding cr values are 94 60 60 and 63 during the validation period respectively at least 60 of observations that are contained in the 90 confidence intervals it indicates that the model can be used for eco hydrological simulation in bioretention systems in addition the 90 confidence intervals of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth of the gravel layer and outflow rate cannot include all measured values it means that parameter variability alone cannot compensate for other sources of error e g measured data and model structure errors 3 1 3 sensitivity analysis of vegetation module parameters we used measured meteorological data e g rainfall and air temperature and inflow rates in 2020 the annual rainfall was 1773 9 mm and the annual average daily temperature was 23 9 c according to the duration of the antecedent dry period rainfall events 5 mm in 2020 were divided into 73 rainfall events with antecedent dry periods of less than 3 d and 24 rainfall events with antecedent dry periods of more than 3 d the sensitivity analysis of the vegetation module parameters to vegetation coverage and hydrological performance i e evapotranspiration exfiltration and outflow at the annual and monthly scales is as follows the sensitivities of the annual simulation results show that i for the simulated vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration volume most vegetation module parameters except for ah1 and gmhu have medium or high levels of sensitivity specifically fcmax to hupoint tb and phu are highly sensitive parameters and ah2 ah3 and ad are moderately sensitive parameters however ii for the simulated exfiltration and outflow volume all parameters have small or negligible sensitivity fig 4 a furthermore the parameters were divided into three categories according to their sensitivities to the monthly simulation results fig 4 b1 b4 i fcmax hupoint and phu considerably affect not only vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration in most months but also exfiltration and outflow in some months for example fcmax is a moderately or highly sensitive parameter to vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration and is a moderately sensitive parameter to exfiltration and outflow in november ii to tb ad and ah2 are moderately highly or very highly sensitive parameters to vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration in some months whereas they are insensitive to exfiltration and outflow and iii ah1 ah3 and gmhu are small to negligible or insensitive parameters to vegetation coverage and hydrological performance in all months vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration are sensitive to most parameters whether on a monthly or annual scale this finding indicates that the parameters particularly fcmax phu hupoint tb and ad of the vegetation module be estimated as accurately as possible when simulating vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration on monthly or annual scales in addition several parameters ah1 ah3 and gmhu are insensitive to vegetation coverage and hydrological performance and their values can be set according to relevant references such as the epic model documentation sharpley and williams 1990 the monthly exfiltration and outflow volumes are moderately or highly sensitive to fcmax phu and hupoint in months with long antecedent dry periods vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration are the most sensitive to these three parameters therefore these three parameters are more likely to change the evapotranspiration volume and then affect the exfiltration and outflow volumes moreover a long antecedent dry period is necessary for exfiltration and outflow volumes to be sensitive to vegetation parameters an explanation for this result is that vegetation parameters can affect soil moisture through evapotranspiration during dry periods and exfiltration and outflow during rainfall events for example there were two rainfall events 19 and 47 mm on november 10 and 20 respectively and the antecedent dry periods of both rainfall events were approximately 10 d during such a long dry period the difference in vegetation coverage caused by the sensitive parameters fcmax phu and hupoint will significantly affect evapotranspiration exfiltration and outflow in the rainy season frequent rainfall and short antecedent dry periods mostly 3 d although vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration are also sensitive to the parameters fcmax phu and hupoint and the temperature and solar radiation are higher than those in november there is insufficient time for evapotranspiration to change the value of soil moisture thus the parameters cannot affect the volume of exfiltration and outflow moreover the annual exfiltration and outflow volumes are insensitive to all vegetation parameters although some rainfall events with long antecedent dry periods were included in the annual simulation the number of such rainfall events was lower than that of events with large rainfall and short antecedent dry periods the difference in the volume of exfiltration or outflow which is mainly generated during rainfall events with a long antecedent dry period is much less than the annual exfiltration or outflow volume these results indicate that when conducting hydrological simulations during the study period with a long antecedent dry time the values of the three vegetation parameters fcmax phu and hupoint are influential 3 2 simulation of seasonal variations in vegetation and hydrological performance 3 2 1 differences in vegetation coverage between s base and s fixed rainfall has experienced significant seasonal changes in this area the annual rainfall was 1932 9 mm in 2012 rainfall in the rainy season april september was far greater than that in the dry season january march and october december accounting for 80 4 of annual rainfall the monthly average temperature was the lowest in january 13 7 c and the highest in august 29 9 c the change in solar radiation was similar to that in temperature monthly total solar radiation was the lowest in january 202 1 mj m2 and the highest in july 472 7 mj m2 fig 5 vegetation coverage of the bioretention system varied monthly in the s base scenario fig 6 a1 the vegetation coverage was 0 1 before february and then gradually increased reached a maximum of 0 96 in october and then falls rapidly in scenario s fixed an assumption was that vegetation coverage was a constant that did not change with the season fc 0 5 vegetation coverage was obviously different between the s fixed and s base scenarios the differences were divided into three categories fig 6 a2 i vegetation coverage s fixed was greater than vegetation coverage s base from january to april and december the average differences in vegetation coverage in january and february were the largest with a value of 0 4 ii vegetation coverage s fixed was less than vegetation coverage s base from june to october the average difference in september was the largest 0 46 and iii the average value of vegetation coverage s fixed was close to that of vegetation coverage s base in may and november and the daily differences varied significantly for example the daily differences ranged from 0 18 to 0 11 in may 3 2 2 differences in hydrological performance between s base and s fixed the maximum minimum and average evapotranspiration volumes in scenario s base were 3 72 mm d 0 05 mm d and 1 14 mm d respectively the daily evapotranspiration volume was less than 0 25 mm d from january to february increased from march to september and decreased rapidly from october to december fig 6 b1 daily evapotranspiration fluctuated violently from june to october the differences in the daily evapotranspiration volume between scenarios s fixed and s base were divided into two types fig 6 b2 i daily evapotranspiration volume s fixed was greater than daily evapotranspiration volume s base from january to april and december the average difference in daily evapotranspiration in march is the largest 0 5 mm d the maximum percentage of daily evapotranspiration difference is as high as 283 2 on january 3 note the percentage of daily evapotranspiration difference is equal to the daily evapotranspiration volume difference divided by the daily evapotranspiration volume of scenario s based and ii daily evapotranspiration volume s fixed was less than daily evapotranspiration volume s base from june to october the average difference in evapotranspiration in september was the largest 1 mm d the maximum percentage of the daily evapotranspiration difference was 41 4 on september 28 the maximum minimum and average soil moisture values in the s base scenario were 36 4 18 4 and 29 respectively soil moisture had obvious peaks during rainfall events and gradually decreased at intervals between rainfall events the difference in soil moisture between s base and s fixed gradually became obvious with an increase in drought time and after a light rain the soil moisture quickly returned to basically the same level as in october fig 6 c1 the differences in soil moisture were divided into two categories fig 6 c2 i soil moisture s fixed was greater than soil moisture s base from may to november the average difference in soil moisture in october was the largest 2 25 and the maximum percentage of daily soil moisture difference was 17 7 on october 25 note the percentage of daily soil moisture difference is equal to the daily soil moisture difference divided by the daily soil moisture of scenario s based ii soil moisture s fixed was less than soil moisture s base from january to april and december the average difference in march was the largest 0 5 the maximum percentage of daily soil moisture difference was 5 2 on march 30 the maximum and average exfiltration volumes in s base were 60 mm d and 18 8 mm d respectively exfiltration occurs for more than half a year usually during rainfall events and 1 3 d after the events the differences in the daily exfiltration volume between s fixed and s base were evident in rainfall events with a long antecedent dry period fig 6 d1 the differences were divided into two categories fig 6 d2 i daily exfiltration volume s fixed was greater than daily exfiltration volume s base from june to october the average difference in exfiltration volume in october was the largest 4 mm d the maximum daily exfiltration difference on october 27 was 13 6 mm d and the corresponding percentage of difference was as high as 531 6 note the percentage of daily exfiltration difference is equal to the daily exfiltration difference divided by the daily exfiltration volume of scenario s based and ii daily exfiltration volume s fixed was less than daily exfiltration volume s base from january to march and december the average difference in exfiltration volume in march was the largest 1 7 mm d the maximum daily exfiltration difference was on march 31 7 7 mm d and the corresponding percentage of difference was 20 the maximum and average outflow volumes in scenario s base were 1150 mm d and 17 9 mm d respectively outflows occurred for approximately 10 of the year fig 6 e1 the differences in the outflow volume between s fixed and s base were divided into two categories fig 6 e2 i daily outflow volume s fixed was greater than the daily outflow volume s base in january february april november and december and ii daily outflow volume s fixed was less than daily outflow volume s base from june to august and october the maximum daily outflow difference on august 16 was 2 5 mm d and the corresponding percentage of difference was 31 7 note the percentage of daily outflow difference is equal to the daily outflow difference divided by the daily outflow volume of scenario s based 3 2 3 effects of seasonal variation in vegetation on hydrological performance regarding the difference in evapotranspiration vegetation coverage determines the energy distribution ratio of transpiration and evaporation therefore different vegetation coverages have different evapotranspiration volumes under the same climate conditions moreover increases in temperature and solar radiation are conducive to an increase in evapotranspiration therefore climate conditions can also affect the difference in evapotranspiration under the same vegetation coverage difference for example the absolute value of the vegetation coverage difference in january and september was basically the same fig 6 a2 whereas the temperature and solar radiation in september were far greater than those in january fig 5 making the absolute value of the evapotranspiration difference in september greater than that in january fig 6 b2 the difference in soil moisture is mainly controlled by evapotranspiration when the monthly rainfall is not high this situation occurs mainly in dry seasons for example the monthly rainfall in january and march was 45 1 mm and 38 3 mm respectively and the absolute value of the average difference in soil moisture in march was greater than that in january fig 6 c2 because the difference in evapotranspiration in march was greater than that in january fig 6 b2 moreover the difference in soil moisture is mainly controlled by rainfall in months with frequent rainfall this situation mainly occurs during the rainy season for example the differences in evapotranspiration in march and april were similar fig 6 b2 but the difference in soil moisture in april was smaller than that in march fig 6 c2 this phenomenon can be explained by the frequent rainfall in april and the soil moisture loss caused by evapotranspiration can be quickly supplemented by rainfall therefore the differences in soil moisture between the two months were small the differences in exfiltration and outflow are both related to soil moisture and rainfall during rainfall events runoff that could not be stored in the soil layer percolated into the gravel layer and flowed out of the bioretention system through exfiltration and outflow soil moisture determines water storage in the soil layer therefore it can affect the volume of exfiltration and outflow moreover if the rainfall is too low to cause exfiltration or outflow even if the difference in soil moisture is large there is no difference in exfiltration or outflow fig 6 d2 e2 seasonal variations in vegetation and their effects on the hydrological performance of bioretention systems were simulated better by s base than by s fixed 3 3 simulation of interannual variations in vegetation and hydrological performance 3 3 1 differences in vegetation coverage between y base and y fixed rainfall experienced large interannual changes in this area from 2008 to 2018 the annual rainfall was greater than 2000 mm in 2008 and 2016 and was 1126 mm in 2011 rainfall during the same month in different years also varied significantly for example rainfall in june 2008 was as high as 1177 6 mm and that in june 2014 was 129 3 mm annual average temperature and total solar radiation in the region had little interannual changes with the average value of 23 54 c and 3952 6 mj m2 respectively however the monthly average temperature varied significantly throughout the year for example the maximum monthly average temperature from 2008 to 2018 was 30 2 c in august 2011 and the minimum monthly average temperature was 12 2 c in january 2011 the monthly total solar radiation in this area had similar dynamics to those of the temperature and was the lowest level in january 2016 and the highest level in may 2018 189 6 mj m2 and 501 9 mj m2 respectively fig 7 in scenario y base vegetation coverage began to increase in different months january april in different years the vegetation coverage reached a maximum and remained unchanged between august and october the vegetation coverage started to decrease in october or november and then decreased to the lowest coverage fig 8 a1 vegetation coverage set by scenario y fixed decreased to the minimum earlier than that of scenario y base in 2013 and 2014 began to increase later and then decreased to the minimum later than that of scenario y base in 2008 2010 and 2017 2018 the vegetation coverage of y fixed and y base were basically the same in 2011 2012 and 2015 2016 the differences in vegetation coverage between the y fixed and y base were divided into three categories fig 8 a2 i monthly vegetation coverage y fixed was less than monthly vegetation coverage y based during vegetation growth stages and greater than that in y based during decay stages for example the difference in monthly vegetation coverage in april 2009 and november 2009 was 0 1 and 0 29 respectively ii monthly vegetation coverage y fixed was greater than monthly vegetation coverage y based during vegetation growth stages and less than that in y based during decay stages for example the difference in monthly vegetation coverage in may and december 2014 was 0 1 and 0 2 respectively and iii the differences were small and negligible in 2011 2012 the vegetation growth differs by year because of the influence of temperature precipitation and phenology jolly and running 2003 piao et al 2019 3 3 2 differences in hydrological performance between y base and y fixed because of low rainfall solar radiation and vegetation coverage evapotranspiration volumes in the dry season october march are far less than those in the rainy season april september the maximum and minimum evapotranspiration volume in scenario y base were 79 13 mm month in august 2011 and 2 16 mm month in february 2009 respectively the average evapotranspiration volume in the y base scenario was 32 68 mm month fig 8 b1 the differences in evapotranspiration between y base and y fixed were divided into three categories fig 8 b2 i monthly evapotranspiration volume y fixed was greater than the monthly evapotranspiration volume y base in rainy seasons and less than that in y base in dry seasons for example the differences in june 2014 and december 2014 were 4 23 mm month and 5 33 mm month respectively and the corresponding percentage of difference in june 2014 and december 2014 was 10 3 and 20 8 respectively note the percentage of monthly evapotranspiration difference is equal to the monthly evapotranspiration volume difference divided by the monthly evapotranspiration volume of scenario y based ii monthly evapotranspiration volume y fixed was less than monthly evapotranspiration volume y base in rainy seasons and was greater than that in y base in dry seasons for example the differences in april 2009 and december 2009 were 4 65 mm month and 9 33 mm month respectively the corresponding percentage of difference in april 2009 and december 2009 was 25 8 and 89 7 respectively and iii the differences were small enough to be ignored in 2011 2012 the maximum minimum and average soil moisture values in the y based scenario were 31 1 15 9 and 27 3 respectively fig 8 c1 the differences in monthly soil moisture were divided into three categories fig 8 c2 i monthly soil moisture y fixed was greater than monthly soil moisture y base for example the difference in soil moisture reached 1 2 in january 2014 and the corresponding percentage of difference was 4 7 note the percentage of monthly soil moisture difference is equal to the monthly soil moisture difference divided by the monthly soil moisture of scenario y based ii the monthly soil moisture y fixed was less than monthly soil moisture y base for example the difference reached 2 7 in january 2011 and the corresponding percentage of difference was 10 7 and iii there was no difference less than 0 2 in soil moisture namely all rainy seasons and some months with frequent rainfall in dry seasons such as september 2012 and march 2013 monthly exfiltration volume varied significantly by month the maximum and average exfiltration volume in scenario y base were 1224 79 mm month and 384 94 mm month respectively fig 8 d1 the differences in the monthly exfiltration volume between the y base and y fixed scenarios were divided into three types fig 8 d2 i monthly exfiltration volume y fixed was greater than monthly exfiltration volume y base in rainy seasons and less than that in y base in dry seasons for example the differences in april 2010 and february 2011 were 7 02 mm month and 15 1 mm month respectively the corresponding percentage of difference in april 2010 and february 2011 was 1 4 and 51 3 respectively note the percentage of monthly exfiltration difference is equal to the monthly exfiltration volume difference divided by the monthly exfiltration volume of scenario y based ii monthly exfiltration volume y fixed was less than monthly exfiltration volume y base in rainy seasons and greater than that in y base in dry seasons for example the differences in june 2014 and january 2015 were 3 68 mm month and 10 87 mm month respectively the corresponding percentage of difference in june 2014 and january 2015 were 0 7 and 30 5 respectively and iii the differences were less than 1 5 mm month monthly outflow volumes varied significantly the maximum and average outflow volume in scenario y base were 5552 07 mm month and 325 74 mm month respectively fig 8 e1 the differences in monthly outflow volume between scenario y base and y fixed were divided into three types fig 8 e2 i monthly outflow volume y fixed was less than the monthly outflow volume y base such as in december 2009 the difference was 10 22 mm month the corresponding percentage of difference was 20 note the percentage of monthly outflow difference is equal to the monthly outflow volume difference divided by the monthly outflow volume of scenario y based ii monthly outflow volume y fixed was greater than monthly outflow volume y base such as in february 2014 the difference was 8 4 mm month the corresponding percentage of difference was 5 8 and iii basically no differences between the two scenarios were observed 3 3 3 effects of interannual variation in vegetation on hydrological performance maximum vegetation coverage was mainly affected by water and temperature stresses owing to sufficient rainfall and appropriate temperatures during the growth stage of each year in the study area annual maximum vegetation coverage was basically the same however interannual differences in vegetation coverage occurred during the early growth and decay stages fig 8 a1 a2 for example because the monthly average temperature in january 2011 was 12 2 c and not suitable for vegetation growth the time for a new round of vegetation growth was delayed the average monthly temperature in january 2017 was 18 1 c the vegetation began a new round of growth soon after the end of the prior growth cycle figs 7 and 8 a1 the difference in monthly evapotranspiration was accompanied by a difference in vegetation coverage in the rainy and dry seasons fig 8 a2 b2 the difference in soil moisture is not only related to the difference in evapotranspiration but also to rainfall in the dry season rather than in the rainy season the difference in evapotranspiration affected the difference in soil moisture fig 8 b2 c2 the reason for this phenomenon is that in the dry season there is little rainfall and a long antecedent dry period and the loss of soil water is mainly caused by evapotranspiration therefore the difference in evapotranspiration can easily lead to differences in soil moisture the differences in the exfiltration and outflow volumes are both related to the antecedent dry period and rainfall amount when the rainfall amount is sufficiently large to generate exfiltration the longer the antecedent dry period the greater the difference in the exfiltration volume when the antecedent dry period was more than 9 d there was a significant difference in the exfiltration volume between the y base and y fixed scenarios fig 9 a the same conclusion applies to the difference in outflow volume fig 9 b for example in february 2011 the difference in soil moisture was large 1 4 but the rainfall was 36 2 mm which was sufficient to generate exfiltration but insufficient to generate outflow therefore there was only a significant difference in exfiltration 15 1 mm but no outflow occurred fig 8 c2 e2 interannual simulations may cause inaccurate simulations of hydrological performance if the influence of interannual changes in vegetation is not considered in the study area y base better simulated the interannual variations in vegetation and its effects on the hydrological performance of bioretention systems than y fixed did 3 4 limitations of the eco hydrological bioretention system model overall the model is able to simulate the effects of vegetation dynamics on the hydrological performance of layered bioretention systems however this model has limitations and requires further improvement this model is a water balance model which considers that moisture in the soil layer is uniformly distributed the model cannot simulate the change of soil moisture in a vertical profile if it is necessary to simulate the profile distribution of soil moisture in future researches the richard equation can be added to the model besides the model used a simplification of the epic crop growth module to simulate changes in canna indica l a perennial herb in a bioretention system under a southern subtropical monsoon climate generally epic simulates many other perennial vegetation types in temperate subtropical and tropical regions bernardos et al 2001 jia et al 2012 kamali et al 2018 therefore collecting additional growth data e g vegetation coverage of other commonly used vegetation types in bioretention systems is necessary to prove the adaptability of the model to different vegetation types and climatic zones 4 conclusions an eco hydrological bioretention system model was proposed by coupling vegetation growth and hydrological models the model was verified using 2 years of observed data on vegetation dynamics and hydrological performance of a bioretention system in shenzhen china the main results are summarized as follow the proposed model simulates vegetation coverage changes and the water balance in different layers of the bioretention system and considers the interaction between vegetation dynamics and moisture in the soil layer the nse values of vegetation coverage soil moisture water depth in the gravel layer and outflow rate were all above 0 6 thus the model performed well in the simulation of both the vegetation dynamics and hydrological processes of the bioretention system vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration volume were sensitive to most parameters of the vegetation module whether on a monthly or annual scale moreover the monthly volume of exfiltration into the surrounding soil and outflow were sensitive to fcmax phu and hupoint during months with long dry periods these parameters must be accurately estimated particularly when simulating monthly exfiltration and outflow with an increase or decrease in vegetation coverage evapotranspiration increases or decreases and soil moisture exfiltration and outflow may decrease or increase seasonal and interannual variations in vegetation mainly affect soil moisture and evapotranspiration these variations also affect exfiltration and outflow for rainfall events with long antecedent dry weather conditions this model can be used to evaluate the long term hydrological performance of bioretention systems considering the influence of vegetation dynamics further studies are required to demonstrate the adaptability of this model to bioretention systems with different vegetation types and climatic zones

1939,river confluences are key nodes of pollutant transport in fluvial ecosystems and they are accompanied by complex hydrodynamic and mixing processes the generalization and quantitative response of mixing to highly variable confluent conditions remain unclear this studyinvestigates the spatial distribution and mixing process of pollutants through a series of meticulous experiments in an asymmetric open channel confluence furthermore we propose quantitative responses and characterization equations for the mixing rate and mixing metric for various confluent conditions namely junction angle momentum flux ratio and width depth ratio the spatial distribution of pollutants have a strong three dimensional structure with a narrow long pollution belt near the tributary and an almost vertical mixing interface adjacent to the downstream junction corner this interface exhibits a logarithmic growth trend downstream and is affected by shear layer distortion the standard deviation of the cross sectional pollutant concentration at the confluence decreases gradually along with the downstream mixing of convergent flows and the fitting curve slope increases as the junction angle momentum ratio and width depth ratio increase the mixing rate is promoted by the enhancements of helical motion lateral advection and turbulent diffusion caused by the strengthening of mutual deflection and lateral momentum flux under a large junction angle and momentum ratio as well as the reductions of vertical velocity gradient and cross sectional area under large width depth ratio conditions sufficient and complete mixing occurs under a larger momentum ratio condition of 1 within a short distance of 4 5 widths of the main channel in addition the mixing metric shows a strong linear relationship with each of the three confluent conditions in summary the significant p 0 001 quantitative responses of the mixing rate and mixing metric can be characterized by a polynomial equation these results have major implications for the systematic understanding of the three dimensional distribution characteristics mixing patterns and mixing dynamics of pollutants at asymmetric confluences as well as for the prediction or calculation of the downstream mixing metric keywords river confluence pollutant distribution mixing dynamics quantitative response data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction river confluences or the convergence of two or more streams are important components in natural fluvial systems urban artificial channels and drainage systems as well as critical nodes for the transport of environmental pollutants the complex flow structures produced by river confluences have a considerable impact on bed morphology dissolved chemical and nutrient distribution and aquatic habitats attracting a considerable amount of scientific interest mosley 1976 best 1987 rhoads and johnson 2018 gualtieri et al 2020 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a yuan et al 2021 shi et al 2022 yuan et al 2022b sukhodolov et al 2023 tributaries carrying pollutants can penetrate the main channels at the confluence having considerable influence on pollutant distribution and the aquatic environment particularly when rivers serve as sources of potable water li and morioka 1999 parsons et al 2008 zhang et al 2020b furthermore tributaries carrying various species and amounts of substances flow through different land covers resulting in different physical and chemical properties of the two tributaries at the confluences the impacts of the strong physical and chemical gradients at river confluences persist downstream affecting biological communities and ecological processes at the river and channel network scales rice et al 2001 ramón et al 2014 the mixing process and rate at the confluence are necessary to quantify these effects therefore it is critical to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution and mixing dynamics of pollutants at confluences for accurate water quality assessments precise environmental management and ecological remediation in watersheds with the rapid development of monitoring instruments and computer technology in recent decades numerous studies have been conducted on confluence flow structure bed morphology and sediment transport via flume experiments mosley 1976 best and reid 1984 best 1987 leite ribeiro et al 2012a leite ribeiro et al 2012b guillén ludeña et al 2015 guillén ludeña et al 2016 guillén ludeña et al 2017 numerical simulations bradbrook et al 2000 biron et al 2004 constantinescu et al 2012 shi et al 2022 and in situ measurements ashmore et al 1992 biron et al 1993 de serres et al 1999 rhoads and sukhodolov 2008 riley and rhoads 2012 zhang et al 2020a yuan et al 2021 well recognized conceptual models of complex flow structures within an open channel confluence indicated strong three dimensional flow characteristics and included six zones of flow stagnation deflection separation acceleration recovery and shear layers best 1987 in addition helical motion is an important factor governing sediment transport and bed erosion at confluences nevertheless the helical motion is more likely to be destroyed due to the bed frictional effects at the large confluence with wide shallow channel biron et al 1993 parsons et al 2007 zhang et al 2020a and the flow separation is less likely when the downstream junction corner is smooth roy et al 1988 roy and bergeron 1990 ashmore et al 1992 zhang et al 2020a for example a recent study by the authors derived a conceptual model of flow structure and bed morphology from a field investigation at a large asymmetric confluence with wide shallow channel and smooth junction corner yellow river china confirming the non inevitability of helical motion and flow separation zhang et al 2020a the primary topography of the confluence is characterized by i a scour hole immediately downstream of the junction the orientation of which roughly bisects the confluence angle ii two distinct avalanche faces at the mouth of each channel that dip into the scour hole and iii bars formation within the flow stagnation and separation zones as well as the center of the downstream channel best 1988 best and rhoads 2008 leite ribeiro et al 2012b guillén ludeña et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020a in general confluent conditions such as platform symmetry junction angle momentum flux ratio and bed concordance influence flow structure bed morphology sediment transport and even material mixing best and reid 1984 guillén ludeña et al 2016 rhoads and johnson 2018 however for the complex hydrodynamic conditions that are noteworthy under increasingly serious environmental pollution the distribution and mixing patterns of environmental pollutants particularly the generalization of mixing at the confluence remain unclear lewis et al 2020 sukhodolov et al 2023 in general non point source pollutants carried by surface runoff enter the tributaries through the riparian zones while urban or industrial point source pollutants are discharged into the tributaries through municipal pipes then the tributaries connect to the main channels at the confluences causing pollutants to be transported throughout the river network subsequently a distinct contrast interface between the confluent inflows at the confluence with a narrow pollution belt near the tributary can be retained for tens to hundreds of channels downstream of the confluence under weak mixing rathbun and rostad 2004 lane et al 2008 laraque et al 2009 bouchez et al 2010 umar et al 2018 lewis et al 2020 or dissipate over a very short distance within the immediate vicinity of the confluence under intense mixing processes gaudet and roy 1995 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 rhoads and sukhodolov 2001 biron et al 2004 lewis and rhoads 2015 slow mixing processes are common at large confluences with wide and shallow river channels although sufficient mixing may occur in small or discordant confluences the principal mechanisms driving pollutant mixing at the confluence are molecular diffusion spread from regions of high concentration to low concentration of a tracer turbulent diffusion induced by the shear layer with kelvin helmholtz vortices or vortex street and lateral advection related to secondary currents helical motion or primary flow cross currents lewis et al 2020 yuan et al 2022a an additional mechanism buoyancy can be essential in mixing if it involves the interaction of fluids of various densities rutherford 1994 de serres et al 1999 gualtieri et al 2019 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b yuan et al 2022a however sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2019 considered lateral transport by vertically oriented turbulent eddies as the primary lateral mixing mechanism within the mixing interface these processes are controlled by the complex flow structure generated by changes in the confluent conditions including plane symmetry junction angle momentum or flow ratio width depth ratio bed concordance and density difference therefore a systematic investigation of the spatial distribution transport and mixing process of pollutants under the condition of variable intersections is required moreover quantitative research results such as equations are particularly important for future practical applications nevertheless the quantitative responses of the mixing rate and mixing degree of the dissolved pollutants to the incoming flows and confluent conditions at the confluence have yet to be proposed previous studies have demonstrated that an increase in the junction angle momentum flux ratio and froude number results in a larger separation zone a shift of the stagnation zone to the main stream and stronger helical motion shakibainia et al 2010 rhoads and johnson 2018 zhang et al 2020a furthermore the momentum ratio is the key factor controlling mixing in a natural confluence with a relatively fixed junction angle with a strong positive linear relationship between the mixing rate and momentum ratio lewis and rhoads 2015 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b in contrast the concentration ratio of confluent flows might only affect molecular diffusion exhibiting a weak relationship with the mixing rate and playing an auxiliary role in the mixing process zhang et al 2020b therefore a comprehensive quantitative response relationship of environmental pollutant mixing at a confluence should be constructed to more easily predict mixing length and water quality the present study aims to shed light on the quantitative responses of pollutant spatial distribution and mixing dynamics to various confluent conditions in asymmetric open channel confluences particle image velocimetry piv and planar laser induced fluorescence plif systems were used to meticulously assess the three dimensional flow structure and pollutant concentration cloud of the confluences under a series of junction angles momentum ratios and width to depth ratios this study mainly evaluated how these confluent conditions control the pollutant mixing in a laboratory confluence and established regression equations for the mixing rate and metric to these factors these results are of great significance for gaining a systematic understanding of the distribution and mixing dynamics of dissolved substances as well as the prediction of the mixing rate or length downstream in asymmetric confluences 2 methodology 2 1 experiment set up instrumentation and procedure laboratory experiments were performed in an asymmetric open channel confluence flume with adjustable junction angle α discharge q and water depth h the experimental system is depicted in fig 1 a and consists of a plexiglass flume a water supply and drainage system pipes electromagnetic flowmeters pump valves and tanks a flow control system a tailgate and measurement instruments all channels had rectangular cross sections the widths of the main channel b and tributary flume b t were 0 3 m and 0 1 m respectively and their heights were all 0 3 m fig 1 a the coordinate system origin was at the bottom of the upstream junction vertex with the x axis running along the channel width direction the y axis running along the flow direction and the z axis running vertically upward under the intelligent command of the flow control system the water supply and drainage system could regulate the discharge and momentum of the flow to achieve a predefined momentum ratio to achieve a predefined width to depth ratio b h under the designed operating conditions the tailgate at the end of the flume was used to set the water depth at the upstream entrance y 400 of the main channel 1 flow velocity field measurement a particle image velocimetry piv system was used to capture images in the longitudinal and horizontal planes to calculate the three dimensional flow velocity components at the confluence compared with traditional velocity measurement technology piv offers the advantages of transient measurement of the entire flow field no disturbance and high precision and it has been widely used in the fields of fluid mechanics and aerodynamics nezu and sanjou 2011 chen et al 2018 yuan et al 2022b the piv system flowmaster manufactured by la vision consists of a ldy300 laser with a wavelength of 527 nm laser light sheet formation optics a charge coupled device ccd camera with a resolution of 1 024 1 024 pixels a laser synchronization controller and a computer with insight3g software the camera was 80 cm away from the photographing surface and the lens was perpendicular to the surface capturing a 200 200 mm image a predetermined quantity of polystyrene hollow glass spheres were seeded into the water tank as tracer particles before the test the spheres had a particle size of 10 μm and a density ranging from 1 04 103 kg m3 to 1 06 103 kg m3 the piv procedure included seeding the flow illuminating the measurement plane using a laser capturing successive images of the illuminated plane and image post processing to avoid image distortion caused by multiple media factors calibration was performed using a square ruler with convex points placed under water in the flume at fixed intervals the ruler was aligned with a light laser sheet on the photographing surface the acquisition software identified the size of the calibration ruler and converted the pixels to a physical distance which generated the scale factor yuan et al 2022b after withdrawing the calibration ruler from the water piv continuously captured images of the preset photographing plane for 5 min and transferred the data to the computer at a frame rate of 100 hz signifying 100 instantaneous double frame vector fields per second these data were stored and used as input for postprocessing preliminary convergence tests indicated that the time averaged velocity converged well over the recorded 5 minute duration the instantaneous velocity field of the piv image was calculated using an adaptive method based on cross correlation the resolution grid size in the final iterative step was 64 64 pixels and the relevant particles were calculated over a larger grid area with a 25 overlap velocity vectors were low pass filtered with a 3 3 gaussian filter to reduce measurement noise zhong et al 2015 yuan et al 2022b the ensemble average velocity field was obtained by averaging validated instantaneous velocities 2 pollutant concentration cloud measurement the planar laser induced fluorescence plif in the piv system was used to measure the pollutant concentration the technical principle of plif is based on the certain correlation between the concentration of fluorescent substance and its luminescence intensity the ccd camera was used to capture the gray level of fluorescent substances in water and then the substance concentration was calculated according to the certain correlation calibration curve the calibration curve c 28 726 95 1 g 1 286 fig 1 d was established by matching the gray levels to the actual concentrations of the fluorescent tracer rhodamine 6g c28h30n2o3 in 24 tests in stationary water tank before the experiment starting at the beginning of the experiment a certain amount of rhodamine 6g was added to the tributary tank to reach the design concentration the measurement processes were same to those of flow field measurement which required calibration image capture 5 min time averaged grey level postprocessing and pollutant concentration calculating with the calibration curve 3 experimental setup two camera positions were used in this experiment the first was to capture the flow velocity field fvf and pollutant concentration in the y z plane by photographing the longitudinal section of the flow the camera was located on the side of the flume fig 1 a five measurement sections were set at x 50 100 150 200 and 250 mm along the width of the channel fig 1 b the second was to capture the fvf and pollutant concentration in the x y plane by photographing the horizontal section of the flow the camera was mounted directly above the flume fig 1 a four measurement planes were set at z 50 70 100 and 150 mm along the depth of the channel fig 1 c a total of 24 experiments a1 a8 b1 b8 and c1 c8 table 1 were performed to explore the pollutant distribution and mixing dynamics under various junction angle α momentum flux ratio mr and width to depth ratio b h conditions 2 2 mixing rate and metric to represent the pollutant mixing processes and rate at the confluence the standard deviation σ was calculated to evaluate the variance of the pollutant concentration in each monitoring section biron et al 2004 ramón et al 2014 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b the σ of a given section gradually decreased along the downstream flow the slope of σ vs the longitudinal distance can reflect the mixing rate r m degradation and transformation of the tracer were not considered during the tests standard deviation was calculated using the following equation 1 σ c i c 2 n 1 where ci represents the pollutant concentration in each grid of a given section c is the average concentration of pollutants in all grids of the given section and n is the number of samples deviation from complete mixing δ a heterogeneity index was used to measure the mixing process of pollutants downstream for the concentration in each section gaudet and roy 1995 ramón et al 2014 zhang et al 2020b the greater the δ the more uneven the mixing the δ of pollutant concentration was defined as follows 2 δ i c i c p c p 100 where c p is the predicted concentration after complete mixing in the downstream channel gaudet and roy 1995 the c p is defined as follows 3 c p c t q t c m q m q t q m where c denotes the pollutant concentration q denotes the discharge and subscripts t and m refer to the tributary and main channel respectively to quantify the mixing level under different confluence conditions a normalized mixing metric δ σ xn based on σ was calculated for a synthetic upstream section and for the final downstream section lewis and rhoads 2015 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b the synthetic upstream section consisted of concentration data from the two incoming channels and was interpreted as a cross section of the exact location where the two streams intersected the concentration of pollutants at the inlets of the two confluent channels was used to calculate the standard deviation σ us without mixing the normalized mixing metric δ σ xn is defined as follows 4 δ σ xn 1 σ fs σ us where the subscript xn represents each given experiment σ fs denotes the standard deviation of the concentration in the final cross section y b 4 13 and σ us denotes the standard deviation of the concentration in the upstream section thus completely mixed conditions correspond to δ σ xn 1 σ fs 0 while no mixing correspond to δ σ xn 0 σ fs σ us lewis and rhoads 2015 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b the normalized mixing metric allows for comparison of tests with different inflow conditions and pollutant concentrations multiple linear regression mlr was performed to investigate the quantitative response of r m and δ σ xn to confluent conditions using the statistical package for social sciences spss version 17 0 the dependent variable was set as r m or δ σ x n whereas the independent variables were the junction angle α momentum flux ratio mr and width to depth ratio b h the multiple linear regression equation is defined as follows 5 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n ε where y is the objective function such as r m or δ σ xn x1 x 2 x n represent n independent variables in the system β 0 denotes the constant regression model parameters and β 1 β 2 β n are regression coefficients respectively and ε is the random error 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow field structure understanding the hydrodynamic characteristics of confluences can aid in determining the spatial distribution mechanism of pollutants the three dimensional 3 d flow field structure of the asymmetric open channel confluence aocc was illuminated by an example of the conditions of α 45 mr 0 32 b h 1 88 experiment b3 table 1 the confluence hydrodynamic zone chz of aocc was consistent with the conceptual model proposed in previous studies best 1987 with an obvious flow stagnation zone deflection zone separation zone maximum flow velocity zone flow recovery zone fig 2 a and shear layer fig 2 b comparing all the experimental results the increases in α mr and b h all strengthen the inflow of the tributary into the main channel resulting in more obvious zones and amplifying shear layer distortion and mixing actions however in this study the changes in b h are mainly caused by the water depth changes the evolution of water flow structure caused by the changes in channel width still needs to further study due to space constraints the authors will elaborate on the response of the flow structure to confluent conditions in open channel confluences in a future article 3 2 spatial distribution and mixing pattern of pollutants two major features of the spatial distribution and mixing pattern of pollutants were observed at the asymmetric open channel confluence first a tributary with high concentrations of pollutants penetrated the main stream forming a narrow pollution belt at the post confluence zone near the side of the tributary severely affecting the water quality in the main channel fig 3 the pollutants in the channel formed a transverse gradient with a high concentration on one side of the tributary and a low concentration on the other the two streams converged and mixed along the downstream flow where the high concentration pollution belt gradually decreased migrated and diffused to the opposite side this feature is consistent with the conclusions of a recent study on mixing at the large confluence b h 78 155 of the yellow and fen rivers in china where the fen river with a high concentration of pollutant enters the yellow river forming a narrow pollution belt and an obvious mixing interface at the confluence and the distribution pattern is almost independent of the pollutant type zhang et al 2020b second the mixing of pollutants downstream of the open channel confluence was a three dimensional process a distinct almost vertical interface from the surface to the bed of the channel was found adjacent to the downstream junction corner gradually distorting with the downstream flow corresponding to shear layer distortion in the flow structure fig 3 a fig 2 b pollutant concentrations were greater in the upper flow than near the bed which may be attributed to the high lateral velocity and momentum of the upper flow resulting in the rapid advection of pollutants near the surface flow the changes in the junction angle α momentum flux ratio mr and width depth ratio b h significantly influenced the spatial distribution and mixing pattern of the pollutants at the confluence with the increase in α the mixing interface shifted slightly towards the opposite side of the tributary intensifying the mixing of the two flows and widening the downstream pollution belt fig 3 a and b for example in the section of y b 4 13 the α increased from 45 to 90 the maximum concentration in the core of the pollution belt decreased from 1 700 to 1 400 µg l fig 3 a and b compared to α the change in mr had a greater impact on the pollutant concentration field as mr increased the tributary gained momentum penetrating wider lateral distance and producing increasingly intense lateral advection turbulent vortices and substance mixing leading to considerable widening of the downstream pollution belt fig 3 c and d additionally a larger mr may further intensify the helical motion at confluence enhancing mixing gaudet and roy 1995 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 lane et al 2008 ramón et al 2014 under the condition of mr 2 87 in experiment b8 table 1 the pollutants at post confluence were completely mixed at the cross section y b 3 53 fig 3 d which was the fastest mixing group among all the test groups this result was in accordance with the findings of a previous study on a confluence with an extremely fast mixing process under specific conditions mr 1 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b similar to α and mr the larger the b h the faster the advection and mixing of flows under constant inlet discharges an increase in b h and a shallow water depth could induce an increase in flow velocity as well as a reduction in the cross sectional area and vertical pressure gradient in the channel allowing for transverse penetration of the tributary and mutual flow deflection when b h increased from 2 5 to 3 75 the tributary rapidly diffused to the main channel resulting in a wider pollution belt occupying approximately 2 3 of the downstream channel width fig 3 e and f this also suggests that wide shallow confluences may have a faster mixing rate than narrow deep confluences this result also supports the conclusion that the cross sectional area is negatively correlated with mixing rate lewis and rhoads 2015 lewis et al 2020 however due to the limitations of the plexiglass experiment flume with a fixed width this study did not explore the increased effects of bed frictional elements caused by shallow water depth and the simultaneous changes in cross sectional area caused by changes in b h to what extent does the changes in water depth at the natural confluence comply with the above rules and which of the width depth ratio and cross sectional area is the dominant factor in mixing rate changes may require further research 3 3 mixing process of pollutants the mixing interface is a crucial hydrodynamic characteristic associated with the mixing of lateral pollutants at confluences to better understand the mixing process of the convergent flows points with concentration values equal to the predicted average concentration c p equation 3 of each section were linked to reveal the changing process of the trajectory curves of the mixing interface fig 4 a b and c the trajectory curves exhibited a logarithmic growth trend within the region of y b 1 x b increased considerably causing rapid growth of the trajectory curves to the opposite bank of the tributary fig 4 a b and c this region had the strongest flow deflection of the main stream and the tributaries carrying pollutants penetrated the confluence where the primary driving forces of pollutant mixing were lateral advection and turbulent diffusion fig 2 in the region of y b 1 the increment of x b gradually decreased and the trajectory curves were nearly parallel except for the condition of mr 2 87 fig 4 a b and c where the primary driver of pollutant mixing was turbulent diffusion or helical motion de serres et al 1999 bradbrook et al 2001 zhang et al 2020b yuan et al 2022a the trajectory curves did not begin at point 0 0 but were offset downstream based on the geometric vertex of the flume fig 4 a b and c which may be attributed to the flow stagnation near the upstream junction corner and the jacking effect of the two streams fig 2 a the increase in α fig 4 a mr fig 4 b and b h fig 4 c enhanced mixing and resulted in steeper trajectory curves that deviated further in experiment b8 mr 2 87 at section y b 4 13 the trajectory curve developed to the opposite side of the tributary x b 1 0 demonstrating that the pollutants were thoroughly mixed and uniformly distributed fig 4 c furthermore the deviation from complete mixing δ calculated by equation 2 was used to characterize the mixing process of the two converged streams where δ max reflects the maximum δ in the high concentration pollution belt near the tributary and δ min reflects the minimum values away from the tributary side fig 4 d e f gaudet and roy 1995 defined complete mixing as δ 10 that is the region bordered by two horizontal dashed lines in the figures the δ max and δ min of the initial section were as high as 270 and as low as 98 respectively indicating that the pollutant concentration in the mouth of the tributary was 2 7 times higher than the average concentration while the concentration on the opposite side of the tributary was well below complete mixing fig 4 d under a given operating condition when y b increased δ max gradually decreased whereas δ min remained essentially unchanged indicating that mixing in the confluence was mostly a diffusion and advection process from the tributary pollution belt to the main stream fig 4 d e f similarly increases in α fig 4 d mr fig 4 e and b h fig 4 f resulted in a larger decline in δ along the downstream flow demonstrating enhanced mixing from another direction for example compared with mr 0 17 under the conditions of mr 2 87 δ max 79 16 at section y b 0 37 which decreased by 189 79 the rate of decrease of δ in the center of the confluence was greater than that at the post confluence area demonstrating that flow turbulence near the junction was intense and material mixing was more intense than that far from the junction as established in field tests at large confluences zhang et al 2020b turbulence at the interface is induced by lateral shear caused by velocity differences between confluent flows babarutsi and chu 1998 sukhodolov and rhoads 2001 guillén ludeña et al 2017 and by shedding of vortices from interacting shear layers that bind the stagnation zone lewis and rhoads 2018 3 4 response of mixing rates to confluent conditions with the advection convergence and turbulent diffusion of the flows downstream the pollutants were gradually mixed and the lateral differences in concentration decreased resulting in a drop in the standard deviation σ of the pollutant concentration in the corresponding cross section fig 5 a b and c the mixing rate r m of the substances at the confluence was represented by the variation in σ vs longitudinal distance biron et al 2004 ramón et al 2014 zhang et al 2020b the two convergent flows carrying pollutants began to mix at the initial cross section of the tributary mouth where σ σ us was high 0 405 which was attributed to the tributary with high pollutant concentrations as the water flowed downstream the values of σ σ us exhibited a relatively linear decline fig 5 a the larger the α the faster the σ σ us value decreased when α 30 45 60 and 90 the slopes of the fitting line were 0 022 0 024 0 031 and 0 034 respectively fig 5 a table 2 this confirmed that r m increased accompanied by enhanced mixing with the increase in α through a length of approximately 4 13 channel widths a small σ σ us presented in the final section when α 90 r m was the fastest with σ σ us decreasing by 33 01 from 0 40 to 0 27 whereas the decreased amplitudes at 30 45 and 60 were only 22 04 24 92 and 29 19 respectively fig 5 a recent field studies on mixing at confluences support this finding suggesting that the development of curvature driven large scale helical motion is especially prominent at high angle asymmetrical confluences and enhances mixing constantinescu et al 2016 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2019 lewis et al 2020 similarly when mr and b h increased the mixing was strengthened increasing the slope of σ σ us that is r m increased table 2 fig 5 b and c this phenomenon can be attributed to the strength and persistence of the dual counter rotating helical motion generated by mutual deflection flows at the entrance to the downstream channel rhoads 1996 constantinescu et al 2012 constantinescu et al 2014 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2019 lewis et al 2020 as well as the dominant penetration of tributaries with higher momentum flux to a relatively distant area at the center of the confluence riley and rhoads 2012 zhang et al 2020a the authors previous field study zhang et al 2020b on the confluence also supported this conclusion indicating that an increase in the discharge ratio between the tributary and the main channel can enhance mixing and have a substantial influence on the mixing level additionally the tributary transporting pollutants was pushed to a farther lateral distance in the channel with shallower water depth higher flow velocity and smaller vertical pressure gradient under the experimental conditions of greater b h enhancing mixing the quantitative response of r m to α mr and b h was studied using multiple linear regression mlr method in the statistical package for social sciences spss version 17 0 and four equations were obtained to express r m table 3 to better reduce the influence of dimension on response the junction angle α was divided by 180 for non dimensionalization i e α α 180 the equations were compared and optimized using the coefficient of determination r2 level of significance p and comparison between the predicted and observed values table 3 fig 5 d the four equations have p values less than 0 001 p 0 000 however equations a and b were eliminated due to their relatively low r2 values 0 974 and 0 992 respectively table 3 meanwhile several scatter points of predicted and observed values were distributed beyond the error interval of 10 as indicated by the red ellipse fig 5 d conversely the r2 values of equations c and d were relatively high up to 0 999 table 3 their predicted values were highly consistent with the observed values of r m and the scatter points were all distributed within a 10 error range fig 5 d in contrast the simpler equation c was recommended since it could accurately reflect the quantitative response of the mixing rate r m to the confluent conditions consisting of the junction angle α momentum ratio mr and width depth ratio b h r m 0 036 exp α 0 022 ln m r 0 027 ln b h this mixing rate function illustrates that r m had an exponential relationship with α and a natural logarithmic relationship with mr and b h 3 5 response of mixing metric to confluent conditions to reveal the possible relationships between the spatial variation in pollutant mixing and the confluent conditions within the chz the mixing metrics δσ xn table 2 of the final section y b 4 13 under each experimental condition were calculated using equation 4 and the change in δσ xn was plotted versus α fig 6 a mr fig 6 b and b h fig 6 c strong linear relationships were observed between δσ xn and α mr and b h within the scope of the data with correlation coefficients of 0 97 0 97 and 0 98 respectively fig 6 a b and c within a short distance of 4 13 channel widths i e at the final section δσ xn ranged from 0 67 to 0 73 as α increased from 0 08 to 0 50 table 2 and the linear fitting relationship was δσ xn 0 23α 0 63 r2 0 93 fig 6 a similarly δσ xn increased from 0 64 to 0 84 when b h increased from 1 20 to 3 75 exhibiting a linear relationship of δσ xn 0 089b h 0 51 r2 0 95 fig 6 c in comparison with α and b h mr had a substantial impact on the mixing degree with δσ xn increasing from 0 69 to 0 97 as mr increased from 0 17 to 2 87 accordingly the linear relationship between δσ xn and mr was δσ xn 0 097mr 0 70 r2 0 92 fig 6 b this observation was consistent with the tendency of the mixing metric at the downstream end of the confluence to increase with the momentum flux ratio at a small natural river confluence lewis and rhoads 2015 which exhibited approximately linear relationships fig 6 b it was also consistent with the conclusion that the discharge ratio was the key factor in determining the mixing level at a large confluence with a discordant bed zhang et al 2020b special attention should be paid to the fact that when mr 1 00 the two flows had the same momentum but did not completely mix after the length of 4 13 channel widths with a δσ xn value of 0 80 however when mr increased to 2 87 the two convergent streams were essentially completely mixed with δσ xn 0 97 these results were ascribed to the fact that α mr and b h undoubtedly affected the flow structure at the chz thus controlling the development of mixing to illuminate the quantitative response of pollutant mixing and confluent conditions mlr was performed to obtain four equations for δσ xn table 4 similarly to r m the r2 p value and predicted values vs observed values were used for the comparative analysis of each equation table 4 fig 6 d despite its relative simplicity equation e was not recommended due to the low r2 value 0 987 and the predicted vs observed values of δσ xn did not fit well with the standard line such as the numerous points encircled by red ellipses distributed outside the error interval of 10 fig 6 d among the four equations equation f g and h can accurately reflect the quantitative response relationship between the mixing metric and α mr and b h which all had markedly high values of r2 and high matching degree for predicted and observed δσ xn with the exception of one point of equation f falling outside of the error range of 10 fig 6 d in contrast equation f was proposed to characterize the mixing metric function due to its relatively simple construction and ease of application that is δ σ xn 0 432 α m r 0 084 b h 2 0 523 b h this function indicated that the mixing degree had a linear relationship with the product of α and mr as well as a quadratic relationship with b h 4 conclusion this study proposed the quantitative responses of the mixing rate and mixing metric to the variant confluent conditions of junction angle momentum flux ratio and width depth ratio in asymmetric open channel confluences furthermore the spatial distribution mixing pattern and mixing process of pollutants were investigated under various confluent conditions the key findings of the experiments are summarized as follows i the spatial distribution of pollutants in the open channel confluence had a strong three dimensional structure a narrow long pollution belt near the tributary and a vertical mixing interface adjacent to the downstream junction corner which shifted to the opposite side of the tributary and was distorted due to the shear layer distortion of the flow structure the interface trajectory curves showed a logarithmic growth trend with a position gradually advancing to the opposite bank with the downstream flow there was a decreasing trend in the downstream direction for deviation from complete mixing ii the standard deviation of the pollutant concentration at the confluence decreased gradually along the flow and the slope of the fitting curve could essentially represent the mixing rate the slope increased as the junction angle momentum ratio and width depth ratio increased enhancing mixing particularly when the momentum ratio was 1 and complete mixing was achieved within the length of 4 5 widths of the main channel iii the mixing metric δσ xn can efficiently quantify the mixing level of each experiment allowing for the comparison of results between tests with different inflow conditions the mixing metric had a markedly linear correlation with junction angle momentum ratio and width depth ratio iv the junction angle momentum ratio and width depth ratio all have a substantial impact on the flow structure and pollutant mixing in the open channel confluence with the concordant bed the increase in the three confluent conditions increased the penetration of the tributary the visibility of the confluence hydrodynamic zones the shear layer distortion and pollutant mixing resulting in shifts of the mixing interface trajectory toward the opposite side of the tributary rapid reduction of deviation from complete mixing and a larger mixing rate and metric v a prominent quantitative relationship exists between the mixing rate mixing metric junction angle momentum ratio and width depth ratio the functional equations for which can be expressed as mixing rate rm 0 036 exp α 0 022 ln mr 0 027 ln b h and mixing metric δσ xn 0 432 α mr 0 084 b h 2 0 523 b h these findings have major implications for a systematic understanding of material transport and mixing dynamics as well as the assessment of downstream water quality at confluences however further high precision research is required to elucidate how helical motion produces mixing under various confluent conditions at confluences credit authorship contribution

1939,river confluences are key nodes of pollutant transport in fluvial ecosystems and they are accompanied by complex hydrodynamic and mixing processes the generalization and quantitative response of mixing to highly variable confluent conditions remain unclear this studyinvestigates the spatial distribution and mixing process of pollutants through a series of meticulous experiments in an asymmetric open channel confluence furthermore we propose quantitative responses and characterization equations for the mixing rate and mixing metric for various confluent conditions namely junction angle momentum flux ratio and width depth ratio the spatial distribution of pollutants have a strong three dimensional structure with a narrow long pollution belt near the tributary and an almost vertical mixing interface adjacent to the downstream junction corner this interface exhibits a logarithmic growth trend downstream and is affected by shear layer distortion the standard deviation of the cross sectional pollutant concentration at the confluence decreases gradually along with the downstream mixing of convergent flows and the fitting curve slope increases as the junction angle momentum ratio and width depth ratio increase the mixing rate is promoted by the enhancements of helical motion lateral advection and turbulent diffusion caused by the strengthening of mutual deflection and lateral momentum flux under a large junction angle and momentum ratio as well as the reductions of vertical velocity gradient and cross sectional area under large width depth ratio conditions sufficient and complete mixing occurs under a larger momentum ratio condition of 1 within a short distance of 4 5 widths of the main channel in addition the mixing metric shows a strong linear relationship with each of the three confluent conditions in summary the significant p 0 001 quantitative responses of the mixing rate and mixing metric can be characterized by a polynomial equation these results have major implications for the systematic understanding of the three dimensional distribution characteristics mixing patterns and mixing dynamics of pollutants at asymmetric confluences as well as for the prediction or calculation of the downstream mixing metric keywords river confluence pollutant distribution mixing dynamics quantitative response data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction river confluences or the convergence of two or more streams are important components in natural fluvial systems urban artificial channels and drainage systems as well as critical nodes for the transport of environmental pollutants the complex flow structures produced by river confluences have a considerable impact on bed morphology dissolved chemical and nutrient distribution and aquatic habitats attracting a considerable amount of scientific interest mosley 1976 best 1987 rhoads and johnson 2018 gualtieri et al 2020 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a yuan et al 2021 shi et al 2022 yuan et al 2022b sukhodolov et al 2023 tributaries carrying pollutants can penetrate the main channels at the confluence having considerable influence on pollutant distribution and the aquatic environment particularly when rivers serve as sources of potable water li and morioka 1999 parsons et al 2008 zhang et al 2020b furthermore tributaries carrying various species and amounts of substances flow through different land covers resulting in different physical and chemical properties of the two tributaries at the confluences the impacts of the strong physical and chemical gradients at river confluences persist downstream affecting biological communities and ecological processes at the river and channel network scales rice et al 2001 ramón et al 2014 the mixing process and rate at the confluence are necessary to quantify these effects therefore it is critical to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution and mixing dynamics of pollutants at confluences for accurate water quality assessments precise environmental management and ecological remediation in watersheds with the rapid development of monitoring instruments and computer technology in recent decades numerous studies have been conducted on confluence flow structure bed morphology and sediment transport via flume experiments mosley 1976 best and reid 1984 best 1987 leite ribeiro et al 2012a leite ribeiro et al 2012b guillén ludeña et al 2015 guillén ludeña et al 2016 guillén ludeña et al 2017 numerical simulations bradbrook et al 2000 biron et al 2004 constantinescu et al 2012 shi et al 2022 and in situ measurements ashmore et al 1992 biron et al 1993 de serres et al 1999 rhoads and sukhodolov 2008 riley and rhoads 2012 zhang et al 2020a yuan et al 2021 well recognized conceptual models of complex flow structures within an open channel confluence indicated strong three dimensional flow characteristics and included six zones of flow stagnation deflection separation acceleration recovery and shear layers best 1987 in addition helical motion is an important factor governing sediment transport and bed erosion at confluences nevertheless the helical motion is more likely to be destroyed due to the bed frictional effects at the large confluence with wide shallow channel biron et al 1993 parsons et al 2007 zhang et al 2020a and the flow separation is less likely when the downstream junction corner is smooth roy et al 1988 roy and bergeron 1990 ashmore et al 1992 zhang et al 2020a for example a recent study by the authors derived a conceptual model of flow structure and bed morphology from a field investigation at a large asymmetric confluence with wide shallow channel and smooth junction corner yellow river china confirming the non inevitability of helical motion and flow separation zhang et al 2020a the primary topography of the confluence is characterized by i a scour hole immediately downstream of the junction the orientation of which roughly bisects the confluence angle ii two distinct avalanche faces at the mouth of each channel that dip into the scour hole and iii bars formation within the flow stagnation and separation zones as well as the center of the downstream channel best 1988 best and rhoads 2008 leite ribeiro et al 2012b guillén ludeña et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020a in general confluent conditions such as platform symmetry junction angle momentum flux ratio and bed concordance influence flow structure bed morphology sediment transport and even material mixing best and reid 1984 guillén ludeña et al 2016 rhoads and johnson 2018 however for the complex hydrodynamic conditions that are noteworthy under increasingly serious environmental pollution the distribution and mixing patterns of environmental pollutants particularly the generalization of mixing at the confluence remain unclear lewis et al 2020 sukhodolov et al 2023 in general non point source pollutants carried by surface runoff enter the tributaries through the riparian zones while urban or industrial point source pollutants are discharged into the tributaries through municipal pipes then the tributaries connect to the main channels at the confluences causing pollutants to be transported throughout the river network subsequently a distinct contrast interface between the confluent inflows at the confluence with a narrow pollution belt near the tributary can be retained for tens to hundreds of channels downstream of the confluence under weak mixing rathbun and rostad 2004 lane et al 2008 laraque et al 2009 bouchez et al 2010 umar et al 2018 lewis et al 2020 or dissipate over a very short distance within the immediate vicinity of the confluence under intense mixing processes gaudet and roy 1995 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 rhoads and sukhodolov 2001 biron et al 2004 lewis and rhoads 2015 slow mixing processes are common at large confluences with wide and shallow river channels although sufficient mixing may occur in small or discordant confluences the principal mechanisms driving pollutant mixing at the confluence are molecular diffusion spread from regions of high concentration to low concentration of a tracer turbulent diffusion induced by the shear layer with kelvin helmholtz vortices or vortex street and lateral advection related to secondary currents helical motion or primary flow cross currents lewis et al 2020 yuan et al 2022a an additional mechanism buoyancy can be essential in mixing if it involves the interaction of fluids of various densities rutherford 1994 de serres et al 1999 gualtieri et al 2019 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b yuan et al 2022a however sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2019 considered lateral transport by vertically oriented turbulent eddies as the primary lateral mixing mechanism within the mixing interface these processes are controlled by the complex flow structure generated by changes in the confluent conditions including plane symmetry junction angle momentum or flow ratio width depth ratio bed concordance and density difference therefore a systematic investigation of the spatial distribution transport and mixing process of pollutants under the condition of variable intersections is required moreover quantitative research results such as equations are particularly important for future practical applications nevertheless the quantitative responses of the mixing rate and mixing degree of the dissolved pollutants to the incoming flows and confluent conditions at the confluence have yet to be proposed previous studies have demonstrated that an increase in the junction angle momentum flux ratio and froude number results in a larger separation zone a shift of the stagnation zone to the main stream and stronger helical motion shakibainia et al 2010 rhoads and johnson 2018 zhang et al 2020a furthermore the momentum ratio is the key factor controlling mixing in a natural confluence with a relatively fixed junction angle with a strong positive linear relationship between the mixing rate and momentum ratio lewis and rhoads 2015 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b in contrast the concentration ratio of confluent flows might only affect molecular diffusion exhibiting a weak relationship with the mixing rate and playing an auxiliary role in the mixing process zhang et al 2020b therefore a comprehensive quantitative response relationship of environmental pollutant mixing at a confluence should be constructed to more easily predict mixing length and water quality the present study aims to shed light on the quantitative responses of pollutant spatial distribution and mixing dynamics to various confluent conditions in asymmetric open channel confluences particle image velocimetry piv and planar laser induced fluorescence plif systems were used to meticulously assess the three dimensional flow structure and pollutant concentration cloud of the confluences under a series of junction angles momentum ratios and width to depth ratios this study mainly evaluated how these confluent conditions control the pollutant mixing in a laboratory confluence and established regression equations for the mixing rate and metric to these factors these results are of great significance for gaining a systematic understanding of the distribution and mixing dynamics of dissolved substances as well as the prediction of the mixing rate or length downstream in asymmetric confluences 2 methodology 2 1 experiment set up instrumentation and procedure laboratory experiments were performed in an asymmetric open channel confluence flume with adjustable junction angle α discharge q and water depth h the experimental system is depicted in fig 1 a and consists of a plexiglass flume a water supply and drainage system pipes electromagnetic flowmeters pump valves and tanks a flow control system a tailgate and measurement instruments all channels had rectangular cross sections the widths of the main channel b and tributary flume b t were 0 3 m and 0 1 m respectively and their heights were all 0 3 m fig 1 a the coordinate system origin was at the bottom of the upstream junction vertex with the x axis running along the channel width direction the y axis running along the flow direction and the z axis running vertically upward under the intelligent command of the flow control system the water supply and drainage system could regulate the discharge and momentum of the flow to achieve a predefined momentum ratio to achieve a predefined width to depth ratio b h under the designed operating conditions the tailgate at the end of the flume was used to set the water depth at the upstream entrance y 400 of the main channel 1 flow velocity field measurement a particle image velocimetry piv system was used to capture images in the longitudinal and horizontal planes to calculate the three dimensional flow velocity components at the confluence compared with traditional velocity measurement technology piv offers the advantages of transient measurement of the entire flow field no disturbance and high precision and it has been widely used in the fields of fluid mechanics and aerodynamics nezu and sanjou 2011 chen et al 2018 yuan et al 2022b the piv system flowmaster manufactured by la vision consists of a ldy300 laser with a wavelength of 527 nm laser light sheet formation optics a charge coupled device ccd camera with a resolution of 1 024 1 024 pixels a laser synchronization controller and a computer with insight3g software the camera was 80 cm away from the photographing surface and the lens was perpendicular to the surface capturing a 200 200 mm image a predetermined quantity of polystyrene hollow glass spheres were seeded into the water tank as tracer particles before the test the spheres had a particle size of 10 μm and a density ranging from 1 04 103 kg m3 to 1 06 103 kg m3 the piv procedure included seeding the flow illuminating the measurement plane using a laser capturing successive images of the illuminated plane and image post processing to avoid image distortion caused by multiple media factors calibration was performed using a square ruler with convex points placed under water in the flume at fixed intervals the ruler was aligned with a light laser sheet on the photographing surface the acquisition software identified the size of the calibration ruler and converted the pixels to a physical distance which generated the scale factor yuan et al 2022b after withdrawing the calibration ruler from the water piv continuously captured images of the preset photographing plane for 5 min and transferred the data to the computer at a frame rate of 100 hz signifying 100 instantaneous double frame vector fields per second these data were stored and used as input for postprocessing preliminary convergence tests indicated that the time averaged velocity converged well over the recorded 5 minute duration the instantaneous velocity field of the piv image was calculated using an adaptive method based on cross correlation the resolution grid size in the final iterative step was 64 64 pixels and the relevant particles were calculated over a larger grid area with a 25 overlap velocity vectors were low pass filtered with a 3 3 gaussian filter to reduce measurement noise zhong et al 2015 yuan et al 2022b the ensemble average velocity field was obtained by averaging validated instantaneous velocities 2 pollutant concentration cloud measurement the planar laser induced fluorescence plif in the piv system was used to measure the pollutant concentration the technical principle of plif is based on the certain correlation between the concentration of fluorescent substance and its luminescence intensity the ccd camera was used to capture the gray level of fluorescent substances in water and then the substance concentration was calculated according to the certain correlation calibration curve the calibration curve c 28 726 95 1 g 1 286 fig 1 d was established by matching the gray levels to the actual concentrations of the fluorescent tracer rhodamine 6g c28h30n2o3 in 24 tests in stationary water tank before the experiment starting at the beginning of the experiment a certain amount of rhodamine 6g was added to the tributary tank to reach the design concentration the measurement processes were same to those of flow field measurement which required calibration image capture 5 min time averaged grey level postprocessing and pollutant concentration calculating with the calibration curve 3 experimental setup two camera positions were used in this experiment the first was to capture the flow velocity field fvf and pollutant concentration in the y z plane by photographing the longitudinal section of the flow the camera was located on the side of the flume fig 1 a five measurement sections were set at x 50 100 150 200 and 250 mm along the width of the channel fig 1 b the second was to capture the fvf and pollutant concentration in the x y plane by photographing the horizontal section of the flow the camera was mounted directly above the flume fig 1 a four measurement planes were set at z 50 70 100 and 150 mm along the depth of the channel fig 1 c a total of 24 experiments a1 a8 b1 b8 and c1 c8 table 1 were performed to explore the pollutant distribution and mixing dynamics under various junction angle α momentum flux ratio mr and width to depth ratio b h conditions 2 2 mixing rate and metric to represent the pollutant mixing processes and rate at the confluence the standard deviation σ was calculated to evaluate the variance of the pollutant concentration in each monitoring section biron et al 2004 ramón et al 2014 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b the σ of a given section gradually decreased along the downstream flow the slope of σ vs the longitudinal distance can reflect the mixing rate r m degradation and transformation of the tracer were not considered during the tests standard deviation was calculated using the following equation 1 σ c i c 2 n 1 where ci represents the pollutant concentration in each grid of a given section c is the average concentration of pollutants in all grids of the given section and n is the number of samples deviation from complete mixing δ a heterogeneity index was used to measure the mixing process of pollutants downstream for the concentration in each section gaudet and roy 1995 ramón et al 2014 zhang et al 2020b the greater the δ the more uneven the mixing the δ of pollutant concentration was defined as follows 2 δ i c i c p c p 100 where c p is the predicted concentration after complete mixing in the downstream channel gaudet and roy 1995 the c p is defined as follows 3 c p c t q t c m q m q t q m where c denotes the pollutant concentration q denotes the discharge and subscripts t and m refer to the tributary and main channel respectively to quantify the mixing level under different confluence conditions a normalized mixing metric δ σ xn based on σ was calculated for a synthetic upstream section and for the final downstream section lewis and rhoads 2015 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b the synthetic upstream section consisted of concentration data from the two incoming channels and was interpreted as a cross section of the exact location where the two streams intersected the concentration of pollutants at the inlets of the two confluent channels was used to calculate the standard deviation σ us without mixing the normalized mixing metric δ σ xn is defined as follows 4 δ σ xn 1 σ fs σ us where the subscript xn represents each given experiment σ fs denotes the standard deviation of the concentration in the final cross section y b 4 13 and σ us denotes the standard deviation of the concentration in the upstream section thus completely mixed conditions correspond to δ σ xn 1 σ fs 0 while no mixing correspond to δ σ xn 0 σ fs σ us lewis and rhoads 2015 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b the normalized mixing metric allows for comparison of tests with different inflow conditions and pollutant concentrations multiple linear regression mlr was performed to investigate the quantitative response of r m and δ σ xn to confluent conditions using the statistical package for social sciences spss version 17 0 the dependent variable was set as r m or δ σ x n whereas the independent variables were the junction angle α momentum flux ratio mr and width to depth ratio b h the multiple linear regression equation is defined as follows 5 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n ε where y is the objective function such as r m or δ σ xn x1 x 2 x n represent n independent variables in the system β 0 denotes the constant regression model parameters and β 1 β 2 β n are regression coefficients respectively and ε is the random error 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow field structure understanding the hydrodynamic characteristics of confluences can aid in determining the spatial distribution mechanism of pollutants the three dimensional 3 d flow field structure of the asymmetric open channel confluence aocc was illuminated by an example of the conditions of α 45 mr 0 32 b h 1 88 experiment b3 table 1 the confluence hydrodynamic zone chz of aocc was consistent with the conceptual model proposed in previous studies best 1987 with an obvious flow stagnation zone deflection zone separation zone maximum flow velocity zone flow recovery zone fig 2 a and shear layer fig 2 b comparing all the experimental results the increases in α mr and b h all strengthen the inflow of the tributary into the main channel resulting in more obvious zones and amplifying shear layer distortion and mixing actions however in this study the changes in b h are mainly caused by the water depth changes the evolution of water flow structure caused by the changes in channel width still needs to further study due to space constraints the authors will elaborate on the response of the flow structure to confluent conditions in open channel confluences in a future article 3 2 spatial distribution and mixing pattern of pollutants two major features of the spatial distribution and mixing pattern of pollutants were observed at the asymmetric open channel confluence first a tributary with high concentrations of pollutants penetrated the main stream forming a narrow pollution belt at the post confluence zone near the side of the tributary severely affecting the water quality in the main channel fig 3 the pollutants in the channel formed a transverse gradient with a high concentration on one side of the tributary and a low concentration on the other the two streams converged and mixed along the downstream flow where the high concentration pollution belt gradually decreased migrated and diffused to the opposite side this feature is consistent with the conclusions of a recent study on mixing at the large confluence b h 78 155 of the yellow and fen rivers in china where the fen river with a high concentration of pollutant enters the yellow river forming a narrow pollution belt and an obvious mixing interface at the confluence and the distribution pattern is almost independent of the pollutant type zhang et al 2020b second the mixing of pollutants downstream of the open channel confluence was a three dimensional process a distinct almost vertical interface from the surface to the bed of the channel was found adjacent to the downstream junction corner gradually distorting with the downstream flow corresponding to shear layer distortion in the flow structure fig 3 a fig 2 b pollutant concentrations were greater in the upper flow than near the bed which may be attributed to the high lateral velocity and momentum of the upper flow resulting in the rapid advection of pollutants near the surface flow the changes in the junction angle α momentum flux ratio mr and width depth ratio b h significantly influenced the spatial distribution and mixing pattern of the pollutants at the confluence with the increase in α the mixing interface shifted slightly towards the opposite side of the tributary intensifying the mixing of the two flows and widening the downstream pollution belt fig 3 a and b for example in the section of y b 4 13 the α increased from 45 to 90 the maximum concentration in the core of the pollution belt decreased from 1 700 to 1 400 µg l fig 3 a and b compared to α the change in mr had a greater impact on the pollutant concentration field as mr increased the tributary gained momentum penetrating wider lateral distance and producing increasingly intense lateral advection turbulent vortices and substance mixing leading to considerable widening of the downstream pollution belt fig 3 c and d additionally a larger mr may further intensify the helical motion at confluence enhancing mixing gaudet and roy 1995 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 lane et al 2008 ramón et al 2014 under the condition of mr 2 87 in experiment b8 table 1 the pollutants at post confluence were completely mixed at the cross section y b 3 53 fig 3 d which was the fastest mixing group among all the test groups this result was in accordance with the findings of a previous study on a confluence with an extremely fast mixing process under specific conditions mr 1 lewis et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b similar to α and mr the larger the b h the faster the advection and mixing of flows under constant inlet discharges an increase in b h and a shallow water depth could induce an increase in flow velocity as well as a reduction in the cross sectional area and vertical pressure gradient in the channel allowing for transverse penetration of the tributary and mutual flow deflection when b h increased from 2 5 to 3 75 the tributary rapidly diffused to the main channel resulting in a wider pollution belt occupying approximately 2 3 of the downstream channel width fig 3 e and f this also suggests that wide shallow confluences may have a faster mixing rate than narrow deep confluences this result also supports the conclusion that the cross sectional area is negatively correlated with mixing rate lewis and rhoads 2015 lewis et al 2020 however due to the limitations of the plexiglass experiment flume with a fixed width this study did not explore the increased effects of bed frictional elements caused by shallow water depth and the simultaneous changes in cross sectional area caused by changes in b h to what extent does the changes in water depth at the natural confluence comply with the above rules and which of the width depth ratio and cross sectional area is the dominant factor in mixing rate changes may require further research 3 3 mixing process of pollutants the mixing interface is a crucial hydrodynamic characteristic associated with the mixing of lateral pollutants at confluences to better understand the mixing process of the convergent flows points with concentration values equal to the predicted average concentration c p equation 3 of each section were linked to reveal the changing process of the trajectory curves of the mixing interface fig 4 a b and c the trajectory curves exhibited a logarithmic growth trend within the region of y b 1 x b increased considerably causing rapid growth of the trajectory curves to the opposite bank of the tributary fig 4 a b and c this region had the strongest flow deflection of the main stream and the tributaries carrying pollutants penetrated the confluence where the primary driving forces of pollutant mixing were lateral advection and turbulent diffusion fig 2 in the region of y b 1 the increment of x b gradually decreased and the trajectory curves were nearly parallel except for the condition of mr 2 87 fig 4 a b and c where the primary driver of pollutant mixing was turbulent diffusion or helical motion de serres et al 1999 bradbrook et al 2001 zhang et al 2020b yuan et al 2022a the trajectory curves did not begin at point 0 0 but were offset downstream based on the geometric vertex of the flume fig 4 a b and c which may be attributed to the flow stagnation near the upstream junction corner and the jacking effect of the two streams fig 2 a the increase in α fig 4 a mr fig 4 b and b h fig 4 c enhanced mixing and resulted in steeper trajectory curves that deviated further in experiment b8 mr 2 87 at section y b 4 13 the trajectory curve developed to the opposite side of the tributary x b 1 0 demonstrating that the pollutants were thoroughly mixed and uniformly distributed fig 4 c furthermore the deviation from complete mixing δ calculated by equation 2 was used to characterize the mixing process of the two converged streams where δ max reflects the maximum δ in the high concentration pollution belt near the tributary and δ min reflects the minimum values away from the tributary side fig 4 d e f gaudet and roy 1995 defined complete mixing as δ 10 that is the region bordered by two horizontal dashed lines in the figures the δ max and δ min of the initial section were as high as 270 and as low as 98 respectively indicating that the pollutant concentration in the mouth of the tributary was 2 7 times higher than the average concentration while the concentration on the opposite side of the tributary was well below complete mixing fig 4 d under a given operating condition when y b increased δ max gradually decreased whereas δ min remained essentially unchanged indicating that mixing in the confluence was mostly a diffusion and advection process from the tributary pollution belt to the main stream fig 4 d e f similarly increases in α fig 4 d mr fig 4 e and b h fig 4 f resulted in a larger decline in δ along the downstream flow demonstrating enhanced mixing from another direction for example compared with mr 0 17 under the conditions of mr 2 87 δ max 79 16 at section y b 0 37 which decreased by 189 79 the rate of decrease of δ in the center of the confluence was greater than that at the post confluence area demonstrating that flow turbulence near the junction was intense and material mixing was more intense than that far from the junction as established in field tests at large confluences zhang et al 2020b turbulence at the interface is induced by lateral shear caused by velocity differences between confluent flows babarutsi and chu 1998 sukhodolov and rhoads 2001 guillén ludeña et al 2017 and by shedding of vortices from interacting shear layers that bind the stagnation zone lewis and rhoads 2018 3 4 response of mixing rates to confluent conditions with the advection convergence and turbulent diffusion of the flows downstream the pollutants were gradually mixed and the lateral differences in concentration decreased resulting in a drop in the standard deviation σ of the pollutant concentration in the corresponding cross section fig 5 a b and c the mixing rate r m of the substances at the confluence was represented by the variation in σ vs longitudinal distance biron et al 2004 ramón et al 2014 zhang et al 2020b the two convergent flows carrying pollutants began to mix at the initial cross section of the tributary mouth where σ σ us was high 0 405 which was attributed to the tributary with high pollutant concentrations as the water flowed downstream the values of σ σ us exhibited a relatively linear decline fig 5 a the larger the α the faster the σ σ us value decreased when α 30 45 60 and 90 the slopes of the fitting line were 0 022 0 024 0 031 and 0 034 respectively fig 5 a table 2 this confirmed that r m increased accompanied by enhanced mixing with the increase in α through a length of approximately 4 13 channel widths a small σ σ us presented in the final section when α 90 r m was the fastest with σ σ us decreasing by 33 01 from 0 40 to 0 27 whereas the decreased amplitudes at 30 45 and 60 were only 22 04 24 92 and 29 19 respectively fig 5 a recent field studies on mixing at confluences support this finding suggesting that the development of curvature driven large scale helical motion is especially prominent at high angle asymmetrical confluences and enhances mixing constantinescu et al 2016 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2019 lewis et al 2020 similarly when mr and b h increased the mixing was strengthened increasing the slope of σ σ us that is r m increased table 2 fig 5 b and c this phenomenon can be attributed to the strength and persistence of the dual counter rotating helical motion generated by mutual deflection flows at the entrance to the downstream channel rhoads 1996 constantinescu et al 2012 constantinescu et al 2014 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2019 lewis et al 2020 as well as the dominant penetration of tributaries with higher momentum flux to a relatively distant area at the center of the confluence riley and rhoads 2012 zhang et al 2020a the authors previous field study zhang et al 2020b on the confluence also supported this conclusion indicating that an increase in the discharge ratio between the tributary and the main channel can enhance mixing and have a substantial influence on the mixing level additionally the tributary transporting pollutants was pushed to a farther lateral distance in the channel with shallower water depth higher flow velocity and smaller vertical pressure gradient under the experimental conditions of greater b h enhancing mixing the quantitative response of r m to α mr and b h was studied using multiple linear regression mlr method in the statistical package for social sciences spss version 17 0 and four equations were obtained to express r m table 3 to better reduce the influence of dimension on response the junction angle α was divided by 180 for non dimensionalization i e α α 180 the equations were compared and optimized using the coefficient of determination r2 level of significance p and comparison between the predicted and observed values table 3 fig 5 d the four equations have p values less than 0 001 p 0 000 however equations a and b were eliminated due to their relatively low r2 values 0 974 and 0 992 respectively table 3 meanwhile several scatter points of predicted and observed values were distributed beyond the error interval of 10 as indicated by the red ellipse fig 5 d conversely the r2 values of equations c and d were relatively high up to 0 999 table 3 their predicted values were highly consistent with the observed values of r m and the scatter points were all distributed within a 10 error range fig 5 d in contrast the simpler equation c was recommended since it could accurately reflect the quantitative response of the mixing rate r m to the confluent conditions consisting of the junction angle α momentum ratio mr and width depth ratio b h r m 0 036 exp α 0 022 ln m r 0 027 ln b h this mixing rate function illustrates that r m had an exponential relationship with α and a natural logarithmic relationship with mr and b h 3 5 response of mixing metric to confluent conditions to reveal the possible relationships between the spatial variation in pollutant mixing and the confluent conditions within the chz the mixing metrics δσ xn table 2 of the final section y b 4 13 under each experimental condition were calculated using equation 4 and the change in δσ xn was plotted versus α fig 6 a mr fig 6 b and b h fig 6 c strong linear relationships were observed between δσ xn and α mr and b h within the scope of the data with correlation coefficients of 0 97 0 97 and 0 98 respectively fig 6 a b and c within a short distance of 4 13 channel widths i e at the final section δσ xn ranged from 0 67 to 0 73 as α increased from 0 08 to 0 50 table 2 and the linear fitting relationship was δσ xn 0 23α 0 63 r2 0 93 fig 6 a similarly δσ xn increased from 0 64 to 0 84 when b h increased from 1 20 to 3 75 exhibiting a linear relationship of δσ xn 0 089b h 0 51 r2 0 95 fig 6 c in comparison with α and b h mr had a substantial impact on the mixing degree with δσ xn increasing from 0 69 to 0 97 as mr increased from 0 17 to 2 87 accordingly the linear relationship between δσ xn and mr was δσ xn 0 097mr 0 70 r2 0 92 fig 6 b this observation was consistent with the tendency of the mixing metric at the downstream end of the confluence to increase with the momentum flux ratio at a small natural river confluence lewis and rhoads 2015 which exhibited approximately linear relationships fig 6 b it was also consistent with the conclusion that the discharge ratio was the key factor in determining the mixing level at a large confluence with a discordant bed zhang et al 2020b special attention should be paid to the fact that when mr 1 00 the two flows had the same momentum but did not completely mix after the length of 4 13 channel widths with a δσ xn value of 0 80 however when mr increased to 2 87 the two convergent streams were essentially completely mixed with δσ xn 0 97 these results were ascribed to the fact that α mr and b h undoubtedly affected the flow structure at the chz thus controlling the development of mixing to illuminate the quantitative response of pollutant mixing and confluent conditions mlr was performed to obtain four equations for δσ xn table 4 similarly to r m the r2 p value and predicted values vs observed values were used for the comparative analysis of each equation table 4 fig 6 d despite its relative simplicity equation e was not recommended due to the low r2 value 0 987 and the predicted vs observed values of δσ xn did not fit well with the standard line such as the numerous points encircled by red ellipses distributed outside the error interval of 10 fig 6 d among the four equations equation f g and h can accurately reflect the quantitative response relationship between the mixing metric and α mr and b h which all had markedly high values of r2 and high matching degree for predicted and observed δσ xn with the exception of one point of equation f falling outside of the error range of 10 fig 6 d in contrast equation f was proposed to characterize the mixing metric function due to its relatively simple construction and ease of application that is δ σ xn 0 432 α m r 0 084 b h 2 0 523 b h this function indicated that the mixing degree had a linear relationship with the product of α and mr as well as a quadratic relationship with b h 4 conclusion this study proposed the quantitative responses of the mixing rate and mixing metric to the variant confluent conditions of junction angle momentum flux ratio and width depth ratio in asymmetric open channel confluences furthermore the spatial distribution mixing pattern and mixing process of pollutants were investigated under various confluent conditions the key findings of the experiments are summarized as follows i the spatial distribution of pollutants in the open channel confluence had a strong three dimensional structure a narrow long pollution belt near the tributary and a vertical mixing interface adjacent to the downstream junction corner which shifted to the opposite side of the tributary and was distorted due to the shear layer distortion of the flow structure the interface trajectory curves showed a logarithmic growth trend with a position gradually advancing to the opposite bank with the downstream flow there was a decreasing trend in the downstream direction for deviation from complete mixing ii the standard deviation of the pollutant concentration at the confluence decreased gradually along the flow and the slope of the fitting curve could essentially represent the mixing rate the slope increased as the junction angle momentum ratio and width depth ratio increased enhancing mixing particularly when the momentum ratio was 1 and complete mixing was achieved within the length of 4 5 widths of the main channel iii the mixing metric δσ xn can efficiently quantify the mixing level of each experiment allowing for the comparison of results between tests with different inflow conditions the mixing metric had a markedly linear correlation with junction angle momentum ratio and width depth ratio iv the junction angle momentum ratio and width depth ratio all have a substantial impact on the flow structure and pollutant mixing in the open channel confluence with the concordant bed the increase in the three confluent conditions increased the penetration of the tributary the visibility of the confluence hydrodynamic zones the shear layer distortion and pollutant mixing resulting in shifts of the mixing interface trajectory toward the opposite side of the tributary rapid reduction of deviation from complete mixing and a larger mixing rate and metric v a prominent quantitative relationship exists between the mixing rate mixing metric junction angle momentum ratio and width depth ratio the functional equations for which can be expressed as mixing rate rm 0 036 exp α 0 022 ln mr 0 027 ln b h and mixing metric δσ xn 0 432 α mr 0 084 b h 2 0 523 b h these findings have major implications for a systematic understanding of material transport and mixing dynamics as well as the assessment of downstream water quality at confluences however further high precision research is required to elucidate how helical motion produces mixing under various confluent conditions at confluences credit authorship contribution
