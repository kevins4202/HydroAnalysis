1685,diffusion cell and diffusion wafer experiments were conducted to compare methods for estimating effective matrix diffusion coefficients in rock core samples from pahute mesa at the nevada nuclear security site nnss a diffusion wafer method in which a solute diffuses out of a rock matrix that is pre saturated with water containing the solute is presented as a simpler alternative to the traditional through diffusion diffusion cell method both methods yielded estimates of effective matrix diffusion coefficients that were within the range of values previously reported for nnss volcanic rocks the difference between the estimates of the two methods ranged from 14 to 30 and there was no systematic high or low bias of one method relative to the other from a transport modeling perspective these differences are relatively minor when one considers that other variables e g fracture apertures fracture spacings influence matrix diffusion to a greater degree and tend to have greater uncertainty than effective matrix diffusion coefficients for the same relative random errors in concentration measurements the diffusion cell method yields effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates that have less uncertainty than the wafer method however the wafer method is easier and less costly to implement and yields estimates more quickly thus allowing a greater number of samples to be analyzed for the same cost and time given the relatively good agreement between the methods and the lack of any apparent bias between the methods the diffusion wafer method appears to offer advantages over the diffusion cell method if better statistical representation of a given set of rock samples is desired 1 introduction transport of radionuclides and other contaminants in saturated fractured rock can be strongly affected by diffusive mass transfer between fractures and the surrounding rock matrix a process known as matrix diffusion grisak and pickens 1980 neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 małoszewski and zuber 1985 skagius and neretnieks 1986 liu et al 2004 matrix diffusion is typically associated with dual porosity systems in which flow is predominantly in fractures but there is a significant amount of non flowing or very slowly flowing porosity in the surrounding rock matrix that is in diffusive communication with the flowing fractures reimus and haga 1999 reimus et al 2002a this diffusive communication can result in significant retardation of both reactive and nonreactive solutes relative to groundwater travel times in the fractures for non reactive solutes the effective retardation factor can theoretically approach the ratio of total porosity to flowing porosity where the total porosity is the sum of the flowing porosity and the non flowing porosity that is in diffusive communication with the flowing porosity reimus et al 2011 bradbury and green 1985 reactive sorbing solutes will also experience this retardation but their retardation will be magnified by the increased sorptive surface area that they come into contact within the matrix relative to what they would have contacted if they were confined to the flowing fractures grisak and pickens 1980 robinson et al 2012 in addition to sorption reactive solute mobility will also be altered by chemical reaction with mineral surfaces in the matrix in particular studies at repository sites have shown fe and mn oxide coatings can catalyze the redox reactions or enhance dissociation of organically chelated contaminants thereby affecting their mobility zachara et al 1995 brooks et al 1996 for example even under reducing environments trace fe iii in minerals can lead to dissociation of co iii edta affecting its solubility jardine et al 2002 a large inventory of radionuclides is present underground at the nevada nuclear security site nnss as a result of underground nuclear testing from the 1950s until 1992 much of this inventory resides in saturated fractured volcanic tuff and lava flow aquifers that have high fracture permeabilities and subsequently relatively fast groundwater travel times from radionuclide source locations i e nuclear test cavities blankennagel and weir 1973 finnegan et al 2016 however the majority of the saturated porosity in these aquifers is in the relatively impermeable rock matrix drellack et al 1997 reimus et al 2002a 2002b so the aquifers represent classic dual porosity systems in which matrix diffusion is potentially an important radionuclide retardation mechanism tritiated water 3hho tends to dominate predicted offsite anthropogenic radioactivity in groundwater near the nnss because of its large inventory and the fact that most other radionuclides present in the aftermath of nuclear testing are either very low in solubility strongly retarded and attenuated by geochemical processes or present in such small amounts that they do not contribute much to potential radiological doses even if little credit is taken for retardation processes because matrix diffusion has a big potential impact on 3hho transport considerable work has been conducted to estimate effective matrix diffusion coefficients of non reactive solutes in nnss rocks reimus and haga 1999 reimus et al 2002a 2002b reimus et al 2007 although the ratio of total porosity to fracture porosity defines the upper limit of the retardation factor of a non reactive solute in a dual porosity system the effective matrix diffusion coefficient is needed to estimate diffusive mass transfer rates which affect both breakthrough times and peak concentrations reimus et al 2002b and thus contaminant boundary calculations which delineate the possible extent of radionuclide contaminated groundwater from underground nuclear testing the effective matrix diffusion coefficient is the product of the solute s free water diffusion coefficient and the matrix tortuosity and coefficients can be determined from either laboratory experiments numerical modeling and or field tests grisak and pickens 1980 callahan et al 2000 soler et al 2015 numerical modeling can fit tracer breakthrough curves to yield effective matrix diffusion coefficients but other processes such as kinetic sorption and variations in aquifer hydraulic conductivity also lead to similar effects as matrix diffusion i e retardation of contaminant migration and tailing on breakthrough curves which obfuscates modeling efforts carrera et al 1998 field tracer tests are useful for obtaining breakthrough curves and identifying governing chemical processes affecting transport but insofar as determining effective matrix diffusion coefficients this computed value is scale dependent and generally larger than core scale estimates shapiro 2001 zhou et al 2007 this discrepancy results from field test s ability to only yield estimates of a lumped mass transfer coefficient for matrix diffusion which also depends on porosity and fracture aperture not a direct matrix diffusion coefficient estimate reimus et al 2003 therefore unambiguous estimates of effective matrix diffusion coefficients are best determined in laboratory tests callahan et al 2000 reimus et al 2007 laboratory estimates of effective matrix diffusion coefficients are traditionally determined using a through diffusion method whereby a reservoir containing the tracer of interest is separated from a receiving reservoir by a rock sample of known thickness and cross sectional area and the concentration change of the receiving reservoir is monitored through time e g bradbury and green 1985 skagius and neretnieks 1986 reimus et al 2007 however this through diffusion method can be expensive time consuming and complex limiting the number of samples that can be analyzed another method involving the diffusion of a tracer out of a rock sample saturated with tracer solution into an initially tracer free reservoir in which the sample is immersed may provide a cheaper quicker and simpler alternative because this method does not require the use of a specialized diffusion cell and it permits diffusion from both sides of the rock core thus expediting the tracer breakthrough times reimus et al 2006 hershey and fereday 2016 this study compares the merits of these two methods 2 methods 2 1 sample descriptions rock core samples were obtained from corehole ue 20c located on pahute mesa at the nnss where previous studies have been conducted to evaluate radionuclide migration from underground nuclear tests reimus et al 2002a 2002b 2003 2007 liu et al 2004 robinson et al 2012 the selected core samples were visually inspected and subsampled to avoid fractures or major voids and cut into pieces of intact matrix material of constant thickness and cross sectional area fig 1 these samples represent different hydrostratigraphic units that have significant transmissivity within pahute mesa and for which effective matrix diffusion coefficient data were lacking before this study the benham aquifer cores represent variable sizes of lithophysal cavities within a similar matrix in this lava flow unit from depths of 1189 1189 25 1353 1353 28 and 1925 1 1925 3ft below ground surface bgs previous work demonstrated that lithophysal cavities are open to exchange with fracture networks and act to retard the flow of water through vertical fractures liu et al 2004 the lithophysal cavities in the benham aquifer samples are largely filled with poorly consolidated alteration minerals so they are not void spaces although they appear to be more porous and hence more accessible to diffusion than the surrounding lava matrix duplicate tiva canyon aquifer tca samples represent the moderate to densely welded tuff at 2131 3 2131 5ft bgs table 1 use of these duplicate samples located adjacent to each other in this core sample provides a measure of experimental reproducibility 2 2 porosity and permeability prior to diffusion testing the porosity of the rock core sections was measured by dividing the difference between their saturated and oven dry weights by the known sample volume assuming a water density of 1g cm3 each sample was then incorporated into a diffusion cell apparatus see section 2 3 1 and its permeability was measured using either the constant head method for the higher permeability benham aquifer lava flow samples or the falling head method for the lower permeability tiva canyon tuff samples freeze and cherry 1979 the constant and falling head methods provided hydraulic conductivity estimates from which permeability was determined according to 1 k k μ ρ g in which k is hydraulic conductivity μ is the dynamic viscosity of water ρ is density of water and g is acceleration due to gravity callahan et al 2000 2 3 experiment 1 diffusion cell diffusion through rock cores 2 3 1 assembly of diffusion cell apparatus details of the experimental methods are provided in callahan et al 2000 reimus et al 2002a 2002b and reimus et al 2007 briefly each rock core section was placed in a square mold into which room temperature vulcanization rtv silicone was poured until it covered the edges of the cores without spilling over onto the top surface after setting the silicone serves as a gasket material that can be easily sealed between two reservoirs a primer was used to achieve a good seal between the silicone and the periphery of each core wafer to ensure that diffusion was only through the rock matrix and not along the edges of the cores care was taken to ensure no silicone came in contact with either of the open faces of the rock los alamos municipal tap water was used in all experiments and was filter sterilized 0 2μm rock cores were saturated with filtered tap water under vacuum after flushing the vacuum chamber with co2 multiple times replacing atmospheric gas with co2 expedites water saturation as co2 dissolves much more readily in water than does air callahan et al 2000 reimus et al 2006 once there were no visible bubbles escaping the samples the samples were assumed to be saturated 1week samples were then immediately placed in between two reservoirs machined out of plexiglass which were rapidly secured with screws and filled with water to maintain saturation the large reservoir 800 1600ml capacity of the apparatus served as the injection reservoir for the tracer and the smaller reservoir 90 200ml capacity served as the collection reservoir to measure the tracer diffusion the apparatus was oriented horizontally and the water level on both sides of the reservoir was kept identical to eliminate the potential for advective flow fig 2 both reservoirs were kept well mixed using a magnetic stir bar reimus et al 2002a 2002b 2 3 2 tracer introduction sampling and measurements tritium was chosen as the nonsorbing solute with which to measure effective matrix diffusion coefficients the free water diffusion coefficient d of 3hho is 2 4 10 9 m2 s 1 kozaki et al 1999 reimus et al 2007 between 0 3 and 0 6ml of a stock solution of 3hho 2 550 581cpmml 1 was added to the large chamber of each cell to obtain an initial concentration ci of 1300cpmml 1 samples from both the large and small chambers were obtained daily thereafter approximately 0 5ml of water was sampled by syringe from the small chamber whereas 5ml of sample was extracted by syringe from the large chamber to maintain constant head levels on each side concentration changes in the large chambers were small relative to the starting concentrations so only the data from the small chambers were used to determine effective matrix diffusion coefficients 3hho activity was measured using a packard tri carb 2500 liquid scintillation counter the 0 5ml samples were diluted to 6ml with deionized water and then 14ml of ultima gold scintillation cocktail was added reimus et al 2002b standards prepared with different ratios of water to cocktail were used to obtain a quench curve to correct for variations in scintillation counting efficiencies of the samples caused by minor variations in water to cocktail ratios thomson 2001 2 3 3 calculation of matrix diffusion coefficients from diffusion cell method encapsulating the sides of the cores with silicone ensured that bulk diffusion occurred in the axial direction not radially reimus et al 2006 hershey and fereday 2016 therefore the effective matrix diffusion coefficients are determined by the 1 d diffusive transport equation 2 c t d m r m 2 c x 2 in which c is the tracer concentration cpm dm is the aqueous effective diffusion coefficient through the rock matrix cm2 sec 1 rm is the retardation factor 1 for nonsorbing solutes such as 3hho x is the distance cm and t is time sec skagius and neretnieks 1986 callahan et al 2000 reimus et al 2002b the tracer concentrations at the inlet and outlet boundary vary with time according to 3 c i t φ a w d m v i c x x 0 4 c o t φ a w d m v o c x x l in which aw is the cross sectional area of the rock core ci is the tracer concentration in the large reservoir inlet co is the tracer concentration in the small reservoir outlet vi and vo are the volumes ml in the inlet and outlet reservoirs respectively φ is matrix porosity and l is the rock core thickness cm in eqs 3 and 4 the minor decreases in volumes of the inlet and outlet reservoir associated with sampling are not considered eqs 2 4 were solved numerically using the diffcell computer code which employs an implicit finite difference method reimus et al 2002b the effective matrix diffusion coefficient dm is manually varied until the sum of squares of the differences between the modeled co t ci 0 and the experimental co t ci 0 is minimized where ci 0 is the initial concentration in the large reservoir 2 4 experiment 2 diffusion wafers diffusion out of rock wafer 2 4 1 assembly of diffusion wafers the same rock cores from the diffusion cell experiments were used in the subsequent diffusion wafer experiments upon completion of the tritium breakthrough experiments through diffusion the diffusion cells were taken apart and the rocks dried for several days in an oven 105 c to ensure complete dryness the sides of the rocks were then resealed with silicone to prevent contact between the sides of the rock and the water the water used to saturate the samples was spiked with deuterium 6600 rather than tritium to avoid a radiological hazard during the vacuum saturation process see section 2 3 1 which is prone to splashing and spillage the large chambers from the diffusion cell apparatus were used as cylindrical containers for the diffusion wafer experiments and the small chambers were placed on top as a lid to minimize evaporation each sample was placed in a separate container and completely immersed in filtered tap water the rock cores were suspended above the bottom of the containers by placing them on inverted perforated septum caps that were made of very thin aluminum so that there was negligible contact area between the septum caps and the cores in addition to providing unhindered diffusion access to the bottom surface of the rocks the caps created space for magnetic stir bars below the cores fig 2 reimus et al 2006 hershey and fereday 2016 the containers were placed alongside open beakers of water inside larger plastic storage bins that were kept closed except during sampling as a further measure to minimize evaporation fig 2 2 4 2 tracer sampling and measurement samples of the tap water surrounding the cores were taken daily for the first 2weeks and periodically thereafter approximately 2ml of the tap water was collected for each sample deuterium samples were analyzed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms on a gv instruments eurovector elemental analyzer results are reported in δ notation as the per mil deviation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow δd values were calibrated using in house standards calibrated to iaea international atomic energy agency standards vsmow slap standard light antarctic precipitation and gisp greenland ice sheet precipitation and although enriched samples fell outside the range of commercially available standards a check standard prepared at 10 000 yielded results within 1 of its calculated value 2 4 3 calculation of matrix diffusion coefficients from wafer diffusion method effective matrix diffusion coefficients were again calculated using eq 2 with the following boundary conditions 5 dc i dx 0 at x 0 core midpoint 6 v res dc res dt φ 2 a w d m c x at x 0 5 t w in which ci is the concentration of the tracer in the core

the surface area of one side of the core cm2 dm is the aqueous effective deuterium diffusion coefficient through the rock matrix cm2 s and tw is the thickness of the core cm an explicit in time finite difference technique coded in fortran reimus et al 2006 hershey and fereday 2016 was used to obtain a solution that was fitted to the data the effective matrix diffusion coefficient dm was varied until the modeled breakthrough curve matched the experimental breakthrough curve hershey and fereday 2016 for this method it is important to interrogate the entire breakthrough curve as breakthrough occurs more quickly than in the diffusion cell method and initial breakthrough may reflect only the surficial properties of the sample 3 results 3 1 porosities and permeabilities the measured matrix porosities and permeabilities of the 5 core samples are listed in table 1 although the porosity of the tca welded tuff is slightly greater than that of the lava samples the permeability of the tuff is 1 to 3 orders of magnitude less than that of the ba lava flow rocks containing lithophysal cavities these measurements suggest that the lithophysal cavities tend to provide conduits for flow in the lava samples the permeability however does not increase linearly as a function of lithophysal enrichment table 1 during the saturation process it became apparent that there was a dominant discrete flow pathway in sample ue 20c 1189 1189 25 that probably corresponded to a partially filled cavity that extended over most of the sample thickness consequently the larger k value of sample ue 20c 1189 1189 25 relative to sample ue 20c 1353 1353 28 which had a higher density of lithophysal cavities may reflect this single dominant feature it was also noted that the cavities in sample ue 20c 1189 1189 25 though less numerous tended to have more void space than those of sample ue 20c 1353 1353 28 which probably also influenced the permeabilities of the samples relative to each other 3 2 matrix diffusion coefficients the effective matrix diffusion coefficients determined by fitting the data generated with the 2 experimental methods are shown in table 2 and plots comparing the model matches to the data sets are shown in fig 3 in this figure concentrations are expressed as the concentration in the sampled reservoir divided by the initial concentration in either the source reservoir diffusion cells or the rock core diffusion wafer it is apparent in fig 3 that the data sets are matched quite well by the respective models and the goodness of fit of the models are acceptable the diffusion wafer experiments were clearly conducted longer than necessary in most cases as the effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates are determined primarily with data collected during the time period of increasing concentrations not after the breakthrough curves reach their final plateaus which are equal to the ratio of pore volume in the rock to the sum of the rock pore volume and the reservoir volume complete breakthrough occurred in the diffusion wafers in less than 1000h whereas the breakthrough curve had not plateaued after 1500h in the diffusion cell experiments note that the diffusion wafer plots of fig 3 are shown with a log time scale to emphasize the early breakthrough times of the experiments which dictate the effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates deviations from concentration plateaus at later times in some of the diffusion wafer experiments were caused by cumulative errors in making corrections for extracted sample volumes in the case of the diffusion wafer experiment for the sample from 1925ft ue 20c 1925 1 1925 3 the discontinuities at later times were caused by two additions of tap water to the reservoir necessitated by a leak as table 2 shows the differences between the estimated effective matrix diffusion coefficients from the two methods were always within 30 of the diffusion cell estimate there appeared to be no systematic high or low bias of one method relative to the other the diffusion cell method yielded greater effective matrix diffusion coefficients for the duplicate tuff samples and one of the lava samples whereas the diffusion wafer method yielded larger effective matrix diffusion coefficients for two of the lava samples table 2 however the results suggest that when matrix permeabilities are high there may be a tendency to obtain smaller estimates from the diffusion cell experiments more specifically the two rocks with the highest permeability i e ue 20c 1189 1189 25 ue 20c 1353 1353 28 yielded smaller estimates of dm from the diffusion cell method as compared to the diffusion wafer method and the sample with the highest permeability i e ue 20c 1189 1189 25 yielded the smallest estimate of dm applying the diffusion cell method of course the limited sample size of this study does not permit definitive conclusions on such trends the duplicate samples ue 20c 2131 3 2131 5a and b of different thickness show excellent agreement within 5 for a given method table 2 although the error between the two methods for the same samples was about 15 to put the effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates of this study into a broader perspective it is useful to compare them to the data set of reimus et al 2007 who reported diffusion coefficients measured by the diffusion cell method for 46 different rock samples from the nnss representing a wide range of volcanic rock lithologies but excluding the current samples the estimates for halides and 3hho collectively spanned nearly 2 orders of magnitude from 0 09 10 6 to 6 2 10 6 cm2 s which is much larger than the range of values reported in this study fig 4 shows the values of log effective matrix diffusion coefficients divided by free water diffusion coefficients log dm d of the 46 data points from reimus et al 2007 plotted against log dm d values predicted by a multiple linear regression fit to the data reimus et al 2007 7 log d m d 1 42 1 91 φ 0 19 log k where φ is matrix porosity and k is permeability the squared correlation coefficient for this previously established relationship is 0 542 indicating a moderate positive correlation reimus et al 2007 the effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates from this study are included in fig 4 and it is apparent that they fall within the scatter of the values predicted by eq 7 which suggests that the new values would not have significantly altered eq 7 if they had been considered in the multiple linear regression however the data from this study deviate from the positive linear trend of the previous data and display a nearly horizontal trend this deviation arises from the much larger range in permeability values as compared to the range in both the porosity and the effective matrix diffusion coefficient for this new set of samples the permeabilities of the samples in this study range between 3 95 10 14 and 1 5 10 17 m2 whereas the computed effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates are within the same order of magnitude and the porosities only vary between 0 13 and 0 18 thus the variation in the predicted effective matrix diffusion coefficient value from eq 7 is predominantly dependent on permeability which has a much greater variation than the computed effective matrix diffusion coefficients fig 4 additionally the sample with the highest permeability extends beyond the permeability range of all other samples suggesting that the previous set of samples may not have captured all the possible ranges in permeability in nnss rocks this may be because the permeability of this sample was dominated by a single high permeability channel that became apparent when the sample was saturated whereas in the other rocks the permeabilities appeared to be more uniformly distributed over the cross sectional areas of the samples it stands to reason that the diffusion behavior of a sample may not follow an established permeability trend if the permeability is dominated by a unique feature that is not representative of the bulk matrix as appeared to be the case for the sample with the highest permeability thus rocks with lithophysal cavities may not be expected to exhibit as positive of a correlation between effective matrix diffusion coefficients and matrix permeability as rocks with more homogeneous matrices however it may also be that the sample thickness in this study was too small relative to the size of the cavities to exhibit any sort of a correlation such a relationship might emerge if all samples had thicknesses that were large relative to the largest features in the matrices the fact that the effective matrix diffusion coefficients of the three lava samples were all quite similar to each other and to the tuff samples despite their large contrast in permeabilities suggests that the effective matrix diffusion coefficients may have been controlled by the properties of the lava matrix in the samples which appeared to be quite similar in all lava samples whereas the permeability was likely controlled by the widely varying sizes and interconnectedness of the lithophysal cavities 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of method uncertainty because the true values of the effective matrix diffusion coefficients of the samples are unknown it is not possible to determine which experimental method offered the more accurate estimates of effective matrix diffusion coefficients the fact that the estimates were higher for 3 of 5 samples by the diffusion cell method and higher for the other 2 samples by the diffusion wafer method indicates that there is no systematic high or low bias of one method relative to the other however as noted previously the data suggest that diffusion cell estimates may tend to be lower than diffusion wafer estimates when matrix permeabilities are high evaluating the precision of the two methods in this study is complicated by the fact that tritiated and deuterated water were used in the two different types of respective experiments different analytical methods that have significantly different measurement errors were used to analyze for these isotopes the percent standard deviation of the deuterium analysis was less than 1 whereas the tricarb does not report a similar quantification of error for each measurement of tritium if sample size is a concern however the tritium analysis requires less sample volume than the deuterium analysis 0 5ml vs 2 0ml the use of deuterium offers clear advantages over tritium with regards to number of laboratory safety precautions required because of its radioactivity the initial concentration of tritium in the diffusion cell experiments was much closer to its analytical detection limit than the initial concentration of deuterium in the wafer experiments consequently there was inherently more scatter in the diffusion cell data than the diffusion wafer data for these reasons no attempt was made to determine and compare confidence intervals of the two sets of effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates instead the precision uncertainties associated with the two methods were qualitatively compared using a monte carlo type method to simulate the data scatter that would have occurred if normally distributed concentration measurement errors with the same relative standard deviation applied to both types of experiments the norminv function in excel was used for the rock samples with the fastest and slowest changes in concentrations samples ue 20c 2131 3 2131 5a tca and ue 20c 1189 1189 25 ba respectively to generate synthetic data sets that had the best fitting curve as the mean and a standard deviation equal to 5 of the mean at regularly spaced times throughout the test figs 5 and 6 the rand function which generates uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 1 served as the probability input value for the norminv function to ensure that the synthetic data were normally distributed about the best fitting curve in figs 5 and 6 10 normally distributed points are plotted at each selected sampling time along with the best fitting curve and curves corresponding to effective matrix diffusion coefficients equal to 10 of the best fitting effective matrix diffusion coefficients in figs 5 and 6 it is qualitatively apparent that a 5 relative standard deviation results in more of the synthetic data points falling outside the bands defined by the 10 curves in the case of the diffusion wafers than in the case of the diffusion cells the implication is that for the same relative random experimental errors there will be greater uncertainty in estimating effective matrix diffusion coefficients from diffusion wafer experiments than diffusion cell experiments thus if the two different types of experiments were conducted in ways that result in the same relative random experimental errors diffusion cell experiments can be expected to yield effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates that have less uncertainty the greater uncertainty for the diffusion wafer method is a consequence of the much lower sensitivity of the observed tracer concentrations to the effective matrix diffusion coefficient when tracer is diffusing out of a rock core that is initially saturated with tracer than when tracer is diffusing completely through an initially tracer free rock core we again emphasize that no attempt was made in this study to assess and compare either the randomness or the relative magnitudes of the errors in the two different types of experiments because the different tracers and different analytical methods would have biased such a comparison 4 2 comparison of method practicality the diffusion wafer method appears to offer clear advantages over the diffusion cell method from the perspective of experimental apparatus simplicity experimental setup for the diffusion wafer method requires simply to prepare samples of constant thickness and cross sectional area and then to seal the peripheral surface area with a silicone gel or other sealant to ensure diffusional access only to the two ends of the sample having the same cross sectional area these samples are then saturated with a tracer submersed into a stirred vessel with tracer free water without blocking the open surfaces and then periodically sampled the diffusion cell method requires essentially the same rock preparation steps plus incorporation of the sample into a barrier that will separate high and low concentration reservoirs which increases the chances of compromising the sample relative to simply coating the periphery with a sealant the diffusion cell apparatus must also be specially constructed and its greater complexity relative to a simple beaker type reservoir creates a greater potential for leaks additionally both reservoirs of the diffusion cell must be sampled to maintain a constant head on both sides and prevent a hydraulic gradient that drives advective flow that could overwhelm diffusive flux kirino et al 2009 demonstrated a positive correlation between estimated effective matrix diffusion coefficients and solution density indicating that even with initially equal head levels density driven advective flow in the diffusion cell method can lead to overestimation of the effective matrix diffusion coefficients and may require additional correction it is also possible for the diffusion wafer method to be affected by advective flow if the water initially saturated into the sample is denser than the reservoir water for both methods the effects of advective flow will be exaggerated in more permeable rock samples theoretically the diffusion wafer experiment should produce tracer breakthrough 4 times faster than the diffusion cell method because the diffusion distance through the rock core is half that of the cell and diffusion times scale with distance squared eqs 4 and 6 in the experiments of this study the time needed for complete tracer breakthrough of a given sample appeared to be somewhat less than a factor of 4 between the two types of experiments in the diffusion wafer experiments the tracer appears almost immediately in the stirred vessel whereas there is always a time delay in observing tracer in the low concentration reservoir of a diffusion cell fig 3 it is important to note however that the early initial breakthrough in a diffusion wafer may only reflect the properties of the outer edges of the rock sample and it can also be sensitive to how thoroughly the rock surfaces are dried off before being immersed so a full assessment of the breakthrough curve 500 1000h for these samples is necessary to calculate an accurate effective matrix diffusion coefficient 5 conclusions based on the results of this study we conclude that there is no obvious advantage in using the more widely accepted diffusion cell method over the much simpler diffusion wafer method for estimating effective matrix diffusion coefficients in rock samples the differences in the estimates provided by the two methods on the same rock samples are within about 30 and considering that neither method produced estimates of effective matrix diffusion coefficients that were either consistently higher or lower than the other both methods should provide equally acceptable estimates for use in transport models although a larger sample size with a greater range of permeabilities lithologies cementation and mineral bedding is necessary to confirm this position this is particularly true when one considers that the internal variability of a lithologic unit s rock properties is often greater than 30 furthermore when one considers that for a given time and cost more diffusion wafer experiments can be conducted than diffusion cell experiments the diffusion wafer method offers the advantage that it can provide better statistical representation of a given type of rock to better address variability resulting from rock heterogeneity it should also be noted that when accounting for the effects of matrix diffusion in fractured rocks in contaminant transport models there is generally greater sensitivity to and greater uncertainty in average fracture apertures and distances between flowing fractures than there is to effective matrix diffusion coefficients reimus et al 2003 reimus et al 2011 this has the effect of reducing any concerns about which type of experiment yields more accurate effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates especially when they already appear to be in relatively good agreement regarding implications for tritiated water transport at the nnss the results of this study suggest that effective matrix diffusion coefficients in lava flow matrices with varying sizes of lithophysal cavities are quite similar despite significant differences in the permeabilities of the samples the implication is that the matrix in which the lithophysal cavities are embedded likely controls the effective matrix diffusion coefficients it seems logical that the differences in the measured permeabilities of the samples are probably the result of discrete flow pathways through the samples of narrow cross section relative to the sample cross section in such cases one would expect the bulk effective matrix diffusion coefficients to be more poorly correlated with sample permeabilities than in cases where the permeability reflects that of the entire matrix acknowledgements we would like to thank george perkins for the irms analysis of

1685,diffusion cell and diffusion wafer experiments were conducted to compare methods for estimating effective matrix diffusion coefficients in rock core samples from pahute mesa at the nevada nuclear security site nnss a diffusion wafer method in which a solute diffuses out of a rock matrix that is pre saturated with water containing the solute is presented as a simpler alternative to the traditional through diffusion diffusion cell method both methods yielded estimates of effective matrix diffusion coefficients that were within the range of values previously reported for nnss volcanic rocks the difference between the estimates of the two methods ranged from 14 to 30 and there was no systematic high or low bias of one method relative to the other from a transport modeling perspective these differences are relatively minor when one considers that other variables e g fracture apertures fracture spacings influence matrix diffusion to a greater degree and tend to have greater uncertainty than effective matrix diffusion coefficients for the same relative random errors in concentration measurements the diffusion cell method yields effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates that have less uncertainty than the wafer method however the wafer method is easier and less costly to implement and yields estimates more quickly thus allowing a greater number of samples to be analyzed for the same cost and time given the relatively good agreement between the methods and the lack of any apparent bias between the methods the diffusion wafer method appears to offer advantages over the diffusion cell method if better statistical representation of a given set of rock samples is desired 1 introduction transport of radionuclides and other contaminants in saturated fractured rock can be strongly affected by diffusive mass transfer between fractures and the surrounding rock matrix a process known as matrix diffusion grisak and pickens 1980 neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 małoszewski and zuber 1985 skagius and neretnieks 1986 liu et al 2004 matrix diffusion is typically associated with dual porosity systems in which flow is predominantly in fractures but there is a significant amount of non flowing or very slowly flowing porosity in the surrounding rock matrix that is in diffusive communication with the flowing fractures reimus and haga 1999 reimus et al 2002a this diffusive communication can result in significant retardation of both reactive and nonreactive solutes relative to groundwater travel times in the fractures for non reactive solutes the effective retardation factor can theoretically approach the ratio of total porosity to flowing porosity where the total porosity is the sum of the flowing porosity and the non flowing porosity that is in diffusive communication with the flowing porosity reimus et al 2011 bradbury and green 1985 reactive sorbing solutes will also experience this retardation but their retardation will be magnified by the increased sorptive surface area that they come into contact within the matrix relative to what they would have contacted if they were confined to the flowing fractures grisak and pickens 1980 robinson et al 2012 in addition to sorption reactive solute mobility will also be altered by chemical reaction with mineral surfaces in the matrix in particular studies at repository sites have shown fe and mn oxide coatings can catalyze the redox reactions or enhance dissociation of organically chelated contaminants thereby affecting their mobility zachara et al 1995 brooks et al 1996 for example even under reducing environments trace fe iii in minerals can lead to dissociation of co iii edta affecting its solubility jardine et al 2002 a large inventory of radionuclides is present underground at the nevada nuclear security site nnss as a result of underground nuclear testing from the 1950s until 1992 much of this inventory resides in saturated fractured volcanic tuff and lava flow aquifers that have high fracture permeabilities and subsequently relatively fast groundwater travel times from radionuclide source locations i e nuclear test cavities blankennagel and weir 1973 finnegan et al 2016 however the majority of the saturated porosity in these aquifers is in the relatively impermeable rock matrix drellack et al 1997 reimus et al 2002a 2002b so the aquifers represent classic dual porosity systems in which matrix diffusion is potentially an important radionuclide retardation mechanism tritiated water 3hho tends to dominate predicted offsite anthropogenic radioactivity in groundwater near the nnss because of its large inventory and the fact that most other radionuclides present in the aftermath of nuclear testing are either very low in solubility strongly retarded and attenuated by geochemical processes or present in such small amounts that they do not contribute much to potential radiological doses even if little credit is taken for retardation processes because matrix diffusion has a big potential impact on 3hho transport considerable work has been conducted to estimate effective matrix diffusion coefficients of non reactive solutes in nnss rocks reimus and haga 1999 reimus et al 2002a 2002b reimus et al 2007 although the ratio of total porosity to fracture porosity defines the upper limit of the retardation factor of a non reactive solute in a dual porosity system the effective matrix diffusion coefficient is needed to estimate diffusive mass transfer rates which affect both breakthrough times and peak concentrations reimus et al 2002b and thus contaminant boundary calculations which delineate the possible extent of radionuclide contaminated groundwater from underground nuclear testing the effective matrix diffusion coefficient is the product of the solute s free water diffusion coefficient and the matrix tortuosity and coefficients can be determined from either laboratory experiments numerical modeling and or field tests grisak and pickens 1980 callahan et al 2000 soler et al 2015 numerical modeling can fit tracer breakthrough curves to yield effective matrix diffusion coefficients but other processes such as kinetic sorption and variations in aquifer hydraulic conductivity also lead to similar effects as matrix diffusion i e retardation of contaminant migration and tailing on breakthrough curves which obfuscates modeling efforts carrera et al 1998 field tracer tests are useful for obtaining breakthrough curves and identifying governing chemical processes affecting transport but insofar as determining effective matrix diffusion coefficients this computed value is scale dependent and generally larger than core scale estimates shapiro 2001 zhou et al 2007 this discrepancy results from field test s ability to only yield estimates of a lumped mass transfer coefficient for matrix diffusion which also depends on porosity and fracture aperture not a direct matrix diffusion coefficient estimate reimus et al 2003 therefore unambiguous estimates of effective matrix diffusion coefficients are best determined in laboratory tests callahan et al 2000 reimus et al 2007 laboratory estimates of effective matrix diffusion coefficients are traditionally determined using a through diffusion method whereby a reservoir containing the tracer of interest is separated from a receiving reservoir by a rock sample of known thickness and cross sectional area and the concentration change of the receiving reservoir is monitored through time e g bradbury and green 1985 skagius and neretnieks 1986 reimus et al 2007 however this through diffusion method can be expensive time consuming and complex limiting the number of samples that can be analyzed another method involving the diffusion of a tracer out of a rock sample saturated with tracer solution into an initially tracer free reservoir in which the sample is immersed may provide a cheaper quicker and simpler alternative because this method does not require the use of a specialized diffusion cell and it permits diffusion from both sides of the rock core thus expediting the tracer breakthrough times reimus et al 2006 hershey and fereday 2016 this study compares the merits of these two methods 2 methods 2 1 sample descriptions rock core samples were obtained from corehole ue 20c located on pahute mesa at the nnss where previous studies have been conducted to evaluate radionuclide migration from underground nuclear tests reimus et al 2002a 2002b 2003 2007 liu et al 2004 robinson et al 2012 the selected core samples were visually inspected and subsampled to avoid fractures or major voids and cut into pieces of intact matrix material of constant thickness and cross sectional area fig 1 these samples represent different hydrostratigraphic units that have significant transmissivity within pahute mesa and for which effective matrix diffusion coefficient data were lacking before this study the benham aquifer cores represent variable sizes of lithophysal cavities within a similar matrix in this lava flow unit from depths of 1189 1189 25 1353 1353 28 and 1925 1 1925 3ft below ground surface bgs previous work demonstrated that lithophysal cavities are open to exchange with fracture networks and act to retard the flow of water through vertical fractures liu et al 2004 the lithophysal cavities in the benham aquifer samples are largely filled with poorly consolidated alteration minerals so they are not void spaces although they appear to be more porous and hence more accessible to diffusion than the surrounding lava matrix duplicate tiva canyon aquifer tca samples represent the moderate to densely welded tuff at 2131 3 2131 5ft bgs table 1 use of these duplicate samples located adjacent to each other in this core sample provides a measure of experimental reproducibility 2 2 porosity and permeability prior to diffusion testing the porosity of the rock core sections was measured by dividing the difference between their saturated and oven dry weights by the known sample volume assuming a water density of 1g cm3 each sample was then incorporated into a diffusion cell apparatus see section 2 3 1 and its permeability was measured using either the constant head method for the higher permeability benham aquifer lava flow samples or the falling head method for the lower permeability tiva canyon tuff samples freeze and cherry 1979 the constant and falling head methods provided hydraulic conductivity estimates from which permeability was determined according to 1 k k μ ρ g in which k is hydraulic conductivity μ is the dynamic viscosity of water ρ is density of water and g is acceleration due to gravity callahan et al 2000 2 3 experiment 1 diffusion cell diffusion through rock cores 2 3 1 assembly of diffusion cell apparatus details of the experimental methods are provided in callahan et al 2000 reimus et al 2002a 2002b and reimus et al 2007 briefly each rock core section was placed in a square mold into which room temperature vulcanization rtv silicone was poured until it covered the edges of the cores without spilling over onto the top surface after setting the silicone serves as a gasket material that can be easily sealed between two reservoirs a primer was used to achieve a good seal between the silicone and the periphery of each core wafer to ensure that diffusion was only through the rock matrix and not along the edges of the cores care was taken to ensure no silicone came in contact with either of the open faces of the rock los alamos municipal tap water was used in all experiments and was filter sterilized 0 2μm rock cores were saturated with filtered tap water under vacuum after flushing the vacuum chamber with co2 multiple times replacing atmospheric gas with co2 expedites water saturation as co2 dissolves much more readily in water than does air callahan et al 2000 reimus et al 2006 once there were no visible bubbles escaping the samples the samples were assumed to be saturated 1week samples were then immediately placed in between two reservoirs machined out of plexiglass which were rapidly secured with screws and filled with water to maintain saturation the large reservoir 800 1600ml capacity of the apparatus served as the injection reservoir for the tracer and the smaller reservoir 90 200ml capacity served as the collection reservoir to measure the tracer diffusion the apparatus was oriented horizontally and the water level on both sides of the reservoir was kept identical to eliminate the potential for advective flow fig 2 both reservoirs were kept well mixed using a magnetic stir bar reimus et al 2002a 2002b 2 3 2 tracer introduction sampling and measurements tritium was chosen as the nonsorbing solute with which to measure effective matrix diffusion coefficients the free water diffusion coefficient d of 3hho is 2 4 10 9 m2 s 1 kozaki et al 1999 reimus et al 2007 between 0 3 and 0 6ml of a stock solution of 3hho 2 550 581cpmml 1 was added to the large chamber of each cell to obtain an initial concentration ci of 1300cpmml 1 samples from both the large and small chambers were obtained daily thereafter approximately 0 5ml of water was sampled by syringe from the small chamber whereas 5ml of sample was extracted by syringe from the large chamber to maintain constant head levels on each side concentration changes in the large chambers were small relative to the starting concentrations so only the data from the small chambers were used to determine effective matrix diffusion coefficients 3hho activity was measured using a packard tri carb 2500 liquid scintillation counter the 0 5ml samples were diluted to 6ml with deionized water and then 14ml of ultima gold scintillation cocktail was added reimus et al 2002b standards prepared with different ratios of water to cocktail were used to obtain a quench curve to correct for variations in scintillation counting efficiencies of the samples caused by minor variations in water to cocktail ratios thomson 2001 2 3 3 calculation of matrix diffusion coefficients from diffusion cell method encapsulating the sides of the cores with silicone ensured that bulk diffusion occurred in the axial direction not radially reimus et al 2006 hershey and fereday 2016 therefore the effective matrix diffusion coefficients are determined by the 1 d diffusive transport equation 2 c t d m r m 2 c x 2 in which c is the tracer concentration cpm dm is the aqueous effective diffusion coefficient through the rock matrix cm2 sec 1

porosity and l is the rock core thickness cm in eqs 3 and 4 the minor decreases in volumes of the inlet and outlet reservoir associated with sampling are not considered eqs 2 4 were solved numerically using the diffcell computer code which employs an implicit finite difference method reimus et al 2002b the effective matrix diffusion coefficient dm is manually varied until the sum of squares of the differences between the modeled co t ci 0 and the experimental co t ci 0 is minimized where ci 0 is the initial concentration in the large reservoir 2 4 experiment 2 diffusion wafers diffusion out of rock wafer 2 4 1 assembly of diffusion wafers the same rock cores from the diffusion cell experiments were used in the subsequent diffusion wafer experiments upon completion of the tritium breakthrough experiments through diffusion the diffusion cells were taken apart and the rocks dried for several days in an oven 105 c to ensure complete dryness the sides of the rocks were then resealed with silicone to prevent contact between the sides of the rock and the water the water used to saturate the samples was spiked with deuterium 6600 rather than tritium to avoid a radiological hazard during the vacuum saturation process see section 2 3 1 which is prone to splashing and spillage the large chambers from the diffusion cell apparatus were used as cylindrical containers for the diffusion wafer experiments and the small chambers were placed on top as a lid to minimize evaporation each sample was placed in a separate container and completely immersed in filtered tap water the rock cores were suspended above the bottom of the containers by placing them on inverted perforated septum caps that were made of very thin aluminum so that there was negligible contact area between the septum caps and the cores in addition to providing unhindered diffusion access to the bottom surface of the rocks the caps created space for magnetic stir bars below the cores fig 2 reimus et al 2006 hershey and fereday 2016 the containers were placed alongside open beakers of water inside larger plastic storage bins that were kept closed except during sampling as a further measure to minimize evaporation fig 2 2 4 2 tracer sampling and measurement samples of the tap water surrounding the cores were taken daily for the first 2weeks and periodically thereafter approximately 2ml of the tap water was collected for each sample deuterium samples were analyzed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms on a gv instruments eurovector elemental analyzer results are reported in δ notation as the per mil deviation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow δd values were calibrated using in house standards calibrated to iaea international atomic energy agency standards vsmow slap standard light antarctic precipitation and gisp greenland ice sheet precipitation and although enriched samples fell outside the range of commercially available standards a check standard prepared at 10 000 yielded results within 1 of its calculated value 2 4 3 calculation of matrix diffusion coefficients from wafer diffusion method effective matrix diffusion coefficients were again calculated using eq 2 with the following boundary conditions 5 dc i dx 0 at x 0 core midpoint 6 v res dc res dt φ 2 a w d m c x at x 0 5 t w in which ci is the concentration of the tracer in the core

difference technique coded in fortran reimus et al 2006 hershey and fereday 2016 was used to obtain a solution that was fitted to the data the effective matrix diffusion coefficient dm was varied until the modeled breakthrough curve matched the experimental breakthrough curve hershey and fereday 2016 for this method it is important to interrogate the entire breakthrough curve as breakthrough occurs more quickly than in the diffusion cell method and initial breakthrough may reflect only the surficial properties of the sample 3 results 3 1 porosities and permeabilities the measured matrix porosities and permeabilities of the 5 core samples are listed in table 1 although the porosity of the tca welded tuff is slightly greater than that of the lava samples the permeability of the tuff is 1 to 3 orders of magnitude less than that of the ba lava flow rocks containing lithophysal cavities these measurements suggest that the lithophysal cavities tend to provide conduits for flow in the lava samples the permeability however does not increase linearly as a function of lithophysal enrichment table 1 during the saturation process it became apparent that there was a dominant discrete flow pathway in sample ue 20c 1189 1189 25 that probably corresponded to a partially filled cavity that extended over most of the sample thickness consequently the larger k value of sample ue 20c 1189 1189 25 relative to sample ue 20c 1353 1353 28 which had a higher density of lithophysal cavities may reflect this single dominant feature it was also noted that the cavities in sample ue 20c 1189 1189 25 though less numerous tended to have more void space than those of sample ue 20c 1353 1353 28 which probably also influenced the permeabilities of the samples relative to each other 3 2 matrix diffusion coefficients the effective matrix diffusion coefficients determined by fitting the data generated with the 2 experimental methods are shown in table 2 and plots comparing the model matches to the data sets are shown in fig 3 in this figure concentrations are expressed as the concentration in the sampled reservoir divided by the initial concentration in either the source reservoir diffusion cells or the rock core diffusion wafer it is apparent in fig 3 that the data sets are matched quite well by the respective models and the goodness of fit of the models are acceptable the diffusion wafer experiments were clearly conducted longer than necessary in most cases as the effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates are determined primarily with data collected during the time period of increasing concentrations not after the breakthrough curves reach their final plateaus which are equal to the ratio of pore volume in the rock to the sum of the rock pore volume and the reservoir volume complete breakthrough occurred in the diffusion wafers in less than 1000h whereas the breakthrough curve had not plateaued after 1500h in the diffusion cell experiments note that the diffusion wafer plots of fig 3 are shown with a log time scale to emphasize the early breakthrough times of the experiments which dictate the effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates deviations from concentration plateaus at later times in some of the diffusion wafer experiments were caused by cumulative errors in making corrections for extracted sample volumes in the case of the diffusion wafer experiment for the sample from 1925ft ue 20c 1925 1 1925 3 the discontinuities at later times were caused by two additions of tap water to the reservoir necessitated by a leak as table 2 shows the differences between the estimated effective matrix diffusion coefficients from the two methods were always within 30 of the diffusion cell estimate there appeared to be no systematic high or low bias of one method relative to the other the diffusion cell method yielded greater effective matrix diffusion coefficients for the duplicate tuff samples and one of the lava samples whereas the diffusion wafer method yielded larger effective matrix diffusion coefficients for two of the lava samples table 2 however the results suggest that when matrix permeabilities are high there may be a tendency to obtain smaller estimates from the diffusion cell experiments more specifically the two rocks with the highest permeability i e ue 20c 1189 1189 25 ue 20c 1353 1353 28 yielded smaller estimates of dm from the diffusion cell method as compared to the diffusion wafer method and the sample with the highest permeability i e ue 20c 1189 1189 25 yielded the smallest estimate of dm applying the diffusion cell method of course the limited sample size of this study does not permit definitive conclusions on such trends the duplicate samples ue 20c 2131 3 2131 5a and b of different thickness show excellent agreement within 5 for a given method table 2 although the error between the two methods for the same samples was about 15 to put the effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates of this study into a broader perspective it is useful to compare them to the data set of reimus et al 2007 who reported diffusion coefficients measured by the diffusion cell method for 46 different rock samples from the nnss representing a wide range of volcanic rock lithologies but excluding the current samples the estimates for halides and 3hho collectively spanned nearly 2 orders of magnitude from 0 09 10 6 to 6 2 10 6 cm2 s which is much larger than the range of values reported in this study fig 4 shows the values of log effective matrix diffusion coefficients divided by free water diffusion coefficients log dm d of the 46 data points from reimus et al 2007 plotted against log dm d values predicted by a multiple linear regression fit to the data reimus et al 2007 7 log d m d 1 42 1 91 φ 0 19 log k where φ is matrix porosity and k is permeability the squared correlation coefficient for this previously established relationship is 0 542 indicating a moderate positive correlation reimus et al 2007 the effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates from this study are included in fig 4 and it is apparent that they fall within the scatter of the values predicted by eq 7 which suggests that the new values would not have significantly altered eq 7 if they had been considered in the multiple linear regression however the data from this study deviate from the positive linear trend of the previous data and display a nearly horizontal trend this deviation arises from the much larger range in permeability values as compared to the range in both the porosity and the effective matrix diffusion coefficient for this new set of samples the permeabilities of the samples in this study range between 3 95 10 14 and 1 5 10 17 m2 whereas the computed effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates are within the same order of magnitude and the porosities only vary between 0 13 and 0 18 thus the variation in the predicted effective matrix diffusion coefficient value from eq 7 is predominantly dependent on permeability which has a much greater variation than the computed effective matrix diffusion coefficients fig 4 additionally the sample with the highest permeability extends beyond the permeability range of all other samples suggesting that the previous set of samples may not have captured all the possible ranges in permeability in nnss rocks this may be because the permeability of this sample was dominated by a single high permeability channel that became apparent when the sample was saturated whereas in the other rocks the permeabilities appeared to be more uniformly distributed over the cross sectional areas of the samples it stands to reason that the diffusion behavior of a sample may not follow an established permeability trend if the permeability is dominated by a unique feature that is not representative of the bulk matrix as appeared to be the case for the sample with the highest permeability thus rocks with lithophysal cavities may not be expected to exhibit as positive of a correlation between effective matrix diffusion coefficients and matrix permeability as rocks with more homogeneous matrices however it may also be that the sample thickness in this study was too small relative to the size of the cavities to exhibit any sort of a correlation such a relationship might emerge if all samples had thicknesses that were large relative to the largest features in the matrices the fact that the effective matrix diffusion coefficients of the three lava samples were all quite similar to each other and to the tuff samples despite their large contrast in permeabilities suggests that the effective matrix diffusion coefficients may have been controlled by the properties of the lava matrix in the samples which appeared to be quite similar in all lava samples whereas the permeability was likely controlled by the widely varying sizes and interconnectedness of the lithophysal cavities 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of method uncertainty because the true values of the effective matrix diffusion coefficients of the samples are unknown it is not possible to determine which experimental method offered the more accurate estimates of effective matrix diffusion coefficients the fact that the estimates were higher for 3 of 5 samples by the diffusion cell method and higher for the other 2 samples by the diffusion wafer method indicates that there is no systematic high or low bias of one method relative to the other however as noted previously the data suggest that diffusion cell estimates may tend to be lower than diffusion wafer estimates when matrix permeabilities are high evaluating the precision of the two methods in this study is complicated by the fact that tritiated and deuterated water were used in the two different types of respective experiments different analytical methods that have significantly different measurement errors were used to analyze for these isotopes the percent standard deviation of the deuterium analysis was less than 1 whereas the tricarb does not report a similar quantification of error for each measurement of tritium if sample size is a concern however the tritium analysis requires less sample volume than the deuterium analysis 0 5ml vs 2 0ml the use of deuterium offers clear advantages over tritium with regards to number of laboratory safety precautions required because of its radioactivity the initial concentration of tritium in the diffusion cell experiments was much closer to its analytical detection limit than the initial concentration of deuterium in the wafer experiments consequently there was inherently more scatter in the diffusion cell data than the diffusion wafer data for these reasons no attempt was made to determine and compare confidence intervals of the two sets of effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates instead the precision uncertainties associated with the two methods were qualitatively compared using a monte carlo type method to simulate the data scatter that would have occurred if normally distributed concentration measurement errors with the same relative standard deviation applied to both types of experiments the norminv function in excel was used for the rock samples with the fastest and slowest changes in concentrations samples ue 20c 2131 3 2131 5a tca and ue 20c 1189 1189 25 ba respectively to generate synthetic data sets that had the best fitting curve as the mean and a standard deviation equal to 5 of the mean at regularly spaced times throughout the test figs 5 and 6 the rand function which generates uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 1 served as the probability input value for the norminv function to ensure that the synthetic data were normally distributed about the best fitting curve in figs 5 and 6 10 normally distributed points are plotted at each selected sampling time along with the best fitting curve and curves corresponding to effective matrix diffusion coefficients equal to 10 of the best fitting effective matrix diffusion coefficients in figs 5 and 6 it is qualitatively apparent that a 5 relative standard deviation results in more of the synthetic data points falling outside the bands defined by the 10 curves in the case of the diffusion wafers than in the case of the diffusion cells the implication is that for the same relative random experimental errors there will be greater uncertainty in estimating effective matrix diffusion coefficients from diffusion wafer experiments than diffusion cell experiments thus if the two different types of experiments were conducted in ways that result in the same relative random experimental errors diffusion cell experiments can be expected to yield effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates that have less uncertainty the greater uncertainty for the diffusion wafer method is a consequence of the much lower sensitivity of the observed tracer concentrations to the effective matrix diffusion coefficient when tracer is diffusing out of a rock core that is initially saturated with tracer than when tracer is diffusing completely through an initially tracer free rock core we again emphasize that no attempt was made in this study to assess and compare either the randomness or the relative magnitudes of the errors in the two different types of experiments because the different tracers and different analytical methods would have biased such a comparison 4 2 comparison of method practicality the diffusion wafer method appears to offer clear advantages over the diffusion cell method from the perspective of experimental apparatus simplicity experimental setup for the diffusion wafer method requires simply to prepare samples of constant thickness and cross sectional area and then to seal the peripheral surface area with a silicone gel or other sealant to ensure diffusional access only to the two ends of the sample having the same cross sectional area these samples are then saturated with a tracer submersed into a stirred vessel with tracer free water without blocking the open surfaces and then periodically sampled the diffusion cell method requires essentially the same rock preparation steps plus incorporation of the sample into a barrier that will separate high and low concentration reservoirs which increases the chances of compromising the sample relative to simply coating the periphery with a sealant the diffusion cell apparatus must also be specially constructed and its greater complexity relative to a simple beaker type reservoir creates a greater potential for leaks additionally both reservoirs of the diffusion cell must be sampled to maintain a constant head on both sides and prevent a hydraulic gradient that drives advective flow that could overwhelm diffusive flux kirino et al 2009 demonstrated a positive correlation between estimated effective matrix diffusion coefficients and solution density indicating that even with initially equal head levels density driven advective flow in the diffusion cell method can lead to overestimation of the effective matrix diffusion coefficients and may require additional correction it is also possible for the diffusion wafer method to be affected by advective flow if the water initially saturated into the sample is denser than the reservoir water for both methods the effects of advective flow will be exaggerated in more permeable rock samples theoretically the diffusion wafer experiment should produce tracer breakthrough 4 times faster than the diffusion cell method because the diffusion distance through the rock core is half that of the cell and diffusion times scale with distance squared eqs 4 and 6 in the experiments of this study the time needed for complete tracer breakthrough of a given sample appeared to be somewhat less than a factor of 4 between the two types of experiments in the diffusion wafer experiments the tracer appears almost immediately in the stirred vessel whereas there is always a time delay in observing tracer in the low concentration reservoir of a diffusion cell fig 3 it is important to note however that the early initial breakthrough in a diffusion wafer may only reflect the properties of the outer edges of the rock sample and it can also be sensitive to how thoroughly the rock surfaces are dried off before being immersed so a full assessment of the breakthrough curve 500 1000h for these samples is necessary to calculate an accurate effective matrix diffusion coefficient 5 conclusions based on the results of this study we conclude that there is no obvious advantage in using the more widely accepted diffusion cell method over the much simpler diffusion wafer method for estimating effective matrix diffusion coefficients in rock samples the differences in the estimates provided by the two methods on the same rock samples are within about 30 and considering that neither method produced estimates of effective matrix diffusion coefficients that were either consistently higher or lower than the other both methods should provide equally acceptable estimates for use in transport models although a larger sample size with a greater range of permeabilities lithologies cementation and mineral bedding is necessary to confirm this position this is particularly true when one considers that the internal variability of a lithologic unit s rock properties is often greater than 30 furthermore when one considers that for a given time and cost more diffusion wafer experiments can be conducted than diffusion cell experiments the diffusion wafer method offers the advantage that it can provide better statistical representation of a given type of rock to better address variability resulting from rock heterogeneity it should also be noted that when accounting for the effects of matrix diffusion in fractured rocks in contaminant transport models there is generally greater sensitivity to and greater uncertainty in average fracture apertures and distances between flowing fractures than there is to effective matrix diffusion coefficients reimus et al 2003 reimus et al 2011 this has the effect of reducing any concerns about which type of experiment yields more accurate effective matrix diffusion coefficient estimates especially when they already appear to be in relatively good agreement regarding implications for tritiated water transport at the nnss the results of this study suggest that effective matrix diffusion coefficients in lava flow matrices with varying sizes of lithophysal cavities are quite similar despite significant differences in the permeabilities of the samples the implication is that the matrix in which the lithophysal cavities are embedded likely controls the effective matrix diffusion coefficients it seems logical that the differences in the measured permeabilities of the samples are probably the result of discrete flow pathways through the samples of narrow cross section relative to the sample cross section in such cases one would expect the bulk effective matrix diffusion coefficients to be more poorly correlated with sample permeabilities than in cases where the permeability reflects that of the entire matrix acknowledgements we would like to thank george perkins for the irms analysis of

stabilizing agents that enhance repulsion between ag np particles as well as between ag np and porous media surface resulting in greater mobility of ag np in addition ag np transport depends on grain and pore size of the porous media and fluid flow velocities liang et al 2013a sagee et al 2012 neukum et al 2014a taghavy et al 2013 at conditions unfavorable for ag np attachment physicochemical filtration is controlled by heterogeneity of the collector surface with local favorable attachment sites lin et al 2011 transport of ag np in natural porous media is associated with blocking of

is associated with positively charged crystal edges cornelis et al 2013 colloid facilitated transport of ag np is reported for natural loamy sand due to cation exchange and subsequent release of clay minerals liang et al 2013b and partially fractured sandstone neukum et al 2014b unsaturated flow conditions influencing particle interaction at biogeochemical interfaces kumahor et al 2016 only a few studies on ag np transport in consolidated rocks are published to date neukum et al 2014a studied ag np transport in three different unfractured sandstones the same sandstone types are used in experiments under partially fractured conditions neukum et al 2014b physicochemical filtration straining time depending blocking of attachment sites and colloid facilitated transport were identified as major transport processes of ag np mobility physicochemical filtration depends on solute chemistry mineralogy pore size distribution and probably on physical and chemical heterogeneity of the ag np rock system ag np mobility in unfractured sandstone matrix reduces with decreasing mean pore size decreasing hydraulic conductivity and the presence of metal oxides hydroxides partial fracturing of the sandstone matrix increases ag np mobility due to larger void space and higher hydraulic conductivity residence time of colloids in parallel plate fractures compared to solute resident time depends on the ratio of colloid radius and aperture width of the parallel plate fracture the velocity distribution assumption size exclusion states that colloid retention time decreases with increasing ratio of colloid radius and fracture aperture zheng et al 2009 colloids are known to diffuse hardly into rock matrix due to their size in a sensitivity analysis related to the colloidal matrix diffusion in discretely fractured porous media the upper boundary of the colloid size that can diffuse into the matrix is 1 0μm oswald and ibaraki 2001 under unfavorable electrostatic conditions gold latex and smectite colloids travel as fast as or faster than water in an artificially fractured crystalline rock colloid size mean water velocity and fracture aperture are identified to control the transport velocity of colloids albarran et al 2013 colloid mobility in fractures is influenced by colloid size and surface roughness variations large colloids 1000nm undergo sedimentation in stop flow mode and collector interaction is not affected by surface roughness variations for small colloids 25nm sedimentation is not an important process but surface inhomogeneity triggers collector interactions stoll et al 2016 kim et al 2015 investigated latex colloid transport in fractured media and concluded that mobility of these colloids are mainly influenced by filtration than by colloid velocity transport of ag np in three different single fractured sandstones is investigated in column experiments where different fluid chemistries are applied transport in unfractured and partially fractured sandstone depends among others on solute chemistry and time dependent attachment is identified as one major transport process these processes are investigated in this study with single fractured sandstones using the same types of sandstone as in our former experiments neukum et al 2014a neukum et al 2014b to assure comparability in terms of mineralogy and matrix pore size distribution ag np concentration and size are analyzed by flow field flow fractionation we identify the main transport processes of ag np in fractured sandstones based on our experimental results and discuss the environmental implications of these results to ag np mobility in fractured groundwater resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock characteristics three different sandstone types are used in this study the pliocene herzogenrather s4 the cretaceous berrias obernkirchner s14 and the triassic solling s10 sandstones s14 and s10 represent important fractured aquifers which are used for water supply in germany all of the sandstone types have been already tested for ag np transport through the rock matrix and partially fractured systems neukum et al 2014a 2014b the sandstones differ in mineralogy and pore size distribution detailed information is published elsewhere fitzner and kownatzki 1991 neukum et al 2014a the main characteristics are briefly summarized in table 1 2 2 sample preparation and transport experiments cylindrical samples of 10cm length and 5cm diameter are cut along the major axis in the centre of the column into two pieces to create a single fracture system the fracture walls are polished with a carbide abradant with subsequent sonication to clean the surfaces and the adjacent pores from saw residues both pieces are packed in a triaxial flow cell equipped with filter material poroplast type 162 durst filtertechnik germany on top and bottom of the rock samples in order to get uniform fluid flow over the entire cross section of the samples fig 1 a latex rubber sleeve of 5cm diameter separates the surrounding water pressure from the rock samples the samples are hydraulically characterized by flow measurements at defined boundary conditions in up flow mode a non reactive tracer experiment is conducted prior to the ag np transport experiments in each rock sample by injecting a solute concentration of 5gl 1 sodium nitrate for 90min the samples are subsequently flushed using deionized water until steady state solute concentration is achieved corresponding to an electrical conductivity of the fluid to less than 100μscm 1 a constant flow rate is established using a high pressure multichannel dispenser icp ismatec germany the breakthrough curves gained with the solute tracer experiments are inversely fitted using the analytical advection

the rock samples was conditioned to the desired electrolyte solution three different solutions were used deionized water 1mm and 10mm sodium nitrate the applied ag np concentration and flow rate were kept constant for all experiments at 0 16mgml 1 and 1mlmin 1 respectively ag np suspensions are injected into the samples for 90min and the rock samples are subsequently flushed for another 140min with particle free electrolyte solution the pore fluids and rock samples are conditioned between individual experiments to the specific solute concentrations of the following experiment the effluent is analyzed for mobilized ag np due to changes in fluid chemistry which results in insignificant ag np release during flushing the experimental conditions are summarized in table 2 the experimental setup pressure cell with all equipment and filter plates without rock sample is tested for ag np transport in three individual experiments 2 3 ag np characterization determination of ag np concentration and size ag pure w10 ras materials germany is used for the transport experiments the ag np suspensions for each experiment are freshly prepared by dilution of the stock suspension 120mgml 1 into the desired electrolyte solution and then sonicated for 5min in a sonication bath agpure corresponds to the official oecd standard material nm 300 silver its physical properties have been characterized by several independent european laboratories transmission electron microscopy measurements show that 99 of the ag np are smaller than 20nm klein et al 2011 the hydrodynamic radius is approximately 50nm klein et al 2011 neukum et al 2014a the ag np are stabilized by polyoxyethylene glycerol triolate and polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan mono laurat 4 w w each and the unbounded surfactant is around 5 in the stock suspension liang et al 2013a high stability of the suspension even at high ionic strength due to steric stabilization is reported in liang et al 2013a and neukum et al 2014a neukum et al 2014b the zeta potential of the ag np suspension is negative for the experimental conditions at ph 6 7 6 with 9mv for deionized water and 7mv for 10mm sodium nitrate neukum et al 2014a unfavorable conditions are predicted for ag np retention and aggregation in analogy with other studies using the same ag np product liang et al 2013a liang et al 2013b braun et al 2015 and the same types of sandstones neukum et al 2014a 2014b ag np concentrations and size in the effluent are determined by asymmetric flow field flow fractionation af4 analysis on an af2000 mt model coupled with a uv vis detector and a multiangle laser light scattering detector malls postnova analytics gmbh landsberg lech germany the analytical method is described in neukum et al 2014a 2014b ag np retention profiles in the rock samples could not be measured due to the lack of appropriate non destructive methods application of excavation methods in combination with chemical digestion usually used with soil samples e g liang et al 2013a is not appropriate since cutting of consolidated rock samples would be required but the related loss of ag np is not quantifiable 3 results 3 1 hydraulic characterization of the rock samples reynolds numbers varies between 0 31 and 0 34 for all experiments indicating laminar flow in the single fractures aperture width of the fractures vary between 13 and 31μm details of the hydraulic characterization of the fractured sandstone samples under the applied experimental settings are given in table 2 the results of the non reactive solute experiments show the importance of matrix flow on the effluent breakthrough curves solute breakthrough in s4 samples is slower compared to the solute breakthrough in s10 and s14 samples this is due to the relatively large matrix void space and high hydraulic conductivity and the related solute amount flowing through the matrix of s4 samples in contrast almost all solute is transported via the single fracture in samples s10 and s14 at s4 samples matrix flow and storage is more important and consequently the breakthrough is less steep and the maximum concentration is lower the falling limb in samples s4 takes generally longer to reach the fluid background concentration indicating the significant amount of solute transported through the comparably high permeable rock matrix average recovery in ag np transport through the experimental setup without a rock sample is 97 in the effluent indicating largely conservative ag np transport through the pressure cell and filter plates 3 2 ag np transport table 3 summarizes the fractured rock experimental program and includes the ag np recoveries 3 3 ag np transport in s4 samples the results of the ag np transport experiments through the single fracture of sample s4 1 show a considerable dependency on the quantity of experiments the ag np recovery increases from 38 at the first run deionized water to above 80 at the third run 10mm nano3 the effluent breakthrough curves reveal ag np attachment in the first three experiments fig 2 only experiments five and six show almost conservative transport and slightly higher ag np transport velocities compared to the reference solute the recovery of the experiment with higher electrolyte concentration is marginally lower the experiments on sample s4 2 were conducted without filter material in order to test the results gained from the blank experiments concerning ag np filtration within the experimental setup due to the missing filter material some space between the specimen mount and the rock sample was left in the experimental setup the related time shift in the breakthrough curve was corrected using the filter plate volume and the measured flow rate the experiments show on the one hand a comparatively high recovery rate to be occurring already in the initial experiment 82 and on the other hand a lower recovery with increasing electrolyte concentration the first two experiments show reactive transport which is indicated by the breakthrough curves fig 3 and the lower ag np recovery subsequent experiments on sample s4 2 are largely conservative the recovery is considerably higher compared to those of sample s4 1 and the ag np transport velocity is slightly higher in the last two experiments compared to the first two the higher electrolyte concentration of the final experiment results in a slightly lower recovery no hint of ag np attachment on sample s4 2 fracture walls is visible the shape of the breakthrough curve is influenced by the slightly higher volume of the experimental setup due to the missing filter plates that results in a slower solute and ag np transport compared to s4 1 for the same flow rate and ag np concentration the small peak in the breakthrough curve results from the difference in the flow system due to the missing filter plate 3 4 ag np transport samples s10 3 and s10 4 the experiments with sample s10 3 show a high dependency of ag np recovery on the number of experiments mass of injected ag np only the third and fourth experiment are show conservative transport fig 4 here also the effect of electrolyte concentration as in samples s4 1 and s4 2 can be observed higher electrolyte concentrations lead to slightly lower ag np recovery in the effluent due to reduces repulsive forces according the dlvo theory the experiments on sample s10 4 do not show the effect of initial deposition of ag np as discussed above the first experiment is in equilibrium while the higher electrolyte concentration during the second run results in a slightly lower recovery this effect is verified by repeated runs with 1mm nano3 in the following experiments recovery increases continuously in spite of a comparably high electrolyte concentration fig 5 the third repetition with 10mm nano3 experiment 6 10mm nano3 3 is especially remarkable because the breakthrough is faster than the solute breakthrough 3 5 ag np transport samples s14 1 and s14 3 the experiments with the two obernkirchner sandstone samples s14 show very different results while for sample s14 1 all single experiments elute similarly under conservative transport conditions fig 6a sample s14 3 has a clearly differentiated transport behavior the first experiment at s14 3 1mm nano3 indicates high particle retention fig 6b also the second experiment with 10mm nano3 10mm nano3 2 shows ag np attachment during transport it is only transport at the third experiment that becomes almost conservative the following experiments with increased electrolyte concentration indicate transport with ag np attachment because recovery rates decrease slightly despite the high ag np recovery in the experiments without rock samples attachment of ag np in the filter plates occurred in experiments s4 1 s10 3 and s14 3 table 4 total recovery in the effluent of those experiments is generally lower compared to the experiments where this effect was not observed only in experiment s4 1 attachment on the fracture surface is visible with the naked eye combined sem and edx analyses confirm the ag np attachment on the fracture surface in s4 1 fig 7 and its heterogeneous distribution the influence of the filter plates on the ag np transport is therefore not quantifiable but effect of ag np filter plate interaction on ag np breakthrough at the samples effluent can be expected for future experiments other materials should be tested to avoid this effects on ag np transport 4 discussion and conclusion the experimental results of ag np transport through single artificial fractures in sandstones show differences mainly related to ag np recovery and mobility compared to the results gained with unfractured porous sandstone matrix and partially fractured sandstones neukum et al 2014a 2014b however they are comparable concerning two main aspects recovery of ag np in the effluent increases with numbers of experiment which is related to the limited number of deposition sites particle deposition on the rock surface is heterogeneously distributed the main conclusions for ag np transport through singled fractured sandstones are porosity and permeability of the rock matrix have an important effect on ag np transport the higher the matrix porosity and permeability the higher is the relative amount of fluid and ag np transported through the rock matrix this is obvious comparing experimental results from s4 with those of s10 and s14 filtration of ag np in unfractured sandstone might be expected to be higher than for single fractured samples however differences in ag np attachment in sandstone matrix can be quite remarkable due to material heterogeneities neukum et al 2014a the influence of ionic strength on ag np transport is obvious for samples s4 2 s10 3 and s10 4 where higher ionic strength results in higher attachment in samples where matrix flow and ag np transport is less pronounced e g s10 4 and s14 1 the impact of ionic strength is less important and decreases with the amount of applied ag np in general attachment due to ionic strength is less significant than blocking of attachment sites which changes the transport behavior of ag np towards less reactive transport the influence of applied ag np mass on transport is pronounced in particular for those samples with high matrix porosity and for experiments with comparably high retention of ag np in the filter plates quantification of time depending blocking of attachment sites is therefore difficult however the results of sample s4 2 where no filter plates were used and the results of samples s10 4 and s14 1 where no visible attachment of ag np in the filter plates could be observed indicate time depending blocking of attachment sites in the samples with low matrix porosity this effect is clearly subordinate the fracture surfaces of s4 1 have considerable amounts of attached ag np after the final experiment which are heterogeneously distributed heterogeneity of ag np attachment is documented for experiments in undisturbed sandstones neukum et al 2014a and partially fractured sandstones neukum et al 2014b for some experiments of samples s4 1 s4 2 and s14 1 ag np velocity at the beginning of the breakthrough is higher than solute velocity this effect appears only in cases where previous ag np injections have been undertaken on the column and hence charge exclusion involving retained nanoparticles is a possible explanation overall ag np transport in fractured sandstone columns is more rapid and less subject to attachment than in intact sandstone matrix and partially fractured sandstones for instance the sum of recovery at experiments with fractured sample s10 4 are all above 90 but neglectable for partially fractured and unfractured samples neukum et al 2014a 2014b consequently environmental impact can be assumed to be more pronounced compared to partially fractured sandstones ag np transport is also controlled by the characteristics of matrix porosity time depending blocking of attachment sites and solute chemistry ag np attachment is heterogeneously distributed on fracture surfaces further experiments on larger samples are necessary to gain more information on impact of rock and fracture heterogeneity as well as flow regime on ag np transport in order to assess the potential risk of groundwater

show that transport of enp in natural porous media is much more complex than in idealized systems due to heterogeneity of porous media surface and cation exchange processes several investigations under idealized experimental conditions have shown the sensitivity of ag np transport to physicochemical parameters promoting aggregation and deposition processes due to the compression of the electrostatic double layer and decrease of repulsive interaction liang et al 2013a lin et al 2011 thio et al 2012 the relevance of physicochemical properties may be masked by the presence of stabilizing agents that enhance repulsion between ag np particles as well as between ag np and porous media surface resulting in greater mobility of ag np in addition ag np transport depends on grain

as major transport processes of ag np mobility physicochemical filtration depends on solute chemistry mineralogy pore size distribution and probably on physical and chemical heterogeneity of the ag np rock system ag np mobility in unfractured sandstone matrix reduces with decreasing mean pore size decreasing hydraulic conductivity and the presence of metal oxides hydroxides partial fracturing of the sandstone matrix increases ag np mobility due to larger void space and higher hydraulic conductivity residence time of colloids in parallel plate fractures compared to solute resident time depends on the ratio of colloid radius and aperture width of the parallel plate fracture the velocity distribution assumption size exclusion states that colloid retention time decreases with increasing ratio

show the importance of matrix flow on the effluent breakthrough curves solute breakthrough in s4 samples is slower compared to the solute breakthrough in s10 and s14 samples this is due to the

concentration as in samples s4 1 and s4 2 can be observed higher electrolyte concentrations lead to slightly lower ag np recovery in the effluent due to reduces repulsive forces according the dlvo theory the experiments on sample s10 4 do not show the effect of initial deposition of ag np as discussed above the first experiment is in equilibrium while the higher electrolyte concentration during the second run results in a slightly lower recovery this effect is verified by repeated runs with 1mm nano3 in the following experiments recovery increases continuously in spite of a comparably high electrolyte concentration fig 5 the third repetition with 10mm nano3 experiment 6 10mm nano3 3 is especially remarkable because the breakthrough is faster than the solute breakthrough 3 5 ag np transport samples s14 1 and s14 3 the experiments with the two obernkirchner sandstone samples s14 show very different results while for sample s14 1 all single experiments elute similarly under conservative transport conditions fig 6a sample s14 3 has a clearly differentiated transport behavior the first experiment at s14 3 1mm nano3 indicates high particle retention fig 6b also the second experiment with 10mm nano3 10mm nano3 2 shows ag np attachment during transport it is only transport at the third experiment that becomes almost conservative the following experiments with increased electrolyte concentration indicate transport with ag np attachment because recovery rates decrease slightly despite the high ag np recovery in the experiments without rock samples attachment of ag np in the filter plates occurred in experiments s4 1 s10 3 and s14 3 table 4 total recovery in the effluent of those experiments is generally lower compared to the experiments where this effect was not observed only in experiment s4 1 attachment on the fracture surface is visible with the naked eye combined sem and edx analyses confirm the ag np attachment on the fracture surface in s4 1 fig 7 and its heterogeneous distribution the influence of the filter plates on the ag np transport is therefore not quantifiable but effect of ag np filter plate interaction on ag np breakthrough at the samples effluent can be expected for future experiments other materials should be tested to avoid this effects on ag np transport 4 discussion and conclusion the experimental results of ag np transport through single artificial fractures in sandstones show differences mainly related to ag np recovery and mobility compared to the results gained with unfractured porous sandstone matrix and partially fractured sandstones neukum et al 2014a 2014b however they are comparable concerning two main aspects recovery of ag np in the effluent increases with numbers of experiment which is related to the limited number of deposition sites particle deposition on the rock surface is heterogeneously distributed the main conclusions for ag np transport through singled fractured sandstones are porosity and permeability of the rock matrix have an important effect on ag np transport the higher the matrix porosity and permeability the higher is the relative amount of fluid and ag np transported through the rock matrix this is obvious comparing experimental results from s4 with those of s10 and s14 filtration of ag np in unfractured sandstone might be expected to be higher than for single fractured samples however differences in ag np attachment in sandstone matrix can be quite remarkable due to material heterogeneities neukum et al 2014a the influence of ionic strength on ag np transport is obvious for samples s4 2 s10 3 and s10 4 where higher ionic strength results in higher attachment in samples where matrix flow and ag np transport is less pronounced e g s10 4 and s14 1 the impact of ionic strength is less important and decreases with the amount of applied ag np in general attachment due to ionic strength is less significant than blocking of attachment sites which changes the transport behavior of ag np towards less reactive transport the influence of applied ag np mass on transport is pronounced in particular for those samples with high matrix porosity and for experiments with comparably high retention of ag np in the filter plates quantification of time depending blocking of attachment sites is therefore difficult however the results of sample s4 2 where no filter plates were used and the results of samples s10 4 and s14 1 where no visible attachment of ag np in the filter plates could be observed indicate time depending blocking of attachment sites in the samples with low matrix porosity this effect is clearly subordinate the fracture surfaces of s4 1 have considerable amounts of attached ag np after the final experiment which are heterogeneously distributed heterogeneity of ag np attachment is documented for experiments in undisturbed sandstones neukum et al 2014a and partially fractured sandstones neukum et al 2014b for some experiments of samples s4 1 s4 2 and s14 1 ag np velocity at the beginning of the breakthrough is higher than solute velocity this effect appears only in cases where previous ag np injections have been undertaken on the column and hence charge exclusion involving retained nanoparticles is a possible explanation overall ag np transport in fractured sandstone columns is more rapid and less subject to attachment than in intact sandstone matrix and partially fractured sandstones for instance the sum of recovery at experiments with fractured sample s10 4 are all above 90 but neglectable for partially fractured and unfractured samples neukum et al 2014a 2014b consequently environmental impact can be assumed to be more pronounced compared to partially fractured sandstones ag np transport is also controlled by the characteristics of matrix porosity time depending blocking of attachment sites and solute chemistry ag np attachment is heterogeneously distributed on fracture surfaces further experiments on larger samples are necessary to gain more information on impact of rock and fracture heterogeneity as well as flow regime on ag np transport in order to assess the potential risk of groundwater

1687,hydrochemical analysis and environmental isotopic tracing are successfully applied to study groundwater evolution processes located in eastern china the jiangsu coastal plain is characterized by an extensively exploited deep groundwater system and groundwater salinization has become the primary water environmental problem this paper provides a case study on the use of a hydrochemical and environmental isotopic approach to assess possible mixing and evolution processes at yoco port jiangsu province china hydrochemical and isotopic patterns of deep groundwater allow one to distinguish different origins in deep water systems hco3 is the dominant anion in the freshwater samples whereas na and cl are the dominant major ions in the saline samples according to δ18o δ2h and 14c dating the fresh water is derived from precipitation under a colder climate during the glacial maximum dali glacial while the saline groundwater is influenced by glacial interglacial cycles during the holocene hypsithermal the δ18o δ2h and 3h data confirm that deep groundwater in some boreholes is mixed with overlying saline water the deep groundwater reservoir can be divided into a saline water sector and a fresh water sector and each show distinct hydrochemical and isotopic compositions the saline groundwater found in the deep aquifer cannot be associated with present seawater intrusion since the last glacial maximum in the late pleistocene the deep groundwater flow system has evolved to its current status with the decrease in ice cover and the rising of sea level however the hydraulic connection is strengthened by continuous overexploitation and deep groundwater is mixed with shallow groundwater at some points keywords hydrochemistry stable isotopes groundwater age groundwater development 1 introduction a coastal area is a vulnerable region for groundwater resources groundwater salinization is widespread throughout the world because of overexploitation amor et al 2011 monjerezi et al 2011 zhou et al 2011 giambastiani et al 2013 carreira et al 2014 natural hydrochemical evolution patterns have changed since the 1970s in the jiangsu coastal plain in china due to the extraction of groundwater on a large scale huang and lu 2004 zhou et al 2011 groundwater salinization has become the primary environmental water problem in this coastal area moreover groundwater in the coastal plain faces a number of problems including salinization due to mixing with present or ancient seawater water rock interaction ion exchange evaporation etc edmunds and wright 1979 edmunds et al 2003 amor et al 2011 lin et al 2011 carreira et al 2014 classical hydrogeological studies are not useful for drawing conclusions regarding these problems an adequate understanding of groundwater formation and evolution is essential for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater but little attention has been paid to salinization processes in the coastal plain recent studies have proven the usefulness of using a multi tracer approach that combines both hydrochemical and isotopic data to identify groundwater origins and processes hydrochemical analyses are frequently applied to study the problem edmunds et al 2003 monjerezi et al 2011 carucci et al 2012 giambastiani et al 2013 zabala et al 2015 environmental isotopic tracers have been successfully applied in various evolutionary contexts stable isotopes δ2h δ18o often combined with tracers of residence time 3h 14c are commonly used to investigate the hydrological conditions of recharge runoff and discharge edmunds and wright 1979 ha and zhao 1990 negrel et al 2011 négrel et al 2012 as evidence of the hydraulic connection among aquifers amor et al 2011 lin et al 2011 carucci et al 2012 carreira et al 2014 and to discriminate the flow path bretzler et al 2011 bouragba et al 2011 hosono et al 2011 zhou et al 2011 siebert et al 2012 parker et al 2012 raidla et al 2012 in the coastal plain of jiangsu province the aquifers containing fresh water formed during the early pleistocene and neocene and have been subject to multiple sea level fluctuations ha and zhao 1990 li and fan 2009 environmental isotopes δ2h δ18o 3h and 14c were applied to trace the origins and processes involved to explain the groundwater problem ha and zhao 1990 zhao and liang 1993 xu et al 2015 and hydrochemical analyses were used to decipher the origin and mechanism of groundwater salinization zhou et al 2011 xu and liu 2015 previous research on groundwater in the coastal plain has mainly focused on shallow groundwater while little attention has been paid to deep groundwater moreover most deep groundwater samples were mixed with overlying water in the past which complicated or distorted the isotopic and chemical compositions yoco is an important deep port under construction on the jiangsu coastal plain the excellent water quality of deep groundwater is an important basis for regional economic and social development in this study we propose to investigate the origin and evolutionary process of deep groundwater in the coastal aquifers in jiangsu province based on δ2h δ18o 3h and 14c contents together with major chemical data the specific aims are as follows 1 assess the groundwater quality and flow pattern configuration in the deep aquifers 2 identify a possible origin and evolutionary processes of deep groundwater and 3 determine the primary source of deep groundwater salinization this study may be beneficial to the long term prevention of groundwater quality deterioration and enhance understanding of a groundwater salinization process in a complex and multi layered aquifer 2 outline of the study area 2 1 geological and hydrogeological setting the jiangsu coastal plain is in the east jiangsu province in china yoco port is situated on the southern branch of the plain the area consists of a thick series of alluvial sediments the plain has a low slope ranging from 1m to 5m above sea level a s l the plain area is approximately 32 500km2 with an approximate length of 450km and a width of 150km fig 1 this study focuses on the yoco port area the rutai canal river runs through the southern plain from west to east the study area is in the northeastern part of the yangtze block zhang et al 2015 and the surface is covered by unconsolidated sediments from the early pleistocene and holocene the basement under the loose sediments is mesozoic to neogene strata the cenozoic deposit is approximately 500 600m thick and is composed of materials derived from acidic silicate rocks quartz and feldspar are the dominant minerals calcite and iron manganese oxides are common illite kaolinite and montmorillonite are observed in the plain the climate of the study area is generally humid subtropical with a mean annual temperature of 14 8 c and a mean annual rainfall of 1025mm the coastal river and lake water is generally salty because of seawater intrusion therefore groundwater is exploited annual groundwater exploitation is approximately 1 1 107 m3 122mm in the study area the uncontrolled extraction of groundwater in the jiangsu coastal plain in china has led to a decrease in the groundwater level flow field change groundwater resource reduction and progressive groundwater salinization the coastal plain is characterized by several porous aquifer systems table 1 fig 1 the permeable layers consist of unconsolidated sands which are separated by layers of poorly permeable silt clays the stratigraphic sequence comprises 3units ha and zhao 1990 the uppermost unit in the study area is a shallow porous water system which contains a series of holocene estuary or coast sediments these sediments include fine sands and loamy clay that are laterally discontinuous resulting in a highly heterogeneous aquifer system the phreatic aquifer is recharged by local rainfall and discharges from the rutai canal river the unconfined aquifer is generally 25 to 40m deep and the water table is at a depth of from 1 to 4m there is a middle porous water system underneath the phreatic aquifer which formed during the middle to late pleistocene the middle system is composed of the confined aquifer i and confined aquifer ii and is composed of fine sands silts and gravels aquifer i is generally at a depth of from 40 to 140m and the water table is from 2 to 3m deep aquifer ii is generally at a depth of from 220 to 270m and the water table is from 3 to 5m deep both the shallow and middle systems are generally saline water the lowermost unit is the deep porous water system and consists of neogene to early pleistocene fluvio lacustrine sands gravels silts and clays the deep water system includes confined aquifer iii and confined aquifer iv and is the main reservoir of groundwater in the study area aquifer iii is generally found at a depth of from 230 to 300m and its water table is from 10 to 50m deep with generally eastward deepening while the aquifer iv is at a depth of from 350 to 450m and its water table is from 10 to 30m deep our study focused on the deep water system according to the water level monitoring data the water table in aquifer iii declined xu and liu 2015 the groundwater level depression cone was approximately 698km2 and matang was the center of the cone with a water table 40m in depth fig 1 the hydraulic connection between the shallow groundwater and surface water is closely linked and shallow groundwater shows strong regeneration while deep groundwater flow is slow and shows weak regeneration 3 sampling and methods the water samples were collected from boreholes the river and the sea in october 2014 fig 1 using standard sampling procedures cgs 2012 there were 33 sampling points including 21 samples from the deep monitoring boreholes 7 samples from the shallow boreholes and 5 samples from the surface water river and sea all water samples were collected and stored in polyethylene plastic bottles the 21 groundwater samples were used for major ion analysis while all of the selected samples were studied using isotope analysis the samples for major ion analysis were filtered and those for cation analysis were acidified with hno3 ph 2 before storage samples for radiocarbon 14c analysis were obtained by precipitating baco3 by the addition of excess bacl2 to 100 120l of water previously brought to a ph 12 by the addition of naoh 14c was determined radiometrically by liquid scintillation counting after conversion to benzene chen et al 2003 the major hydrochemical concentrations and isotopic compositions of all deep groundwater samples were measured tds ph fe mn na ca2 mg2 k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 δ2h δ18o 3h 14c using standard methods cgs 2012 the ph temperature and tds were measured in the field using portable metres hanna hi8424 thermo scientific orion and calibrated using a standard solution the major hydrochemical concentrations na ca2 mg2 k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 fe mn and stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o were determined at the laboratory of the nanjing institute of geology and mineral resources in china major elements na k ca2 mg2 fe mn h2sio3 were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes major anion concentrations cl so4 2 no3 were determined using ion chromatography co3 2 and hco3 were determined using acid titration δ2h and δ18o were determined using ea mat253 isotope mass spectrometry the δ2h and δ18o analyses adopted the international standards of the vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water monjerezi et al 2011 the results for δ2h and δ18o had an error margin of 2 and 0 1 respectively the determination of 14c and 3h in the groundwater was carried out at the karst geology and resources laboratory of the institute of karst geology china the 14c ages were expressed as the year a and the tritium 3h concentrations were expressed in tu the analytical precisions were 5 and 0 1tu for the 14c ages and 3h respectively hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca were used to clearly characterize the chemical constituents of the groundwater the samples were grouped into various hydrochemical groups statistically using hca first hca was conducted using the nearest neighbor linkage method this method helps to identify outliers within the dataset this procedure resulted in the identification of outliers which were then removed to avoid skewing of the dataset following this a new hca was performed using ward s linkage method adopting euclidean distances as a measure of dissimilarity this method uses an analysis of variance to separate different clusters based on the homogeneity of the data the measure of similarity used ensured that each variable was weighted equally in this study the pca method allows the standardization of both samples and parameters leading to easy interpretation of the considered area and results both hca and pca were performed using ibm spss 19 0 statistical software isotopic data of the local atmospheric precipitation were collected to study the groundwater source and groundwater circulation model iaea 2011 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical analyses chemical data temperature and the ph of the deep groundwater samples considered in this study are provided in table 2 4 1 1 major ions and hydro geochemical characteristics the mean annual temperature of the deep groundwater samples is approximately 23 1 c with a range of from 17 8 c 34 3 c the average ph value is 7 8 with a range of from 7 4 8 3 which shows little variation across the study area the average concentration of tds is 2781mgl 1 varying considerably from 462 to 19 962mgl 1 table 2 the majority of samples are fresh water and only the samples 20 and 21 are typical saline water the results show that na ca2 mg2 cl hco3 and so4 2 dominate the composition of the groundwater with the following order of mean cation concentrations na 678mgl 1 ca2 137mgl 1 mg2 89mgl 1 and for the anions cl 1218mgl 1 hco3 423mgl 1 so4 2 143mgl 1 particularly na and cl are the dominant major ions in the saline samples whereas bicarbonate is the dominant anion in the freshwater samples the coefficient of variation of the cations na ca2 and mg2 is 2 11 1 49 and 1 98 respectively and for their counterparts anions cl hco3 and so4 2 it is 2 32 0 23 and 2 48 respectively the deviation of the test values is relatively large which indicates the notable spatial variability of the hydrochemical compositions 4 1 2 hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis there are two samples 20 and 21 that are outliers because their height is much higher than the rest of the samples which are grouped into cluster 1 after the removal of these outliers hca was performed on the 19 samples collected from the deep aquifer systems and on 11 descriptors so4 2 cl hco3 ca2 mg2 na k h2sio3 fe mn and tds the 19 samples were grouped into three hydrochemical clusters using q mode hca each cluster has distinct chemical properties the groundwater types of cluster 1 c1 are nacl types and those in clusters 2 c2 and 3 c3 are dominated by nacamg hco3 and nacamg cl types respectively fig 2b the samples in c1 have a very high salinity tds 19 840 172 11mgl 1 n 2 which separated c1 from c2 c3 and c4 as seen in the graph of fig 2a the samples in c2 and c3 have intermediate salinities tds 1619 86 741 70mgl 1 n 5 which may be caused by the input of overlying saline water the samples in c4 are characterized by a low tds tds 759 09 251 90mgl 1 n 14 and the groundwater types in c4 are dominated by nacamg hco3 types fig 2b pca was carried out using the same 21 water samples as for the hca calculations the analysis yields 3 principal components and a high cumulative variance of 94 18 the projection of the individual sampled boreholes on the pc1 pc3 factorial plane fig 3 indicates that the pc1 axis permits separation of the saline water samples from the other samples the c1 samples the outliers possess very high positive loadings in pc1 whereas all the other clusters present low negative to neutral pc1 loadings the pc1 axis is a typical mineralization axis the more boreholes that are positive on the pc1 axis the more the groundwater is mineralized the c1 samples are saline water with very high salinity the c4 samples are primarily fresh water and the c2 and c3 samples are brackish water samples in c4 present low negative loadings of pc1 but move throughout all of the pc3 axis showing great variability samples in c2 and c3 present the same loadings as c4 but with less variability this may reflect that c2 and c3 are sub groups of cluster 4 samples in c3 may have been mixed with seawater from the coastal fringe and samples in c2 may have been subject to saline water mixing from overlying aquifers bicarbonates and silicates correlate positively with the fc3 axis therefore positive components on this axis are enriched in these elements the samples in c4 show positive or negative relations with factor 3 the samples in c4 which show a positive relation with factor 3 have higher hco3 and h2sio3 concentrations the samples in c4 which show a negative relation with factor 3 have higher cl and tds values high concentrations of cl and tds may be attributed to the input of saline water 4 2 stable and radioisotope analysis the isotopic data δ2h δ18o 3h and 14c measured for the groundwater and surface water are shown in table 3 4 2 1 δ2h δ18o the δ2h and δ18o compositions of rutai canal water samples vary from 50 45 to 28 35 and from 7 18 to 2 96 respectively 43 08 12 75 and 5 71 2 38 n 3 table 3 the δ2h and δ18o compositions of the river water samples are more enriched than the atmospheric precipitation values in nanjing 44 83 21 95 and 7 36 2 54 n 58 iaea 2011 both the δ2h and δ18o values progressively increase from west to the east along the flow due to the influence of seawater fig 1 the δ2h and δ18o values of shallow groundwater vary from 42 83 to 30 69 and from 6 39 to 3 91 respectively 36 17 4 53 and 5 03 0 93 n 7 and the counterparts of the deep groundwater vary from 55 31 to 28 15 and from 7 22 to 3 25 respectively 43 90 7 06 and 5 57 1 08 n 21 table 3 the δ18o and δ2h concentrations in shallow groundwater become progressively enriched from west to the east along the canal and are higher than in the deep groundwater the global meteoric water line gmwl and chinese meteoric water line cmwl correspond to craig 1961 and zheng et al 1983 respectively for which the equations are δ2h 8δ18o 10 and δ2h 7 9δ18o 8 2 the local meteoric water line lmwl is the optimal fitting line based on the isotopic data of the atmospheric precipitation in nanjing iaea 2011 the equation of lmwl is calculated as follows xu et al 2015 δ 2 h 8 49 δ 18 o 17 71 n 58 r 2 0 967 ρ 0 01 compared to the gmwl and cmwl the slope and intercept of the lmwl equation are higher which may be attributed to the humid and rainy climate in the coastal area in the δ2h versus δ18o diagram the regression lines for shallow and deep groundwater have slightly lower slopes 4 69 and 6 19 compared to the lmwl fig 4 indicating that groundwater originates from meteoric water and is affected by significant evaporation but the stable isotopes in the shallow and deep groundwater show different degrees of evaporation palaeowater stable isotope signatures are controlled by temperature effects the overall 18o isotopic depletion represents a cooler regime and vice versa chen et al 2003 edmunds et al 2003 jasechko 2016a to check for the presence of a palaeoclimatic signal using δ18o samples with high mineralization or mixing with another type of water should not be considered in the calculations therefore 7 samples from the shallow systems and 7 samples from the deep systems are used to estimate the mean isotopic composition which exhibits low tds values tds 675mgl 1 the fresh groundwater samples in the deep systems show depleted δ18o 5 67 0 77 n 7 signatures while the shallow groundwater samples are enriched in δ18o 5 03 0 93 n 7 which indicates that deep groundwater originated from precipitation under colder climate conditions the δ2h and δ18o compositions in c1 range from 28 20 to 28 15 28 18 0 35 n 2 and from 3 67 to 3 25 3 46 0 30 n 2 the counterparts in c2 and c3 vary from 52 76 to 36 58 43 67 6 62 n 5 and from 6 97 to 3 97 5 40 1 26 n 5 and the counterparts in c4 vary from 55 31 to 39 92 46 23 4 38 n 14 and from 7 22 to 4 88 5 94 0 67 n 14 respectively the groundwater in c1 shows notable 2h and 18o enrichment which may be the product of evaporation at a high temperature high temperature evaporation is less selective in regard to evaporation 4 2 2 3h in this study the tritium recovery curve fig 5 of the nanjing station is presented based on the factor analysis method by zhang et al 2011 according to the recovery curve of precipitation in nanjing the tritium concentrations are 200 tu in the 1960s and 60 150 tu in the 1970s in the 1980s and thereafter the tritium concentrations restore to the natural level the evolutionary processes are determined from the tritium concentrations in the groundwater based on the law of tritium decay the decay of tritium lasted for approximately 5 half life periods to the present thus the tritium concentrations of the groundwater that were recharged from precipitation in the 1960s may be more than l2 5tu in the 2010s the tritium concentrations of groundwater recharged from precipitation in the 1970s are 10tu after 3 half life periods most of the tritium concentrations measured in deep groundwater in the study area are 2tu however the 3h contents vary between 2 47 and 15 80tu in some boreholes table 3 this finding indicates that the deep groundwater in most boreholes was mainly recharged from precipitation prior to the 1960s some samples have high tritium levels which should be regarded as a modern water supply induced by long term overexploitation overexploitation of deep groundwater leads to a decline of the regional deep groundwater level which causes the overlying water with high 3h contents to flow into the deep groundwater systems jasechko et al 2017 the tritium concentrations of the samples from the towns of fengli and juegang are between 5 and 9tu which implies an effect from precipitation occurring during the 1960s and or 1970s the town of matang is the center of the groundwater level depression cone in the study area where the tritium level is 12tu in the confined aquifer iii it can be inferred that this higher tritium level is caused by the effects of precipitation that occurred during the 1960s 4 2 3 14c dating the application of 14c dating often leads to overestimations of groundwater ages jasechko 2016b therefore numerous methods for 14c groundwater age correction have been introduced cartwright 2010 in this study the 14c ages are corrected based on the vogel model correction factor 0 85 because of limited hydrogeological data in the region lin et al 2011 the corrected 14c ages are provided in table 3 the age of the groundwater is the water residence time in the aquifer and the age of the aquifer is the formation time of the water bearing medium the formation period of deep aquifer systems is the early pleistocene and neogene 73 000 a the 14c ages of deep groundwater samples vary from 7410 to 26 140 a mean value 18 330 a n 15 the 14c ages of confined aquifer iii vary from 7410 to 26 140 a mean value 17 805 a n 11 and the counterparts in the confined aquifer iv vary from 16 140 to 25 890 a mean value 19 775 a n 4 table 3 the 14c ages show a significant negative correlation with the δ18o values with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 901 n 15 ρ 0 01 fig 6 on the north china plain the negative δ18o values and radioisotopes reflect the cold climate of the late pleistocene while the greater δ18o enrichments indicate the warm climate of the holocene chen et al 2003 in the study area it is assumed that most samples of the deep groundwater originated from precipitation under a colder climate during the late pleistocene only a minority are influenced by glacial interglacial cycles during the early holocene the deep groundwater is younger than the water bearing medium 4 3 formation and evolution of deep groundwater 4 3 1 source identification of deep groundwater the average δ2h and δ18o values of atmospheric precipitation are positively correlated with local average temperature the formulas for δ2h δ18o and local average temperature in china were established by zheng et al 1983 and are as follows 1 δ 18 o 0 35 t 13 0 2 δ 2 h 2 8 t 94 0 based on δ2h and δ18o data of the deep groundwater the temperature in c2 c3 and c4 ranges from 8 0 c 8 9 c which is approximately 6 c lower than the present annual temperature 14 8 c during the last glacial maximum 13 000 60 000 a the average temperature is 6 c 8 c lower than the present temperature in north china and the δ18o value is depleted by approximately 2 liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 the 14c ages of c2 c3 and c4 are between 15 000 and 26 000 a which reflects the period of the last glacial dali glaciation this finding implies that most of the samples of the deep groundwater originated from precipitation under a colder climate during the glacial maximum at the holocene hypsithermal maximum the average temperature was 2 5 c higher than the present temperature in east china shi et al 1992 the 14c ages in c1 are 10ka it is assumed that the saline water in the study area may be a product of the holocene hypsithermal 4 3 2 hydrochemical body of deep groundwater the deep groundwater flow is slow and shows weak regeneration in a closed or semi closed state based on the distinct distribution of the hydrochemical and isotopic compositions the deep groundwater reservoir can be divided into a saline water sector and a fresh water sector 1 saline water sector saline water is preserved in aquifer iii west of the yoco port the water types are mainly na cl types the saline water shows notable δ2h and δ18o enrichment and its 14c age is 10ka the na cl ratio ranges from 0 46 0 56 and the mg ca ratio from 1 00 1 77 which are notably different from values in seawater the saline groundwater cannot be associated with present seawater intrusion its higher salinity may be from ancient seawater which was subject to terrestrial salinization under the dry climate during the holocene hypsithermal the saline groundwater is influenced by glacial interglacial cycles 2 fresh water sector fresh water infiltrates all of aquifer iv and most of aquifer iii the water types are mainly nacamg hco3 nacamg hco3 or camgna cl the groundwater has depleted δ2h δ18o signatures and its 14c ages are between 15 000 and 26 000a indicating that it originated from precipitation under a colder climate during the glacial maximum 4 3 3 evolution of deep groundwater the natural groundwater flow in the coastal plain of jiangsu has adjusted to its current status since the late pleistocene with the decrease in ice cover and the rising of sea level sea level was approximately 120m below current sea level during the last glacial maximum 25 000 15 000a zhang et al 2013 and the annual temperature was lower the deep aquifers in the fresh water sector were recharged with meteoric water during the late pleistocene the deep groundwater shows 14c ages from 10 to 30ka the groundwater is mainly fresh water with lower δ18o values because of the holocene warm period and subsequent sea level rise the deep aquifers were covered with holocene sediments the deep groundwater remained the same as the present however the groundwater of aquifer iii was influenced by high temperature evaporation during the holocene hypsithermal resulting in higher salinity since the 1970s the exploitation and utilization of deep groundwater on a large scale has resulted in a decline in the regional groundwater level and a strengthening of the hydraulic connection between shallow groundwater and deep groundwater some of the deep boreholes have high tritium content which should be recharged by the overlying saline water the natural evolution patterns of groundwater have changed and the water environment has entered a new evolutionary stage in which it is intensely disturbed by human activities 5 conclusions a multi component approach which is the contemporaneous application of hydrochemical tracers and isotope studies provides an interconnection and cross verification of information on the formation and evolutionary processes of the deep groundwater at yoco port based on the distinct distribution of hydrochemical and isotopic compositions the deep groundwater reservoir can be divided into a saline water sector and a fresh water sector an hca analysis presents 4 clusters and a pca analysis yields 3 principal components according to δ18o δ2h and 14c dating freshwater is derived from precipitation under a colder climate during the glacial maximum dali glacial while the saline groundwater is influenced by glacial interglacial cycles and its high salinity cannot be associated with present seawater intrusion high tritium contents of deep groundwater were determined at some points and are attributed to deep confined aquifers with upward leakage the change in the geological environment since the last glacial maximum determined the evolution of the pattern of the quaternary groundwater flow system however the hydraulic connection has been strengthened between the shallow and deep groundwater by continuous overexploitation in this study we confirm salinization of deep groundwater in the coastal aquifers the groundwater salinization process perhaps involves a number of different processes further research will focus on the origin of salinity and the salinization mechanism in the coastal

1687,hydrochemical analysis and environmental isotopic tracing are successfully applied to study groundwater evolution processes located in eastern china the jiangsu coastal plain is characterized by an extensively exploited deep groundwater system and groundwater salinization has become the primary water environmental problem this paper provides a case study on the use of a hydrochemical and environmental isotopic approach to assess possible mixing and evolution processes at yoco port jiangsu province china hydrochemical and isotopic patterns of deep groundwater allow one to distinguish different origins in deep water systems hco3 is the dominant anion in the freshwater samples whereas na and cl are the dominant major ions in the saline samples according to δ18o δ2h and 14c dating the fresh water is derived from precipitation under a colder climate during the glacial maximum dali glacial while the saline groundwater is influenced by glacial interglacial cycles during the holocene hypsithermal the δ18o δ2h and 3h data confirm that deep groundwater in some boreholes is mixed with overlying saline water the deep groundwater reservoir can be divided into a saline water sector and a fresh water sector and each show distinct hydrochemical and isotopic compositions the saline groundwater found in the deep aquifer cannot be associated with present seawater intrusion since the last glacial maximum in the late pleistocene the deep groundwater flow system has evolved to its current status with the decrease in ice cover and the rising of sea level however the hydraulic connection is strengthened by continuous overexploitation and deep groundwater is mixed with shallow groundwater at some points keywords hydrochemistry stable isotopes groundwater age groundwater development 1 introduction a coastal area is a vulnerable region for groundwater resources groundwater salinization is widespread throughout the world because of overexploitation amor et al 2011 monjerezi et al 2011 zhou et al 2011 giambastiani et al 2013 carreira et al 2014 natural hydrochemical evolution patterns have changed since the 1970s in the jiangsu coastal plain in china due to the extraction of groundwater on a large scale huang and lu 2004 zhou et al 2011 groundwater salinization has become the primary environmental water problem in this coastal area moreover groundwater in the coastal plain faces a number of problems including salinization due to mixing with present or ancient seawater water rock interaction ion exchange evaporation etc edmunds and wright 1979 edmunds et al 2003 amor et al 2011 lin et al 2011 carreira et al 2014 classical hydrogeological studies are not useful for drawing conclusions regarding these problems an adequate understanding of groundwater formation and evolution is essential for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater but little attention has been paid to salinization processes in the coastal plain recent studies have proven the usefulness of using a multi tracer approach that combines both hydrochemical and isotopic data to identify groundwater origins and processes hydrochemical analyses are frequently applied to study the problem edmunds et al 2003 monjerezi et al 2011 carucci et al 2012 giambastiani et al 2013 zabala et al 2015 environmental isotopic tracers have been successfully applied in various evolutionary contexts stable isotopes δ2h δ18o often combined with tracers of residence time 3h 14c are commonly used to investigate the hydrological conditions of recharge runoff and discharge edmunds and wright 1979 ha and zhao 1990 negrel et al 2011 négrel et al 2012 as evidence of the hydraulic connection among aquifers amor et al 2011 lin et al 2011 carucci et al 2012 carreira et al 2014 and to discriminate the flow path bretzler et al 2011 bouragba et al 2011 hosono et al 2011 zhou et al 2011 siebert et al 2012 parker et al 2012 raidla et al 2012 in the coastal plain of jiangsu province the aquifers containing fresh water formed during the early pleistocene and neocene and have been subject to multiple sea level fluctuations ha and zhao 1990 li and fan 2009 environmental isotopes δ2h δ18o 3h and 14c were applied to trace the origins and processes involved to explain the groundwater problem ha and zhao 1990 zhao and liang 1993 xu et al 2015 and hydrochemical analyses were used to decipher the origin and mechanism of groundwater salinization zhou et al 2011 xu and liu 2015 previous research on groundwater in the coastal plain has mainly focused on shallow groundwater while little attention has been paid to deep groundwater moreover most deep groundwater samples were mixed with overlying water in the past which complicated or distorted the isotopic and chemical compositions yoco is an important deep port under construction on the jiangsu coastal plain the excellent water quality of deep groundwater is an important basis for regional economic and social development in this study we propose to investigate the origin and evolutionary process of deep groundwater in the coastal aquifers in jiangsu province based on δ2h δ18o 3h and 14c contents together with major chemical data the specific aims are as follows 1 assess the groundwater quality and flow pattern configuration in the deep aquifers 2 identify a possible origin and evolutionary processes of deep groundwater and 3 determine the primary source of deep groundwater salinization this study may be beneficial to the long term prevention of groundwater quality deterioration and enhance understanding of a groundwater salinization process in a complex and multi layered aquifer 2 outline of the study area 2 1 geological and hydrogeological setting the jiangsu coastal plain is in the east jiangsu province in china yoco port is situated on the southern branch of the plain the area consists of a thick series of alluvial sediments the plain has a low slope ranging from 1m to 5m above sea level a s l the plain area is approximately 32 500km2 with an approximate length of 450km and a width of 150km fig 1 this study focuses on the yoco port area the rutai canal river runs through the southern plain from west to east the study area is in the northeastern part of the yangtze block zhang et al 2015 and the surface is covered by unconsolidated sediments from the early pleistocene and holocene the basement under the loose sediments is mesozoic to neogene strata the cenozoic deposit is approximately 500 600m thick and is composed of materials derived from acidic silicate rocks quartz and feldspar are the dominant minerals calcite and iron manganese oxides are common illite kaolinite and montmorillonite are observed in the plain the climate of the study area is generally humid subtropical with a mean annual temperature of 14 8 c and a mean annual rainfall of 1025mm the coastal river and lake water is generally salty because of seawater intrusion therefore groundwater is exploited annual groundwater exploitation is approximately 1 1 107 m3 122mm in the study area the uncontrolled extraction of groundwater in the jiangsu coastal plain in china has led to a decrease in the groundwater level flow field change groundwater resource reduction and progressive groundwater salinization the coastal plain is characterized by several porous aquifer systems table 1 fig 1 the permeable layers consist of unconsolidated sands which are separated by layers of poorly permeable silt clays the stratigraphic sequence comprises 3units ha and zhao 1990 the uppermost unit in the study area is a shallow porous water system which contains a series of holocene estuary or coast sediments these sediments include fine sands and loamy clay that are laterally discontinuous resulting in a highly heterogeneous aquifer system the phreatic aquifer is recharged by local rainfall and discharges from the rutai canal river the unconfined aquifer is generally 25 to 40m deep and the water table is at a depth of from 1 to 4m there is a middle porous water system underneath the phreatic aquifer which formed during the middle to late pleistocene the middle system is composed of the confined aquifer i and confined aquifer ii and is composed of fine sands silts and gravels aquifer i is generally at a depth of from 40 to 140m and the water table is from 2 to 3m deep aquifer ii is generally at a depth of from 220 to 270m and the water table is from 3 to 5m deep both the shallow and middle systems are generally saline water the lowermost unit is the deep porous water system and consists of neogene to early pleistocene fluvio lacustrine sands gravels silts and clays the deep water system includes confined aquifer iii and confined aquifer iv and is the main reservoir of groundwater in the study area aquifer iii is generally found at a depth of from 230 to 300m and its water table is from 10 to 50m deep with generally eastward deepening while the aquifer iv is at a depth of from 350 to 450m and its water table is from 10 to 30m deep our study focused on the deep water system according to the water level monitoring data the water table in aquifer iii declined xu and liu 2015 the groundwater level depression cone was approximately 698km2 and matang was the center of the cone with a water table 40m in depth fig 1 the hydraulic connection between the shallow groundwater and surface water is closely linked and shallow groundwater shows strong regeneration while deep groundwater flow is slow and shows weak regeneration 3 sampling and methods the water samples were collected from boreholes the river and the sea in october 2014 fig 1 using standard sampling procedures cgs 2012 there were 33 sampling points including 21 samples from the deep monitoring boreholes 7 samples from the shallow boreholes and 5 samples from the surface water river and sea all water samples were collected and stored in polyethylene plastic bottles the 21 groundwater samples were used for major ion analysis while all of the selected samples were studied using isotope analysis the samples for major ion analysis were filtered and those for cation analysis were acidified with hno3 ph 2 before storage samples for radiocarbon 14c analysis were obtained by precipitating baco3 by the addition of excess bacl2 to 100 120l of water previously brought to a ph 12 by the addition of naoh 14c was determined radiometrically by liquid scintillation counting after conversion to benzene chen et al 2003 the major hydrochemical concentrations and isotopic compositions of all deep groundwater samples were measured tds ph fe mn na ca2 mg2 k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 δ2h δ18o 3h 14c using standard methods cgs 2012 the ph temperature and tds were measured in the field using portable metres hanna hi8424 thermo scientific orion and calibrated using a standard solution the major hydrochemical concentrations na ca2 mg2 k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 fe mn and stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o were determined at the laboratory of the nanjing institute of geology and mineral resources in china major elements na k ca2 mg2 fe mn h2sio3 were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes major anion concentrations cl so4 2 no3 were determined using ion chromatography co3 2 and hco3 were determined using acid titration δ2h and δ18o were determined using ea mat253 isotope mass spectrometry the δ2h and δ18o analyses adopted the international standards of the vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water monjerezi et al 2011 the results for δ2h and δ18o had an error margin of 2 and 0 1 respectively the determination of 14c and 3h in the groundwater was carried out at the karst geology and resources laboratory of the institute of karst geology china the 14c ages were expressed as the year a and the tritium 3h concentrations were expressed in tu the analytical precisions were 5 and 0 1tu for the 14c ages and 3h respectively hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca were used to clearly characterize the chemical constituents of the groundwater the samples were grouped into various hydrochemical groups statistically using hca first hca was conducted using the nearest neighbor linkage method this method helps to identify outliers within the dataset this procedure resulted in the identification of outliers which were then removed to avoid skewing of the dataset following this a new hca was performed using ward s linkage method adopting euclidean distances as a measure of dissimilarity this method uses an analysis of variance to separate different clusters based on the homogeneity of the data the measure of similarity used ensured that each variable was weighted equally in this study the pca method allows the standardization of both samples and parameters leading to easy interpretation of the considered area and results both hca and pca were performed using ibm spss 19 0 statistical software isotopic data of the local atmospheric precipitation were collected to study the groundwater source and groundwater circulation model iaea 2011 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical analyses chemical data temperature and the ph of the deep groundwater samples considered in this study are provided in table 2 4 1 1 major ions and hydro geochemical characteristics the mean annual temperature of the deep groundwater samples is approximately 23 1 c with a range of from 17 8 c 34 3 c the average ph value is 7 8 with a range of from 7 4 8 3 which shows little variation across the study area the average concentration of tds is 2781mgl 1 varying considerably from 462 to 19 962mgl 1 table 2 the majority of samples are fresh water and only the samples 20 and 21 are typical saline water the results show that na ca2 mg2 cl hco3 and so4 2 dominate the composition of the groundwater with the following order of mean cation concentrations na 678mgl 1 ca2 137mgl 1 mg2 89mgl 1 and for the anions cl 1218mgl 1 hco3 423mgl 1 so4 2 143mgl 1 particularly na and cl are the dominant major ions in the saline samples whereas bicarbonate is the dominant anion in the freshwater samples the coefficient of variation of the cations na ca2 and mg2 is 2 11 1 49 and 1 98 respectively and for their counterparts anions cl hco3 and so4 2 it is 2 32 0 23 and 2 48 respectively the deviation of the test values is relatively large which indicates the notable spatial variability of the hydrochemical compositions 4 1 2 hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis there are two samples 20 and 21 that are outliers because their height is much higher than the rest of the samples which are grouped into cluster 1 after the removal of these outliers hca was performed on the 19 samples collected from the deep aquifer systems and on 11 descriptors so4 2 cl hco3 ca2 mg2 na k h2sio3 fe mn and tds the 19 samples were grouped into three hydrochemical clusters using q mode hca each cluster has distinct chemical properties the groundwater types of cluster 1 c1 are nacl types and those in clusters 2 c2 and 3 c3 are dominated by nacamg hco3 and nacamg cl types respectively fig 2b the samples in c1 have a very high salinity tds 19 840 172 11mgl 1 n 2 which separated c1 from c2 c3 and c4 as seen in the graph of fig 2a the samples in c2 and c3 have intermediate salinities tds 1619 86 741 70mgl 1 n 5 which may be caused by the input of overlying saline water the samples in c4 are characterized by a low tds tds 759 09 251 90mgl 1 n 14 and the groundwater types in c4 are dominated by nacamg hco3 types fig 2b pca was carried out using the same 21 water samples as for the hca calculations the analysis yields 3 principal components and a high cumulative variance of 94 18 the projection of the individual sampled boreholes on the pc1 pc3 factorial plane fig 3 indicates that the pc1 axis permits separation of the saline water samples from the other samples the c1 samples the outliers possess very high positive loadings in pc1 whereas all the other clusters present low negative to neutral pc1 loadings the pc1 axis is a typical mineralization axis the more boreholes that are positive on the pc1 axis the more the groundwater is mineralized the c1 samples are saline water with very high salinity the c4 samples are primarily fresh water and the c2 and c3 samples are brackish water samples in c4 present low negative loadings of pc1 but move throughout all of the pc3 axis showing great variability samples in c2 and c3 present the same loadings as c4 but with less variability this may reflect that c2 and c3 are sub groups of cluster 4 samples in c3 may have been mixed with seawater from the coastal fringe and samples in c2 may have been subject to saline water mixing from overlying aquifers bicarbonates and silicates correlate positively with the fc3 axis therefore positive components on this axis are enriched in these elements the samples in c4 show positive or negative relations with factor 3 the samples in c4 which show a positive relation with factor 3 have higher hco3 and h2sio3 concentrations the samples in c4 which show a negative relation with factor 3 have higher cl and tds values high concentrations of cl and tds may be attributed to the input of saline water 4 2 stable and radioisotope analysis the isotopic data δ2h δ18o 3h and 14c measured for the groundwater and surface water are shown in table 3 4 2 1 δ2h δ18o the δ2h and δ18o compositions of rutai canal water samples vary from 50 45 to 28 35 and from 7 18 to 2 96 respectively 43 08 12 75 and 5 71 2 38 n 3 table 3 the δ2h and δ18o compositions of the river water samples are more enriched than the atmospheric precipitation values in nanjing 44 83 21 95 and 7 36 2 54 n 58 iaea 2011 both the δ2h and δ18o values progressively increase from west to the east along the flow due to the influence of seawater fig 1 the δ2h and δ18o values of shallow groundwater vary from 42 83 to 30 69 and from 6 39 to 3 91 respectively 36 17 4 53 and 5 03 0 93 n 7 and the counterparts of the deep groundwater vary from 55 31 to 28 15 and from 7 22 to 3 25 respectively 43 90 7 06 and 5 57 1 08 n 21 table 3 the δ18o and δ2h concentrations in shallow groundwater become progressively enriched from west to the east along the canal and are higher than in the deep groundwater the global meteoric water line gmwl and chinese meteoric water line cmwl correspond to craig 1961 and zheng et al 1983 respectively for which the equations are δ2h 8δ18o 10 and δ2h 7 9δ18o 8 2 the local meteoric water line lmwl is the optimal fitting line based on the isotopic data of the atmospheric precipitation in nanjing iaea 2011 the equation of lmwl is calculated as follows xu et al 2015 δ 2 h 8 49 δ 18 o 17 71 n 58 r 2 0 967 ρ 0 01 compared to the gmwl and cmwl the slope and intercept of the lmwl equation are higher which may be attributed to the humid and rainy climate in the coastal area in the δ2h versus δ18o diagram the regression lines for shallow and deep groundwater have slightly lower slopes 4 69 and 6 19 compared to the lmwl fig 4 indicating that groundwater originates from meteoric water and is affected by significant evaporation but the stable isotopes in the shallow and deep groundwater show different degrees of evaporation palaeowater stable isotope signatures are controlled by temperature effects the overall 18o isotopic depletion represents a cooler regime and vice versa chen et al 2003 edmunds et al 2003 jasechko 2016a to check for the presence of a palaeoclimatic signal using δ18o samples with high mineralization or mixing with another type of water should not be considered in the calculations therefore 7 samples from the shallow systems and 7 samples from the deep systems are used to estimate the mean isotopic composition which exhibits low tds values tds 675mgl 1 the fresh groundwater samples in the deep systems show depleted δ18o 5 67 0 77 n 7 signatures while the shallow groundwater samples are enriched in δ18o 5 03 0 93 n 7 which indicates that deep groundwater originated from precipitation under colder climate conditions the δ2h and δ18o compositions in c1 range from 28 20 to 28 15 28 18 0 35 n 2 and from 3 67 to 3 25 3 46 0 30 n 2 the counterparts in c2 and c3 vary from 52 76 to 36 58 43 67 6 62 n 5 and from 6 97 to 3 97 5 40 1 26 n 5 and the counterparts in c4 vary from 55 31 to 39 92 46 23 4 38 n 14 and from 7 22 to 4 88 5 94 0 67 n 14 respectively the groundwater in c1 shows notable 2h and 18o enrichment which may be the product of evaporation at a high temperature high temperature evaporation is less selective in regard to evaporation 4 2 2 3h in this study the tritium recovery curve fig 5 of the nanjing station is presented based on the factor analysis method by zhang et al 2011 according to the recovery curve of precipitation in nanjing the tritium concentrations are 200 tu in the 1960s and 60 150 tu in the 1970s in the 1980s and thereafter the tritium concentrations restore to the natural level the evolutionary processes are determined from the tritium concentrations in the groundwater based on the law of tritium decay the decay of tritium lasted for approximately 5 half life periods to the present thus the tritium concentrations of the groundwater that were recharged from precipitation in the 1960s may be more than l2 5tu in the 2010s the tritium concentrations of groundwater recharged from precipitation in the 1970s are 10tu after 3 half life periods most of the tritium concentrations measured in deep groundwater in the study area are 2tu however the 3h contents vary between 2 47 and 15 80tu in some boreholes table 3 this finding indicates that the deep groundwater in most boreholes was mainly recharged from precipitation prior to the 1960s some samples have high tritium levels which should be regarded as a modern water supply induced by long term overexploitation overexploitation of deep groundwater leads to a decline of the regional deep groundwater level which causes the overlying water with high 3h contents to flow into the deep groundwater systems jasechko et al 2017 the tritium concentrations of the samples from the towns of fengli and juegang are between 5 and 9tu which implies an effect from precipitation occurring during the 1960s and or 1970s the town of matang is the center of the groundwater level depression cone in the study area where the tritium level is 12tu in the confined aquifer iii it can be inferred that this higher tritium level is caused by the effects of precipitation that occurred during the 1960s 4 2 3 14c dating the application of 14c dating often leads to overestimations of groundwater ages jasechko 2016b therefore numerous methods for 14c groundwater age correction have been introduced cartwright 2010 in this study the 14c ages are corrected based on the vogel model correction factor 0 85 because of limited hydrogeological data in the region lin et al 2011 the corrected 14c ages are provided in table 3 the age of the groundwater is the water residence time in the aquifer and the age of the aquifer is the formation time of the water bearing medium the formation period of deep aquifer systems is the early pleistocene and neogene 73 000 a the 14c ages of deep groundwater samples vary from 7410 to 26 140 a mean value 18 330 a n 15 the 14c ages of confined aquifer iii vary from 7410 to 26 140 a mean value 17 805 a n 11 and the counterparts in the confined aquifer iv vary from 16 140 to 25 890 a mean value 19 775 a n 4 table 3 the 14c ages show a significant negative correlation with the δ18o values with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 901 n 15 ρ 0 01 fig 6 on the north china plain the negative δ18o values and radioisotopes reflect the cold climate of the late pleistocene while the greater δ18o enrichments indicate the warm climate of the holocene chen et al 2003 in the study area it is assumed that most samples of the deep groundwater originated from precipitation under a colder climate during the late pleistocene only a minority are influenced by glacial interglacial cycles during the early holocene the deep groundwater is younger than the water bearing medium 4 3 formation and evolution of deep groundwater 4 3 1 source identification of deep groundwater the average δ2h and δ18o values of atmospheric precipitation are positively correlated with local average temperature the formulas for δ2h δ18o and local average temperature in china were established by zheng et al 1983 and are as follows 1 δ 18 o 0 35 t 13 0 2 δ 2 h 2 8 t 94 0 based on δ2h and δ18o data of the deep groundwater the temperature in c2 c3 and c4 ranges from 8 0 c 8 9 c which is approximately 6 c lower than the present annual temperature 14 8 c during the last glacial maximum 13 000 60 000 a the average temperature is 6 c 8 c lower than the present temperature in north china and the δ18o value is depleted by approximately 2 liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 the 14c ages of c2 c3 and c4 are between 15 000 and 26 000 a which reflects the period of the last glacial dali glaciation this finding implies that most of the samples of the deep groundwater originated from precipitation under a colder climate during the glacial maximum at the holocene hypsithermal maximum the average temperature was 2 5 c higher than the present temperature in east china shi et al 1992 the 14c ages in c1 are 10ka it is assumed that the saline water in the study area may be a product of the holocene hypsithermal 4 3 2 hydrochemical body of deep groundwater the deep groundwater flow is slow and shows weak regeneration in a closed or semi closed state based on the distinct distribution of the hydrochemical and isotopic compositions the deep groundwater reservoir can be divided into a saline water sector and a fresh water sector 1 saline water sector saline water is preserved in aquifer iii west of the yoco port the water types are mainly na cl types the saline water shows notable δ2h and δ18o enrichment and its 14c age is 10ka the na cl ratio ranges from 0 46 0 56 and the mg ca ratio from 1 00 1 77 which are notably different from values in seawater the saline groundwater cannot be associated with present seawater intrusion its higher salinity may be from ancient seawater which was subject to terrestrial salinization under the dry climate during the holocene hypsithermal the saline groundwater is influenced by glacial interglacial cycles 2 fresh water sector fresh water infiltrates all of aquifer iv and most of aquifer iii the water types are mainly nacamg hco3 nacamg hco3 or camgna cl the groundwater has depleted δ2h δ18o signatures and its 14c ages are between 15 000 and 26 000a indicating that it originated from precipitation under a colder climate during the glacial maximum 4 3 3 evolution of deep groundwater the natural groundwater flow in the coastal plain of jiangsu has adjusted to its current status since the late pleistocene with the decrease in ice cover and the rising of sea level sea level was approximately 120m below current sea level during the last glacial maximum 25 000 15 000a zhang et al 2013 and the annual temperature was lower the deep aquifers in the fresh water sector were recharged with meteoric water during the late pleistocene the deep groundwater shows 14c ages from 10 to 30ka the groundwater is mainly fresh water with lower δ18o values because of the holocene warm period and subsequent sea level rise the deep aquifers were covered with holocene sediments the deep groundwater remained the same as the present however the groundwater of aquifer iii was influenced by high temperature evaporation during the holocene hypsithermal resulting in higher salinity since the 1970s the exploitation and utilization of deep groundwater on a large scale has resulted in a decline in the regional groundwater level and a strengthening of the hydraulic connection between shallow groundwater and deep groundwater some of the deep boreholes have high tritium content which should be recharged by the overlying saline water the natural evolution patterns of groundwater have changed and the water environment has entered a new evolutionary stage in which it is intensely disturbed by human activities 5 conclusions a multi component approach which is the contemporaneous application of hydrochemical tracers and isotope studies provides an interconnection and cross verification of information on the formation and evolutionary processes of the deep groundwater at yoco port based on the distinct distribution of hydrochemical and isotopic compositions the deep groundwater reservoir can be divided into a saline water sector and a fresh water sector an hca analysis presents 4 clusters and a pca analysis yields 3 principal components according to δ18o δ2h and 14c dating freshwater is derived from precipitation under a colder climate during the glacial maximum dali glacial while the saline groundwater is influenced by glacial interglacial cycles and its high salinity cannot be associated with present seawater intrusion high tritium contents of deep groundwater were determined at some points and are attributed to deep confined aquifers with upward leakage the change in the geological environment since the last glacial maximum determined the evolution of the pattern of the quaternary groundwater flow system however the hydraulic connection has been strengthened between the shallow and deep groundwater by continuous overexploitation in this study we confirm salinization of deep groundwater in the coastal aquifers the groundwater salinization process perhaps involves a number of different processes further research will focus on the origin of salinity and the salinization mechanism in the coastal aquifers of the jiangsu plain acknowledgements this work was funded by grants of the natural science foundation of the jiangsu province bk20151093 and the chinese project of the national geological

1688,the point velocity probe pvp quantifies groundwater speed and flow direction i e velocity at the centimeter scale the first probe designs required that the flow direction be known a priori within about 100 in order to position the probe during installation this study introduces and assesses a 360 pvp that measures flow from any direction without foreknowledge of the groundwater velocity in tests conducted in a nested storage tank nest aquifer simulator packed with sand pvp measured velocities matched expected velocities within 9 in direction and 15 in magnitude on average consistent with previously reported pvp performances in laboratory studies in tests involving 17 repacked nests the measured and expected velocities were within 30 and 30 on average illustrating the sensitivity of flow to porous medium packing and the probes ability to sense these changes the porosity was found to vary considerably between packings i e n 0 34 0 2 for flow directions between 0 and 80 of an injection port the experimental error on velocity magnitude was within the ranges reported above at higher flow angles experimental sources of error contributed to greater uncertainties fortunately in these cases there were always alternative injection ports with lower angles to flow that could be used to circumvent any biases at low experimental flow angles 10 the calculated values tended to overestimate the actual flow angles fortunately these cases were identifiable by the detection of tracer at detectors on either side of the active injection port in several tests designed with an expected flow direction of 0 averaging the calculated directions from each side of the injection port resulted in improved matches to the expected flow direction 1 introduction groundwater velocity must be known to understand the transport of contaminants through an aquifer assign risk and design in situ remediation schemes labaky et al 2007 typically assessments of this kind are undertaken by the measurement of water levels in wells and subsequent darcy s law calculations using eq 1 1 v k h n x where v is the average linear flow velocity l t k is the hydraulic conductivity l t h is the hydraulic head l n is the effective porosity dimensionless and x is the distance in the direction of flow l over which a decline in hydraulic head is observed and l and t are generalized units of length and time flow velocities calculated this way rely on estimates or measurements of both hydraulic conductivity and porosity which are prone to uncertainties and spatial variability in the case of hydraulic conductivity these uncertainties can be especially large in addition darcy s law calculations can sometimes be limited by the determination of a hydraulic gradient well spacings must be sufficiently large that water level variations across the test area are greater than the measurement uncertainties devlin and mcelwee 2007 in general this means wells spacings of several meters or more are required where remediation depends on in situ treatment zones these distances can become an issue where parameter uncertainties as discussed above are deemed large the addition of independent methods of groundwater velocity determination could be beneficial an emerging technology that determines groundwater velocity at the centimeter scale is the point velocity probe pvp labaky et al 2007 devlin et al 2009 the probe operates in saturated noncohesive aquifers within a borehole allowed to collapse around the probe the velocity determinations referred to here as pvp measurements or measurements for simplicity it is noted that in a strict sense the velocities themselves are not actually measured rely on a mini tracer test on the probe surface an easy tracer suitable for use is a dilute salt solution with an electrical conductance different from the ambient groundwater both magnitude v and direction α of the groundwater flow vector can be calculated if the pvp is constructed with two detectors along the tracer flowpath labaky et al 2007 2 v v app γ 1 2 cos α cos α γ 1 3 α tan 1 v app 1 γ 1 cos γ 2 1 v app 2 γ 2 1 cos γ 1 v app 1 γ 1 sin γ 2 v app 2 γ 2 sin γ 1 where vapp is the apparent tracer velocity measured at a detector l t and γi is the fixed angle between the injector and detector i the device does not require calibration and can be constructed from inexpensive materials devlin et al 2009 recently methods have been reported for the fabrication of pvps with 3d printing technology walter and devlin 2017 pvps have been used in several studies for site characterization high resolution flow mapping and detecting changes in aquifer permeability resulting from biostimulation schillig et al 2011 a review of the earliest studies is presented in devlin et al 2012 pvps have been shown to provide measurements with comparable or better accuracy than other direct measurement methods in the field labaky et al 2009 kempf et al 2013 in all field cases where pvps were deployed up to the time of this work the point scale flow directions were less well known than anticipated schillig et al 2011 devlin et al 2012 kempf et al 2013 schillig et al 2015 the original pvp design featured a single tracer injection port and two detectors fig 2a however that design required that the flow direction be known a priori to within about 100 depending on detector placement in principle with additional sets of detectors no a priori knowledge of flow direction should be needed with one caveat theoretically flow directly into injectors results in tracer stagnation at the point of injection hence a blind spot should exist at each injection port however in practice because tracer injections occupy volumes greater than zero true tracer stagnation does not fully occur rather tracer mass splits to pass over detectors on either side of an injection port fig 2b thus in principle it should be possible to build a probe with no restrictions on measurable flow directions the purpose of this study was to design and test such a pvp referred to here has the 360 pvp with the additional requirements that the probes remain inexpensive simple to assemble and suitable for multilevel deployment 2 methods and materials 2 1 360 pvp design the 360 pvp was designed using the free 3d design software sketchup by trimble and printed on a uprint dimension 3d prototype printer using abs plastic walter and devlin 2017 the probe was 5 00cm tall and consisted of a hollow body cylinder with an outside diameter of 6 03cm the top and bottom ends were designed with inset riser connections to couple tightly with commercially available schedule 40 pvc pipe fig 3 the connections were further secured with commercially available abs cement the pvp was printed with the capacity to incorporate three tracer injection ports six horizontal flow detectors and two vertical flow detectors the detectors consisted of pairs of 20 guage stainless steel wires detector wire pairs were located on the probe with angles to the ports of γ1 48 and γ2 78 fig 2 the γ angles are measured from the center of the injection port to the second wire on a detector which is the distance the tracer must travel for a signal to be generated within the probe the stainless steel detector wires were soldered to insulated 22 gauge braided copper wires that extended upward through pvc casing and ultimately to a campbell scientific cr1000 datalogger as described by devlin et al 2009 each injection port consisted of a single hole with a diameter of 1 2mm separated from the porous medium by a printed screen the tracer injection lines were made of 1 16 by 1 8 flexelene tubing low density polyethylene each of the three injection lines was connected to an injection port inside the probe body and sealed with cyanoacrylate glue to prevent leaks 2 2 experimental procedure the tracer experiments were conducted in a benchtop nest nested storage tank aquifer simulator bowen et al 2012 which was packed with sand the nest is an inexpensive leak proof tank constructed from readily available plastic storage bins the nest consisted of two open water reservoirs connected by an inner tank containing the sand a constant hydraulic gradient was created by circulating water from the downgradient reservoir to the upgradient reservoir with a peristaltic pump creating uniform flow conditions through the sand fig 4 the pvp derived velocity estimates were compared to experimental expected velocity estimates determined from the following equation 4 v q an where q is the discharge rate l3 t produced by a peristaltic pump measured using a 1000ml graduated cylinder and a stopwatch a l2 is the saturated cross sectional area of the porous medium sand and n dimensionless is the porous medium sand effective porosity porosity was estimated by wet packing a 600ml beaker with sand exactly as the nest was packed and then weighing the saturated sand wwet drying it and weighing the dried sand wdry porosity estimated this way was assumed to be representative of the nest packing total porosity n was estimated from 5 n w wet w dry 600 ml ρ h 2 o where ρh2o is the density of water assumed 1 00g ml for the purposes of this work the total and effective porosities were assumed to be the same in this work which is justified for the medium to coarse sand used in these experiments bowen et al 2012 estimated that porosity determined this way was accurate to within 0 1 dimensionless porosity units packing was conducted with a slight excess of water in the tank to minimize entrapped air and assure near full saturation of the sand during packing the pvp was held in place in the tank following the methodology of labaky et al 2007 to minimize secondary sources of bias the tracer lines were filled with tracer solution before the pvp was placed in the tank to avoid later introduction of air to the porous medium after packing the top of the sand was leveled and any ponded water was withdrawn so that the top of the saturated zone corresponded with surface of the sand care was taken to avoid any ponding of the water on the sand surface while tests were underway to avoid preferential flow the sides of the nest were braced with a metal frame running 90 to the flow direction in the sand fig 5 that served two purposes 1 it provided support to prevent the sides of the nest from flexing outward and 2 it provided a convenient benchmark for use in measuring the expected flow angle α after packing the tank a peristaltic pump was turned on and water was circulated until the background electrical conductivity sensed by the detectors on the pvp achieved a steady baseline the tank was considered ready for use in tests when all of the detectors registered a steady baseline for at least 10 15min a tracer solution of 1g l of nacl was prepared using water from the tank this method has been demonstrated to provide an adequate contrast in electrical conductance in sands without producing significant density driven flow schillig et al 2011 bowen et al 2012 schillig et al 2014 injection volumes were 0 35ml which is within the range of volumes reported previously labaky et al 2007 schillig et al 2011 the injections were delivered over 4 to 5s and completed manually using 1 0ml syringes as described by schillig et al 2011 to demonstrate the capability of the pvp to measure flow from any direction tracer tests were performed at α increments of 10 over an arc of 360 each injection port was tested over its entire detectable range of α 102 with detectors on each side of a port and γ2 78 see fig 2 2 3 data processing the groundwater velocities and flow directions were calculated using the spreadsheet program velprobepe schillig 2012 briefly this program uses a nonlinear optimizer and a solution of the advection dispersion equation to obtain best fits to the tracer breakthrough data at the detectors the fitting is achieved by adjusting the velocity dispersivity and source width terms in the equation the best fit velocity terms are also the vapp terms for the respective detector locations in eqs 2 and 3 from which the ambient groundwater velocity v is calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 visibility ranges recall from fig 1a a pvp with a single injection port can measure velocities over a limited range of flow directions referred to here as the visibility range of an injection port flow occurring from directions outside the visibility range is referred to here as occurring in a blind spot of the injection port the occurrence of blind spots can be greatly reduced by equipping a pvp with additional injection ports and detectors if three symmetrically placed injection ports are used with corresponding detectors placed between them fig 1b the visibility range can ideally be extended for all directions in this study the pvp was constructed as shown in figs 1b and 3 and as described in the section on the 360 probe design the maximum measurable α angle using any single injection port was theoretically 102 on each side of an injection port the total visible range of a pvp injection port under these conditions was therefore 204 including both sides around a port fig 6 3 2 uncertainty inherent to the method devlin 2016 examined the sensitivity of the calculated velocity magnitude v from eq 2 to the true direction of flow αtrue eq 6 that work was extended to estimate the relative error on the estimations of v vexpected eqs 7 to 9 by expressing the results of pvp tests as v vexpected systematic trends in the errors of the measurements are easily identifiable as deviations from the value 1 6 1 v d v d α true sin α true sin α true γ i cos α true cos α true γ i 7 σ v v 1 v v α true 2 α true 2 8 v v expected upper bound 1 σ v v 9 v v expected lower bound 1 σ v v the first term on the right side of eq 7 is calculated from eq 6 the second term δαtrue is more problematic since neither αtrue nor δαtrue are well known i e a centimeter scale flow direction is not necessarily equal to a larger scale flow direction measured with the hydraulic gradient therefore δαtrue can only be estimated a convenient quantity to supply this estimate is δα which is taken from the experimental variability in measured flow angles see dashed lines in fig 7a and c accordingly combining the sensitivity equation eq 6 and the error propagation equation eq 7 the trend in uncertainty in v vexpected can be estimated as a function of uncertainty in the flow direction eqs 8 and 9 see dashed lines in fig 7b and d the uncertainties calculated from these calculations do not account for all experimental sources of error though some are incorporated in δα such as variabilities in injection rates volumes tracer concentrations porous medium heterogeneity or artifacts introduced during probe installation transient flow or operator error therefore the calculations represent minimum errors for the value of δα that is used nevertheless the agreement between the theoretical uncertainties and the deviations from v vexpected 1 in the experiments dashed lines and symbols in fig 7b and d respectively indicates that the major sources of uncertainty are understood 3 3 the effects of tank packing a total of 235 pvp tests were performed in this study in which velocity magnitude and direction were calculated these tests were conducted with the probe oriented at 36 different angles and involved 17 re packings of the nest repacking of the tank was necessary when evaporative losses of the water between tests e g overnight or on days when tests were not run led to unsaturated conditions developing in the upper few centimeters of the packed sand the nest was occasionally repacked for other operational reasons such as verification of injection port alignment or integrity of the injection port screens as alluded to above the velocity magnitude results of the various tests were compared as normalized values by dividing the pvp measured velocities v by the corresponding expected velocities vexpected this facilitated comparisons between tests in which the pumping rates q and saturated areas a varied slightly and assisted the identification of patterns of uncertainty a comparison of the calculated ranges of uncertainty from eqs 6 to 9 and the scatter in the experimentally derived values of v vexpected shows that over the 235 tests conducted the experimental data exhibited scatter in flow angles on the order of 30 and in v vexpected 30 see gray area in fig 7b where experimental points lie outside the range of uncertainty shown by the dashed lines sources of uncertainty not accounted for in the equations are indicated a likely source of such uncertainty comes from variations in the porous media of each repacking it was noted that gravimetrically determined porosities over six replicate packings in 600ml beakers varied on average 0 34 0 2 reflecting the sensitivity of porosity to packing this alone could account for much of the 30 in v vexpected obtained experimentally however it should be noted that the porosity variability probably reflects a range of spatially variable porosity that could be achieved within a single tank repacking as well reflecting average porosity differences between separate nest packings to further evaluate the effect of repacking on measured velocity variation flow directions obtained from a single packing were compiled and compared to the entire dataset figs 7c and d in the single packing tests the uncertainty in flow angle was found to be 9 and the experimental values of v vexpected varied 15 on average in good agreement with predictions from eqs 6 to 9 and also in close agreement with expectations from previously reported work labaky et al 2007 devlin 2016 these findings indicate that the 3 injector pvps can measure flow from any direction as designed further it was shown that the measurements 1 are sensitive to subtle variations in porous media caused by repacking which doubled the variability between tests 2 that where the porous medium was not perturbed between tests the reproducibility was found to be consistent with previous reports and predictions from sensitivity analyses 3 the best accuracy in velocity was experienced for flow between 20 and 80 of any injector 3 4 results for α 80 in about 80 of the 235 tests the deviations of v vexpected from 1 were 30 similarly about 80 of the 52 single packed tests yielded v vexpected values that varied 15 from 1 the data suggest that in general uncertainties in velocity rise as the flow angle approaches the extremes 0 or 100 in these tests this trend was anticipated for v by eqs 6 and 7 and reflects the effects of stagnation points on the measurements fig 2 for example when the second detector d 2 is located at a stagnation point on the downstream side of a probe i e α 102 it will produce no response because the tracer is carried off the probe surface before arriving there when the detector is located slightly upstream of that location i e α 102 a response on d2 occurs but may be prematurely terminated as tracer mass leaves the probe surface due to the nearby stagnation point this effect can result in a positive bias to the estimated velocity values this bias could be at least partially responsible for the data points with the highest deviations of v from vexpected at the highest α values any positive bias to α due to the effect above turns out not to be a serious limitation for the device in practical applications as shown in fig 6 high flow angles for each detector represent probe orientations that are more favorably analyzed with alternate detectors for which the flow angles are lower for example flow with an α angle of 80 from injector 1 is only 40 from injector 2 which should produce a more reliable estimate of v with regard to the calculated flow angle α from eq 3 the experimental data indicated that again higher errors were recorded for the highest and lowest α angles this finding is in contrast to the theoretical analysis of devlin 2016 devlin showed from a sensitivity analysis of eqs 2 and 3 that the highest uncertainties on flow direction about 12 occur when α is in the mid range i e about 50 the fact that the experimental results showed the reverse with the highest deviations from expected values at α near either 0 or 100 indicates that experimental sources of uncertainty gained importance at the extreme flow angles 3 5 results for α 20 when a tracer injection port is positioned at a stagnation point the tracer velocity is theoretically zero at the point of injection this should result in a blind spot on the injection port however in practice the tracer volume is larger than a stagnation point and so mass is carried away from the injection port in two directions fig 2b therefore a measurable velocity results however the calculated values of v may be biased low due to the influence of the stagnation point this result is visible for all three injectors in fig 7b and for injectors 1 and 3 in fig 7d the magnitude of the biases seen at low flow angles appears to be explainable on the basis of eqs 6 to 9 and may therefore be anticipated better than biases at the high flow angles and perhaps corrected flow angles appeared to be overestimated at low values of αtrue fig 7a and c the reason for this follows directly from the phenomenon of tracer splitting described above a flow angle of 0 could never be measured in the conventional way because any movement of the tracer to the detectors requires a flow angle α 0 however since flow splits across the injection port in these cases and tracer should be experimentally observable at detectors on either side of the injection port it is hypothesized that a flow angle near 0 could be qualitatively indicated it was further hypothesized that a more quantitative estimate of α could be obtained if the over estimated values of α from detectors on opposite sides of the injection port were averaged fig 8 seven tests were conducted with an expected flow direction into an injection port which was then used to measure water velocity the calculated flow angles ranged from about 7 to 17 in each direction averaging the split signals resulted in estimated flow angles of 0 to 3 which was a marked improvement 4 conclusions the 360 pvp presented in this laboratory study has no effective blind spots and will likely prove useful in reconnaissance studies and investigations where groundwater flow undergoes changes in direction over time flow directions in excess of 80 from any single injection port are subject to positive biases that may be up to a factor of 2 5 however in such cases there will be an alternative port that makes a lower angle to the direction of incident flow and that will provide more reliable estimates of v velocity magnitude deviations from expected values were greatest for 10 α 80 this is partially a function of the sensitivity of the velocity estimates to the presence of stagnation points immediately upstream and downstream on the probe surface at α 20 the velocity estimate was more likely to be lower than expected but never by more than a factor of 0 5 which may be an improvement on darcy calculations in some cases estimated flow directions were also sensitive to the probe orientation in the flow system on average higher than expected estimates of α were obtained where the true angle was 0 but after averaging the estimates obtained from detectors positioned to either side of the injection port the estimated flow direction was within a few degrees of 0 the variability of pvp derived velocity measurements in a laboratory setting was found to be largely attributable to either 1 the extreme α angles or 2 variability probably in porosity arising from the re packing of the nest this result has an important implication for pvp use in the field it highlights the importance of installing pvps with as little disturbance to the aquifer material as possible the installation of sand packs or auguring of the borehole during installation are likely to introduce notable

1688,the point velocity probe pvp quantifies groundwater speed and flow direction i e velocity at the centimeter scale the first probe designs required that the flow direction be known a priori within about 100 in order to position the probe during installation this study introduces and assesses a 360 pvp that measures flow from any direction without foreknowledge of the groundwater velocity in tests conducted in a nested storage tank nest aquifer simulator packed with sand pvp measured velocities matched expected velocities within 9 in direction and 15 in magnitude on average consistent with previously reported pvp performances in laboratory studies in tests involving 17 repacked nests the measured and expected velocities were within 30 and 30 on average illustrating the sensitivity of flow to porous medium packing and the probes ability to sense these changes the porosity was found to vary considerably between packings i e n 0 34 0 2 for flow directions between 0 and 80 of an injection port the experimental error on velocity magnitude was within the ranges reported above at higher flow angles experimental sources of error contributed to greater uncertainties fortunately in these cases there were always alternative injection ports with lower angles to flow that could be used to circumvent any biases at low experimental flow angles 10 the calculated values tended to overestimate the actual flow angles fortunately these cases were identifiable by the detection of tracer at detectors on either side of the active injection port in several tests designed with an expected flow direction of 0 averaging the calculated directions from each side of the injection port resulted in improved matches to the expected flow direction 1 introduction groundwater velocity

uncertainties calculated from these calculations do not account for all experimental sources of error though some are incorporated in δα such as variabilities in injection rates volumes tracer concentrations porous medium heterogeneity or artifacts introduced during probe installation transient flow or operator error therefore the calculations represent minimum errors for the value of δα that is used nevertheless the agreement between the theoretical uncertainties and the deviations from v vexpected 1 in the experiments dashed lines and symbols in fig 7b and d respectively indicates that the major sources of uncertainty are understood 3 3 the effects of tank packing a total of 235 pvp tests were performed in this study in which velocity magnitude and direction were calculated these tests were conducted with the probe oriented at 36 different angles and involved 17 re packings of the nest repacking of the tank was necessary when evaporative losses of the water between tests e g overnight or on days when tests were not run led to unsaturated conditions developing in the upper few centimeters of the packed sand the nest was occasionally repacked for other operational reasons such as verification of injection port alignment or integrity of the injection port screens as alluded to above the velocity magnitude results of the various tests were compared as normalized values by dividing the pvp measured velocities v by the corresponding expected velocities vexpected this facilitated comparisons between tests in which the pumping rates q and saturated areas a varied slightly and assisted the identification of patterns of uncertainty a comparison of the calculated ranges of uncertainty from eqs 6 to 9 and the scatter in the experimentally derived values of v vexpected shows that over the 235 tests conducted the experimental data exhibited scatter in flow angles on the order of 30 and in v vexpected 30 see gray area in fig 7b where experimental points lie outside the range of uncertainty shown by the dashed lines sources of uncertainty not accounted for in the equations are indicated a likely source of such uncertainty comes from variations in the porous media of each repacking it was noted that gravimetrically determined porosities over six replicate packings in 600ml beakers varied on average 0 34 0 2 reflecting the sensitivity of porosity to packing this alone could account for much of the 30 in v vexpected obtained experimentally however it should be noted that the porosity variability probably reflects a range of spatially variable porosity that could be achieved within a single tank repacking as well reflecting average porosity differences between separate nest packings to further evaluate the effect of repacking on measured velocity variation flow directions obtained from a single packing were compiled and compared to the entire dataset figs 7c and d in the single packing tests the uncertainty in flow angle was found to be 9 and the experimental values of v vexpected varied 15 on average in good agreement with predictions from eqs 6 to 9 and also in close agreement with expectations from previously reported work labaky et al 2007 devlin 2016 these findings indicate that the 3 injector pvps can measure flow from any direction as designed further it was shown that the measurements 1 are sensitive to subtle variations in porous media caused by repacking which doubled the variability between tests 2 that where the porous medium was not perturbed between tests the reproducibility was found to be consistent with previous reports and predictions from sensitivity analyses 3 the best accuracy in velocity was experienced for flow between 20 and 80 of any injector 3 4 results for α 80 in about 80 of the 235 tests the deviations of v vexpected from 1 were 30 similarly about 80 of the 52 single packed tests yielded v vexpected values that varied 15 from 1 the data suggest that in general uncertainties in velocity rise as the flow angle approaches the extremes 0 or 100 in these tests this trend was anticipated for v by eqs 6 and 7 and reflects the effects of stagnation points on the measurements fig 2 for example when the second detector d 2 is located at a stagnation point on the downstream side of a probe i e α 102 it will produce no response because the tracer is carried off the probe surface before arriving there when the detector is located slightly upstream of that location i e α 102 a response on d2 occurs but may be prematurely terminated as tracer mass leaves the probe surface due to the nearby stagnation point this effect can result in a positive bias to the estimated velocity values this bias could be at least partially responsible for the data points with the highest deviations of v from vexpected at the highest α values any positive bias to α due to the effect above turns out not to be a serious limitation for the device in practical applications as shown in fig 6 high flow angles for each detector represent probe orientations that are more favorably analyzed with alternate detectors for which the flow angles are lower for example flow with an α angle of 80 from injector 1 is only 40 from injector 2 which should produce a more reliable estimate of v with regard to the calculated flow angle α from eq 3 the experimental data indicated that again higher errors were recorded for the highest and lowest α angles this finding is in contrast to the theoretical analysis of devlin 2016 devlin showed from a sensitivity analysis of eqs 2 and 3 that the highest uncertainties on flow direction about 12 occur when α is in the mid range i e about 50 the fact that the experimental results showed the reverse with the highest deviations from expected values at α near either 0 or 100 indicates that experimental sources of uncertainty gained importance at the extreme flow angles 3 5 results for α 20 when a tracer injection port is positioned at a stagnation point the tracer velocity is theoretically zero at the point of injection this should result in a blind spot on the injection port however in practice the tracer volume is larger than a stagnation point and so mass is carried away from the injection port in two directions fig 2b therefore a measurable velocity results however the calculated values of v may be biased low due to the influence of the stagnation point this result is visible for all three injectors in fig 7b and for injectors 1 and 3 in fig 7d the magnitude of the biases seen at low flow angles appears to be explainable on the basis of eqs 6 to 9 and may therefore be anticipated better than biases at the high flow angles and perhaps corrected flow angles appeared to be overestimated at low values of αtrue fig 7a and c the reason for this follows directly from the phenomenon of tracer splitting described above a flow angle of 0 could never be measured in the conventional way because any movement of the tracer to the detectors requires a flow angle α 0 however since flow splits across the injection port in these cases and tracer should be experimentally observable at detectors on either side of the injection port it is hypothesized that a flow angle near 0 could be qualitatively indicated it was further hypothesized that a more quantitative estimate of α could be obtained if the over estimated values of α from detectors on opposite sides of the injection port were averaged fig 8 seven tests were conducted with an expected flow direction into an injection port which was then used to measure water velocity the calculated flow angles ranged from about 7 to 17 in each direction averaging the split signals resulted in estimated flow angles of 0 to 3 which was a marked improvement 4 conclusions the 360 pvp presented in this laboratory study has no effective blind spots and will likely prove useful in reconnaissance studies and investigations where groundwater flow undergoes changes in direction over time flow directions in excess of 80 from any single injection port are subject to positive biases that may be up to a factor of 2 5 however in such cases there will be an alternative port that makes a lower angle to the direction of incident flow and that will provide more reliable estimates of v velocity magnitude deviations from expected values were greatest for 10 α 80 this is partially a function of the sensitivity of the velocity estimates to the presence of stagnation points immediately upstream and downstream on the probe surface at α 20 the velocity estimate was more likely to be lower than expected but never by more than a factor of 0 5 which may be an improvement on darcy calculations in some cases estimated flow directions were also sensitive to the probe orientation in the flow system on average higher than expected estimates of α were obtained where the true angle was 0 but after averaging the estimates obtained from detectors positioned to either side of the injection port the estimated flow direction was within a few degrees of 0 the variability of pvp derived velocity measurements in a laboratory setting was found to be largely attributable to either 1 the extreme α angles or 2 variability probably in porosity arising from the re packing of the nest this result has an important implication for pvp use in the field it highlights the importance of installing pvps with as little disturbance to the aquifer material as possible the installation of sand packs or auguring of the borehole during installation are likely to introduce notable uncertainties in the porous media packing and pvp measurements acknowledgements angela eichler kevin walter and rubina firdous are acknowledged for their assistance and insights with the research

1689,it is evident based on historical data that groundwater contaminant plumes persist at many sites requiring costly long term management high resolution site characterization methods are needed to support accurate risk assessments and to select design and operate effective remediation operations most subsurface characterization methods are generally limited in their ability to provide unambiguous real time delineation of specific processes affecting mass transfer transformation and mass removal and accurate estimation of associated rates an integrated contaminant elution and tracer test toolkit comprising a set of local scale groundwater extraction and injection tests was developed to ameliorate the primary limitations associated with standard characterization methods the test employs extended groundwater extraction to stress the system and induce hydraulic and concentration gradients clean water can be injected which removes the resident aqueous contaminant mass present in the higher permeability zones and isolates the test zone from the surrounding plume this ensures that the concentrations and fluxes measured within the isolated area are directly and predominantly influenced by the local mass transfer and transformation processes controlling mass removal a suite of standard and novel tracers can be used to delineate specific mass transfer and attenuation processes that are active at a given site and to quantify the associated mass transfer and transformation rates the conceptual basis for the test is first presented followed by an illustrative application based on simulations produced with a 3 d mathematical model and a brief case study application keywords tracer test attenuation plume persistence mass removal mass discharge site characterization 1 introduction groundwater contamination by organic compounds such as chlorinated aliphatics 1 4 dioxane mtbe and poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas continues to be an issue of import for many industrial commercial and military facilities at many of these sites groundwater contaminant plumes which are typically hundreds of meters to several kilometers long pose current or potential risks to human health and or water resource sustainability despite two to three decades of remedial operations at many of these sites groundwater contamination continues to persist presenting complex and costly challenges to complete remediation and closure of the sites it is now recognized that cleanup and closure of many sites with large complex plumes is impractical within time frames of 50 100years using current technologies and approaches e g national research council nrc 2013 this realization has resulted in the examination of cost effective alternatives for risk reduction and long term sustainable management of these sites nrc 2013 the factors and processes that can limit effective contaminant mass removal and contribute to the persistence of groundwater contamination are well known primary factors involve mass removal constraints associated with contaminant residing in poorly accessible retention domains and or occurring in phases for which mass transfer is rate limited i e potentially any mass other than matter occurring in groundwater that resides within advection dominated domains this mass includes immiscible organic liquid in source zones napl sources and distributed sources of contaminant such as sorbed phase mass dissolved mass residing within lower permeability units and mass associated with other potential retention phases vapor phase partitioned to napl adsorbed at fluid fluid interfaces while most of these factors and their potential impacts are well known the difficulty faced for effective site characterization and cleanup is delineating and quantifying their relevance for a specific site the ability to identify and quantify with reasonable certainty the specific mass transfer and or attenuation processes active at a given site is critical for accurate risk assessment for robust selection and design of remediation systems and for effective long term site management current standard characterization methods such as plume scale analysis of concentration profiles analysis of concentration profiles associated with sediment cores and mass flux fences are generally limited in their ability to provide unambiguous real time delineation of specific mass transfer and attenuation processes and accurate estimation of associated rates the development of innovative cost effective field methods for improved characterization of mass removal processes has been deemed a critical research need nrc 2013 serdp strategic environmental research and development program 2013 a standard method used to characterize groundwater contaminant persistence and attenuation is based on the analysis of plume scale concentration vs distance profiles determined along the longitudinal axis of the plume e g newell et al 2002 an alternative approach employing mass flux fences is based on measurement of contaminant mass fluxes at two or more control planes oriented perpendicular to the mean plume trajectory the mass flux can be measured using a network of multi level samplers or flux meters e g borden et al 1997 king et al 1999 basu et al 2006 or by use of contaminant pumping tests e g bockelmann et al 2001 as has been well established these approaches are often subject to considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors e g barker et al 2000 newell et al 2002 chapelle et al 2007 first the methods provide measures of aggregate behavior i e the combined contribution of all processes and factors contributing to mass transfer and attenuation because the individual processes are not explicitly delineated the rate coefficients obtained from analysis of these data are composite lumped parameters this limits their usefulness for predicting how the system will respond to changes in conditions such as induced by modification of well field configuration or operation for hydraulic based remediation systems or introduction of a reagent to enhance contaminant mass transfer or transformation brusseau 1998 chapelle et al 2007 this in turn limits their utility for accurately assessing persistence or for evaluating the impact of efforts to enhance mass removal a second significant limitation is the impact of preferential flow phenomena contaminant present in groundwater flowing in the higher permeability domains typically provides the predominant contribution to concentrations measured with groundwater sampling or flux meter devices this advective preferential flow component can in some cases obscure the concentration signals associated with rate limited mass transfer processes such as diffusion from lower permeability domains often termed back diffusion and desorption methods for providing local scale characterization of attenuation have been developed with standard approaches based on the analysis of concentration vs depth profiles obtained from high resolution sampling of sediment cores or of groundwater e g johnson et al 1989 ball et al 1997 brusseau et al 1999a 2007 chapman and parker 2005 these concentration profiles reflect the composite impact of all mass transfer and attenuation processes active at that location thus delineation of specific attenuation processes and quantification of process specific rates is typically influenced by significant ambiguity and uncertainty this limits their overall utility similar to the standard plume scale methods discussed above in addition the methods provide data that are produced under natural gradient conditions typically demarcated by relatively slow rates of mass transfer and transformation for at least some relevant attenuation processes this results in two major potential limitations one the method may exhibit poor sensitivity to processes that have slower characteristic rates second long often impractical monitoring times may be required to accurately characterize these processes another major limitation is caused by the influence of spatial and temporal heterogeneity inherent to sites i e the measurements pertain only to the borehole and its close vicinity and for one snapshot in time this introduces uncertainty regarding their representativeness and may require significant cost to overcome induced gradient contaminant elution tests cet or contaminant elution tests for short also referred to as contaminant pumping tests or mass discharge tests are another approach for site characterization cets have been used to evaluate and quantify mass removal behavior characterize the impact of mass transfer and attenuation processes on contaminant transport and measure contaminant mass discharge this test is typically conducted by pumping an extraction well for an extended period and monitoring contaminant concentrations in the discharge the effluent concentration data are used to produce a contaminant elution curve which is analyzed to characterize mass removal behavior these data can also be used to determine contaminant mass discharge and to evaluate the potential impact of mass transfer and attenuation processes whiffen and bahr 1985 conducted a combined contaminant elution and tracer test within a groundwater contaminant plume at a site in gloucester canada to evaluate the potential effectiveness of pump and treat as a remedial option the test site was approximately 100m from the source zone and the primary contaminants investigated were tetrahydrofuran diethylether and 1 1 1 trichloroethane nonreactive tracers were used to characterize pore water velocities and dispersivities bahr 1989 applied mathematical modeling to the cet data from whiffen and bahr to assess the potential impact of rate limited sorption desorption on transport brusseau 1993a b applied a multiprocess mass transfer model to the same data to delineate and quantify the apparent specific processes controlling mass removal thorbjarnarson and mackay 1997 conducted a combined contaminant elution and tracer test at rocky mountain arsenal in colorado to characterize contaminant transport behavior during groundwater extraction the test was conducted within the distal portion of a groundwater contaminant plume composed primarily of trichloroethene and 1 1 1 trichloroethane approximately 1km from the source zones sahoo et al 1998 conducted a variation of a contaminant elution test at the picatinny arsenal in new jersey to characterize the impact of rate limited sorption and the addition of surfactant on trichloroethene removal the test was implemented by injecting uncontaminated groundwater and sampling downgradient monitoring wells with no extraction wells employed it was conducted in the center of a groundwater contaminant plume approximately 350m from the source zone all of the prior noted cet applications were conducted explicitly for systems with no immiscible organic liquid present within the test domain i e within the plumes and away from source zones brusseau and colleagues conducted combined contaminant elution and tracer tests within a chlorinated solvent napl source zone at a site in tucson az nelson and brusseau 1996 1997 blue et al 1998 brusseau et al 1999a 2007 the tests were conducted to delineate and quantify the specific processes contributing to the constrained mass removal observed for the pump and treat system and the concomitant plume persistence trichloroethene is the primary contaminant of concern at the site the base cet method suffers from two of the same limitations as the prior methods discussed one is the confounding influence of the contaminant plume and preferential flow the cet can be modified to reduce or eliminate this issue by using injection wells to inject clean water which removes the resident aqueous contaminant mass present in the higher permeability zones and isolates a portion of the test zone from the surrounding plume the application of this coupled injection extraction concept for evaluating the impact of mass transfer and attenuation processes on transport was employed in most of the studies noted above the other limitation for the standard cet is that the observed contaminant elution behavior reflects the aggregate impact of all mass transfer and attenuation processes influencing contaminant transport for that system analysis of such data will return lumped rate coefficients when mass removal is influenced by more than one process but those processes are not accounted for individually delineation of specific processes can be accomplished by employing process specific tracer tests along with the cet for example most of the cet applications noted above used nonreactive tracers to characterize advective dispersive solute transport more definitively a tracer suite can be employed that incudes tracers targeted to characterize specific mass transfer or transformation processes examples include tracers to characterize partitioning to napl diffusive mass transfer impacts and transformation induced mass loss the integration of the various available tracer tests with the cet constitutes the integrated contaminant elution and tracer test toolkit brusseau 2017 the various components of the icet3 have been used to varying degrees in individual applications for some time a strength of the integrated toolkit is the synergism attained from the concurrent implementation of the individual components despite the several benefits and advantages of the method it has apparently yet to become widely applied the objective of this work is to present the concept and elements of the integrated cet toolkit approach application of specific test components will be illustrated with a case study implementation and data analysis aspects will be covered briefly 2 applications for the icet3 the integrated contaminant elution and tracer test toolkit icet3 method is an integration of aquifer perturbation and tracer test methods coupled with the use of standard and novel tracers to target specific individual mass transfer and attenuation processes fig 1 it employs extended groundwater extraction to stress the system and induce and increase hydraulic and concentration gradients in many cases this serves to enhance the sensitivity of the method by perturbing extant magnitudes and rates of mass transfer and transformation this also reduces the time required for obtaining quality measurements and thus increases the ability to obtain measurements in reasonable timeframes injection wells can be employed for injection of clean water which ensures that the concentrations and fluxes measured within the isolated area are directly and predominantly influenced by the local mass transfer and transformation processes controlling mass removal the suite of tracers is selected to allow characterization of specific processes and quantification of associated rate coefficients the test interrogates a much larger volume compared to borehole based methods reducing uncertainty associated with spatial variability the spatial domain interrogated by the test can be scaled according to site conditions and test objectives which allows for cost effective optimization of the test the test can be conducted multiple times to characterize the impact of natural temporal variability or that of human induced perturbations during the icet3 test groundwater samples are collected periodically from the extraction well and monitoring wells if desired and analyzed for the target constituents contaminants of concern tracers nutrients transformation products the constituent concentrations are used to produce elution curves for the contaminants and breakthrough curves comprising both arrival and elution waves for the tracers fig 2 these curves provide the foundation data sets for the various applications of the method it should be noted that groundwater levels can be monitored during the test to provide data for characterization of aquifer hydraulic properties 2 1 characterize mass removal and contaminant persistence a primary application for the standard and integrated cet is its use for characterization of mass removal behavior generally it constitutes the most effective method for such characterization the contaminant elution curves are inspected to determine the type of behavior exhibited specifically the elution curve profiles are examined for specific landmarks such as the presence and extent of steady state relatively uniform concentrations and asymptotic slow rate of decrease to low concentrations stages as well as distinct changes in slope the observed behavior is interpreted in conjunction with the site conceptual model to evaluate mass removal scenarios and help identify the one most likely representative of the extant system this information is used to evaluate the potential impact of rate limited mass transfer or transformation processes on contaminant transport and fate several examples of possible contaminant elution curve profiles are shown in fig 3 five distinct types of behavior are represented i high concentration steady state ii low concentration steady state iii high concentration asymptotic iv low concentration asymptotic and v multi stage each type of behavior is associated with a specific type or types of mass removal condition which is mediated by the amount of the contaminant present its hydraulic accessibility distribution of the contaminant hydraulic properties of the system and the potential for contaminant transformation for example type i and ii behavior would be anticipated for systems in which a large mass of non dissolved phase contaminant is distributed relatively uniformly within the domain and mass transfer is significantly rate limited or the mass is located within a fraction of the domain and the measured concentrations are influenced by significant dilution or some combination thereof the distinction between type i and ii would relate to site conditions and the specific nature of the non dissolved phase mass and or rates of transformation type i would be expected for example for situations wherein napl sources are present whereas type ii may be prevalent for systems with distributed contaminant phases such as dissolved mass present in lower permeability domains or sorbed mass and no napl alternatively both type i and ii may represent a site with substantial non dissolved phase mass distributed in similar manner with the difference in steady state concentrations reflecting the impact of relatively high rates of transformation for type ii type iv behavior may connote that nearly all contaminant present is hydraulically accessible and is present in limited quantities and or influenced by relatively rapid rates of transformation for example contaminant that is present primarily as dissolved mass in the higher permeability domains of the system type iii behavior may represent a system similar to type i but for which mass transfer constraints are not as extreme multistage elution profiles may occur for systems wherein contaminant mass is distributed in multiple domains for which characteristic times of mass transfer are distinctly different type v mathematical modeling can be used to assist in the analysis and interpretation of cet data when interpreting elution curve data it is critical to deconvolute the impact of the regional plume from the local processes influencing mass transfer and attenuation in addition it is important to recognize that the observed behavior is an aggregation of all factors and processes influencing mass removal data analysis and interpretation should always be reflective of this reality this leads to the next application delineation of specific processes 2 2 delineate specific mass transfer and attenuation processes as discussed in the preceding subsection cet data can be used to evaluate the impact of mass transfer and attenuation processes on mass removal this analysis can be extended to identify specific operative processes in this regard interpretation of the test results is relatively straightforward for a system in which a single mass transfer or attenuation process is predominant however for many systems contaminant transport and mass removal is influenced by multiple processes in such cases a suite of tracers can be used to help delineate and characterize specific processes and their respective impact on mass removal various types of tracers can be used each to target a specific transport mass transfer or transformation process 1 conservative tracer a conservative tracer one that is not subject to sorption other retention processes or transformation reactions i e an analogue to water is used to characterize advective dispersive transport residence times and flow heterogeneity this standard tracer approach has been widely employed for site characterization additionally multiple conservative tracers with different molecular weights i e diffusion coefficients can be used to characterize specifically the occurrence of diffusive mass transfer back diffusion and its impact on contaminant transport brusseau 1993 maloszewski and zuber 1993 nelson et al 2003 specifically for a system influenced by a diffusive mass transfer process the rates of mass transfer will differ for solutes with different diffusion coefficients thus tracers with different diffusion coefficients should exhibit dissimilar transport behavior e g different amounts of spreading different extents of tailing for a given set of conditions this is illustrated in fig 2 2 sorptive retention tracers tracers can be used to characterize the impact of retention on transport one example are tracers that are sorbed by the sediment to evaluate the impact of sorption and retardation on transport and mass transfer other examples include tracers selected to probe other potential retention processes such as partitioning to napl to fluid fluid interfaces and to trapped air phases related tracer test methods involve the use of partitioning tracers to characterize the presence and quantity of napl present in source zones water content in vadose zones and the magnitude of fluid fluid interface e g nelson and brusseau 1996 annable et al 1998a 1998b deeds et al 1999 cain et al 2000 keller and brusseau 2003 3 biotransformation tracer susceptible to biotransformation but is not affected by abiotic transformation this type of tracer is used to characterize the specific impact of biotransformation processes tracer tests conducted with biodegradable tracers have been used successfully to characterize the impact of biotransformation processes istok et al 1997 brusseau et al 1999b alter et al 2003 sandrin et al 2004 products of biotransformation can be monitored along with the target tracer to provide additional data 4 abiotic transformation tracer susceptible to abiotic transformation but is not affected by biotransformation this tracer type is used to characterize the specific impact of natural abiotic transformation processes such as mineral induced reduction products of abiotic transformation can be monitored along with the target tracer to provide additional data note that tracers can be selected to characterize speciation changes for inorganics due to abitoic or biotic for biotransformation processes it should be noted that the tracers discussed above generally refer to surrogates for contaminants of concern at a site of course actual contaminants of interest can be used as tracers in these tests as well which has often been done at research sites however such use at typical contaminated sites is often precluded the use of this integrated tracer suite provides a means to identify the contributions of individual processes to mass removal including back diffusion desorption biotransformation and abiotic transformation the use of injected tracers allows accurate determination of mass recoveries and associated magnitudes and rates of mass transfer and transformation thus the test can provide improved quantitative determination of the specific contributions of individual processes to overall mass removal and persistence 2 3 quantitative analysis and determination of rate coefficients it should be stressed that the qualitative analysis discussed above is just as important as quantitative analysis as discussed most field sites will entail conditions wherein multiple processes contribute to mass removal the qualitative analysis supported by the test allows delineation of specific attenuation processes and thus enhances the accuracy of the rate coefficients determined from quantitative analysis one method used to obtain rate coefficients is based on fitting selected functions to the contaminant tracer elution curve these functions range from a simple first order decay function e g newell et al 2002 to power law functions for which the power law magnitude has been correlated to specific mass transfer behavior e g haggerty et al 2000 luo et al 2007 another method of analysis is based on temporal moment analysis e g leij and dane 1992 das and kluitenberg 1996 srivastava et al 2004 das et al 2005 luo et al 2006 standard methods are available for application of function and moment analysis to elution and breakthrough curves a major advantage of using function or moment analysis is that it does not require the use of mathematical transport modeling and does not require the attendant input data that are potentially costly and time consuming to obtain a major disadvantage of these methods of analysis is that the rate coefficients obtained are aggregate lumped parameters representing the contribution of all processes that influenced the transport of that constituent however the design of the icet3 test with its use of a suite of tracers can minimize this limitation for example analysis of nonreactive tracer data will provide specific characterization of diffusive mass transfer rate coefficients similarly the rate coefficient determined for the abiotic tracer data will reflect the impact of abiotic related attenuation another potential limitation for data analysis is associated with data truncation incomplete elution curves which can increase uncertainty of the estimated parameters methods to account for the impact of data truncation on parameter estimation are available e g skopp 1984 das and kluitenberg 1996 luo et al 2006 in addition the use of flow interruption or stop flow tests can help compensate for data truncation and other issues brusseau et al 1989 1997 the other method used to quantitatively analyze icet3 test data and to obtain rate coefficients is based on the application of reactive transport modeling it must be stressed that it is critical to use a process discrete distributed parameter approach to modeling wherein each transport mass transfer and attenuation process is explicitly and separately represented as has been well established the use of simplified lumped process models provides generally poor results for systems with multiple processes affecting migration and attenuation e g brusseau 1998 chapelle et al 2007 the use of process discrete modeling improves the determination of accurate process specific rate coefficients the primary disadvantage of using complex process specific transport models is the significant data input requirements however implementation of an icet study is an effective way to obtain much of the required input data quality assurance and quality control procedures should be implemented for assessing overall robustness of the test data this would include identification of possible outliers and potential impacts of sampling or analytical artifacts the relatively high temporal resolution of the icet test is an advantage for conducting such assessments the process specific information gleaned from the tests is another advantage 2 4 other applications contaminant mass flux or discharge cmd has become an alternate or supplemental metric for use in characterizing risk and evaluating the performance of remedial operations multiple methods are available to measure cmd with the cet one such approach the cet method has been used for example to measure cmd before and after a large scale in situ chemical oxidation project conducted at a federal superfund site in tucson to evaluate remedial operation performance brusseau et al 2011a the mass of contaminant present at the time of characterization and remediation referred to herein as resident contaminant mass is a critical parameter for assessing risk and evaluating remediation efforts for contaminated sites unfortunately accurate determination of resident mass is generally problematic at most sites with the standard characterization method high resolution coring being typically cost prohibitive to employ however resident mass can be estimated by fitting simple mass depletion functions to measured cet data for example mass depletion functions have been applied to cmd data obtained from cets conducted within napl source zones brusseau et al 2013a johnston et al 2013 the cet is ideal for evaluating the potential effectiveness of hydraulic based remediation methods for example solutions of reagent s e g surfactants oxidants electron acceptors electron donors associated with a remediation technology under consideration can be injected to test effectiveness essentially these are implemented as pilot tests of the proposed technology the data can be analyzed as has been discussed for the cet applications to enhance knowledge gained from the pilot tests 3 implementation the design of the test and the selection of components employed will depend upon the objectives of the test and site conditions the specific configuration of the well field the operational pumping rates and the length of the test are primary design variables multiple additional factors need to be considered to ensure successful implementation mathematical modeling can be conducted to assist in the design of the tests and is particularly recommended for more complex systems 3 1 well field configuration the standard well field configuration for contaminant elution and tracer tests comprises a single injection extraction dipole fig 4 a variation consists of multiple injection and extraction wells arranged separately in two parallel lines either approach can provide isolation of the central region of the test domain but data collected from the extraction well s remains influenced by the surrounding plume this is a significant limitation for some applications because the extraction well provides critical data for analysis of transport and attenuation recently guo and brusseau 2017 evaluated alternative well field configurations to improve isolation of the extraction well from the plume for these tests two alternative configurations were tested and compared to the standard dipole fig 4b and c the results demonstrated that the nested couplet configuration established isolation of the inner extraction well from the surrounding plume hence it appears useful for applications in which isolation from the plume is desired however such isolation is not desired for other applications including those charactering mass removal associated with the plume itself a tandem vertical circulation well system can be used in place of the standard injection extraction wells to eliminate the need for extracting large volumes of groundwater to the surface and subsequent treatment this can be done for example using the approach presented by goltz et al 2009 who used the system to measure mass flux this approach may be advantageous for sites with limited capability to treat contaminated groundwater or where regulatory limits preclude injection implementation of icet tests with such a configuration would require in well treatment of contaminants to maintain clean water injection and tracer removal or specific accounting for tracer reinjection 3 2 additional test components in addition to this baseline design additional components can be implemented including i vertical discretization of sampling the extraction and monitoring wells can be fitted with vertically discrete sampling devices to characterize vertical variability the use of multiple monitoring wells interspersed within the target domain provides characterization of areal spatial variability ii stop flow tests can be conducted to enhance characterization of rate limited phenomena these tests developed by brusseau et al 1989 1997 have since been widely used to characterize mass transfer processes for example potential concentration rebound can be monitored within the isolated zone to specifically evaluate the impact and rates of back diffusion and desorption brogan and gailey 1995 presented a method to estimate field scale mass transfer rate parameters based on analyzing concentrations of a resident contaminant obtained during the recovery phase of a groundwater pumping test the method was successfully demonstrated using mathematical modeling simulations for a system with rate limited sorption as the mass transfer limitation iii push pull tests can be conducted within the isolated zone of the test domain to provide additional smaller scale characterization of specific processes these tests wherein solutions are injected into the aquifer and then extracted after a given reaction period e g drever and mckee 1980 istok et al 1997 hansen et al 2016 have been used for example to characterize attenuation particularly biotransformation processes and to measure attenuation rates these tests have been demonstrated to provide robust characterization of transformation processes under certain conditions they are also used to characterize hydrodynamic transport behavior and the impact of retention processes on transport a major potential limitation of the push pull method is increased uncertainty due to poor tracer recovery in some cases one case occurs for systems wherein the rates of attenuation are relatively slow compared to the hydraulic residence times i e sites with relatively large groundwater velocities for this case a significant fraction of the injected solution may migrate outside of the zone of recapture during the non pumping phase and thus would not be extracted during the pull phase this would lead to significant loss of tracer and result in greater uncertainty in estimated parameters as shown by the results of field tests burbery et al 2004 this issue would need to be considered for application with an ongoing icet small volume vertically discrete push pull tests can be conducted using multilevel sampling devices located within the isolated zone to provide high resolution characterization of processes in the vertical dimension while at the same time reducing the influence of potential mass loss issues this can be done for example using the method presented by knecht et al 2011 tests can be conducted at different locations within the test zone to characterize areal spatial variability 3 3 additional implementation factors and potential constraints it is critical to consider all factors that may influence or limit implementation of the tests as well as the potential impacts of the tests on the subsurface system generally the greatest potential impact is the possible alteration of subsurface conditions with the injection of clean water for example electron acceptors other than oxygen are predominant in many groundwater contaminant plumes introducing oxygenated water may significantly alter redox conditions thereby affecting redox sensitive reactions and associated reactants and products similarly differences in ph between the injected water and resident groundwater may affect ph sensitive conditions microbial community profile ionic composition and temperature are other factors to consider therefore it is imperative that the biogeochemical properties of the injected water be matched to the target subsurface system this can often be accomplished by using resident groundwater as the source for injected water subject to appropriate procedures to maintain representativeness while meeting the requirements for the test the effective range of tracer detection is an important factor to consider in tracer selection this is influenced by the analytical method s available and associated quantitative detection limits as well as potential impacts of the environmental matrix e g presence of background concentrations of the selected tracer or interferences ideally the conditions will support a detection range of several logs to better characterize transport behavior in addition the detection range would span lower concentration ranges such that high injection concentrations are not required which will minimize solution density contrasts and other potential undesirable impacts it is also desirable that the tracers employed have minimal impact on the subsurface system except as specifically targeted for example the tracers should not affect the sorption of resident contaminants nor induce mobilization of napl present in addition the tracers should not contribute to long term groundwater contamination another condition for implementing the test is on site capacity to treat the volumes of contaminated groundwater extracted during the test as noted above one advantage of the icet method is the much larger measurement volume compared to standard borehole based methods in addition the measured domain is a design variable that can be tailored to site conditions and test objectives through the dimensions of the well field as well as the use of interspersed monitoring wells and vertical spatial variability can be characterized with use of vertically discrete sampling as noted the typical configuration would produce areal measurement domains of roughly several 10s to a few 1000s of m2 and can be matched to mesh sizes used for field scale mathematical modeling however due the nature of the tests smaller scale heterogeneity is not captured sediment coring or push pull tests can be implemented to supplement the icet if so desired 4 illustrative applications 4 1 simulated example test a simulated icet test is presented to illustrate the types of data that would be collected as well as to present an example of timeframes required to complete the test the properties of the domain were selected to be generally representative of an alluvial aquifer system with values for some parameters patterned after information generated from our prior studies conducted at the tucson international airport area tiaa superfund site zhang and brusseau 1999 the flow model used in this work was modflow the three dimensional 3d finite difference numerical model developed by the u s geological survey mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 harbaugh et al 2000 the 3d solute transport model mt3d with tvd solver zheng 1990 was used to simulate solute transport groundwater vista gv version 6 85 rumbaugh and rumbaugh 2007 and groundwater modeling system gms version 7 1 environmental modeling research laboratory emrl 2005 were used as graphical user interfaces the model domain was 625 square meters the domain was divided into a regular orthogonal grid consisting of 100 rows and 100 columns with grid space 0 25 m 0 25 m the grid size was set to ensure numerical accuracy for the given simulation conditions the thickness of the domain was 10m which was split into 10 layers with 1m thickness for each layer the test area where the injection extraction well system was set up was 5 m 3 m a random field generator gutjahr 1989 was used to derive realizations of k for the aquifer unit of the domain it was assumed that the permeability of the sand was lognormally distributed with mean ln k and variance σ y 2 the simulations were conducted in a domain with permeability heterogeneity of arithmetic mean value of k equal to 10m d and σ y 2 as 5 specified head boundaries were used along right and left borders of the model with natural gradient 0 01 under confined conditions inducing groundwater flow from the left to right side longitudinal dispersivity was set to 0 05m based on standard grid peclet number criteria and transverse and vertical dispersivities were set to 0 005 and 0 0005m respectively a porosity of 0 3 and bulk density of 1 73g cm3 were used two injection wells were used with flow rate of 1m3 d for each well and one extraction well located between the injection wells was used with extraction rate of 2m3 d the injection and extraction wells were screened through the entire thickness of the domain the initial tracer concentration was zero for the entire domain the tracers were injected via the upgradient injection well and clean water was injected via the downgradient injection well four different tracers were used the first two are non reactive tracers nrt with diffusion coefficients of 0 0076 and 0 00076m2 d respectively the third is a sorptive tracer with a diffusion coefficient of 0 0076m2 d and distribution coefficient kd of 0 35ml g resulting in a retardation factor of 3 for this example sorption is assumed to be linear and rate limited first order kinetics was applied with the mass transfer desorption rate coefficient set at 15d 1 the fourth tracer was a transformation tracer and the transformation process was simulated by first order irreversible kinetics with the aqueous phase rate constant set at 0 04d 1 the tracers were injected continuously for 10days followed by 100days of monitoring the properties of the resident contaminant were set to represent a conservative constituent no sorption or decay to allow illustration of the impact of physical heterogeneity and back diffusion on mass removal the entire domain was contaminated with an initial concentration set to 1g m3 temporal data were collected in high resolution from the extraction well for the simulations the elution curve for the resident contaminant and breakthrough curves for the tracers produced using the time continuous concentrations are presented in fig 2a different transport behavior with different amounts of spreading and tailing are observed for the two non reactive tracers with different diffusion coefficients this observed difference signifies the impact of diffusive mass transfer on transport the breakthrough of the sorptive tracer occurs later compared to the curves for the non reactive tracers because of the impact of retardation the concentrations for the transformation tracer are much lower as a result of degradation long tailing is observed in the elution curve for the resident contaminant which is attributed to the influences of the surrounding plume and back diffusion these different behaviors reflected in the breakthrough elution curves are the result of the contributions of individual processes to transport it is often very useful to examine breakthrough curve and elution data in a semilog format to better evaluate potential mass transfer limitations and the impact of flow heterogeneities fig 2b the effective pore volume pv of the test domain was 45m3 and approximately 0 22 pv of tracer solution was injected by the end of the simulation approximately 5 pv of groundwater was extracted the impacts of different processes on transport were readily apparent after 60days equivalent to approximately 3 pv of groundwater being extracted increases to the pumping rates would shorten the overall experiment time these results illustrate that icet tests can be conducted in reasonable time frames 4 2 application at the tucson international airport area superfund site brusseau and colleagues conducted an extensive study of source zone remediation efforts and associated groundwater contaminant plume behavior for a chlorinated solvent contaminated site in az undergoing pump and treat remediation the site that was the focus of the study is part of the tiaa federal superfund site in southern arizona a large multiple source plume of trichloroethene and 1 1 dichloroethene exists in the upper portion of the regional aquifer which in the past was the primary source of potable water for the tucson metropolitan area administratively the tiaa site is separated into two major zones the north and south sections the study site is located within the south section three primary napl contaminated source zones have been delineated in the south section the major hydrogeologic units in the area of the site have been designated as in descending order with depth the unsaturated zone the upper aquifer an aquitard unit and the lower aquifer the unsaturated zone extends from the land surface to the regional groundwater surface which is located 30 to 40m below ground surface bgs the upper aquifer extends from the regional groundwater surface to a depth of approximately 54 to 66m bgs where it is underlain by the aquitard unit the upper aquifer consists of sand and gravel lenses layers separated in some areas by clayey sediment ranging from 1m to greater than 7m in thickness the contaminants are limited primarily to the upper 6 m thick portion of the upper aquifer concentrations of trichloroethene in groundwater ranged from less than 100 to approximately 12 000μg l within the study site the dce concentrations are approximately ten times lower than the tce concentrations multiple methods including induced gradient contaminant elution tests multiple solute tracer tests high resolution sediment coring and vertical groundwater sampling analysis of historic pump and treat operations data laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling were used to characterize the relative impacts of plume scale back diffusion plume scale sorption desorption and dissolution of organic liquid trapped in the source zones on contaminant mass removal and plume persistence nelson and brusseau 1996 1997 blue et al 1998 brusseau et al 1999a zhang and brusseau 1999 johnson et al 2003a b 2009 nelson et al 2003 sandrin et al 2004 brusseau et al 2007 2011a b 2013a an example of the multi solute tracer test results is presented in fig 5 fig 5 shows the breakthrough curves obtained for two non reactive tracers with different diffusion coefficients the breakthrough curve for the larger solute with a smaller diffusion coefficient exhibits greater spreading this reflects the impact of diffusive mass transfer between the higher permeability aquifer and the adjacent low permeability clay unit the results of this test supported process delineation and parameterization of the mathematical model used for simulations of contaminant transport an example of a napl partitioning tracer test conducted at the site is presented in fig 5b the breakthrough curve for the tracer that can partition to napl but that is not sorbed by the sediment is observed to be delayed compared to the non reactive tracer this indicates the presence of napl within the test domain these data were analyzed to determine a napl saturation value this value was used for conducting a mass balance on contamination present at the site versus the mass removed with pump and treat and to support mathematical modeling an example of a contaminant elution profile obtained from the icet tests conducted at one of the source zones at the site is presented in fig 5c it is observed that the data exhibit type i behavior with pseudo steady state concentrations at relatively high values information obtained from the icet tests and other characterization efforts was used to support development of a mathematical model to simulate flow and transport an example of using the model to obtain a value for the napl dissolution rate coefficient is shown in the figure as noted previously conducting such a modeling analysis necessitates understanding the processes influencing mass removal if one is to obtain robust results in this case the model accounted for all three factors contributing to constrained mass removal napl dissolution back diffusion and desorption application of a simplified model accounting solely for napl dissolution would result in determination of an incorrect mass transfer coefficient the results of the integrated studies indicated that all three mass transfer processes were influencing mass removal and plume persistence with organic liquid dissolution the primary factor in addition the results showed that contaminant concentrations were generally higher within the laterally extensive lower permeability units compared to the more permeable units indicating that pump and treat was ineffective at flushing the lower permeability units assessment of the historic integrated plume scale contaminant mass discharge along with the results of mathematical modeling indicated that the plume would persist for many decades even with the isolation or removal of the source zones primarily due to back diffusion of contaminant associated with the lower permeability units brusseau et al 2007 the information obtained from the icet tests was integral in the comprehensive assessment of mass removal and plume persistence for the site the test results allowed delineation of the specific processes contributing to observed behavior they also provided data for model parameterization to support the mathematical modeling as a result of the icet and associated work the site conceptual model was revised and additional remediation strategies were implemented focusing on source zone treatment 5 conclusion the integrated contaminant elution and tracer test toolkit was presented as an improved method for characterizing mass removal behavior and delineating the underlying mass transfer and attenuation processes that impact the transport fate and remediation of contaminants in complex heterogeneous subsurface environments application of this toolkit will support delineation of the specific processes that are active at a given site and quantification of the associated mass transfer and transformation rates the method will improve our understanding of the impact of site specific processes on plume persistence in addition the test will produce information and parameter values that can be used to enhance the accuracy of mathematical models for predicting plume behavior under a range of conditions including active pump and treat enhanced attenuation and monitored natural attenuation this information can be used to improve the site conceptual model support robust risk assessments and promote cost effective long term management of the large complex groundwater contaminant plumes present at many sites in addition it should be noted that while the current work was focused on saturated zone systems the method can also be employed for vadose zone characterization brusseau et al 2013b the method can be integrated with other site characterization tools to produce the most robust cost effective site information possible acknowledgements this research was supported by the national institute of environmental health science

1689,it is evident based on historical data that groundwater contaminant plumes persist at many sites requiring costly long term management high resolution site characterization methods are needed to support accurate risk assessments and to select design and operate effective remediation operations most subsurface characterization methods are generally limited in their ability to provide unambiguous real time delineation of specific processes affecting mass transfer transformation and mass removal and accurate estimation of associated rates an integrated contaminant elution and tracer test toolkit comprising a set of local scale groundwater extraction and injection tests was developed to ameliorate the primary limitations associated with standard characterization methods the test employs extended groundwater extraction to stress the system and induce hydraulic and concentration gradients clean water can be injected which removes the resident aqueous contaminant mass present in the higher permeability zones and isolates the test zone from the surrounding plume this ensures that the concentrations and fluxes measured within the isolated area are directly and predominantly influenced by the local mass transfer and transformation processes controlling mass removal a suite of standard and novel tracers can be used to delineate specific mass transfer and attenuation processes that are active at a given site and to quantify the associated mass transfer and transformation rates the conceptual basis for the test is first presented followed by an illustrative application based on simulations produced with a 3 d mathematical model and a brief case study application keywords tracer test attenuation plume persistence mass removal mass discharge site characterization 1 introduction groundwater contamination by organic compounds such as chlorinated aliphatics 1 4 dioxane mtbe and poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas continues to be an issue of import for many industrial commercial and military facilities at many of these sites groundwater contaminant plumes which are typically hundreds of meters to several kilometers long pose current or potential risks to human health and or water resource sustainability despite two to three decades of remedial operations at many of these sites groundwater contamination continues to persist presenting complex and costly challenges to complete remediation and closure of the sites it is now recognized that cleanup and closure of many sites with large complex plumes is impractical within time frames of 50 100years using current technologies and approaches e g national research council nrc 2013 this realization has resulted in the examination of cost effective alternatives for risk reduction and long term sustainable management of these sites nrc 2013 the factors and processes that can limit effective contaminant mass removal and contribute to the persistence of groundwater contamination are well known primary factors involve mass removal constraints associated with contaminant residing in poorly accessible retention domains and or occurring in phases for which mass transfer is rate limited i e potentially any mass other than matter occurring in groundwater that resides within advection dominated domains this mass includes immiscible organic liquid in source zones napl sources and distributed sources of contaminant such as sorbed phase mass dissolved mass residing within lower permeability units and mass associated with other potential retention phases vapor phase partitioned to napl adsorbed at fluid fluid interfaces while most of these factors and their potential impacts are well known the difficulty faced for effective site characterization and cleanup is delineating and quantifying their relevance for a specific site the ability to identify and quantify with reasonable certainty the specific mass transfer and or attenuation processes active at a given site is critical for accurate risk assessment for robust selection and design of remediation systems and for effective long term site management current standard characterization methods such as plume scale analysis of concentration profiles analysis of concentration profiles associated with sediment cores and mass flux fences are generally limited in their ability to provide unambiguous real time delineation of specific mass transfer and attenuation processes and accurate estimation of associated rates the development of innovative cost effective field methods for improved characterization of mass removal processes has been deemed a critical research need nrc 2013 serdp strategic environmental research and development program 2013 a standard method used to characterize groundwater contaminant persistence and attenuation is based on the analysis of plume scale concentration vs distance profiles determined along the longitudinal axis of the plume e g newell et al 2002 an alternative approach employing mass flux fences is based on measurement of contaminant mass fluxes at two or more control planes oriented perpendicular to the mean plume trajectory the mass flux can be measured using a network of multi level samplers or flux meters e g borden et al 1997 king et al 1999 basu et al 2006 or by use of contaminant pumping tests e g bockelmann et al 2001 as has been well established these approaches are often subject to considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors e g barker et al 2000 newell et al 2002 chapelle et al 2007 first the methods provide measures of aggregate behavior i e the combined contribution of all processes and factors contributing to mass transfer and attenuation because the individual processes are not explicitly delineated the rate coefficients obtained from analysis of these data are composite lumped parameters this limits their usefulness for predicting how the system will respond to changes in conditions such as induced by modification of well field configuration or operation for hydraulic based remediation systems or introduction of a reagent to enhance contaminant mass transfer or transformation brusseau 1998 chapelle et al 2007 this in turn limits their utility for accurately assessing persistence or for evaluating the impact of efforts to enhance mass removal a second significant limitation is the impact of preferential flow phenomena contaminant present in groundwater flowing in the higher permeability domains typically provides the predominant contribution to concentrations measured with groundwater sampling or flux meter devices this advective preferential flow component can in some cases obscure the concentration signals associated with rate limited mass transfer processes such as diffusion from lower permeability domains often termed back diffusion and desorption methods for providing local scale characterization of attenuation have been developed with standard approaches based on the analysis of concentration vs depth profiles obtained from high resolution sampling of sediment cores or of groundwater e g johnson et al 1989 ball et al 1997 brusseau et al 1999a 2007 chapman and parker 2005 these concentration profiles reflect the composite impact of all mass transfer and attenuation processes active at that location thus delineation of specific attenuation processes and quantification of process specific rates is typically influenced by significant ambiguity and uncertainty this limits their overall utility similar to the standard plume scale methods discussed above in addition the methods provide data that are produced under natural gradient conditions typically demarcated by relatively slow rates of mass transfer and transformation for at least some relevant attenuation processes this results in two major potential limitations one the method may exhibit poor sensitivity to processes that have slower characteristic rates second long often impractical monitoring times may be required to accurately characterize these processes another major limitation is caused by the influence of spatial and temporal heterogeneity inherent to sites i e the measurements pertain only to the borehole and its close vicinity and for one snapshot in time this introduces uncertainty regarding their representativeness and may require significant cost to overcome induced gradient contaminant elution tests cet or contaminant elution tests for short also referred to as contaminant pumping tests or mass discharge tests are another approach for site characterization cets have been used to evaluate and quantify mass removal behavior characterize the impact of mass transfer and attenuation processes on contaminant transport and measure contaminant mass discharge this test is typically conducted by pumping an extraction well for an extended period and monitoring contaminant concentrations in the discharge the effluent concentration data are used to produce a contaminant elution curve which is analyzed to characterize mass removal behavior these data can also be used to determine contaminant mass discharge and to evaluate the potential impact of mass transfer and attenuation processes whiffen and bahr 1985 conducted a combined contaminant elution and tracer test within a groundwater contaminant plume at a site in gloucester canada to evaluate the potential effectiveness of pump and treat as a remedial option the test site was approximately 100m from the source zone and the primary contaminants investigated were tetrahydrofuran diethylether and 1 1 1 trichloroethane nonreactive tracers were used to characterize pore water velocities and dispersivities bahr 1989 applied mathematical modeling to the cet data from whiffen and bahr to assess the potential impact of rate limited sorption desorption on transport brusseau 1993a b applied a multiprocess mass transfer model to the same data to delineate and quantify the apparent specific processes controlling mass removal thorbjarnarson and mackay 1997 conducted a combined contaminant elution and tracer test at rocky mountain arsenal in colorado to characterize contaminant transport behavior during groundwater extraction the test was conducted within the distal portion of a groundwater contaminant plume composed primarily of trichloroethene and 1 1 1 trichloroethane approximately 1km from the source zones sahoo et al 1998 conducted a variation of a contaminant elution test at the picatinny arsenal in new jersey to characterize the impact of rate limited sorption and the addition of surfactant on trichloroethene removal the test was implemented by injecting uncontaminated groundwater and sampling downgradient monitoring wells with no extraction wells employed it was conducted in the center of a groundwater contaminant plume approximately 350m from the source zone all of the prior noted cet applications were conducted explicitly for systems with no immiscible organic liquid present within the test domain i e within the plumes and away from source zones brusseau and colleagues conducted combined contaminant elution and tracer tests within a chlorinated solvent napl source zone at a site in tucson az nelson and brusseau 1996 1997 blue et al 1998 brusseau et al 1999a 2007 the tests were conducted to delineate and quantify the specific processes contributing to the constrained mass removal observed for the pump and treat system and the concomitant plume persistence trichloroethene is the primary contaminant of concern at the site the base cet method suffers from two of the same limitations as the prior methods discussed one is the confounding influence of the contaminant plume and preferential flow the cet can be modified to reduce or eliminate this issue by using injection wells to inject clean water which removes the resident aqueous contaminant mass present in the higher permeability zones and isolates a portion of the test zone from the surrounding plume the application of this coupled injection extraction concept for evaluating the impact of mass transfer and attenuation processes on transport was employed in most of the studies noted above the other limitation for the standard cet is that the observed contaminant elution behavior reflects the aggregate impact of all mass transfer and attenuation processes influencing contaminant transport for that system analysis of such data will return lumped rate coefficients when mass removal is influenced by more than one process but those processes are not accounted for individually delineation of specific processes can be accomplished by employing process specific tracer tests along with the cet for example most of the cet applications noted above used nonreactive tracers to characterize advective dispersive solute transport more definitively a tracer suite can be employed that incudes tracers targeted to characterize specific mass transfer or transformation processes examples include tracers to characterize partitioning to napl diffusive mass transfer impacts and transformation induced mass loss the integration of the various available tracer tests with the cet constitutes the integrated contaminant elution and tracer test toolkit brusseau 2017 the various components of the icet3 have been used to varying degrees in individual applications for some time a strength of the integrated toolkit is the synergism attained from the concurrent implementation of the individual components despite the several benefits and advantages of the method it has apparently yet to become widely applied the objective of this work is to present the concept and elements of the integrated cet toolkit approach application of specific test components will be illustrated with a case study implementation and data analysis aspects will be covered briefly 2 applications for the icet3 the integrated contaminant elution and tracer test toolkit icet3 method is an integration of aquifer perturbation and tracer test methods coupled with the use of standard and novel tracers to target specific individual mass transfer and attenuation processes fig 1 it employs extended groundwater extraction to stress the system and induce and increase hydraulic and concentration gradients in many cases this serves to enhance the sensitivity of the method by perturbing extant magnitudes and rates of mass transfer and transformation this also reduces the time required for obtaining quality measurements and thus increases the ability to obtain measurements in reasonable timeframes injection wells can be employed for injection of clean water which ensures that the concentrations and fluxes measured within the isolated area are directly and predominantly influenced by the local mass transfer and transformation processes controlling mass removal the suite of tracers is selected to allow characterization of specific processes and quantification of associated rate coefficients the test interrogates a much larger volume compared to borehole based methods reducing uncertainty associated with spatial variability the spatial domain interrogated by the test can be scaled according to site conditions and test objectives which allows for cost effective optimization of the test the test can be conducted multiple times to characterize the impact of natural temporal variability or that of human induced perturbations during the icet3 test groundwater samples are collected periodically from the extraction well and monitoring wells if desired and analyzed for the target constituents contaminants of concern tracers nutrients transformation products the constituent concentrations are used to produce elution curves for the contaminants and breakthrough curves comprising both arrival and elution waves for the tracers fig 2 these curves provide the foundation data sets for the various applications of the method it should be noted that groundwater levels can be monitored during the test to provide data for characterization of aquifer hydraulic properties 2 1 characterize mass removal and contaminant persistence a primary application for the standard and integrated cet is its use for characterization of mass removal behavior generally it constitutes the most effective method for such characterization the contaminant elution curves are inspected to determine the type of behavior exhibited specifically the elution curve profiles are examined for specific landmarks such as the presence and extent of steady state relatively uniform concentrations and asymptotic slow rate of decrease to low concentrations stages as well as distinct changes in slope the observed behavior is interpreted in conjunction with the site conceptual model to evaluate mass removal scenarios and help identify the one most likely representative of the extant system this information is used to evaluate the potential impact of rate limited mass transfer or transformation processes on contaminant transport and fate several examples of possible contaminant elution curve profiles are shown in fig 3 five distinct types of behavior are represented i high concentration steady state ii low concentration steady state iii high concentration asymptotic iv low concentration asymptotic and v multi stage each type of behavior is associated with a specific type or types of mass removal condition which is mediated by the amount of the contaminant present its hydraulic accessibility distribution of the contaminant hydraulic properties of the system and the potential for contaminant transformation for example type i and ii behavior would be anticipated for systems in which a large mass of non dissolved phase contaminant is distributed relatively uniformly within the domain and mass transfer is significantly rate limited or the mass is located within a fraction of the domain and the measured concentrations are influenced by significant dilution or some combination thereof the distinction between type i and ii would relate to site conditions and the specific nature of the non dissolved phase mass and or rates of transformation type i would be expected for example for situations wherein napl sources are present whereas type ii may be prevalent for systems with distributed contaminant phases such as dissolved mass present in lower permeability domains or sorbed mass and no napl alternatively both type i and ii may represent a site with substantial non dissolved phase mass distributed in similar manner with the difference in steady state concentrations reflecting the impact of relatively high rates of transformation for type ii type iv behavior may connote that nearly all contaminant present is hydraulically accessible and is present in limited quantities and or influenced by relatively rapid rates of transformation for example contaminant that is present primarily as dissolved mass in the higher permeability domains of the system type iii behavior may represent a system similar to type i but for which mass transfer constraints are not as extreme multistage elution profiles may occur for systems wherein contaminant mass is distributed in multiple domains for which characteristic times of mass transfer are distinctly different type v mathematical modeling can be used to assist in the analysis and interpretation of cet data when interpreting elution curve data it is critical to deconvolute the impact of the regional plume from the local processes influencing mass transfer and attenuation in addition it is important to recognize that the observed behavior is an aggregation of all factors and processes influencing mass removal data analysis and interpretation should always be reflective of this reality this leads to the next application delineation of specific processes 2 2 delineate specific mass transfer and attenuation processes as discussed in the preceding subsection cet data can be used to evaluate the impact of mass transfer and attenuation processes on mass removal this analysis can be extended to identify specific operative processes in this regard interpretation of the test results is relatively straightforward for a system in which a single mass transfer or attenuation process is predominant however for many systems contaminant transport and mass removal is influenced by multiple processes in such cases a suite of tracers can be used to help delineate and characterize specific processes and their respective impact on mass removal various types of tracers can be used each to target a specific transport mass transfer or transformation process 1 conservative tracer a conservative tracer one that is not subject to sorption other retention processes or transformation reactions i e an analogue to water is used to characterize advective dispersive transport residence times and flow heterogeneity this standard tracer approach has been widely employed for site characterization additionally multiple conservative tracers with different molecular weights i e diffusion coefficients can be used to characterize specifically the occurrence of diffusive mass transfer back diffusion and its impact on contaminant transport brusseau 1993 maloszewski and zuber 1993 nelson et al 2003 specifically for a system influenced by a diffusive mass transfer process the rates of mass transfer will differ for solutes with different diffusion coefficients thus tracers with different diffusion coefficients should exhibit dissimilar transport behavior e g different amounts of spreading different extents of tailing for a given set of conditions this is illustrated in fig 2 2 sorptive retention tracers tracers can be used to characterize the impact of retention on transport one example are tracers that are sorbed by the sediment to evaluate the impact of sorption and retardation on transport and mass transfer other examples include tracers selected to probe other potential retention processes such as partitioning to napl to fluid fluid interfaces and to trapped air phases related tracer test methods involve the use of partitioning tracers to characterize the presence and quantity of napl present in source zones water content in vadose zones and the magnitude of fluid fluid interface e g nelson and brusseau 1996 annable et al 1998a 1998b deeds et al 1999 cain et al 2000 keller and brusseau 2003 3 biotransformation tracer susceptible to biotransformation but is not affected by abiotic transformation this type of tracer is used to characterize the specific impact of biotransformation processes tracer tests conducted with biodegradable tracers have been used successfully to characterize the impact of biotransformation processes istok et al 1997 brusseau et al 1999b alter et al 2003 sandrin et al 2004 products of biotransformation can be monitored along with the target tracer to provide additional data 4 abiotic transformation tracer susceptible to abiotic transformation but is not affected by biotransformation this tracer type is used to characterize the specific impact of natural abiotic transformation processes such as mineral induced reduction products of abiotic transformation can be monitored along with the target tracer to provide additional data note that tracers can be selected to characterize speciation changes for inorganics due to abitoic or biotic for biotransformation processes it should be noted that the tracers discussed above generally refer to surrogates for contaminants of concern at a site of course actual contaminants of interest can be used as tracers in these tests as well which has often been done at research sites however such use at typical contaminated sites is often precluded the use of this integrated tracer suite provides a means to identify the contributions of individual processes to mass removal including back diffusion desorption biotransformation and abiotic transformation the use of injected tracers allows accurate determination of mass recoveries and associated magnitudes and rates of mass transfer and transformation thus the test can provide improved quantitative determination of the specific contributions of individual processes to overall mass removal and persistence 2 3 quantitative analysis and determination of rate coefficients it should be stressed that the qualitative analysis discussed above is just as important as quantitative analysis as discussed most field sites will entail conditions wherein multiple processes contribute to mass removal the qualitative analysis supported by the test allows delineation of specific attenuation processes and thus enhances the accuracy of the rate coefficients determined from quantitative analysis one method used to obtain rate coefficients is based on fitting selected functions to the contaminant tracer elution curve these functions range from a simple first order decay function e g newell et al 2002 to power law functions for which the power law magnitude has been correlated to specific mass transfer behavior e g haggerty et al 2000 luo et al 2007 another method of analysis is based on temporal moment analysis e g leij and dane 1992 das and kluitenberg 1996 srivastava et al 2004 das et al 2005 luo et al 2006 standard methods are available for application of function and moment analysis to elution and breakthrough curves a major advantage of using function or moment analysis is that it does not require the use of mathematical transport modeling and does not require the attendant input data that are potentially costly and time consuming to obtain a major disadvantage of these methods of analysis is that the rate coefficients obtained are aggregate lumped parameters representing the contribution of all processes that influenced the transport of that constituent however the design of the icet3 test with its use of a suite of tracers can minimize this limitation for example analysis of nonreactive tracer data will provide specific characterization of diffusive mass transfer rate coefficients similarly the rate coefficient determined for the abiotic tracer data will reflect the impact of abiotic related attenuation another potential limitation for data analysis is associated with data truncation incomplete elution curves which can increase uncertainty of the estimated parameters methods to account for the impact of data truncation on parameter estimation are available e g skopp 1984 das and kluitenberg 1996 luo et al 2006 in addition the use of flow interruption or stop flow tests can help compensate for data truncation and other issues brusseau et al 1989 1997 the other method used to quantitatively analyze icet3 test data and to obtain rate coefficients is based on the application of reactive transport modeling it must be stressed that it is critical to use a process discrete distributed parameter approach to modeling wherein each transport mass transfer and attenuation process is explicitly and separately represented as has been well established the use of simplified lumped process models provides generally poor results for systems with multiple processes affecting migration and attenuation e g brusseau 1998 chapelle et al 2007 the use of process discrete modeling improves the determination of accurate process specific rate coefficients the primary disadvantage of using complex process specific transport models is the significant data input requirements however implementation of an icet study is an effective way to obtain much of the required input data quality assurance and quality control procedures should be implemented for assessing overall robustness of the test data this would include identification of possible outliers and potential impacts of sampling or analytical artifacts the relatively high temporal resolution of the icet test is an advantage for conducting such assessments the process specific information gleaned from the tests is another advantage 2 4 other applications contaminant mass flux or discharge cmd has become an alternate or supplemental metric for use in characterizing risk and evaluating the performance of remedial operations multiple methods are available to measure cmd with the cet one such approach the cet method has been used for example to measure cmd before and after a large scale in situ chemical oxidation project conducted at a federal superfund site in tucson to evaluate remedial operation performance brusseau et al 2011a the mass of contaminant present at the time of characterization and remediation referred to herein as resident contaminant mass is a critical parameter for assessing risk and evaluating remediation efforts for contaminated sites unfortunately accurate determination of resident mass is generally problematic at most sites with the standard characterization method high resolution coring being typically cost prohibitive to employ however resident mass can be estimated by fitting simple mass depletion functions to measured cet data for example mass depletion functions have been applied to cmd data obtained from cets conducted within napl source zones brusseau et al 2013a johnston et al 2013 the cet is ideal for evaluating the potential effectiveness of hydraulic based remediation methods for example solutions of reagent s e g surfactants oxidants electron acceptors electron donors associated with a remediation technology under consideration can be injected to test effectiveness essentially these are implemented as pilot tests of the proposed technology the data can be analyzed as has been discussed for the cet applications to enhance knowledge gained from the pilot tests 3 implementation the design of the test and the selection of components employed will depend upon the objectives of the test and site conditions the specific configuration of the well field the operational pumping rates and the length of the test are primary design variables multiple additional factors need to be considered to ensure successful implementation mathematical modeling can be conducted to assist in the design of the tests and is particularly recommended for more complex systems 3 1 well field configuration the standard well field configuration for contaminant elution and tracer tests comprises a single injection extraction dipole fig 4 a variation consists of multiple injection and extraction wells arranged separately in two parallel lines either approach can provide isolation of the central region of the test domain but data collected from the extraction well s remains influenced by the surrounding plume this is a significant limitation for some applications because the extraction well provides critical data for analysis of transport and attenuation recently guo and brusseau 2017 evaluated alternative well field configurations to improve isolation of the extraction well from the plume for these tests two alternative configurations were tested and compared to the standard dipole fig 4b and c the results demonstrated that the nested couplet configuration established isolation of the inner extraction well from the surrounding plume hence it appears useful for applications in which isolation from the plume is desired however such isolation is not desired for other applications including those charactering mass removal associated with the plume itself a tandem vertical circulation well system can be used in place of the standard injection extraction wells to eliminate the need for extracting large volumes of groundwater to the surface and subsequent treatment this can be done for example using the approach presented by goltz et al 2009 who used the system to measure mass flux this approach may be advantageous for sites with limited capability to treat contaminated groundwater or where regulatory limits preclude injection implementation of icet tests with such a configuration would require in well treatment of contaminants to maintain clean water injection and tracer removal or specific accounting for tracer reinjection 3 2 additional test components in addition to this baseline design additional components can be implemented including i vertical discretization of sampling the extraction and monitoring wells can be fitted with vertically discrete sampling devices to characterize vertical variability the use of multiple monitoring wells interspersed within the target domain provides characterization of areal spatial variability ii stop flow tests can be conducted to enhance characterization of rate limited phenomena these tests developed by brusseau et al 1989 1997 have since been widely used to characterize mass transfer processes for example potential concentration rebound can be monitored within the isolated zone to specifically evaluate the impact and rates of back diffusion and desorption brogan and gailey 1995 presented a method to estimate field scale mass transfer rate parameters based on analyzing concentrations of a resident contaminant obtained during the recovery phase of a groundwater pumping test the method was successfully demonstrated using mathematical modeling simulations for a system with rate limited sorption as the mass transfer limitation iii push pull tests can be conducted within the isolated zone of the test domain to provide additional smaller scale characterization of specific processes these tests wherein solutions are injected into the aquifer and then extracted after a given reaction period e g drever and mckee 1980 istok et al 1997 hansen et al 2016 have been used for example to characterize attenuation particularly biotransformation processes and to measure attenuation rates these tests have been demonstrated to provide robust characterization of transformation processes under certain conditions they are also used to characterize hydrodynamic transport behavior and the impact of retention processes on transport a major potential limitation of the push pull method is increased uncertainty due to poor tracer recovery in some cases one case occurs for systems wherein the rates of attenuation are relatively slow compared to the hydraulic residence times i e sites with relatively large groundwater velocities for this case a significant fraction of the injected solution may migrate outside of the zone of recapture during the non pumping phase and thus would not be extracted during the pull phase this would lead to significant loss of tracer and result in greater uncertainty in estimated parameters as shown by the results of field tests burbery et al 2004 this issue would need to be considered for application with an ongoing icet small volume vertically discrete push pull tests can be conducted using multilevel sampling devices located within the isolated zone to provide high resolution characterization of processes in the vertical dimension while at the same time reducing the influence of potential mass loss issues this can be done for example using the method presented by knecht et al 2011 tests can be conducted at different locations within the test zone to characterize areal spatial variability 3 3 additional implementation factors and potential constraints it is critical to consider all factors that may influence or limit implementation of the tests as well as the potential impacts of the tests on the subsurface system generally the greatest potential impact is the possible alteration of subsurface conditions with the injection of clean water for example electron acceptors other than oxygen are predominant in many groundwater contaminant plumes introducing oxygenated water may significantly alter redox conditions thereby affecting redox sensitive reactions and associated reactants and products similarly differences in ph between the injected water and resident groundwater may affect ph sensitive conditions microbial community profile ionic composition and temperature are other factors to consider therefore it is imperative that the biogeochemical properties of the injected water be matched to the target subsurface system this can often be accomplished by using resident groundwater as the source for injected water subject to appropriate procedures to maintain representativeness while meeting the requirements for the test the effective range of tracer detection is an important factor to consider in tracer selection this is influenced by the analytical method s available and associated quantitative detection limits as well as potential impacts of the environmental matrix e g presence of background concentrations of the selected tracer or interferences ideally the conditions will support a detection range of several logs to better characterize transport behavior in addition the detection range would span lower concentration ranges such that high injection concentrations are not required which will minimize solution density contrasts and other potential undesirable impacts it is also desirable that the tracers employed have minimal impact on the subsurface system except as specifically targeted for example the tracers should not affect the sorption of resident contaminants nor induce mobilization of napl present in addition the tracers should not contribute to long term groundwater contamination another condition for implementing the test is on site capacity to treat the volumes of contaminated groundwater extracted during the test as noted above one advantage of the icet method is the much larger measurement volume compared to standard borehole based methods in addition the measured domain is a design variable that can be tailored to site conditions and test objectives through the dimensions of the well field as well as the use of interspersed monitoring wells and vertical spatial variability can be characterized with use of vertically discrete sampling as noted the typical configuration would produce areal measurement domains of roughly several 10s to a few 1000s of m2 and can be matched to mesh sizes used for field scale mathematical modeling however due the nature of the tests smaller scale heterogeneity is not captured sediment coring or push pull tests can be implemented to supplement the icet if so desired 4 illustrative applications 4 1 simulated example test a simulated icet test is presented to illustrate the types of data that would be collected as well as to present an example of timeframes required to complete the test the properties of the domain were selected to be generally representative of an alluvial aquifer system with values for some parameters patterned after information generated from our prior studies conducted at the tucson international airport area tiaa superfund site zhang and brusseau 1999 the flow model used in this work was modflow the three dimensional 3d finite difference numerical model developed by the u s geological survey mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 harbaugh et al 2000 the 3d solute transport model mt3d with tvd solver zheng 1990 was used to simulate solute transport groundwater vista gv version 6 85 rumbaugh and rumbaugh 2007 and groundwater modeling system gms version 7 1 environmental modeling research laboratory emrl 2005 were used as graphical user interfaces the model domain was 625 square meters the domain was divided into a regular orthogonal grid consisting of 100 rows and 100 columns with grid space 0 25 m 0 25 m the grid size was set to ensure numerical accuracy for the given simulation conditions the thickness of the domain was 10m which was split into 10 layers with 1m thickness for each layer the test area where the injection extraction well system was set up was 5 m 3 m a random field generator gutjahr 1989 was used to derive realizations of k for the aquifer unit of the domain it was assumed that the permeability of the sand was lognormally distributed with mean ln k and variance σ y 2 the simulations were conducted in a domain with permeability heterogeneity of arithmetic mean value of k equal to 10m d and σ y 2 as 5 specified head boundaries were used along right and left borders of the model with natural gradient 0 01 under confined conditions inducing groundwater flow from the left to right side longitudinal dispersivity was set to 0 05m based on standard grid peclet number criteria and transverse and vertical dispersivities were set to 0 005 and 0 0005m respectively a porosity of 0 3 and bulk density of 1 73g cm3 were used two injection wells were used with flow rate of 1m3 d for each well and one extraction well located between the injection wells was used with extraction rate of 2m3 d the injection and extraction wells were screened through the entire thickness of the domain the initial tracer concentration was zero for the entire domain the tracers were injected via the upgradient injection well and clean water was injected via the downgradient injection well four different tracers were used the first two are non reactive tracers nrt with diffusion coefficients of 0 0076 and 0 00076m2 d respectively the third is a sorptive tracer with a diffusion coefficient of 0 0076m2 d and distribution coefficient kd of 0 35ml g resulting in a retardation factor of 3 for this example sorption is assumed to be linear and rate limited first order kinetics was applied with the mass transfer desorption rate coefficient set at 15d 1 the fourth tracer was a transformation tracer and the transformation process was simulated by first order irreversible kinetics with the aqueous phase rate constant set at 0 04d 1 the tracers were injected continuously for 10days followed by 100days of monitoring the properties of the resident contaminant were set to represent a conservative constituent no sorption or decay to allow illustration of the impact of physical heterogeneity and back diffusion on mass removal the entire domain was contaminated with an initial concentration set to 1g m3 temporal data were collected in high resolution from the extraction well for the simulations the elution curve for the resident contaminant and breakthrough curves for the tracers produced using the time continuous concentrations are presented in fig 2a different transport behavior with different amounts of spreading and tailing are observed for the two non reactive tracers with different diffusion coefficients this observed difference signifies the impact of diffusive mass transfer on transport the breakthrough of the sorptive tracer occurs later compared to the curves for the non reactive tracers because of the impact of retardation the concentrations for the transformation tracer are much lower as a result of degradation long tailing is observed in the elution curve for the resident contaminant which is attributed to the influences of the surrounding plume and back diffusion these different behaviors reflected in the breakthrough elution curves are the result of the contributions of individual processes to transport it is often very useful to examine breakthrough curve and elution data in a semilog format to better evaluate potential mass transfer limitations and the impact of flow heterogeneities fig 2b the effective pore volume pv of the test domain was 45m3 and approximately 0 22 pv of tracer solution was injected by the end of the simulation approximately 5 pv of groundwater was extracted the impacts of different processes on transport were readily apparent after 60days equivalent to approximately 3 pv of groundwater being extracted increases to the pumping rates would shorten the overall experiment time these results illustrate that icet tests can be conducted in reasonable time frames 4 2 application at the tucson international airport area superfund site brusseau and colleagues conducted an extensive study of source zone remediation efforts and associated groundwater contaminant plume behavior for a chlorinated solvent contaminated site in az undergoing pump and treat remediation the site that was the focus of the study is part of the tiaa federal superfund site in southern arizona a large multiple source plume of trichloroethene and 1 1 dichloroethene exists in the upper portion of the regional aquifer which in the past was the primary source of potable water for the tucson metropolitan area administratively the tiaa site is separated into two major zones the north and south sections the study site is located within the south section three primary napl contaminated source zones have been delineated in the south section the major hydrogeologic units in the area of the site have been designated as in descending order with depth the unsaturated zone the upper aquifer an aquitard unit and the lower aquifer the unsaturated zone extends from the land surface to the regional groundwater surface which is located 30 to 40m below ground surface bgs the upper aquifer extends from the regional groundwater surface to a depth of approximately 54 to 66m bgs where it is underlain by the aquitard unit the upper aquifer consists of sand and gravel lenses layers separated in some areas by clayey sediment ranging from 1m to greater than 7m in thickness the contaminants are limited primarily to the upper 6 m thick portion of the upper aquifer concentrations of trichloroethene in groundwater ranged from less than 100 to approximately 12 000μg l within the study site the dce concentrations are approximately ten times lower than the tce concentrations multiple methods including induced gradient contaminant elution tests multiple solute tracer tests high resolution sediment coring and vertical groundwater sampling analysis of historic pump and treat operations data laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling were used to characterize the relative impacts of plume scale back diffusion plume scale sorption desorption and dissolution of organic liquid trapped in the source zones on contaminant mass removal and plume persistence nelson and brusseau 1996 1997 blue et al 1998 brusseau et al 1999a zhang and brusseau 1999 johnson et al 2003a b 2009 nelson et al 2003 sandrin et al 2004 brusseau et al 2007 2011a b 2013a an example of the multi solute tracer test results is presented in fig 5 fig 5 shows the breakthrough curves obtained for two non reactive tracers with different diffusion coefficients the breakthrough curve for the larger solute with a smaller diffusion coefficient exhibits greater spreading this reflects the impact of diffusive mass transfer between the higher permeability aquifer and the adjacent low permeability clay unit the results of this test supported process delineation and parameterization of the mathematical model used for simulations of contaminant transport an example of a napl partitioning tracer test conducted at the site is presented in fig 5b the breakthrough curve for the tracer that can partition to napl but that is not sorbed by the sediment is observed to be delayed compared to the non reactive tracer this indicates the presence of napl within the test domain these data were analyzed to determine a napl saturation value this value was used for conducting a mass balance on contamination present at the site versus the mass removed with pump and treat and to support mathematical modeling an example of a contaminant elution profile obtained from the icet tests conducted at one of the source zones at the site is presented in fig 5c it is observed that the data exhibit type i behavior with pseudo steady state concentrations at relatively high values information obtained from the icet tests and other characterization efforts was used to support development of a mathematical model to simulate flow and transport an example of using the model to obtain a value for the napl dissolution rate coefficient is shown in the figure as noted previously conducting such a modeling analysis necessitates understanding the processes influencing mass removal if one is to obtain robust results in this case the model accounted for all three factors contributing to constrained mass removal napl dissolution back diffusion and desorption application of a simplified model accounting solely for napl dissolution would result in determination of an incorrect mass transfer coefficient the results of the integrated studies indicated that all three mass transfer processes were influencing mass removal and plume persistence with organic liquid dissolution the primary factor in addition the results showed that contaminant concentrations were generally higher within the laterally extensive lower permeability units compared to the more permeable units indicating that pump and treat was ineffective at flushing the lower permeability units assessment of the historic integrated plume scale contaminant mass discharge along with the results of mathematical modeling indicated that the plume would persist for many decades even with the isolation or removal of the source zones primarily due to back diffusion of contaminant associated with the lower permeability units brusseau et al 2007 the information obtained from the icet tests was integral in the comprehensive assessment of mass removal and plume persistence for the site the test results allowed delineation of the specific processes contributing to observed behavior they also provided data for model parameterization to support the mathematical modeling as a result of the icet and associated work the site conceptual model was revised and additional remediation strategies were implemented focusing on source zone treatment 5 conclusion the integrated contaminant elution and tracer test toolkit was presented as an improved method for characterizing mass removal behavior and delineating the underlying mass transfer and attenuation processes that impact the transport fate and remediation of contaminants in complex heterogeneous subsurface environments application of this toolkit will support delineation of the specific processes that are active at a given site and quantification of the associated mass transfer and transformation rates the method will improve our understanding of the impact of site specific processes on plume persistence in addition the test will produce information and parameter values that can be used to enhance the accuracy of mathematical models for predicting plume behavior under a range of conditions including active pump and treat enhanced attenuation and monitored natural attenuation this information can be used to improve the site conceptual model support robust risk assessments and promote cost effective long term management of the large complex groundwater contaminant plumes present at many sites in addition it should be noted that while the current work was focused on saturated zone systems the method can also be employed for vadose zone characterization brusseau et al 2013b the method can be integrated with other site characterization tools to produce the most robust cost effective site information possible acknowledgements this research was supported by the national institute of environmental health science
