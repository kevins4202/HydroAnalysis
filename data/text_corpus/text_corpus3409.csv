graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords optical coherence tomography oct wastewater reuse organic fouling biofouling forward osmosis fo membrane 1 introduction forward osmosis fo has gained attention as an alternative membrane process to traditional pressure driven membrane processes such as reverse osmosis ro nano filtration nf and ultra filtration uf for economical and sustainable desalination and wastewater reuse technologies im et al 2016 im and jang 2020 the driving force in the fo process is the osmotic pressure difference caused by a difference in solute concentration between the two solutions previous studies have suggested that osmotically driven membrane processes reduce operational expenditures opex and the environmental impact of water treatment processes im et al 2018a im et al 2020b considering the economic and environmental advantages the fo process can be employed in combination with traditional desalination processes such as ro electrodialysis and multi stage flash distillation among these the fo ro hybrid process has gained attention in recent years previously our research team evaluated and optimized an fo ro hybrid system under various operating conditions estimating the techno economic aspects of this system ban et al 2019 im et al 2020b however the fo process is still considered a developing technology requiring further process optimization hybrid post treatment processes and the development of fouling monitoring cleaning methods im et al 2020a im et al 2018c west et al 2016 additional and advanced research is needed in areas such as full scale implementation development of operation guidelines and combining suitable fouling monitoring procedures with real time databases for process feasibility and reliability among the limitations of the fo process membrane fouling is considered a critical drawback impacting performance leading to membrane surface deterioration and increasing opex kim et al 2018 kook et al 2018 to alleviate membrane fouling several approaches have been evaluated including membrane cleaning surface modification fouling investigations and monitoring he et al by performing cleaning using free radicals and oxygen recovered 94 filtration performance without affecting the membrane properties vs virgin membrane he et al 2019 a al ghamdi et al observed 100 trans membrane pressure recovery and more than 80 water flux recovery after employing co2 bubble nucleation to remove sodium alginate inorganic and colloidal silica based membrane fouling al ghamdi et al 2019 straub et al applied the redox initiated graft polymerization technique to a uf membrane improving water flux by 83 and reducing fouling by bio matter such as soluble microbial byproduct smp and extracellular protein substances eps straub et al 2020 deng et al reported that through the surface grafting of polyethyleneimine using the zwitterionic modification method it was possible to achieve a flux decline ratio and flux recovery ratio of up to 19 6 and 28 7 respectively without affecting water transport resistance deng et al 2021 however the development and application of cleaning agents and membrane surface modification and fabrication technologies require additional research in terms of engineering and process commercialization a comprehensive evaluation of the fo process feasibility is essential to bridge the knowledge gap between research development and full scale implementation moreover it is necessary to evaluate the applicability of the fo process in wastewater reuse processes and to identify the major limitation of membrane fouling in addition to effectively control membrane fouling it is necessary to gain a better understanding of the morphology components and characteristics of the membrane fouling layer in order to investigate membrane fouling tendencies or variation advanced fouling diagnostic technologies have been introduced and applied such as ultrasonic time domain reflectometry sim et al 2012 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy gao et al 2018 confocal laser scanning microscopy fortunato et al 2019 and small angle neutron scattering rudolph et al 2019 through previous research our team classified major contaminants and identified the membrane fouling phenomenon through real time monitoring of membrane fouling and analysis of the contaminants constituting the fouling layer fortunato et al 2017a fortunato and leiknes 2017 optical coherence tomography oct has recently been proposed as an in situ technique for studying fouling in membrane filtration systems oct enables the acquisition of morphological information of the fouling layer as it develops on the membrane surface in real time fortunato et al 2017b fortunato et al 2020 in addition detailed morphological analysis is possible through image analysis of 2d and 3d cross sectional scans west et al 2016 therefore since the membrane and fouling layer can be monitored in real time it can be implemented during operation to guide the cleaning frequency and membrane replacement to this extent the real time monitoring of fouling layers can be combined with information and communication technologies ict to improve process performance real time monitoring technique is possible to understand the physical characteristics through image analysis and to predict the growth of the membrane fouling layer as a result the combination of real time monitoring technology and membrane technology contributes greatly to the advancement of process o m since monitoring technology can only provide information on the fouling morphology deep analysis of the properties of both the membrane surface and fouling layer is necessary im et al 2020a the major organic and inorganic components in a fouling layer were analyzed and changes in the physicochemical properties of the membrane surface were observed to identify initial membrane fouling and the major contaminants chon et al 2012 consequently the purpose of this study was to monitor in real time the membrane fouling developed in fo for wastewater reuse and to link the membrane performance to the formation of the membrane fouling layer finally through an in depth analysis of the fouling layer through membrane autopsy major contaminants were identified and the fouling mechanism in the fo process was investigated 2

classified into three major steps step 1 process operation and evaluation consisted of process performance evaluation water flux and rejection and fouling matter analysis step 2 of the study consisted of real time monitoring of the fouling layer through image acquisition followed by optimization and analysis of the acquired images and finally analysis of the physical properties of the fouling layer after long term 66 d operation step 3 was performed which comprised analysis of the fouled membrane and fouling layer through this process we aimed to characterize fouling and investigate fouling behavior through process operation evaluation autopsy analysis fouling layer monitoring and image analysis 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance and real time monitoring operation conditions fs 1st wastewater effluent ds 35 000 mg l synthetic seawater membrane fouling layer monitoring fouling layer monitoring every 5 days fig s3 in this study the fo process was tested for wastewater reuse applications by employing a primary wastewater effluent as the fs and a synthetic seawater solution as the ds fig 3 shows the change in water flux variation and membrane fouling layer during the 66 days of operation physical and chemical cleaning were not performed during the operation period and the volume of fs was reduced by 50 ds diluted 50 fs and ds were constantly replaced the initial water flux with di water baseline test was 19 80 0 58 lmh however when the primary wastewater effluent was employed as the fs the water flux decreased to 16 16 0 42 lmh due to a reduction in the ionic strength reduction of osmotic pressure difference across the membrane the initial deposition of contaminants and initial concentration polarization cp layer development based on the water flux variation and membrane fouling deposited during the 66 day operation the operation can be divided into four phases 1 virgin performance baseline 2 initial deposition 3 stabilization and 4 fouling aggregation clustering the four phases are classified according to the process performance and morphological characteristics of the fouling layer roughness thickness image shape real time fouling monitoring through oct was utilized to investigate fouling layer development during operation two dimensional oct scans were taken at a fixed cell location center of the cell aligned with the flow direction on the membrane surface fig s1 shows the oct images obtained during the 66 days of operation the oct scan includes three sections the active layer of the membrane bright line in the center of the scan supporting layer below the active layer and fouling layer on top of the active layer phase 2 lasted about 15 days after which the water flux increased slightly average 17 41 0 43 lmh initial membrane fouling during phase 2 day 6 was assessed using the acquired oct cross sectional images fig 3 however after day 16 at the beginning of phase 3 an increase in fouling deposition was observed as shown in fig s1 the fouling layer continuously accumulated on the membrane surface until the end of operation day 51 during phase 3 the water flux continuously decreased from 17 36 0 48 to 14 49 0 37 lmh but from day 31 a recovery in the water flux was registered water flux 15 92 0 27 lmh recovery rate 8 9 0 14 it is worth noting that a similar flux trend was observed for phases 2 and 3 initial deposition and stabilization where the water flux first decreased as the fouling layer initially developed and then recovered during fouling layer growth stabilization by comparing the flux and oct images fig 3 it is clear that there is no direct correlation between the water flux and the amount of fouling deposited on the membrane surface but a detailed analysis of the fouling layer is necessary to assess the morphological changes over time and to develop a better understanding of the impact of fouling on the process in fact as reported in the literature the presence of microorganisms affects the evolution of the fouling over time leading to a change in the layer properties fouling composition and morphology during long term operation and impacting the fo membrane performance fortunato et al 2018 fortunato et al 2017b 3 2 membrane fouling layer characteristics the morphological properties of the fouling layer were assessed based on the oct images acquired during operation fig 4 shows the fouling layer thickness and roughness over time the thickness of the fouling layer increased continuously reaching 43 μm after 66 days of operation interestingly during the entire layer stabilization period phase 3 the thickness remained constant but after 56 days during phase 4 a rapid increase in fouling thickness 27 to 43 μm was followed by a dramatic decrease in water flux 16 23 0 16 to 13 15 0 31 lmh it is worth mentioning that the fouling roughness is not the only parameter that influences process performance several studies have highlighted the impact of fouling roughness on process performance hashino et al 2011 ramon and hoek 2013 shang et al 2020 surface roughness directly affects the surface area and energy the structure of the valleys of rough appearing in the roughness of the membrane has a significant effect on valley clogging in addition the formation of turbulent dead zones in micro units causes the accumulation of many foulnats and reduction of roughness represents the stabilization and density of the fouling layer and as a result the increase in the cp value of the fouling layer as shown in fig 4 fouling layer roughness increased during phase 2 showing a trend similar to that of thickness but decreased from 0 40 to 0 22 in the fouling layer stabilization period phase 3 in the early stage of operation the fouling layer develops heterogeneously resulting in increased thickness and roughness afterwards as the fouling layer develops it reaches a relatively stable morphology phase 3 where the roughness decreases and the fouling becomes more homogeneous the time resolved analysis provided an insight into contaminant deposition and the impact on the fouling layer s physical properties over time moreover the morphology of the fouling layer formed on the membrane surface can influence the rejection performance owing to contaminant diffusion and the convection coefficient value the cp effects and fouling layer sorption rate were linked to the physico chemical properties of the fouling layer 3 3 contaminant rejection tendency the physical properties of the fo membrane fouling layer have a significant influence on the membrane performance including water flux and rejection rate ahmad et al 2013 rho et al 2020 during monitoring of the process performance and membrane fouling the contaminants present in the fs and ds were also analyzed to determine the impact of fouling on rejection and removal mechanisms table 2 shows the resulting toc uv254 and cod values indirect indicators of om and the removal rate of divalent ions that are responsible for bridge interactions increasing the fouling propensity fig 5 shows the removal trend over the operation time a relatively high removal rate was observed in phase 2 day 1 to day 11 with rates of 98 8 0 1 97 3 0 5 95 3 0 4 99 5 0 1 99 6 0 1 and 99 5 0 05 for toc uv cod ca2 mg2 and si2 respectively but from the start of phase 3 days 16 51 the removal rate reduced continuously with the minimum removal rates of toc and uv reaching 78 2 and 78 9 respectively however removal rates of cod and inorganic matter such as ca2 mg2 and si2 were 96 3 94 3 94 5 and 92 4 respectively these results are probably due to the continuous deposition of foulants on the membrane surface and the increased internal interactions within the fouling layer moreover the fouling layer concentration fouling layer enhanced cp layer on the membrane surface increased the diffusion and convection rate of the om im et al 2020a lee et al 2019 in a different way from phases 2 and 3 in phase 4 the removal rates of toc and uv decreased dramatically to 74 4 and 52 2 respectively a slight decrease in the removal rate of cod ca2 mg2 and si2 to 95 5 94 1 93 0 and 92 4 respectively was observed in phase 4 whereas in initial period in phases 2 late period in phase 2 and 3 the removal rate of inorganic divalent ions when compared with the removal tendency of om appeared to be constant over time the slight decrease in inorganic ions might be due to their partial enrichment in the fouling layer in addition eem and size exclusion analysis of om in the fs and ds were performed on day 1 16 36 and 61 sampling point to characterize the types of om that were not removed by the fo membrane fig s3 and s4 in the fs relatively high peaks were observed for humic acid ha em 450 nm ex 320 nm and protein like em 350 nm ex 240 nm substances compared with the peaks of other om types soluble microbial by products fulvic acid like substances in addition smp related substances em 350 nm ex 280 nm and hydrophobic om em 420 nm ex 240 nm were observed duc viet et al 2020 on days 1 and 16 phase 2 and phase 3 low peaks were observed for om in the ds intensity 280 mv while on days 36 and 61 high peaks were observed for smp related substances ha and protein like substances intensity 400 mv through size exclusion analysis it was observed that protein like substances in the ds had molecular weights of 120 980 4400 and 33 000 da on days 36 and 61 while aromatic like substances had molecular weights of 70 and 380 da the consolidation and interaction of the membrane fouling layer is believed to result in an increase in the concentration of the membrane fouling layer high foulants concentration per unit area high deposition rate and a dramatic decrease in the removal rate when it exceeds the critical fouling concentration the toc concentrations in the ds on day 1 16 36 and 61 were 0 33 0 13 0 13 and 1 80 mg l respectively lcocd analysis was performed to identify the removal mechanism of the organic fraction which changes according to fouling layer tendency and indicate which organic compounds are diffused and convected through the fo membrane table 3 shows the fractionation of om present in the fs and ds the om present in the fs in phase 2 is mainly characterized by lmw neutral 61 45 building blocks 19 1 and humic substances 10 1 but om in the ds is mainly composed of lmw neutrals 68 6 building blocks 15 2 and humic substances 13 3 humic substances building blocks and lmw are reportedly easily rejected by the fo membrane pore size 20 80 nm zhang et al 2020 and thus can significantly contribute to initial membrane fouling initial fouling deposition moreover the adsorption of lmw acids is unlikely to occur because of the electrostatic repulsion between them and the hydrophilic fo membrane in contrast lmw neutrals alcohols aldehydes and ketones can be easily adsorbed on a negatively charged membrane surface and or within the pores after 16 days phase 3 when the fouling layer was stabilized the removal rate increased slightly and the ratio of lmw neutrals and acids in the ds increased neutral 72 1 acid 12 5 though the removal rate was reduced during phase 4 and the proportion of high molecular weight om increased bio polymer and humic substances according to previous studies the sec fl peaks located at 20 000 da or more correspond to polysaccharide like substances pontié et al 2007 yamamura et al 2014 polysaccharide like substances are thought to be the major component of eps choi et al 2016 chon and cho 2016 in general polysaccharides contain amino sugars and polypeptides which can easily bind to proteins acting as precursors for hydrophilic membrane fouling size exclusion and sorption in addition polysaccharide like substances are generally neutral and if adsorbed may reduce the negative charge of the fo membrane im et al 2020a im et al 2018b the bio polymer observed in the lcocd analysis indirectly shows the presence of polysaccharides with some contribution from nitrogen containing materials such as proteins or amino sugars as shown in fig s3 and 4 peaks that were not observed at the beginning of the process approximately day 16 phase 3 were observed during the later parts of the process approximately day 36 and day 61 phase 3 and phase 4 these results were also confirmed by lcocd analysis vs hpsec analysis in this study the fouling layer thickness and om removal rate showed an opposite trends when the fouling layer became more homogenous decrease in roughness and the average thickness increased above 30 µm a reduction in om removal was observed it is believed that after the fouling layer is stabilized a secondary fouling layer is formed and the cp caused by the additional layer increases the diffusion and convection ratio of the om resulting in the passage of some om with larger molecular weights into the ds li et al 2019 this phenomenon coincided with the formation of an additional fouling layer bridging fouling formation a detailed characterization of the fouling layer was necessary to assess the distribution of om bio matter and inorganic matter constituting the fouling layer 3 4 fouled membrane analysis a final destructive membrane autopsy was performed after 66 days of operation to characterize the membrane fouling and identify the major foulants deposited in the fouling layer organic inorganic bio matter fig 6 shows the results of image characterization performed on the fouled membrane these images exhibit the morphological 3d oct surface sem and physicochemical proprieties of the fouling layer clsm live dead cell eps and protein as well as the distribution of inorganic ions eds as shown in fig 5 sem and oct after 66 days of operation the fo membrane surface was completely covered with contaminants the sem eds analysis highlighted the presence of monovalent and divalent ions in the fouling layer these ions resulted in the formation of a fouling layer through bridging with om on the surface of the membrane in fact divalent ions are reported to cause intermolecular adhesion through electrostatic interactions with phenolic and carboxylic groups in om the divalent ions interact with the om influencing the fouling layer compression and charge neutralization resulting in the compaction of the fouling layer and the reduction of the membrane surface charge tang et al 2009 moreover the interactions between the carboxylic groups and ca2 can generate a cross linked macromolecular network increasing membrane hydraulic resistance reducing water permeation and enhancing the diffusion coefficient of contaminants in addition the bulk concentration of the fouling layer was enhanced as some ions and om from the fs accumulated over time in the fouling layer the eds analysis of the fouling layer table s1 highlighted an enrichment in ca2 relative to other ions and compared with the inorganic composition of the fs table 1 as reported in studies comparing the effects of ca2 and mg2 on bridging fouling ca2 forms a calcium hydrophilic organic complexation eggbox like gelation relative to mg2 lee et al 2006 ca2 is a relatively small divalent ion compared to mg2 and si2 so it binds easily to the structural om in addition reportedly ca2 has a greater affinity than mg2 for hydrophobic om and bio polymers this was supported by the decreased rejection results for ions and om the clsm analysis allowed us to distinguish between the live and dead cells eps and proteins of the microorganisms deposited on the fo membrane surface these results indicate the simultaneous formation of organic and biological fouling on the fo membrane surface in phase 4 bio polymer polysaccharide lmw and building block substances were observed in the ds this result can probably be linked to the composition and cp influence of the fouling layer the aggregated fouling layer affects the hydrophilicity surface charge and back diffusion value of the membrane surface in fact the bio matter penetrated through the membrane due to the effect of the fouling enhanced cp layer and this result is consistent with the results of om analysis tables 2 and 3 to identify the functional groups of the om attached to the membrane surface atr ftir analyses were performed overall the absorbance of the fouled membrane was lower than that of the virgin membrane fig s5 the atr ftir spectrum of the fouled fo membrane exhibited differences when compared to that of the virgin membrane peaks high absorbance intensities were observed at 1090 cm 1 amide i c o carbonyl stretching 1540 cm 1 amide ii chromatic ring breathing and 1653 cm 1 amide i c o carbonyl stretching in the virgin membrane however significantly different peaks were observed in the fouled fo membrane including peaks at 1100 cm 1 alcohol c o stretching and 2356 cm 1 c n nitrile aromatic compounds which were derived from hydrophilic om polysaccharides and humic and fulvic acids in addition the relative hydrophobicity of the fo membrane surface shown in table 4 were obtained from analysis of the contact angle of the virgin and fouled membrane surfaces the contact angle of the virgin fo membrane was 67 1 while for the fouled fo membrane this angle increased to 81 9 increment value 14 8 this indicates that the fouled fo membrane surface was more hydrophobic than the virgin fo membrane 3 5 membrane fouling layer analysis liquid extraction extraction solution analysis was conducted to identify the characteristics of the types of om and to indirectly evaluate the efficiency of physical and chemical cleaning doc values of 0 21 and 3 56 mgc cm2 respectively were obtained for di and naoh extraction this result indirectly shows the efficiency of physical and chemical cleaning the results were confirmed by eem analysis as highlighted by the different peak intensities di water 60 80 mv naoh 80 100 mv the reversible fouling layer has strong hydrophobic properties and the irreversible fouling layer has strong hydrophilic properties im et al 2018b the molecular weight distribution and fluorescence characteristics of the extracted om are shown in fig 7 additionally table 5 shows the doc values om fractionation and lcocd results of the extraction solution therefore of di water extraction aromatic like om substances with molecular weights of 800 980 11 000 and 32 000 da were observed while protein like om substances with molecular weights of 120 900 and 9000 da were identified eem analysis confirmed that smp like substances humic acid like substances and aromatic proteins are the main contributors to the fouling layer the extracted om was fractionated in the order of tpi hpi hpo with lmw neutral material having the highest proportion 68 4 when 0 1 m naoh solution indicating chemical cleaning was extracted 16 9 times higher om 3 56 mgc cm2 was extracted compared to the extraction with di water 0 21 mgc cm2 indicating physical cleaning in contrast as a result of 0 1 m naoh extraction high peaks were observed at 800 980 and 32 000 da for aromatic like om substances and at 800 980 and 33 000 da for protein like om substances in addition smp like substances and humic acid like om as also had high peaks and have a fractionation order of hpi tpi hpo similar to di water extraction lmw neural substances 58 0 humic substances 22 4 and building blocks 17 8 were also registered through these results it is possible to indirectly confirm the difference between the physical and chemical cleaning efficiency in addition there appears to be a difference in the characteristics of the main om types constituting the initial deposition and fouling aggregation 4 conclusion process operation evaluation real time fouling monitoring and advanced fouling characterization were performed in forward osmosis process for wastewater reuse application using a primary effluent as the fs a comprehensive analysis based on the process performance water flux removal rate and characterization of fouling layer properties allowed linking the fouling layer characteristics with the fo process performance after 66 days of operation a detailed destructive analysis sem eds clsm extraction analysis of the fouling layer was performed to evaluate the composition of the main fouling layer through real time monitoring and image based analysis the physical properties of the fouling layer on the fo membrane surface could be evaluated under continuous operation the membrane fouling layer was classified into initial deposition stabilization and aggregation sections the properties of the fouling layer varied according to the formation period of each section the contaminant rejection rate of the virgin fo membrane is very high approximately 99 and is suitable for use in wastewater processing however as the fouling layer stabilized the rejection rate decreased owing to the increase in fouling layer cp effects through membrane autopsy analysis microbial based matter live dead cells eps protein om and a large amount of divalent ions were observed on the fouled membrane surface through the correlation between process performance and membrane autopsy analysis it is possible to identify major membrane contaminants and propose process optimization guidelines in addition the approach presented in this study can be directly applied to maintenance of membrane based water treatment technology and ict based process control technology therefore it is possible to establish the

monitored in real time the investigation of fouling layer physical and chemical characteristics was assessed by performance evaluation and in depth analysis of fouling layer non invasive visual monitoring and in depth autopsy combined with the performance and image analyses provided a better understanding of fouling phenomena the relative roughness of the fouling layer was correlated with water flux decrease while the fouling layer thickness decreased rapidly when fouling was stabilized from 66 day operation using the primary wastewater as the feed membrane fouling development was classified into 4 phases virgin performance initial deposition stabilization and aggregation with the growing fouling layer and with aggregation the removal rate of organic matter was reduced from 99 to 70 conversely the removal rate of inorganic matter was maintained at a level higher than 90 the fractionation of physical and chemical extraction had the following characteristics tpi hpi hpo and

pressure recovery and more than 80 water flux recovery after employing co2 bubble nucleation to remove sodium alginate inorganic and colloidal silica based membrane fouling al ghamdi et al 2019 straub et al applied the redox initiated graft polymerization technique to a uf membrane improving water flux by 83 and reducing fouling by bio matter such as soluble microbial byproduct smp and extracellular protein substances eps straub et al 2020 deng et al reported that through the surface grafting of polyethyleneimine using the zwitterionic modification method it was possible to achieve a flux decline ratio and flux recovery ratio of up to 19 6 and 28 7 respectively without affecting water transport resistance deng et al 2021 however the development and application of cleaning agents and membrane surface modification and fabrication technologies require additional research in terms of engineering and process commercialization a comprehensive evaluation of the fo process feasibility is essential to bridge the knowledge gap between research development and full scale implementation moreover it is necessary to evaluate the applicability of the fo process in wastewater reuse processes and to identify the major limitation of membrane fouling in addition to effectively control membrane fouling it is necessary to gain a better understanding of the morphology components and characteristics of the membrane fouling layer in order to investigate membrane fouling tendencies or variation advanced fouling diagnostic technologies have been introduced and applied such as ultrasonic time domain reflectometry sim et al 2012 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy gao et al 2018 confocal laser scanning microscopy fortunato et al 2019 and small angle neutron scattering rudolph et al 2019 through previous research our team classified major contaminants and identified the membrane fouling phenomenon through real time monitoring of membrane fouling and analysis of the contaminants constituting the fouling layer fortunato et al 2017a fortunato and leiknes 2017 optical coherence tomography oct has recently been proposed as an in situ technique for studying fouling in membrane filtration systems oct enables the acquisition of morphological information of the fouling layer as it develops on the membrane surface in real time fortunato et al 2017b fortunato et al 2020 in addition detailed morphological analysis is possible through image analysis of 2d and 3d cross sectional scans west et al 2016 therefore since the membrane and fouling layer can be monitored in real time it can be implemented during operation to guide the cleaning frequency and membrane replacement to this extent the real time monitoring of fouling layers can be combined with information and communication technologies ict to improve process performance real time monitoring technique is possible to understand the physical characteristics through image analysis and to predict the growth of the membrane fouling layer as a result the combination of real time monitoring technology and membrane technology contributes greatly to the advancement of process o m since monitoring technology can only provide information on the fouling morphology deep analysis of the properties of both the membrane surface and fouling layer is necessary im et al 2020a the major organic and inorganic components in a fouling layer were analyzed and changes in the physicochemical properties of the membrane surface were observed to identify initial membrane fouling and the major contaminants chon et al 2012 consequently the purpose of this study was to monitor in real time the membrane fouling developed in fo for wastewater reuse and to link the membrane performance to the formation of the membrane fouling layer finally through an in depth analysis of the fouling layer through membrane autopsy major contaminants were identified and the fouling mechanism in the fo process was investigated 2

classified into three major steps step 1 process operation and evaluation consisted of process performance evaluation water flux and rejection and fouling matter analysis step 2 of the study consisted of real time monitoring of the fouling layer through image acquisition followed by optimization and analysis of the acquired images and finally analysis of the physical properties of the fouling layer after long term 66 d operation step 3 was performed which comprised analysis of the fouled membrane and fouling layer through this process we aimed to characterize fouling and investigate fouling behavior through process operation evaluation autopsy analysis fouling layer monitoring and image analysis 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance and real time monitoring operation conditions fs 1st wastewater effluent ds 35 000 mg l synthetic seawater membrane fouling layer monitoring fouling layer monitoring every 5 days fig s3 in this study the fo process was tested for wastewater reuse applications by employing a primary wastewater effluent as the fs and a synthetic seawater solution as the ds fig 3 shows the change in water flux variation and membrane fouling layer during the 66 days of operation physical and chemical cleaning were not performed during the operation period and the volume of fs was reduced by 50 ds diluted 50 fs and ds were constantly replaced the initial water flux with di water baseline test was 19 80 0 58 lmh however when the primary wastewater effluent was employed as the fs the water flux decreased to 16 16 0 42 lmh due to a reduction in the ionic strength reduction of osmotic pressure difference across the membrane the initial deposition of contaminants and initial concentration polarization cp layer development based on the water flux variation and membrane fouling deposited during the 66 day operation the operation can be divided into four phases 1 virgin performance baseline 2 initial deposition 3 stabilization and 4 fouling aggregation clustering the four phases are classified according to the process performance and morphological characteristics of the fouling layer roughness thickness image shape real time fouling monitoring through oct was utilized to investigate fouling layer development during operation two dimensional oct scans were taken at a fixed cell location center of the cell aligned with the flow direction on the membrane surface fig s1 shows the oct images obtained during the 66 days of operation the oct scan includes three sections the active layer of the membrane bright line in the center of the scan supporting layer below the active layer and fouling layer on top of the active layer phase 2 lasted about 15 days after which the water flux increased slightly average 17 41 0 43 lmh initial membrane fouling during phase 2 day 6 was assessed using the acquired oct cross sectional images fig 3 however after day 16 at the beginning of phase 3 an increase in fouling deposition was observed as shown in fig s1 the fouling layer continuously accumulated on the membrane surface until the end of operation day 51 during phase 3 the water flux continuously decreased from 17 36 0 48 to 14 49 0 37 lmh but from day 31 a recovery in the water flux was registered water flux 15 92 0 27 lmh recovery rate 8 9 0 14 it is worth noting that a similar flux trend was observed for phases 2 and 3 initial deposition and stabilization where the water flux first decreased as the fouling layer initially developed and then recovered during fouling layer growth stabilization by comparing the flux and oct images fig 3 it is clear that there is no direct correlation between the water flux and the amount of fouling deposited on the membrane surface but a detailed analysis of the fouling layer is necessary to assess the morphological changes over time and to develop a better understanding of the impact of fouling on the process in fact as reported in the literature the presence of microorganisms affects the evolution of the fouling over time leading to a change in the layer properties fouling composition and morphology during long term operation and impacting the fo membrane performance fortunato et al 2018 fortunato et al 2017b 3 2 membrane fouling layer characteristics the morphological properties of the fouling layer were assessed based on the oct images acquired during operation fig 4 shows the fouling layer thickness and roughness over time the thickness of the fouling layer increased continuously reaching 43 μm after 66 days of operation interestingly during the entire layer stabilization period phase 3 the thickness remained constant but after 56 days during phase 4 a rapid increase in fouling thickness 27 to 43 μm was followed by a dramatic decrease in water flux 16 23 0 16 to 13 15 0 31 lmh it is worth mentioning that the fouling roughness is not the only parameter that influences process performance several studies have highlighted the impact of fouling roughness on process performance hashino et al 2011 ramon and hoek 2013 shang et al 2020 surface roughness directly affects the surface area and energy the structure of the valleys of rough appearing in the roughness of the membrane has a significant effect on valley clogging in addition the formation of turbulent dead zones in micro units causes the accumulation of many foulnats and reduction of roughness represents the stabilization and density of the fouling layer and as a result the increase in the cp value of the fouling layer as shown in fig 4 fouling layer roughness increased during phase 2 showing a trend similar to that of thickness but decreased from 0 40 to 0 22 in the fouling layer stabilization period phase 3 in the early stage of operation the fouling layer develops heterogeneously resulting in increased thickness and roughness afterwards as the fouling layer develops it reaches a relatively stable morphology phase 3 where the roughness decreases and the fouling becomes more homogeneous the time resolved analysis provided an insight into contaminant deposition and the impact on the fouling layer s physical properties over time moreover the morphology of the fouling layer formed on the membrane surface can influence the rejection performance owing to contaminant diffusion and the convection coefficient value the cp effects and fouling layer sorption rate were linked to the physico chemical properties of the fouling layer 3 3 contaminant rejection tendency the physical properties of the fo membrane fouling layer have a significant influence on the membrane performance including water flux and rejection rate ahmad et al 2013 rho et al 2020 during monitoring of the process performance and membrane fouling the contaminants present in the fs and ds were also analyzed to determine the impact of fouling on rejection and removal mechanisms table 2 shows the resulting toc uv254 and cod values indirect indicators of om and the removal rate of divalent ions that are responsible for bridge interactions increasing the fouling propensity fig 5 shows the removal trend over the operation time a relatively high removal rate was observed in phase 2 day 1 to day 11 with rates of 98 8 0 1 97 3 0 5 95 3 0 4 99 5 0 1 99 6 0 1 and 99 5 0 05 for toc uv cod ca2 mg2 and si2 respectively but from the start of phase 3 days 16 51 the removal rate reduced continuously with the minimum removal rates of toc and uv reaching 78 2 and 78 9 respectively however removal rates of cod and inorganic matter such as ca2 mg2 and si2 were 96 3 94 3 94 5 and 92 4 respectively these results are probably due to the continuous deposition of foulants on the membrane surface and the increased internal interactions within the fouling layer moreover the fouling layer concentration fouling layer enhanced cp layer on the membrane surface increased the diffusion and convection rate of the om im et al 2020a lee et al 2019 in a different way from phases 2 and 3 in phase 4 the removal rates of toc and uv decreased dramatically to 74 4 and 52 2 respectively a slight decrease in the removal rate of cod ca2 mg2 and si2 to 95 5 94 1 93 0 and 92 4 respectively was observed in phase 4 whereas in initial period in phases 2 late period in phase 2 and 3 the removal rate of inorganic divalent ions when compared with the removal tendency of om appeared to be constant over time the slight decrease in inorganic ions might be due to their partial enrichment in the fouling layer in addition eem and size exclusion analysis of om in the fs and ds were performed on day 1 16 36 and 61 sampling point to characterize the types of om that were not removed by the fo membrane fig s3 and s4 in the fs relatively high peaks were observed for humic acid ha em 450 nm ex 320 nm and protein like em 350 nm ex 240 nm substances compared with the peaks of other om types soluble microbial by products fulvic acid like substances in addition smp related substances em 350 nm ex 280 nm and hydrophobic om em 420 nm ex 240 nm were observed duc viet et al 2020 on days 1 and 16 phase 2 and phase 3 low peaks were observed for om in the ds intensity 280 mv while on days 36 and 61 high peaks were observed for smp related substances ha and protein like substances intensity 400 mv through size exclusion analysis it was observed that protein like substances in the ds had molecular weights of 120 980 4400 and 33 000 da on days 36 and 61 while aromatic like substances had molecular weights of 70 and 380 da the consolidation and interaction of the membrane fouling layer is believed to result in an increase in the concentration of the membrane fouling layer high foulants concentration per unit area high deposition rate and a dramatic decrease in the removal rate when it exceeds the critical fouling concentration the toc concentrations in the ds on day 1 16 36 and 61 were 0 33 0 13 0 13 and 1 80 mg l respectively lcocd analysis was performed to identify the removal mechanism of the organic fraction which changes according to fouling layer tendency and indicate which organic compounds are diffused and convected through the fo membrane table 3 shows the fractionation of om present in the fs and ds the om present in the fs in phase 2 is mainly characterized by lmw neutral 61 45 building blocks 19 1 and humic substances 10 1 but om in the ds is mainly composed of lmw neutrals 68 6 building blocks 15 2 and humic substances 13 3 humic substances building blocks and lmw are reportedly easily rejected by the fo membrane pore size 20 80 nm zhang et al 2020 and thus can significantly contribute to initial membrane fouling initial fouling deposition moreover the adsorption of lmw acids is unlikely to occur because of the electrostatic repulsion between them and the hydrophilic fo membrane in contrast lmw neutrals alcohols aldehydes and ketones can be easily adsorbed on a negatively charged membrane surface and or within the pores after 16 days phase 3 when the fouling layer was stabilized the removal rate increased slightly and the ratio of lmw neutrals and acids in the ds increased neutral 72 1 acid 12 5 though the removal rate was reduced during phase 4 and the proportion of high molecular weight om increased bio polymer and humic substances according to previous studies the sec fl peaks located at 20 000 da or more correspond to polysaccharide like substances pontié et al 2007 yamamura et al 2014 polysaccharide like substances are thought to be the major component of eps choi et al 2016 chon and cho 2016 in general polysaccharides contain amino sugars and polypeptides which can easily bind to proteins acting as precursors for hydrophilic membrane fouling size exclusion and sorption in addition polysaccharide like substances are generally neutral and if adsorbed may reduce the negative charge of the fo membrane im et al 2020a im et al 2018b the bio polymer observed in the lcocd analysis indirectly shows the presence of polysaccharides with some contribution from nitrogen containing materials such as proteins or amino sugars as shown in fig s3 and 4 peaks that were not observed at the beginning of the process approximately day 16 phase 3 were observed during the later parts of the process approximately day 36 and day 61 phase 3 and phase 4 these results were also confirmed by lcocd analysis vs hpsec analysis in this study the fouling layer thickness and om removal rate showed an opposite trends when the fouling layer became more homogenous decrease in roughness and the average thickness increased above 30 µm a reduction in om removal was observed it is believed that after the fouling layer is stabilized a secondary fouling layer is formed and the cp caused by the additional layer increases the diffusion and convection ratio of the om resulting in the passage of some om with larger molecular weights into the ds li et al 2019 this phenomenon coincided with the formation of an additional fouling layer bridging fouling formation a detailed characterization of the fouling layer was necessary to assess the distribution of om bio matter and inorganic matter constituting the fouling layer 3 4 fouled membrane analysis a final destructive membrane autopsy was performed after 66 days of operation to characterize the membrane fouling and identify the major foulants deposited in the fouling layer organic inorganic bio matter fig 6 shows the results of image characterization performed on the fouled membrane these images exhibit the morphological 3d oct surface sem and physicochemical proprieties of the fouling layer clsm live dead cell eps and protein as well as the distribution of inorganic ions eds as shown in fig 5 sem and oct after 66 days of operation the fo membrane surface was completely covered with contaminants the sem eds analysis highlighted the presence of monovalent and divalent ions in the fouling layer these ions resulted in the formation of a fouling layer through bridging with om on the surface of the membrane in fact divalent ions are reported to cause intermolecular adhesion through electrostatic interactions with phenolic and carboxylic groups in om the divalent ions interact with the om influencing the fouling layer compression and charge neutralization resulting in the compaction of the fouling layer and the reduction of the membrane surface charge tang et al 2009 moreover the interactions between the carboxylic groups and ca2 can generate a cross linked macromolecular network increasing membrane hydraulic resistance reducing water permeation and enhancing the diffusion coefficient of contaminants in addition the bulk concentration of the fouling layer was enhanced as some ions and om from the fs accumulated over time in the fouling layer the eds analysis of the fouling layer table s1 highlighted an enrichment in ca2 relative to other ions and compared with the inorganic composition of the fs table 1 as reported in studies comparing the effects of ca2 and mg2 on bridging fouling ca2 forms a calcium hydrophilic organic complexation eggbox like gelation relative to mg2 lee et al 2006 ca2 is a relatively small divalent ion compared to mg2 and si2 so it binds easily to the structural om in addition reportedly ca2 has a greater affinity than mg2 for hydrophobic om and bio polymers this was supported by the decreased rejection results for ions and om the clsm analysis allowed us to distinguish between the live and dead cells eps and proteins of the microorganisms deposited on the fo membrane surface these results indicate the simultaneous formation of organic and biological fouling on the fo membrane surface in phase 4 bio polymer polysaccharide lmw and building block substances were observed in the ds this result can probably be linked to the composition and cp influence of the fouling layer the aggregated fouling layer affects the hydrophilicity surface charge and back diffusion value of the membrane surface in fact the bio matter penetrated through the membrane due to the effect of the fouling enhanced cp layer and this result is consistent with the results of om analysis tables 2 and 3 to identify the functional groups of the om attached to the membrane surface atr ftir analyses were performed overall the absorbance of the fouled membrane was lower than that of the virgin membrane fig s5 the atr ftir spectrum of the fouled fo membrane exhibited differences when compared to that of the virgin membrane peaks high absorbance intensities were observed at 1090 cm 1 amide i c o carbonyl stretching 1540 cm 1 amide ii chromatic ring breathing and 1653 cm 1 amide i c o carbonyl stretching in the virgin membrane however significantly different peaks were observed in the fouled fo membrane including peaks at 1100 cm 1 alcohol c o stretching and 2356 cm 1 c n nitrile aromatic compounds which were derived from hydrophilic om polysaccharides and humic and fulvic acids in addition the relative hydrophobicity of the fo membrane surface shown in table 4 were obtained from analysis of the contact angle of the virgin and fouled membrane surfaces the contact angle of the virgin fo membrane was 67 1 while for the fouled fo membrane this angle increased to 81 9 increment value 14 8 this indicates that the fouled fo membrane surface was more hydrophobic than the virgin fo membrane 3 5 membrane fouling layer analysis liquid extraction extraction solution analysis was conducted to identify the characteristics of the types of om and to indirectly evaluate the efficiency of physical and chemical cleaning doc values of 0 21 and 3 56 mgc cm2 respectively were obtained for di and naoh extraction this result indirectly shows the efficiency of physical and chemical cleaning the results were confirmed by eem analysis as highlighted by the different peak intensities di water 60 80 mv naoh 80 100 mv the reversible fouling layer has strong hydrophobic properties and the irreversible fouling layer has strong hydrophilic properties im et al 2018b the molecular weight distribution and fluorescence characteristics of the extracted om are shown in fig 7 additionally table 5 shows the doc values om fractionation and lcocd results of the extraction solution therefore of di water extraction aromatic like om substances with molecular weights of 800 980 11 000 and 32 000 da were observed while protein like om substances with molecular weights of 120 900 and 9000 da were identified eem analysis confirmed that smp like substances humic acid like substances and aromatic proteins are the main contributors to the fouling layer the extracted om was fractionated in the order of tpi hpi hpo with lmw neutral material having the highest proportion 68 4 when 0 1 m naoh solution indicating chemical cleaning was extracted 16 9 times higher om 3 56 mgc cm2 was extracted compared to the extraction with di water 0 21 mgc cm2 indicating physical cleaning in contrast as a result of 0 1 m naoh extraction high peaks were observed at 800 980 and 32 000 da for aromatic like om substances and at 800 980 and 33 000 da for protein like om substances in addition smp like substances and humic acid like om as also had high peaks and have a fractionation order of hpi tpi hpo similar to di water extraction lmw neural substances 58 0 humic substances 22 4 and building blocks 17 8 were also registered through these results it is possible to indirectly confirm the difference between the physical and chemical cleaning efficiency in addition there appears to be a difference in the characteristics of the main om types constituting the initial deposition and fouling aggregation 4 conclusion process operation evaluation real time fouling monitoring and advanced fouling characterization were performed in forward osmosis process for wastewater reuse application using a primary effluent as the fs a comprehensive analysis based on the process performance water flux removal rate and characterization of fouling layer properties allowed linking the fouling layer characteristics with the fo process performance after 66 days of operation a detailed destructive analysis sem eds clsm extraction analysis of the fouling layer was performed to evaluate the composition of the main fouling layer through real time monitoring and image based analysis the physical properties of the fouling layer on the fo membrane surface could be evaluated under continuous operation the membrane fouling layer was classified into initial deposition stabilization and aggregation sections the properties of the fouling layer varied according to the formation period of each section the contaminant rejection rate of the virgin fo membrane is very high approximately 99 and is suitable for use in wastewater processing however as the fouling layer stabilized the rejection rate decreased owing to the increase in fouling layer cp effects through membrane autopsy analysis microbial based matter live dead cells eps protein om and a large amount of divalent ions were observed on the fouled membrane surface through the correlation between process performance and membrane autopsy analysis it is possible to identify major membrane contaminants and propose process optimization guidelines in addition the approach presented in this study can be directly applied to maintenance of membrane based water treatment technology and ict based process control technology therefore it is possible to establish the

17046,transformation of microplastics in aquatic environments and engineered systems e g wastewater treatment plants significantly affects their transport fate and effects here we present the counterintuitive finding that sulfide a prevalent nucleophile and reductant can result in oxidation of microplastics in addition to sulfide addition treating four model microplastics thermoplastic polyurethane polystyrene polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene with 0 1 mm sulfide in a tris buffer solution ph 7 2 25 c resulted in physical damages embrittlement and cracking and chemical transformation increased o c ratio and formation of c s bonds of the materials pre aging of the microplastics with o3 or uv treatment had varied effects on their reactivities toward sulfide depending on the specific structural and surface chemistry properties of the polymers electron paramagnetic resonance and radical trapping quenching experiments showed that sulfide underwent spontaneous oxidation to form oh radicals which acted as the primary oxidant to attack the carbon atoms in the polymer chains leading to surface oxidation and chain scission notably sulfide addition verified with x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses likely contributed to the physicochemical transformation of microplastics together with radical oxidation in a synergistic manner the findings unravel an important transformation route and a potential source of microplastics in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics transformation wastewater treatment oxidation sulfide addition hydroxyl radicals 1 introduction the wide spread of microplastics commonly referred to as plastic particles 5 mm in size in aquatic environments has become an increasing environmental concern koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2021 microplastics account for 13 5 of marine plastic budget koelmans et al 2017 and have been found in surface waters koelmans et al 2019 rachman 2018 and in waste streams sun et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2017 transformation of microplastics occurs both in the natural environment and during wastewater treatment processes as the results of various chemical physical and biological stresses such as sunlight exposure and chemical photo disinfection andrady 2011 ateia et al 2020 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 kelkar et al 2019 lin et al 2020 these processes can significantly alter the physicochemical properties of microplastics and consequently their environmental transport fate and effects huffer et al 2018 liu et al 2020a 2019c wu et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 for instance ultraviolet uv treatment of microplastics markedly affects their adsorption affinities toward organic contaminants e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ciprofloxacin by altering the surface area pore volume and contents of surface oxygen groups of the microplastics li et al 2020 liu et al 2019a transformation of microplastics induced by uv irradiation can also affect the leaching of additives and adsorbed contaminants liu et al 2020b luo et al 2020 a previously unidentified route that may significantly contribute to the transformation of microplastics is through sulfide induced reactions sulfide is a prevalent nucleophile and reductant both in the environment and in anaerobic wastewater treatment units kent et al 2014 rickard and luther 2007 due to biological sulfate reduction and wastewater discharge it is important to note that many sulfide rich environments e g estuary lake and river sediments sewage and wastewater treatment sludge are also important sinks and or hotspots of microplastics brandon et al 2019 niu et al 2021 sun et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2021 previous studies on engineered nanomaterials have demonstrated the important role of sulfide induced reactions in the transformation of these materials in natural environments and engineered systems e g wastewater treatment processes brunetti et al 2015 for example sulfide at environmentally relevant concentrations e g tens of micromolar to several millimolar and ambient temperature can result in significant loss or conversion of surface functional groups of carbonaceous nanomaterials e g graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes fu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 moreover sulfide spontaneously reacts with dissolved organic matter via nucleophilic substitution and or addition amrani and aizenshtat 2004 thus far the potential effects of sulfide on the transformation processes of microplastics remain unclear and we hypothesize that sulfide induced transformation is an important pathway of microplastics weathering in the natural environment and during wastewater treatment processes which alters the physicochemical properties and environmental behavior of microplastics the objective of this study was to understand the reactivity of common microplastics toward sulfide under environmentally relevant conditions as well as the reaction pathways involved four microplastics including thermoplastic polyurethane tpu polystyrene ps polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyethylene pe were selected as the model microplastics based on their wide use and abundance in environmental samples koelmans et al 2019 the four materials cover a wide range of polymeric properties tpu and ps are relative amorphous while pet and pe are crystalline tpu and pet contain oxygen atoms in their polymeric chains whereas the structures of carbon backbones of ps and pe are oxygen free wright and kelly 2017 zhang et al 2020 besides of the relatively uniform and well defined pristine materials which were used to clearly illustrate the changes of microplastics physicochemical properties and to understand the reaction mechanisms aged materials obtained by treating the pristine materials with uv light or ozone to simulate environmental weathering of microplastics gewert et al 2018 sun et al 2020 and weathering of microplastics during wastewater treatment hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 were also included to better represent microplastics in realistic environmental settings the 12 pristine

the acronyms of the microplastics a suspension of microplastics 500 mg in 500 ml deionized di water in a 1 l quartz tube was bubbled with o3 generated from pure o2 99 995 using a 3s a15 o3 generator tonglin technology co beijing china at a rate of 0 1 l min through a ceramic sparger for 5 d the uv aged microplastics indicated with the suffix uv were obtained by exposing the microplastics

22 μm membranes and the particles retained on the membranes were washed repeatedly with ethanol and di water freeze dried and collected the samples undergone sulfide treatment are noted with the suffix s for selected microplastics sulfide treatment experiments were also carried out in the presence of the oh scavenger isopropyl alcohol to verify the roles of oh in the transformation of microplastics additional experiments were carried out using ps to understand the effects of initial do concentration on the formation of oh and transformation of microplastics the initial do concentration was varied by purging the ps suspension with n2 as mentioned above sparging the suspension with o2 to enrich do or bypassing the purging sparging step 2 3 characterization of microplastics the physical dimensions and morphologies of the pristine aged and sulfide treated microplastics were characterized with scanning electron microscopy sem s 3400 n ii hitachi japan the average particle sizes were determined using imagej software by analyzing at least 500 particles in the sem images of each microplastics the specific surface area and pore volume were determined by n2 adsorption desorption at 77 k using an accelerated surface area and porosimetry system micromeritics asap 2460 norcross ga the number average molecular weight m n weight average molecular weight m w and polydispersity index pdi defined as m w m n was determined by gel permeation chromatography gpc on a security gpc system pl gpc 120 agilent technologies waldbronn germany tetrahydrofuran was used to dissolve tpu and ps and dichloromethane to dissolve pet and pe the surface elemental composition and functional groups were determined using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi 5000 versaprobe tokyo japan the chemical structures of the microplastics were also verified by uv visible spectrometry uv 2401 shimadzu japan particles of mps were mixed with pure barium sulfate and pressed into disks for analysis direct evidence of sulfide addition was gathered based on 13c nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectra obtained with a bruker spectrometer av400 rheinstetten germany at 100 mhz and deuterated chloroform cdcl3 was used as the solvent chemical shifts were reported in ppm down field from internal me4si statistical analysis was performed with spss 22 0 software package using analysis of independent samples t test or one way analysis of variance anova test 2 4 radical detection experiments electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometry ms400 magnettech germany was employed to gather direct evidence on the formation of free radical intermediates during sulfide treatment of microplastics with radicals trapped by the spin trapping agent dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo in a typical epr detection experiment 200 µl of di water electrolyte solution or a microplastics suspension was placed in a 2 ml centrifuge tube the solution or suspension was first purged with n2 under the same purging conditions as those in the sulfide treatment experiments of microplastics then either 1 µl dmpo solution 100 mm was added for the detection of oh or 1 ml dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and 1 µl dmpo solution 100 mm were added for the detection of o2 the mixture was hand shaken to homogenize and then immediately transferred to the epr cell the formation of oh was also confirmed using terephthalic acid ta as a chemical probe burns et al 2012 the concentrations of oh were determined by measuring the concentration of 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid 2hta formed by the reaction between oh and ta with high performance liquid chromatography waters alliancee 2695 milford ma equipped with a fluorescence detector excitation wavelength λ ex 315 nm and emission wavelength λ em 425 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfide treatment results in physical damages of microplastics treating the microplastics with low concentration of na2s 0 1 mm resulted in physical damages of the materials as manifested by the formation of cracks increased surface roughness reduction in particle sizes and increased specific surface area for most of the materials tested however the specific extents of the damages varied among different types of microplastics and between pristine and aged ones table s2 the sem images show that out of the four pristine microplastics three exhibited the formation of microcracks and micro debris upon sulfide treatment fig 1 a likely from the embrittlement and fragmentation of the materials the sulfide treated tpu i e tpu s was visibly lacerated compared with its untreated counterpart i e pristine tpu fig 1a1 1a2 cracks and pits appeared on the surfaces of ps and pet after sulfide treatment fig 1a3 1a6 in contrast the morphological features of pe did not change noticeably fig 1a7 1a8 the average particle sizes of tpu and ps decreased upon sulfide treatment by 33 1 and 27 3 respectively figs 1b and s1 also suggesting the breakdown of the particles the specific surface area and micropore volume of all four pristine microplastics increased upon sulfide treatment fig 1c 1d further corroborating the structural damages note that the specific surface area and micropore volume of pe increased by 109 p 0 01 and 57 1 p 0 05 respectively even though the morphological damages on this material were less visible than the other three materials fig 1a the number average molecular weight m n of pristine tpu decreased by 23 6 after sulfide treatment whereas those of ps pet and pe increased by 14 4 16 9 fig 1e it has been proposed that both crosslinking and chain scission of polymers may occur during weathering of plastics gradinaru et al 2019 pan et al 2012 and the net effects of these two counteracting processes would likely vary depending on the types of the microplastics the changes of polydispersity upon sulfidation table s2 are in line with this argument the varied effects of sulfide treatment on different microplastics were likely related to the differences in both the structural rigidity and elemental compositions among the polymers for example polymers with more amorphous and relatively open structures e g tpu schollenberger and goodrich 1979 and ps huffer et al 2018 may be more susceptible to damages as the reactants can penetrate the structures more easily huffer et al 2018 the sem images show that sulfide treatment incurred greater degrees of damages to the aged materials i e the ozone treated and uv treated microplastics than to the respective pristine materials more cracks were observable on tpu uv s and tpu o3 s than on tpu s fig 2a sulfide treatment resulted in more noticeable fragments fissures and rugged texture on the aged pss and pets than on their pristine counterparts fig 2b 2c sulfidation induced damages to the two aged pe materials were also more obvious than to pristine pe fig 2d additionally small particles of 0 3 1 8 μm appeared upon sulfide treatment of certain aged microplastics see the arrows in fig 2a4 2b2 and 2c4 indicating that polymer breakdown occurred note that for the aged microplastics the extents of sulfide induced changes of specific surface area pore volume and m n values varied considerably depending on the types of the microplastics and the mode of pre aging e g o3 vs uv aging table s2 while the changes of certain parameters were substantial for certain materials for example the specific surface area of tpu uv increased by 740 upon sulfide treatment no clear trends were observed 3 2 sulfide treatment results in chemical transformation of microplastics sulfide treatment also resulted in chemical transformation of the microplastics with the specific extents varying among the type of the polymers and between aged and pristine materials table s2 figs 3 s2 and s3 notably the xps data show that upon sulfide treatment three of the four pristine microplastics i e tpu ps and pet were oxidized indicated by the increased surface o c ratio fig 3a this was counterintuitive as sulfide is a common reductant in the environment and reduction of carbonaceous materials by sulfide was reported previously fu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 sulfide treatment also resulted in changes in the distribution of surface o functionality as indicated by the deconvoluted peaks of the c 1 s spectra corresponding to carbon atoms with different chemical states the c o content of tpu increased by 42 5 upon sulfide treatment fig 3c the surface of pristine ps consisted of essentially 100 c c c c but upon sulfide treatment c o and c o appeared accounting for 6 91 and 3 60 of the surface c fig 3c 3d additionally the formation of c s bonds upon sulfide treatment was evident for tpu ps and pet fig 3b based on the xps s 2p spectra figure s3 the two peaks at 164 and 165 2 ev can be assigned to the c s species kozlowski 2004 ren et al 2020 and the peak at 168 3 ev can be ascribed to sulphones and sulphates that may be caused by further oxidation of sulfide grzybek et al 2002 for the o3 and uv aged microplastics changes of surface o c ratio were only obvious for ps and pe the two microplastics containing no o atoms in their polymer chains table s2 moreover even for a given type of microplastics i e ps or pe the specific changes depended on the way the material was aged for example sulfide treatment resulted in decreased surface o content from 23 2 to 14 4 of ps o3 but increased content 5 15 to 8 44 for ps uv table s2 an opposite trend was observed for the two aged pe samples that is upon sulfide treatment the surface o content increased for pe o3 7 80 to 13 0 but decreased for pe uv 5 43 to 0 600 the changes of the distribution of surface o functional groups as indicated by the relative concentrations of surface c o vs c o also varied between aged ps and pe and between the same polymers aged in different ways table s2 the formation of c s bond was observed for all the aged microplastics except tpu o3 and pe uv table s2 figure s3 the varied effects of sulfide treatment on different aged microplastics were likely because sulfide and sulfide induced reactive species exhibited different reactivity towards different regions of polymers moreover while sulfide treatment can result in oxidation of microplastics as demonstrated using the pristine materials fig 3a it may also cause the loss or conversion of surface o functional groups ma and chen 2020 wang et al 2020a thus the insignificant changes in surface chemical compositions for certain aged materials particularly tpu and pet might have been the net counteracting effects of both oxidation and reduction of microplastics surfaces 3 3 sulfide generated hydroxyl radicals induce surface oxidation and chain scission of microplastics the abovementioned changes of elemental compositions and surface functionality indicate that the microplastics were being oxidized during sulfide treatment a possible explanation for this counterintuitive observation is that the oxidation of sulfide in aqueous solution triggered the formation of reactive oxygen species which then oxidized the microplastics it has been reported that at near neutral ph sulfide can undergo autoxidation to form superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution chen and morris 1972 tapley et al 1999 1 h s o 2 hs o 2 2 hs o 2 s ho 2 3 ho 2 h h 2 o 2 in a very recent study it was proposed that hydrogen sulfide or bisulfide can act as the reducing agent to react with h2o2 at neutral ph resulting in the formation of oh via a fenton like mechanism lomardo et al 2020 these processes likely have occurred under the experimental conditions of the present study generating highly reactive oh and consequently triggering surface oxidation of the microplastics in a previous study the formation of oh when sulfide 1 mm was introduced to artificial seawater was confirmed using epr tapley et al 1999 to gather direct evidence that sulfide was able to trigger the formation of reactive oxygen species under the experimental conditions of the present study we carried out epr spin trapping experiments using dmpo 0 5 mm as a spin trapping agent of oh and o2 in all the systems containing 0 1 mm sulfide i e sulfide in di water sulfide in tris buffer and sulfide in microplastics suspension oh and o2 were invariably detected figs 4a and s4 in comparison in the reaction systems containing no sulfide i e di water tris buffer and ps in tris buffer no signals were observed in the spectra figs 4a and s4 indicating that negligible amounts of oh and o2 radicals were formed similarly in the radical probing experiments conducted using terephthalic acid as the probe of oh 2hta the reaction product of terephthalic acid with oh was only observed in the reaction systems containing sulfide fig 4b to verify that oh generated was responsible for the physicochemical transformation of the microplastics during sulfide treatment we carried out additional experiments using ps one of the o free polymers as the model polymer the addition of excess isopropyl alcohol 300 mm a oh scavenger in the ps suspension in tris buffer significantly inhibited the transformation of the microplastics in the presence of the oh scavenger the specific area of ps remained essentially unchanged upon sulfide treatment compared with an 120 increase without the scavenger fig 4c the xps data showed that when the oh scavenger was added the c 1 s spectrum of the sulfide treated ps showed no differences from that of the pristine ps in that only one major peak at 284 6 ev corresponding to the c c c c was detected and the peaks of surface o containing groups c o and c o were not observable fig 4d based on the above analysis and the literature gligorovski et al 2015 neyens and baeyens 2003 shang et al 2003 singh and sharma 2008 wang et al 2020b yousif and haddad 2013 we propose the following pathways using ps as an example to explain how the oh radicals formed due to the spontaneous oxidation of sulfide likely have induced the transformation of microplastics see fig 5 for the schematic illustration specifically oh can attack the c h bond on the tertiary carbon atoms i e species a in fig 5 the tertiary carbon are more reactive than the primary and secondary carbons in the polymeric chains of the microplastics to generate polymer alkyl radicals species b neyens and baeyens 2003 which then react with dissolved oxygen to form polymer peroxy radicals species c shang et al 2003 note that the reaction of species b with oh can also form species c but the reaction with dissolved oxygen is thermodynamically more favorable as the activation energy of the reaction with oxygen is nearly zero gligorovski et al 2015 the polymer peroxy radicals can abstract hydrogen atoms from polymer molecules noted as rh in the figure to form hydroperoxides species d yousif and haddad 2013 the cleavage of oh from species d leads to the formation of polymer alkyloxy species e singh and sharma 2008 which can either abstract hydrogen from polymer molecules rh to form a species with hydroxyl function groups species f or undergo chain cleavage as triggered by electron delocalization leading to the formation of species containing carbonyl group species g and c c bonds species h wang et al 2020b yousif and haddad 2013 this last chain scission step was likely the cause for the observed physical damages to the microplastic particles such as the formation of cracks and fractures and the increased surface roughness as well as the chemical transformation in particular the increase of surface hydroxyl and carboxyl groups the proposed pathways in fig 5 are in line with the changes of the uv vis absorbance of the four pristine microplastics upon sulfide treatment figs 6 and s5 the spectra of the pristine tpu ps and pet exhibit a peak at 270 300 nm assigned to the π π transition of the benzene chromophore the red shift of the peaks of tpu and pet in comparison to that of the ps is attributable to the increased conjugation of benzene chromophore by the presence of polyurethane and carboxyl groups while that of the pristine pe is essentially featureless upon sulfide treatment the intensity of the peak at 270 300 nm was reduced indicating the decrease of the amounts of benzene rings see fig 6a for an example strikingly a new wide absorption band centered at approximately 350 nm emerged on the spectra of tpu ps and pet figs 6a and s5 the new feature was likely due to the increased n π transitions from the addition of electron donating groups such as oh c o and c c to the conjugation of benzene chromophore pan et al 2012 tjandraatmadja et al 2002 consistent with the formation of species f g and h in fig 5 note that a weak absorption band in the range of 250 300 nm appeared on the spectrum of pe fig 6b possibly due to the formation of c c and c o in the polymer chains it is necessary to note that additional reactions might have occurred besides of those depicted in fig 5 first the reactions with oh may also result in the loss of oxygen from the polymeric structures a previous study on photochemical transformation of carbonaceous nanomaterials showed that oh can remove carboxyl groups from carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes while simultaneously creating oxygen containing functional groups with an overall decrease in total surface o content qu et al 2013 such counteracting reactions might have been responsible for the varied effects of sulfide treatment on the surface o functionality of the aged microplastics with the grafting of new functional groups and removal of the existing ones formed during o3 or uv aging occurring simultaneously the relative importance of the two processes would depend on the specific activities of different sites being attacked by oh second coupling of radicals and small molecules generated during the reactions depicted in fig 5 might have occurred gradinaru et al 2019 pan et al 2012 forming structures with higher molecular weight consistent with the increase of m n of certain microplastics upon sulfide treatment moreover sulfide can be slowly oxidized to sulfur which can react with sulfide to form polysulfides francois 1987 as stronger reductants than s2 and hs polysulfides are expected to be more effective in activating molecular oxygen the fact that the steady state concentration of oh as well as the degrees of physical damages and chemical transformation did not increase appreciably with the initial do concentration figures s6 and s7 might also indicate that there were multiple sinks of oh and suggests that the sulfide induced generation of oh can be triggered under oxygen deficient conditions e g those at sediment water interface 3 4 sulfide addition reactions are an additional pathway of chemical transformation as mentioned earlier the xps spectra indicate the formation of c s species sulphones and sulphates during sulfide treatment for most of the microplastics tested figure s3 moreover a comparison between the 13c nmr spectra of ps and ps s fig 6c 6d showed that upon sulfide treatment several new peaks appeared around 10 50 ppm the characteristic field of c s bonds particularly the peak at 37 1 ppm schoenauer et al 2019 further confirming the incorporation of s to the surfaces of the microplastics it has been reported that sulfide can react with natural organic matter via nucleophilic substitution and or addition resulting in the formation of organic polysulfide or sulfide linkages amrani and aizenshtat 2004 francois 1987 lalonde et al 1987 perlinger et al 2002 yu et al 2015 such reactions mostly likely occurred through the michael addition reaction pathway wherein s2 or polysulfide as the nucleophile attacks the conjugated double bonds to form sulfhydryl groups perlinger et al 2002 yu et al 2015 similarly it was reported that polysulfides can attack α β unsaturated isoprenoid aldehydes in artificial seawater also via michael addition amrani and aizenshtat 2004 intriguingly none of the four pristine microplastics contained c c bonds in their polymeric structures this indicates that during sulfide treatment the chemical transformation of polymers likely started with the oxidation of polymer chains by oh which generated c c bonds during the chain scission step i e species h in fig 5 therefore enabling sulfide addition note that the reaction of hydrogen atoms bound to sulfide are more reactive towards oh than those bound to carbon buxton et al 1988 thus sulfide addition might have further facilitated the oxidation of the polymers i e the first reaction step depicted in fig 5 accordingly the observed transformation of the microplastics under the experimental conditions of the present study likely was due to the synergistic effects of radical oxidation and sulfide addition 4 conclusion there has been increasing awareness of the potential environmental risks and implications of microplastics and nanoplastics transformation of these small plastic particles in the environment can modify their physicochemical properties and consequently fate transport and effects the following conclusions can be drawn from the findings of this study sulfide an environmentally abundant and ubiquitous constituent can trigger the transformation of microplastics even for the materials of rigid structures seemingly recalcitrant to environmental stress this may have important implications not only for the environmental behaviors of microplastics but also for the leaching of hazardous additives while the oh radicals formed from the spontaneous oxidation of sulfide are primarily responsible for the surface oxidation and physical damages of microplastics sulfide addition reactions also play an important role and likely affect the transformation of microplastics along with radical oxidations in a synergistic manner weathering of plastic debris in the environment due to physical chemical and biological stress is a major source of micro and nano sized plastics the findings of this study indicate that sulfide induced physical damages might be a

17046,transformation of microplastics in aquatic environments and engineered systems e g wastewater treatment plants significantly affects their transport fate and effects here we present the counterintuitive finding that sulfide a prevalent nucleophile and reductant can result in oxidation of microplastics in addition to sulfide addition treating four model microplastics thermoplastic polyurethane polystyrene polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene with 0 1 mm sulfide in a tris buffer solution ph 7 2 25 c resulted in physical damages embrittlement and cracking and chemical transformation increased o c ratio and formation of c s bonds of the materials pre aging of the microplastics with o3 or uv treatment had varied effects on their reactivities toward sulfide depending on the specific structural and surface chemistry properties of the polymers electron paramagnetic resonance and radical trapping quenching experiments showed that sulfide underwent spontaneous oxidation to form oh radicals which acted as the primary oxidant to attack the carbon atoms in the polymer chains leading to surface oxidation and chain scission notably sulfide addition verified with x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses likely contributed to the physicochemical transformation of microplastics together with radical oxidation in a synergistic manner the findings unravel an important transformation route and a potential source of microplastics in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics transformation wastewater treatment oxidation sulfide addition hydroxyl radicals 1 introduction the wide spread of microplastics commonly referred to as plastic particles 5 mm in size in aquatic environments has become an increasing environmental concern koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2021 microplastics account for 13 5 of marine plastic budget koelmans et al 2017 and have been found in surface waters koelmans et al 2019 rachman 2018 and in waste streams sun et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2017 transformation of microplastics occurs both in the natural environment and during wastewater treatment processes as the results of various chemical physical and biological stresses such as sunlight exposure and chemical photo disinfection andrady 2011 ateia et al 2020 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 kelkar et al 2019 lin et al 2020 these processes can significantly alter the physicochemical properties of microplastics and consequently their environmental transport fate and effects huffer et al 2018 liu et al 2020a 2019c wu et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 for instance ultraviolet uv treatment of microplastics markedly affects their adsorption affinities toward organic contaminants e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ciprofloxacin by altering the surface area pore volume and contents of surface oxygen groups of the microplastics li et al 2020 liu et al 2019a transformation of microplastics induced by uv irradiation can also affect the leaching of additives and adsorbed contaminants liu et al 2020b luo et al 2020 a previously unidentified route that may significantly contribute to the transformation of microplastics is through sulfide induced reactions sulfide is a prevalent nucleophile and reductant both in the environment and in anaerobic wastewater treatment units kent et al 2014 rickard and luther 2007 due to biological sulfate reduction and wastewater discharge it is important to note that many sulfide rich environments e g estuary lake and river sediments sewage and wastewater treatment sludge are also important sinks and or hotspots of microplastics brandon et al 2019 niu et al 2021 sun et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2021 previous studies on engineered nanomaterials have demonstrated the important role of sulfide induced reactions in the transformation of these materials in natural environments and engineered systems e g wastewater treatment processes brunetti et al 2015 for example sulfide at environmentally relevant concentrations e g tens of micromolar to several millimolar and ambient temperature can result in significant loss or conversion of surface functional groups of carbonaceous nanomaterials e g graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes fu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 moreover sulfide spontaneously reacts with dissolved organic matter via nucleophilic substitution and or addition amrani and aizenshtat 2004 thus far the potential effects of sulfide on the transformation processes of microplastics remain unclear and we hypothesize that sulfide induced transformation is an important pathway of microplastics weathering in the natural environment and during wastewater treatment processes which alters the physicochemical properties and environmental behavior of microplastics the objective of this study was to understand the reactivity of common microplastics toward sulfide under environmentally relevant conditions as well as the reaction pathways involved four microplastics including thermoplastic polyurethane tpu polystyrene ps polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyethylene pe were selected as the model microplastics based on their wide use and abundance in environmental samples koelmans et al 2019 the four materials cover a wide range of polymeric properties tpu and ps are relative amorphous while pet and pe are crystalline tpu and pet contain oxygen atoms in their polymeric chains whereas the structures of carbon backbones of ps and pe are oxygen free wright and kelly

materials as manifested by the formation of cracks increased surface roughness reduction in particle sizes and increased specific surface area for most of the materials tested however the specific extents of the damages varied among different types of microplastics and between pristine and aged ones table s2 the sem images show that out of the four pristine microplastics three exhibited the formation of microcracks and micro debris upon sulfide treatment fig 1 a likely from the embrittlement and fragmentation of the materials the sulfide treated tpu i e tpu s was visibly lacerated compared with its untreated counterpart i e pristine tpu fig 1a1 1a2 cracks and pits appeared on the surfaces of ps and pet after sulfide treatment fig 1a3 1a6 in contrast the morphological features of pe did not change noticeably fig 1a7 1a8 the average particle sizes of tpu and ps decreased upon sulfide treatment by 33 1 and 27 3 respectively figs 1b and s1 also suggesting the breakdown of the particles the specific surface area and micropore volume of all four pristine microplastics increased upon sulfide treatment fig 1c 1d further corroborating the structural damages note that the specific surface area and micropore volume of pe increased by 109 p 0 01 and 57 1 p 0 05 respectively even though the morphological damages on this material were less visible than the other three materials fig 1a the number average molecular weight m n of pristine tpu decreased by 23 6 after sulfide treatment whereas those of ps pet and pe increased by 14 4 16 9 fig 1e it has been proposed that both crosslinking and chain scission of polymers may occur during weathering of plastics gradinaru et al 2019 pan et al 2012 and the net effects of these two counteracting processes would likely vary depending on the types of the microplastics the changes of polydispersity upon sulfidation table s2 are in line with this argument the varied effects of sulfide treatment on different microplastics were likely related to the differences in both the structural rigidity and elemental compositions among the polymers for example polymers with more amorphous and relatively open structures e g tpu schollenberger and goodrich 1979 and ps huffer et al 2018 may be more susceptible to damages as the reactants can penetrate the structures more easily huffer et al 2018 the sem images show that sulfide treatment incurred greater degrees of damages to the aged materials i e the ozone treated and uv treated microplastics than to the respective pristine materials more cracks were observable on tpu uv s and tpu o3 s than on tpu s fig 2a sulfide treatment resulted in more noticeable fragments fissures and rugged texture on the aged pss and pets than on their pristine counterparts fig 2b 2c sulfidation induced damages to the two aged pe materials were also more obvious than to pristine pe fig 2d additionally small particles of 0 3 1 8 μm appeared upon sulfide treatment of certain aged microplastics see the arrows in fig 2a4 2b2 and 2c4 indicating that polymer breakdown occurred note that for the aged microplastics the extents of sulfide induced changes of specific surface area pore volume and m n values varied considerably depending on the types of the microplastics and the mode of pre aging e g o3 vs uv aging table s2 while the changes of certain parameters were substantial for certain materials for example the specific surface area of tpu uv increased by 740 upon sulfide treatment no clear trends were observed 3 2 sulfide treatment results in chemical transformation of microplastics sulfide treatment also resulted in chemical transformation of the microplastics with the specific extents varying among the type of the polymers and between aged and pristine materials table s2 figs 3 s2 and s3 notably the xps data show that upon sulfide treatment three of the four pristine microplastics i e tpu ps and pet were oxidized indicated by the increased surface o c ratio fig 3a this was counterintuitive as sulfide is a common reductant in the environment and reduction of carbonaceous materials by sulfide was reported previously fu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 sulfide treatment also resulted in changes in the distribution of surface o functionality as indicated by the deconvoluted peaks of the c 1 s spectra corresponding to carbon atoms with different chemical states the c o content of tpu increased by 42 5 upon sulfide treatment fig 3c the surface of pristine ps consisted of essentially 100 c c c c but upon sulfide treatment c o and c o appeared accounting for 6 91 and 3 60 of the surface c fig 3c 3d additionally the formation of c s bonds upon sulfide treatment was evident for tpu ps and pet fig 3b based on the xps s 2p spectra figure s3 the two peaks at 164 and 165 2 ev can be assigned to the c s species kozlowski 2004 ren et al 2020 and the peak at 168 3 ev can be ascribed to sulphones and sulphates that may be caused by further oxidation of sulfide grzybek et al 2002 for the o3 and uv aged microplastics changes of surface o c ratio were only obvious for ps and pe the two microplastics containing no o atoms in their polymer chains table s2 moreover even for a given type of microplastics i e ps or pe the specific changes depended on the way the material was aged for example sulfide treatment resulted in decreased surface o content from 23 2 to 14 4 of ps o3 but increased content 5 15 to 8 44 for ps uv table s2 an opposite trend was observed for the two aged pe samples that is upon sulfide treatment the surface o content increased for pe o3 7 80 to 13 0 but decreased for pe uv 5 43 to 0 600 the changes of the distribution of surface o functional groups as indicated by the relative concentrations of surface c o vs c o also varied between aged ps and pe and between the same polymers aged in different ways table s2 the formation of c s bond was observed for all the aged microplastics except tpu o3 and pe uv table s2 figure s3 the varied effects of sulfide treatment on different aged microplastics were likely because sulfide and sulfide induced reactive species exhibited different reactivity towards different regions of polymers moreover while sulfide treatment can result in oxidation of microplastics as demonstrated using the pristine materials fig 3a it may also cause the loss or conversion of surface o functional groups ma and chen 2020 wang et al 2020a thus the insignificant changes in surface chemical compositions for certain aged materials particularly tpu and pet might have been the net counteracting effects of both oxidation and reduction of microplastics surfaces 3 3 sulfide generated hydroxyl radicals induce surface oxidation and chain scission of microplastics the abovementioned changes of elemental compositions and surface functionality indicate that the microplastics were being oxidized during sulfide treatment a possible explanation for this counterintuitive observation is that the oxidation of sulfide in aqueous solution triggered the formation of reactive oxygen species which then oxidized the microplastics it has been reported that at near neutral ph sulfide can undergo autoxidation to form superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution chen and morris 1972 tapley et al 1999 1 h s o 2 hs o 2 2 hs o 2 s ho 2 3 ho 2 h h 2 o 2 in a very recent study it was proposed that hydrogen sulfide or bisulfide can act as the reducing agent to react with h2o2 at neutral ph resulting in the formation of oh via a fenton like mechanism lomardo et al 2020 these processes likely have occurred under the experimental conditions of the present study generating highly reactive oh and consequently triggering surface oxidation of the microplastics in a previous study the formation of oh when sulfide 1 mm was introduced to artificial seawater was confirmed using epr tapley et al 1999 to gather direct evidence that sulfide was able to trigger the formation of reactive oxygen species under the experimental conditions of the present study we carried out epr spin trapping experiments using dmpo 0 5 mm as a spin trapping agent of oh and o2 in all the systems containing 0 1 mm sulfide i e sulfide in di water sulfide in tris buffer and sulfide in microplastics suspension oh and o2 were invariably detected figs 4a and s4 in comparison in the reaction systems containing no sulfide i e di water tris buffer and ps in tris buffer no signals were observed in the spectra figs 4a and s4 indicating that negligible amounts of oh and o2 radicals were formed similarly in the radical probing experiments conducted using terephthalic acid as the probe of oh 2hta the reaction product of terephthalic acid with oh was only observed in the reaction systems containing sulfide fig 4b to verify that oh generated was responsible for the physicochemical transformation of the microplastics during sulfide treatment we carried out additional experiments using ps one of the o free polymers as the model polymer the addition of excess isopropyl alcohol 300 mm a oh scavenger in the ps suspension in tris buffer significantly inhibited the transformation of the microplastics in the presence of the oh scavenger the specific area of ps remained essentially unchanged upon sulfide treatment compared with an 120 increase without the scavenger fig 4c the xps data showed that when the oh scavenger was added the c 1 s spectrum of the sulfide treated ps showed no differences from that of the pristine ps in that only one major peak at 284 6 ev corresponding to the c c c c was detected and the peaks of surface o containing groups c o and c o were not observable fig 4d based on the above analysis and the literature gligorovski et al 2015 neyens and baeyens 2003 shang et al 2003 singh and sharma 2008 wang et al 2020b yousif and haddad 2013 we propose the following pathways using ps as an example to explain how the oh radicals formed due to the spontaneous oxidation of sulfide likely have induced the transformation of microplastics see fig 5 for the schematic illustration specifically oh can attack the c h bond on the tertiary carbon atoms i e species a in fig 5 the tertiary carbon are more reactive than the primary and secondary carbons in the polymeric chains of the microplastics to generate polymer alkyl radicals species b neyens and baeyens 2003 which then react with dissolved oxygen to form polymer peroxy radicals species c shang et al 2003 note that the reaction of species b with oh can also form species c but the reaction with dissolved oxygen is thermodynamically more favorable as the activation energy of the reaction with oxygen is nearly zero gligorovski et al 2015 the polymer peroxy radicals can abstract hydrogen atoms from polymer molecules noted as rh in the figure to form hydroperoxides species d yousif and haddad 2013 the cleavage of oh from species d leads to the formation of polymer alkyloxy species e singh and sharma 2008 which can either abstract hydrogen from polymer molecules rh to form a species with hydroxyl function groups species f or undergo chain cleavage as triggered by electron delocalization leading to the formation of species containing carbonyl group species g and c c bonds species h wang et al 2020b yousif and haddad 2013 this last chain scission step was likely the cause for the observed physical damages to the microplastic particles such as the formation of cracks and fractures and the increased surface roughness as well as the chemical transformation in particular the increase of surface hydroxyl and carboxyl groups the proposed pathways in fig 5 are in line with the changes of the uv vis absorbance of the four pristine microplastics upon sulfide treatment figs 6 and s5 the spectra of the pristine tpu ps and pet exhibit a peak at 270 300 nm assigned to the π π transition of the benzene chromophore the red shift of the peaks of tpu and pet in comparison to that of the ps is attributable to the increased conjugation of benzene chromophore by the presence of polyurethane and carboxyl groups while that of the pristine pe is essentially featureless upon sulfide treatment the intensity of the peak at 270 300 nm was reduced indicating the decrease of the amounts of benzene rings see fig 6a for an example strikingly a new wide absorption band centered at approximately 350 nm emerged on the spectra of tpu ps and pet figs 6a and s5 the new feature was likely due to the increased n π transitions from the addition of electron donating groups such as oh c o and c c to the conjugation of benzene chromophore pan et al 2012 tjandraatmadja et al 2002 consistent with the formation of species f g and h in fig 5 note that a weak absorption band in the range of 250 300 nm appeared on the spectrum of pe fig 6b possibly due to the formation of c c and c o in the polymer chains it is necessary to note that additional reactions might have occurred besides of those depicted in fig 5 first the reactions with oh may also result in the loss of oxygen from the polymeric structures a previous study on photochemical transformation of carbonaceous nanomaterials showed that oh can remove carboxyl groups from carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes while simultaneously creating oxygen containing functional groups with an overall decrease in total surface o content qu et al 2013 such counteracting reactions might have been responsible for the varied effects of sulfide treatment on the surface o functionality of the aged microplastics with the grafting of new functional groups and removal of the existing ones formed during o3 or uv aging occurring simultaneously the relative importance of the two processes would depend on the specific activities of different sites being attacked by oh second coupling of radicals and small molecules generated during the reactions depicted in fig 5 might have occurred gradinaru et al 2019 pan et al 2012 forming structures with higher molecular weight consistent with the increase of m n of certain microplastics upon sulfide treatment moreover sulfide can be slowly oxidized to sulfur which can react with sulfide to form polysulfides francois 1987 as stronger reductants than s2 and hs polysulfides are expected to be more effective in activating molecular oxygen the fact that the steady state concentration of oh as well as the degrees of physical damages and chemical transformation did not increase appreciably with the initial do concentration figures s6 and s7 might also indicate that there were multiple sinks of oh and suggests that the sulfide induced generation of oh can be triggered under oxygen deficient conditions e g those at sediment water interface 3 4 sulfide addition reactions are an additional pathway of chemical transformation as mentioned earlier the xps spectra indicate the formation of c s species sulphones and sulphates during sulfide treatment for most of the microplastics tested figure s3 moreover a comparison between the 13c nmr spectra of ps and ps s fig 6c 6d showed that upon sulfide treatment several new peaks appeared around 10 50 ppm the characteristic field of c s bonds particularly the peak at 37 1 ppm schoenauer et al 2019 further confirming the incorporation of s to the surfaces of the microplastics it has been reported that sulfide can react with natural organic matter via nucleophilic substitution and or addition resulting in the formation of organic polysulfide or sulfide linkages amrani and aizenshtat 2004 francois 1987 lalonde et al 1987 perlinger et al 2002 yu et al 2015 such reactions mostly likely occurred through the michael addition reaction pathway wherein s2 or polysulfide as the nucleophile attacks the conjugated double bonds to form sulfhydryl groups perlinger et al 2002 yu et al 2015 similarly it was reported that polysulfides can attack α β unsaturated isoprenoid aldehydes in artificial seawater also via michael addition amrani and aizenshtat 2004 intriguingly none of the four pristine microplastics contained c c bonds in their polymeric structures this indicates that during sulfide treatment the chemical transformation of polymers likely started with the oxidation of polymer chains by oh which generated c c bonds during the chain scission step i e species h in fig 5 therefore enabling sulfide addition note that the reaction of hydrogen atoms bound to sulfide are more reactive towards oh than those bound to carbon buxton et al 1988 thus sulfide addition might have further facilitated the oxidation of the polymers i e the first reaction step depicted in fig 5 accordingly the observed transformation of the microplastics under the experimental conditions of the present study likely was due to the synergistic effects of radical oxidation and sulfide addition 4 conclusion there has been increasing awareness of the potential environmental risks and implications of microplastics and nanoplastics transformation of these small plastic particles in the environment can modify their physicochemical properties and consequently fate transport and effects the following conclusions can be drawn from the findings of this study sulfide an environmentally abundant and ubiquitous constituent can trigger the transformation of microplastics even for the materials of rigid structures seemingly recalcitrant to environmental stress this may have important implications not only for the environmental behaviors of microplastics but also for the leaching of hazardous additives while the oh radicals formed from the spontaneous oxidation of sulfide are primarily responsible for the surface oxidation and physical damages of microplastics sulfide addition reactions also play an important role and likely affect the transformation of microplastics along with radical oxidations in a synergistic manner weathering of plastic debris in the environment due to physical chemical and biological stress is a major source of micro and nano sized plastics the findings of this study indicate that sulfide induced physical damages might be a

to be a promising technology to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates pha however work performed thus far has focussed mainly on the use of synthetic feedstocks and operational conditions that differ from those expectable in full scale processes the goals of this work were to study for the first time the capability of pmcs to produce pha using real fermented domestic wastewater as feedstock under mixing light temperature conditions that are naturally found in outdoor open systems various operational strategies were evaluated in this study to increase pha productivity namely the poly 3 hydroxybutyric co 3 hydroxyvaleric copolymer phbv by pmc systems two lab scale photobioreactors were operated in parallel with transient illumination 12 h light 12 h dark and subjected to feedstock fluctuations under two culture selection strategies that best suit the oxidative conditions of high rate algal ponds hraps which are commonly applied in wastewater treatment plants wwtp under a permanent carbon feast regime selection strategy 1 the pmc became highly enriched in phototrophic purple bacteria ppb and two complementary conditions that can improve the selection of pha accumulating bacteria were discovered phosphate cycling where 20 pha vss 86hb 14hv in a c mol basis with a light phase productivity of 0 23 g pha l d light phase was attained and transitioning from selection under low organic loading rate olr to high olr where 17 6 pha vss 60hb 40hv in c base with a light phase productivity of 0 18 g pha l d light phase was achieved under a feast and famine regime selection strategy 2 a pmc consortium of microalgae and ppb was obtained and a multiple pulse feeding strategy during the first hours of the light phase in the selector reactor led to a 26 1 pha vss 36hb 64hv in c base content with a productivity of 0 26 g pha l d light phase and 0 52 g pha l d feast phase an accumulation test under higher light intensity led to 30 8 pha vss 85hb 15hv on a c mol basis with a productivity of 2 67 g pha l d along the 8 h of accumulation keywords polyhydroxyalkanoates pha phototrophic purple bacteria ppb wastewater treatment added value bioproduct

wastewater molasses mixture wwtp wastewater treatment plants 1 introduction plastics have become an essential material for our society with applications in a wide variety of markets e g agriculture packaging automotive building and construction however traditional plastics are non degradable and persist in the environment accumulating as waste to overcome this situation the plastic industry is evolving from the use of synthetic molecules to new natural feedstocks to produce biodegradable plastics polyhydroxyalkanoates pha are an example of natural polymers produced and internally stored by bacteria as carbon and energy reserves pha are fully biodegradable polyesters with thermoplastic properties which makes this material a potential substitute for traditional plastics muhammadi et al 2015 moreover pha can be produced by mixed microbial cultures fed with 2nd generation feedstocks e g solid wastes wastewater therefore not competing with crops and promoting waste valorisation also the operation of open systems combined with the utilization of cheap agro industrial wastes can decrease pha production costs making this polymer more economically attractive reis et al 2003 in line with this cost reduction effort a new pha producing system has been developed in the last years which uses phototrophic mixed cultures pmc fradinho et al 2013a b 2016 these cultures are enriched in pha accumulating phototrophic purple bacteria ppb that use light energy as a means of producing atp and are operated anaerobically saving costs regarding aeration the selection of pmcs with the capability to accumulate pha can either occur using an organic carbon feast and famine regime ff fradinho et al 2013a or an organic carbon permanent feast regime pf fradinho et al 2016 in the first case consortia of microalgae and bacteria are typically selected with results indicating that pha accumulation levels of 20 with acetate feeding under continuous illumination fradinho et al 2013a and 30 pha content in alternating light dark conditions fradinho et al 2013b are achievable under a pf regime the culture is maintained in the permanent presence of external carbon and it becomes highly enriched in pha accumulating ppb these anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria do not release oxygen when illuminated but they do produce atp phototrophically they thrive in anaerobic conditions and when fed with reduced organic molecules like volatile fatty acids vfa they can dissipate excess reducing power through pha production therefore unlike the ff strategy where organisms are selected for their capability of growing on the accumulated pha the pf strategy selects organisms for their capability of internally regulating the cell s reducing power through pha formation studies with pmcs selected under the pf strategy with acetate as the carbon source indicated the culture capability to accumulate up to 60 pha content in accumulation trials the maximum value ever reported for a pmc fradinho et al 2016 until now these promising studies were mostly conducted using synthetic feedstocks and ideal illuminated conditions fradinho et al 2019 however it is essential to evaluate pmc s capability of producing pha when they are fed with real feedstocks and subjected to light temperature conditions that are naturally found outdoors a critical factor widely recognised in this field capson tojo et al 2020 the real feedstocks contain several carbon sources and other compounds that may have an impact on the selection and metabolism of the pmc as a first approach for this evaluation the operating conditions tested in the present work were based on the operating conditions currently applied in high rate algal ponds hrap these are photosynthetic systems that rely on microalgae bacterial consortia to perform wastewater treatment being commonly used worldwide either for wastewater pre treatment in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp or to directly treat wastewater prior to water discharge into surface waters mahaprata et al 2013 usually hrap are operated under open and sunlight illuminated conditions presenting liquid heights in the range of 0 3 0 6 m young et al 2017 craggs et al 2012 and diverse mixing systems like paddle wheels submersible jet mixers or low energy algae reactor lear mixers kohlheb et al al 2020 monti et al 2013 depending on the operating liquid height and mixing system ponds are more prone to experience oxidative conditions and as such different operating strategies can be devised in order to promote the development of microbial consortia adapted to the ponds oxidative state since the referred hrap conditions are very similar to those that pmc can face in outdoor conditions this work intends to evaluate pmc s capability to produce pha following two operating strategies that best suit the oxidative conditions found in hrap the first strategy is based on ponds that present suboxic conditions i e ponds that are operated with high liquid height low volumetric light availability and use submersible mixers low oxygen diffusion at the liquid surface for ponds with these characteristics herein called submersible mixed ponds the strategy involves operating pmc under a permanent feast strategy which as mentioned before requires anaerobic conditions the second strategy is based on ponds that present more oxidative conditions typically ponds with lower liquid height higher volumetric light availability and higher presence of oxygen producing microalgae and use paddle wheel thrust higher oxygen diffusion for these ponds herein called paddle wheel ponds the strategy involves operating the pmc under a feast and famine strategy that requires microaerophilic conditions both types of ponds are currently utilised in full scale operations and represent the state of the art in hrap operations de godos et al 2016 this study investigates the impact of operational strategies on pha production by pmcs using real fermented feedstocks under conditions representative of the mixing light intensity and temperature found in outdoor systems such as hraps this represents both a novel and needed progress with respect to advancing pmc technology for pha production by feeding pmc with real fermented feedstocks and operating them using the two aforementioned operating strategies this work will allow the evaluation of pmc s pha production performance under the two sets of conditions and ascertain the pha production potential of pmcs for outdoor operation the focus of the work is on the evaluation of pha productivity as well as maximum pha content achieved under these realistic operational strategies 2 methods 2 1 mixed photosynthetic culture operation two sequencing batch reactors sbr1 and sbr2 with a working volume of 5 8 l each were inoculated with mixotrophic microalgae sludge biomass from a 10 m3 hrap hrt 7 days from el torno wwtp aqualia at chiclana andalucia spain fed with urban wastewater both reactors were operated for 210 days with a temperature controlled at 25 c and under a 24 hour cycle with alternating periods of light 12 h and dark 12 h being externally illuminated by a halogen lamp 60 w the adaptation period stage 0 started with a single pulse of carbon feed with no purge or complementary feeding along that stage sbr1 simulated a submersible jet mixed hrap that presented a kla of 0 0035 min 1 and a liquid height of 0 60 m low oxygen and low light availability hrap the kla in sbr1 was set solely through reactor mixing the reactor was operated under a permanent feast regime at a light intensity of 193 w m2 which corresponded to a volumetric light intensity of 1 14 w l supplementary material appendix a1 and a2 sbr2 simulated a paddle wheel hrap with kla of 0 0064 min 1 and a liquid height of 30 cm higher oxygen and light availability hrap the higher kla was set in sbr2 by reactor mixing and system aeration with an air disperser fig a1 sbr2 was operated under a feast and famine regime illuminated with a light intensity of 315 6 w m2 which corresponded to a volumetric light intensity of 1 90 w l both reactors were operated with a hydraulic retention time and sludge retention time of 6 days at the end of each light phase under continuous stirring 1 l of the reactor volume was removed by gravity through a valve installed at 5 6 height of the total operational volume the valve was opened for 30 min to assure the volume discharge the reactors operational conditions kla light intensity temperature and liquid height were established according to the summer operational conditions in the hrap from chiclana wwtp concerning the ammonium and phosphate availability in the system during the adaptation period small amounts of ammonia and phosphate were fed into the reactor to prevent nutrient depletion and determine the required nutrient dosing for subsequent stages from the 20th day beginning of stage 1 both systems were daily fed with mineral medium containing ammonium and phosphate initial loading rates sbr1 plr 0 3 pmmol l d and nlr 0 86 nmmol l d sbr2 plr 0 50 pmmol l d and nlr 1 05 nmmol l furthermore to ensure the continuous presence of nutrients and avoid inhibitory concentrations in the system the nlr and the plr were adjusted along the study to suit the nutrient demand loading rates ranges sbr1 plr 0 3 0 9 pmmol l d nlr 0 7 1 5 nmmol l d sbr2 plr 0 3 0 9 pmmol l d nlr 1 0 2 0 nmmol l d the fermented feedstock contained insufficient ammonium and phosphate content necessary to sustain typical pmc functions fermented feedstock composition 0 pmmol l 1 4 nmmol l however a supply of n and p is typically available onsite at full scale hraps such as via anaerobic supernatant streams thus the nutrient demand of the pmc would not likely represent an additional cost to the wwtp further characterization of the feedstock is detailed in supplementary material appendix a7 similarly the olr was adjusted to the different feedstock compositions and organic carbon demand of the culture in sbr1 the olr was adjusted to ensure the constant presence of organic carbon while in sbr2 the olr was adjusted according to the required feast length table 1 summarizes the different conditions olr and feeding process used for each sbr along the operation time and the respective carbon feed composition average value along the period stage and indicates the maximum and minimum ph registered in each stage along the sbrs operation the ph was monitored but not controlled and varied between 6 and 7 during the 24 h cycle as an exception ph adjustments with 4 m naoh were manually performed in sbr2 during operation with single pulse feeding ph adjusted to 6 5 after the pulse feeding 2 2 fermentation of wastewater with molasses sbr1 and sbr2 were both fed with an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb effluent which consisted of a fermented mixture of domestic pre treated wastewater de sanding and degreasing supplemented with 1 v v of molasses provided by the guadalete sugar plant the molasses codt 1070 65 go2 l addition to the municipal wastewater codt 592 114 mgo2 l augmented the chemical oxygen demand cod to enable the production of an effluent rich in organic acids more details about the uasb operation are available in the supplementary material appendix a3 uasb effluent was collected daily and frozen 20 c before feeding the sbrs the feedstock was defrosted and settled overnight then the supernatant was transferred to a schott bottle that supplied both sbrs and kept at 4 6 c under continuous stirring the total suspended solids in the feedstock were 0 23 0 33 g tss l 2 3 pha accumulation tests to evaluate the pha accumulation capacity of the pmcs of sbr2 operation experimental trials were carried out in external batch reactors working volume 0 5 l operated for 8 h and externally illuminated with halogen lamps 30 w the tests occurred at 25 c under a light intensity of 6 17 w l 5 4 times higher than the 1 14 w l of the sbr2 a value that takes into account the maximum values that can be obtained in a typical hrap fradinho et al 2019 the biomass for the batch tests was taken directly from the

appendix a5 the ph was controlled at 5 5 6 5 ph of the culture during sbr2 stage 4 through feedstock pulses addition i e pulse addition in response to ph increase 2 4 analytical methods the light intensity in the selector and accumulator reactors was measured using a li cor light metre li 250 a equipped with a pyranometer sensor li 200 sa the concentrations of the organic acids ethanol and sugars were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a refractive index detector and an aminex hpx 87h biorad column sulphuric acid at 0 01 n was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min and 30 c operating temperature total carbohydrates were determined using the method described by lanham et al 2012 with minor changes described in fradinho et al 2013a polyhydroxyalkanoates determination was performed by gas chromatography according to lanham et al 2013 with minor modifications also described in fradinho et al 2013a ammonia and phosphate were analysed by a colorimetric method implemented in a flow segmented flow analyser skalar 5100 skalar analytical the netherlands total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were determined according to standard methods apha et al 1995 the evolution of the microbial culture regarding its bacteriochlorophyll a b and chlorophyll a contents was performed by ethanol extraction biomass was centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in a proportional volume of absolute ethanol after overnight incubation in dark conditions at room temperature the mixture was centrifuged and the absorbence spectra of the supernatant was measured in an uv visible spectrophotometer with a quartz cuvette 2 5 calculation of kinetic and stoichiometric parameters the biomass pha content was determined in terms of percentage of vss on a mass basis pha 100 pha vss g pha g vss considering that vss consists of active biomass x pha and total carbohydrates active biomass was calculated by subtracting pha and total carbohydrates from vss and its value in c mol was determined considering a standard biomass chemical formula of ch1 8o0 5n0 2p0 02 that is typically applied in mixed microbial cultures the specific biomass growth rate µ was determined through the uptake rate of ammonium divided by the respective n c molar biomass ratio of 0 2 according to the above mentioned biomass chemical formula since nh4 was never limiting preventing nitrogen fixation the biomass growth was estimated through ammonium consumption the specific ammonium consumption rate was measured through a nitrogen mass balance of the system during the illuminated phase divided by the initial active biomass concentration xi regarding the specific phosphate consumption rate q p it was assessed through a phosphate mass balance of the system during the illuminated phase divided by the initial active biomass concentration xi the phosphate release rate q p was achieved similarly considering the release phase the average specific pha production rate q pha in cmmol pha cmmol x d was determined by calculating the change in pha concentration as a function of time during the illuminated phase per initial active biomass concentration the pha productivity in the light phase in g pha l d light phase was determined by dividing the amount of pha produced during the light phase by the 12 h of the light phase in g pha h divided per the respective reactor volume l and multiplied by 24 h for sbr2 an additional productivity was determined in g pha l d feast phase diving the pha produced per the number of hours of feast the pha productivity in the accumulation tests was similarly calculated but referring to an 8 h batch test the substrate concentration corresponds to the sum of lactic acetic butyric isovaleric propionic and valeric acids concentrations organic acids in terms of cmmol l plus ethanol and sugar glucose and fructose the average specific substrate uptake rate q s in cmmol s cmmol x d was calculated through an organic carbon mass balance per initial active biomass concentration similarly to that described above for n the percentage of carbon removal was calculated by considering the total organic carbon consumed during the light phase divided by the total organic carbon that enters in the sbr in the same interval of time multiplied by 100 the reactor yields of pha and active biomass per substrate y pha s cmmol pha cmmol s yx s cmmol x cmmol s were determined by dividing the production rate of pha cmmol pha d and growth rate cmmol x d by the substrate uptake rate cmmol s d the feast to famine ratio f f was calculated by dividing the number of hours where the organic carbon was present feast phase per total hours of the famine phase the food to microorganism ratio f m was obtain by dividing the substrate concentration in cmmol per the active biomass in cmmol the ratio between bacteriochlorophyll a b and chlorophyll a was estimated by dividing the extracted pigments absorbence at 775 nm corresponding to bacteriochlorophyll a b by the absorbence at 665 nm corresponding to chlorophyll a in this analysis it is important to refer that bacteriochlorophyll c from green bacteria can also absorb at 665 nm however microscopic observations performed until day 195 of operation did not reveal the presence of green bacteria and therefore the pigments absorbence at 665 nm were ascribed to chl a 3 results and discussion the pmc s capability to produce pha with a real waste feedstock and under the physical and operating characteristics temperature and light intensity of the hraps of chiclana s wwtp was evaluated for both the submersible jet mixed sbr1 and paddle wheel sbr2 systems the two sbrs were fed with real fermented feedstock domestic wastewater plus molasses wwm composed of a mixture of different compounds especially organic acids lactic acetic propionic butyric valeric as well as ethanol and sugars the composition and content of the fermented feedstock fluctuated over time where sometimes the fermentation process was incomplete leading to the presence of considerable amounts of sugars namely glucose and fructose the composition of the fermented feed solution over time can be found in table 1 3 1 phototrophic mixed culture enrichment in sbr1 sbr1 operation started with its inoculation with algae sludge from a hrap and addition of one pulse of the fermented wwm rich in organic acids the culture underwent an 11 day batch adaptation period to promote the growth of purple bacteria over microalgae in fig 1 a the carbon substrate started to be consumed from day zero while biomass steadily grew from the 0 44 g l of the initial algae inoculum up to 0 80 g vss l fig 1d by day 15 purple bacteria were already present in the reactor as observed by the increase of the bacteriochlorophyll a b content fig 1d it should be noted that bacteriochlorophyll a b indicates the presence of organisms performing anoxygenic photosynthesis such as purple phototrophic bacteria while chlorophyll a indicates the presence of organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis such as microalgae as such stage 1 was initiated and sbr1 started being continuously fed during the 12 hours light period with a corresponding organic loading rate olr of 12 16 cmmol l d the simultaneous feeding of fermented wwm and respective substrate consumption by the sbr1 culture naturally stabilized the ph between 6 5 7 0 also sbr1 presented orp values between 400 mv and 300 mv which indicates that despite the open operating conditions and the stirring the culture was under anaerobic conditions these are precisely the ideal conditions for operating pmc under a permanent feast regime fradinho et al 2016 during stage 1 operation the imposed operating conditions led to a stabilization of the biomass concentration 1 72 0 2 g vss l supplementary material appendix a6 and to a further enrichment of the culture in purple bacteria with an increase of bacteriochlorophyll a b fig 1d in relation to the pha profile the culture increased its pha content from 1 3 pha 0 06 cmmol pha l in the beginning of stage 1 up to 20 of pha 14 09 cmmol pha l 86hb 14hv in c base stabilizing at an average value of 12 of pha 10 30 2 69 cmmol pha l 85hb 15hv in c base during the last 20 days of stage 1 it is worth noting that at this stage the culture presented a phosphorous uptake release profile along the 24 h cycle which may have resulted from the initial culture selection stage 0 being under limiting p concentrations this could potentially be linked with the higher pha accumulation observed at this stage in the reactor operation further discussed in section 3 1 1 from stage 1 to stage 2 there was a change in the influent composition and a considerable amount of sugars mostly glucose and fructose which accounted for 20 of the total organic carbon were still present in the feedstock see table 1 the high sugar concentration in the feed solution along with the reactor anaerobic conditions led to a fermentative process that acidified the system and diminished the ph down to 4 the culture conversion into a fermentative mode may explain the loss of capability to accumulate pha residual values moreover the low ph led to a large decrease in the biomass concentration only 0 2 g vss l in the reactor due to biomass decay fig 1d stage 2 however the bacteriochlorophyll a b was consistently higher than chlorophyll a this might be due to ph being a very important factor in microalgae and cyanobacteria growth which have generally been reported to prefer neutral to slightly alkaline ph levels for optimum growth li et al 2014 nayak and prasanna 2007 while purple bacteria are more resilient to extreme environments such as acidic conditions madigan and jung 2009 since in stage 2 the biomass concentration decreased dramatically due to the sugar rich influent fully fermented feed was added in stage 3 without sugars see table 1 and the olr was lowered to approximately 4 cmmol l d 3 5 times lower adjusting it to the low biomass concentration as the biomass concentration increased during culture recovery the olr was steadily increased over time however between day 115 and day 151 low concentrations of organic acids were registered and this was likely responsible for the observed bchl a b chl a decrease 1 28 0 55 indicating a period of stable coexistence of microalgae and purple bacteria since the former are autotrophic organisms when organic carbon is limited their presence is expected as they compete with the heterotrophic purple bacteria for light and nutrients at the end of stage 3 the biomass concentration quadrupled reaching 0 8 g vss l as a low amount of pha was accumulated during this period 0 71 0 43 cmmol pha l it was hypothesised that organic carbon was limiting pha production thus additional fermented wwm was added by increasing the olr at the beginning of stage 4 the culture responded with a fast increase in the pha content reaching up to 17 6 pha vss 6 99 cmmol pha l 60hb 40hv in c base this suggests that despite the residual pha concentrations in the selector reactor the continuous operation under low organic carbon selected for pha accumulating bacteria which could quickly accumulate pha once organic carbon was no longer limiting see section 3 1 1 for further discussion also and as planned the increase of organic acids also directly impacted the purple bacteria content with a fast increase in the bchl a b chl a ratio and concomitant decrease in chlorophyll a this increase in bchl a b chl a ratio continued during stage 4 despite this clear indication of the high dominance of purple bacteria during stage 4 the culture presented low values of pha 2 pha vss 1 29 0 38 cmmol pha l fig 1b significantly the fermented feedstock used in stage 4 contained sugars once again see table 1 this time a lower sugar concentration was observed 11 3 cmmol l 7 of the total organic carbon and the reactor did not suffer biomass loss likely because the ph in the reactor ranged between 5 5 5 values that are still suitable for growth of ppb madigan and jung 2009 however and similarly to what happened in stage 2 the microbial culture lost its capability to accumulate pha this result is in line with the previous finding that the presence of sugar under anaerobic conditions likely leads to a fermentative metabolism through the growth of fermentative anaerobic bacteria and a decrease of ph to 4 5 the loss of pha accumulation capability by the ppb may be related to 1 inhibition by low ph or 2 the preference of ppb to perform sugar fermentation in detriment of photoheterotrophic organic acids uptake for growth or pha production this is an important finding confirming that for the successful operation of a pmc under anaerobic conditions strict control of the upstream fermentation step is required to guarantee a fully fermented influent without sugars under a permanent feast regime it was possible to select a pmc rich in ppb starting from an inoculum rich in microalgae and fed with a real fermented waste feedstock despite the considerable negative impact observed in the presence of a high sugar concentration in general phosphate cycling and the selection under periods of low to high organic acids in the medium appear to be a good complementary selection strategy to favour the selection of a pmc with higher pha accumulation capacity 3 1 1 operating conditions that favour pha accumulation the highest amounts of pha were accumulated during stage 1 and stage 4 fig 2 presents two profiles of the pmc during 24 hour cycles under the two complementary selection processes that lead to pha production in the selector reactor a phosphorus uptake and release by the pmc observed during stage 1 and b short term response of a culture selected under low olr stage 3 to an increase of olr beginning of stage 4 in stage 1 the culture performed phosphate uptake 0 0025 pmmol cmmol x d and pha production during the light phase and release of phosphate 0 0015 pmmol cmmol x d during the dark phase fig 2a during the dark phase phosphate was released but with no apparent association neither with organic acids uptake nor pha accumulation as typically observed in the well studied systems enriched in polyphosphate accumulating organisms oehmen et al 2006 poly p storage during the light phase likely served as an energy source during the dark phase for cell maintenance increasing its resilience under the operational conditions of the reactor nevertheless the observation of p cycling is consistent with the increased pha accumulation during this period suggesting the selection of pha accumulating bacteria ppb have previously been observed to accumulate polyphosphate and release it as phosphate during dark periods as an energy source lai et al 2017 liang et al 2010 which is also associated with pha accumulation lai et al 2017 during stage 1 the pha content reached levels of 20 of pha 14 09 cmmol pha l 86hb 14hv on a c mole basis which was the highest value registered during reactor operation fig 1a with the biomass decay observed in stage 2 due to the growth of fermentative organisms the microbial culture lost this p cycling ability which was also no longer observed during the subsequent reactor operational stages fig 2b q p 0 0003 pmmol cmmol x d q p 0 pmmol cmmol x d another operating condition that seemed to play an important role in enriching the culture with pha accumulating organisms was the continuous presence of carbon in the reactor but at very low concentrations 0 02 to 2 cmmol l under the continuous presence of n and p fig 2 b represents one cycle of the reactor where after a selection period under low organic carbon availability end of stage 3 olr 3 79 1 53 cmmol l d the olr was increased to 6 9 cmmol l d while fig 2a is representative of the culture behaviour along stage 1 fig 2b represents a transitory behaviour of a pmc selected under a low carbon availability when exposed to a higher carbon concentration after the reactor came from an initial phase where substrate was scarce stage 3 and after a quick increase of the substrate concentration beginning of stage 4 the pha content achieved 17 6 pha vss 6 99 cmmol pha l 60hb 40hv in c base fig 2b it is possible that under low availability of organic acids the competition for substrate favoured the growth of bacteria that had the capability to accumulate pha as an internal carbon reserve once exposed to higher carbon availability the pha storing organisms could achieve higher pha content in this period pha accumulation was favoured in comparison with the biomass growth y x s 0 05 ypha s 0 53 leading to phosphate accumulation as shown in fig 2b since this higher pha production was observed only during a 3 days transition period between the change from low olr to higher olr it would be of interest in the future to evaluate two possible operating scenarios 1 culture selection under low olr with a parallel reactor accumulation at higher organic content 2 culture selection with alternating low olr high olr conditions to study the dynamic feeding impact on the pmc performance namely if a consistently high pha productivity could be maintained a dynamic feeding with continuous substrate supply at low concentrations low olr with short peaks of high carbon dosage high olr has been observed as a viable strategy to select pha accumulating bacteria in aerobic mixed culture systems marang et al 2018 3 1 2 phosphorous cycling vs low to high olr strategy upon comparing both scenarios identified to be favourable to pha production in sbr1 the selected culture possessed some differences in the observed stoichiometric and kinetic behaviour table 2 enables the comparison between the two selection methods despite the different operational conditions and different feedstock composition table 1 at the time of scenario a stage 1 and scenario b end of stage 3 operation propionic acid appears to be the preferred organic acids in both situations other differences in organic acids preferences cannot be clearly linked to either changes in the fermented feedstock composition see table 1 or to changes in operational conditions it is clear however that a link exists between the organic acids consumption behaviour and the resulting pha composition where acetate and butyrate lead to phb production and propionate and valerate to phv in case a the pha produced was composed of 20 hv while in case b it presented a content of 35 hv furthermore during sbr1 operation a preference for the less reduced organic acids acetate and propionate was observed as compared to the more reduced organic acids butyrate and valerate this behaviour may be associated to the permanent feast selection strategy used where regulation of internal reducing power acts as a stress factor to produce pha indeed on a c mol basis the degree of reduction of acetic acid ĸ 4 is lower than phb ĸ 4 5 unlike butyric acid ĸ 5 similarly the degree of reduction of propionic acid ĸ 4 67 is also lower than phv ĸ 4 8 unlike valeric acid ĸ 5 2 naturally to overcome this stress the microorganisms will have a higher propensity to consume the less reduced compounds these results suggest that the operational conditions of feedstock fermentation should be altered to promote greater acetogenesis prior to its addition to pmcs as this will increase the y pha s in chart b the culture displayed negligible ethanol consumption residual rate of 0 007 cmmol cmmol x d and ethanol did not appear to have a negative impact on the system a lower yield of pha per substrate consumed was found with phosphate cycling y pha s 0 28 cmmol pha cmmol s as compared to the olr increase response of the culture selected under low organic substrate levels y pha s 0 53 cmmol pha cmmol s due to the extended period of low organic carbon availability the pmc displayed very low growth rates after the increase in organic carbon loading rate the culture accumulated more of the newly available organic carbon in the form of pha presenting a higher pha production rate and yield of pha per substrate table 2 overall results show that under a permanent feast regime there are two possible ways to select a pmc with higher pha accumulation capacity namely under phosphate cycling obtaining a 20 pha vss 14 09 cmmol pha l 86hb 14hv in c base with a productivity of 0 23 g pha l d light phase or under low concentrations of organic acids in the medium achieving a 17 6 pha vss 6 99 cmmol pha l 60hb 40hv in c base with a productivity of 0 18 g pha l d light phase result obtained in a short term response of the culture to an increase of the carbon content 3 2 phototrophic mixed culture enrichment in sbr2 sbr2 was operated to study the pmc s pha production performance under higher volumetric light availability and higher oxygen diffusion conditions as found in shallow paddle wheel mixed hrap the enrichment of the pmc used in this study was carried out under a feast and famine regime with alternating periods of 12 h of light and 12 h of dark sbr2 was fed with the same fermented mixture of domestic wastewater with 1 v v sugar molasses used in sbr1 table 1 during the 8 months of operation efforts were made to achieve the optimal duration of the feast and famine periods to maximise the growth of pha accumulating bacteria this implied adjustments of the olr during sbr2 operation it should be noted that although a high content of pha accumulating ppb is desired the microalgae presence is also typically important during a feast and famine enrichment process since they are the oxygen producers that allow pha consumption during the famine phase as reported in fradinho et al 2013a however unlike fradinho et al 2013a that operated with continuous illumination transient illumination 12 h light 12 h dark was applied in the present study therefore it was of interest to assess if the feast and famine phases should occur entirely during the 12 h light period when there is oxygen available from algae i e a cycle consisting of a short light feast phase up to 4 h 8 h light famine phase 12 h dark famine or if the feast phase could be extended up to 8 10 h of the light phase maximising the period of pha production and potentially the pha productivity in this latter scenario the dark phase despite not allowing pha consumption could act as a period of low cell metabolism simulating the starvation conditions of a traditional famine phase thus the first scenario implies the presence of algae non pha producers during the light phase along with 12 h of a non productive dark phase while in the second scenario algae are not required and the dark phase potentially contributes towards the selection process the impact of a light dark famine phase vs a dark only famine phase was addressed during sbr2 operation during stage 1 2 and 3 a light dark famine phase was implemented while in stage 4 a dark only famine phase was implemented similarly to sbr1 sbr2 operation started with an adaptation period between days 0 and 15 achieving a biomass concentration of 0 89 0 2 g vss l after this adaptation period and to implement a ff regime during the light phase two feeding methods were tested in stage 1 until day 45 both with an olr 3 4 cmmol l d 1 continuous feeding during the first 4 h of the light phase and 2 one single pulse addition at the beginning of the light phase as observed in fig 3 a both feeding methods led to low concentrations of organic acids which combined with the higher light intensity of sbr2 favoured microalgae growth thus a low bchl a b chl a fig 3c and pha were observed fig 3b during the remainder of stage 1 and stage 2 the olr of the single pulse was increased up to 9 5 cmmol l d to achieve a longer feast phase range 1 h 4 h although this promoted the growth of purple bacteria fig 3c day 50 onwards the quick load of organic acids in a single pulse also led to a sharp ph drop 5 that inhibited the culture decreasing the organic acids consumption rate and sometimes eliminating the famine phase during this period the ph was adjusted to 6 5 after feeding to reverse the inhibition of the culture due to low ph to overcome this periodical pulses with a lower olr 2 cmmol l d each were implemented in stage 3 to maintain a 4 h feast period f f 0 2 without the ph limitation after 20 days of stage 3 operation the multi pulse feeding method stabilized the ppb content and the biomass concentration at 1 05 0 12 g vss l and led to the highest pha value of 26 1 pha vss 11 97 cmmol pha l 36hb 64hv on a c mol basis with a productivity of 0 26 g pha l d light phase and 0 52 g pha l d feast phase by the end of stage 3 during stage 4 the feast phase was extended up to 8 h 10 h f f 0 7 to study the dark famine phase possibility although a strong increase in ppb was observed with the higher olr the extension of the feast phase decreased the overall pha productivity as further discussed in section 3 2 1 as such the olr was continuously adjusted in stage 4 fig 3a to attempt to maintain both a long feast phase and a famine period unlike sbr1 the presence of high concentrations of sugar in the feed solution stage 2 and stage 4 did not significantly affect the reactor performance in terms of ph and biomass losses the presence of oxygen along the light phase particularly in the light famine phase likely inhibited any fermentative state from developing both in terms of repressing the growth of anaerobic fermentative bacteria and avoiding ph decreases as well as preventing any eventual sugar fermentation by some ppb 3 2 1 influence of the f f ratio on the pha accumulation capacity of sbr2 during the 210 days of sbr2 operation it was possible to observe changes in the pha accumulating capacity of the culture selected under different feast to famine ratios f f fig 4 and table 3 summarize the results of three representative pmc cycles performed in sbr2 at stage 1 fig 4a and stage 4 fig 4b and c under different f f ratios and different organic carbon and bchl a b chl a ratio comparing cycles a and b a higher pha productivity of the pmc was found in case b a 0 17 g pha l d feast phase and 0 06 g pha l d light phase b 0 71 g pha l d feast phase and 0 24 g pha l d light phase the higher specific pha production rate and higher yield of pha per substrate are related to the higher ppb content of the culture in chart b responsible for pha production this is coupled with the increased biomass concentration that led to a substantially higher pha productivity in case a under a low olr operation the biomass content is consequently lower and with more oxygen availability more hours with higher orp levels fig 4a aerobic pha accumulating bacteria are likely present and consuming the substrate through decarboxylation leading to lower y pha s and naturally lower productivity in case c a decrease in the pmc pha accumulation rate was found in comparison to case b although bchl a b chl a in the pmc in case c is the same that in case b the lack of a substantial famine phase while light was available and inherent presence of oxygen produced by algae did not allow the consumption of pha with an extended feast phase the culture did not fully consume the pha and along the cycles started to lose its capability to accumulate the polymer this indicates that the 12 h dark period cannot act as a substitute to the famine phase being essential for the f f regime to contain an extended famine period during the light phase in stages 1 to 3 higher orp levels were observed during the light famine phase fig 4a the lower level of orp in stage 4 also suggested that oxygen production by algae was minimal and insufficient to oxidise pha in the dark famine phase fig 4c the organic acids uptake rates by the pmc varied in accordance with organic acids abundance of the feed butyrate and valerate were more abundant in cases b and c stage 4 table 1 presenting higher uptake rates while acetate and propionate were the most abundant and more rapidly taken up in case a stage 1 table 1 the higher algae content in case a may also have contributed to the higher preference for acetate since some algae are capable of consuming acetate ogbonna et al 2000 perez garcia et al 2011 overall in sbr2 there is no stress associated to the reductive power as observed in sbr1 which explains not existing a preference for the less reductive organic acids acetate and propionate comparing with the higher reductive organic acids butyrate and valerate the multiple pulse feeding strategy was the best way to achieve higher f f ratios without causing substrate limitations increasing the bchl a b chl a ratio however both the feast and famine phases must occur in the light phase to ensure pha consumption through the oxygen produced by algae an alternative to maximize the pha production is to increase the light availability operating an accumulation reactor in parallel with the selector reactor as discussed below in section 3 2 2 3 2 2 sbr2 pha accumulation tests during pha accumulation tests a higher light intensity was applied in parallel accumulator reactors to increase the kinetic rates of pha production and to determine the maximum pha accumulating capacity of the pmc it should be noted that this higher light intensity is still representative of realistic light levels that could be achieved in an hrap with natural sunlight as shown in fig 5 two batch accumulation tests were performed with sbr2 s pmc in stage 4 during a f f 0 2 the first test was performed when sugar was present in the fermented feed fig 5a while the second test did not contain sugar in the feed fig 5b as previously mentioned in the selection reactor for sbr2 under a feast and famine regime the presence of sugar did not seem to affect the culture in terms of ph and biomass losses however the capability to accumulate pha seems to be affected as shown through the lower pha production and substrate consumption rates when sugar is present table 4 under the presence of sugar chart 5a the pmc achieved a pha content of 24 6 pha vss 23 4 cmmol pha l 85hb 15hv on a c mol basis with a productivity of 1 66 g pha l d in 8 h of operation under no sugar presence chart 5b the pha content was similar achieving a 30 8 pha vss 31 56 cmmol pha l 85hb 15hv on a c mol basis with a productivity of 2 67 g pha l d in 8 h it must be referred however that the food to microorganism ratio f m could have also influenced the higher kinetic rates of test 5b since the ph was controlled through the pulse addition of feedstock the much faster ph increase observed during test 5b was counterbalanced with a more frequent addition of feedstock pulses this eventually led to a higher f m in relation to test 5a where a slower ph increase led to a shorter demand of pulse addition supplementary material appendix a5 future tests under acid base ph control and similar f m can provide further insight on the real impact of this parameter in fig 5a 2 and 5b2 it is possible to observe the cumulative consumption profile of each organic compound in fig 5a 2 the pmc presents a homogeneous consumption of all the organic compounds showing preference for butyrate valerate and acetate in fig 5b 2 with no sugar in the feedstock but with a high percentage of ethanol 18 on a c mol basis the culture displayed a preference for ethanol butyrate and acetate while in test a the glucose consumed by the culture was not likely leading to pha production in test b the ethanol could contribute to pha production duque et al 2014 which might be a further explanation to the higher pha content observed in this test regarding the effect of tests operation under higher light intensity and as anticipated it increased the specific kinetic rates for pha production and substrate consumption in comparison to the ones observed in the selector sbr2 test 4b table 4 a similar behaviour was also observed for the sbr1 culture in external batch tests consult supplementary material a4 for more details on sbr1 batch tests at higher light intensity the increased pha production under high light intensity highlights the advantage of an accumulator reactor in this process fradinho et al 2013b studied the effect of dark light periods in the pha production of a pmc operated in a feast and famine regime but fed with synthetic medium containing acetic acid as carbon source obtaining a 30 phb vss content a very similar value was achieved in the present work 5b test with no sugar presence but with the advantage of being produced a phbv co polymer under a complex feedstock feeding containing a mixture of different organic acids regarding the substrate uptake and pha production rates fradinho et al 2013b presented similar rates attained under lower light intensity which might be due to the selection of the culture only under synthetic acetic acid feeding when sbr2 pha production tests are compared with aerobic mixed culture systems also fed with fermented molasses we observed that the pmc s productivities are lower in accumulation assays duque et al 2014 obtained a specific pha production rate of 3 36 cmol pha cmol x d 1 8 times higher with a pha volumetric productivity of 8 88 g pha l d 3 3 times higher likewise in albuquerque et al 2011 pha production rates of 3 36 4 8 cmol pha cmol x d 1 8 2 6 times higher with pha volumetric productivities of 7 2 12 g pha l d 2 7 4 5 times higher were achieved it is important to note that while the specific pha production rates between the phototrophic and the aerobic systems have only a 2 fold difference the volumetric productivities present a higher gap due to the lower biomass concentration of the phototrophic culture 1 5 g vss l in comparison to 4 6 g vss l of aerobic cultures light is known to be a critical factor of phototrophic systems and the optimization of light supply can enhance the biomass growth and consequently enable higher pha productivities fradinho et al 2021 future developments in this field will positively contribute to the increase of pha productivities in pmcs 3 3 permanent feast pf vs feast and famine ff two pmcs were tested in parallel under the same conditions simulating an outdoor environment following two operating strategies pf and ff that best suit the oxidative conditions found in model hraps both strategies were tested using the same feedstock solution allowing to compare the different pmcs behaviour along the feedstock fluctuations the work developed under a pf regime shows that there are two complementary strategies that improve pha accumulation namely the phosphate cycling and transitioning from low to high olr the best strategy seems to be the phosphate cycling that led to the highest pha content of 20 pha vss 14 09 cmmol pha l 86hb 14hv in c base with a respective productivity of 0 23 g pha l d light phase in terms of cost efficiency phosphate cycling strategy is perhaps more appealing not only because of the higher pha productivities but also because it requires less operational space one single reactor and it has a simpler process control however the sensitivity of the pmc selected under a permanent feast regime to the presence of considerable amounts of sugar is a drawback if the up stream fermentation is not complete and in the phosphate cycling strategy the feedstock solution must also allow the p limitation condition under the ff regime the highest pha content obtained in the selection reactor was 26 1 of pha vss 11 97 cmmol pha l 36hb 64hv in c base with a respective productivity 0 26 g pha l d light phase and 0 52 g pha l d feast phase the productivity could be increased up to 2 67 g pha l d by operating parallel accumulation reactors under higher light intensity final pha content after 8 h of accumulation of 30 8 pha vss 31 56 cmmol pha l 85hb 15hv on a c mol basis this regime has the advantage of not requiring nutrient limitation and not presenting high sensitivity to the presence of sugar in the feedstock however the feast and famine phases must occur only during the light phase since during the dark phase the culture does not present any productive activity in the future it will be interesting to study the possibility of a culture selected under high f f ratio to use aeration in the dark phase this could promote pha consumption in the dark while maximising the pha productive period of the light feast phase during natural sunlight hours furthermore oxygen demand in the famine phase is typically less than in the feast phase in traditional mixed culture pha production processes third et al 2003 lowering the cost of the process this approach could lead to increased productivities in one single reactor thus avoiding the need for a second accumulator reactor this outcome opens the possibility towards the implementation of this new technology in an outdoor environment through the retrofitting of already existing infrastructure such as hraps into ppb ponds furthermore it will require the adaptation of hraps to accommodate the operational strategies studied and proposed here potentially as an sbr rather than continuous flow operation further work should also address the integration of pha production with wastewater treatment and nutrient removal by ppb ppb have been shown to be effective at removing organic carbon and nutrients from domestic wastewaters hülsen et al 2016 puyol et al 2020 in the present study for both sbrs the domestic wastewater had to be supplemented with n p and organic carbon for efficient ppb selection and pha production the supplementation could be sourced from local waste streams agricultural industrial wastes or the readily available internal waste streams of the wwtp e g sludge concentrate from anaerobic digestion regarding the cod removed it was found that under p cycling stage 1 in the pf regime the culture was capable of removing 94 of the organic carbon in the 12 hour light phase similar to the value obtained by hülsen et al 2016 in a continuous photo anaerobic membrane bioreactor panmbr selected for purple bacteria in the future studies should also evaluate the potential of a pmc system to produce pha and perform simultaneous wastewater treatment under a pf or ff 3 4 conclusion a new low cost photosynthetic technology was developed where pmc enriched in phototrophic purple bacteria can produce an added value product poly 3 hydroxybutyric co 3 hydroxyvaleric copolymer while valorising residues within the permanent feast regime transitioning from low to high olr and the p cycling appear to be the best promising strategies when operating without sugars presence the best results were obtained with phosphorous cycling with a productivity of 0 23 g pha l d light phase regarding the ff regime the multiple pulses appears to be the best feeding method to control the feast length achieving a productivity of 0 26 g pha l d light phase and 0 52 g pha l d feast phase in the selector reactor or 2 67 g pha l d under higher light intensity in 8 h accumulation tests it was also noticed that the ff must take place only during the light phase further studies should focus on the prospect of integrating this new technology with wwtp processes exploring the capability of pmc to produce pha from complex feedstocks while treating wastewater under outdoor conditions using

to be a promising technology to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates pha however work performed thus far has focussed mainly on the use of synthetic feedstocks and operational conditions that differ from those expectable in full scale processes the goals of this work were to study for the first time the capability of pmcs to produce pha using real fermented domestic wastewater as feedstock under mixing light temperature conditions that are naturally found in outdoor open systems various operational strategies were evaluated in this study to increase pha productivity namely the poly 3 hydroxybutyric co 3 hydroxyvaleric copolymer phbv by pmc systems two lab scale photobioreactors were operated in parallel with transient illumination 12 h light 12 h dark and subjected to feedstock fluctuations under two culture selection strategies that best suit the oxidative conditions of high rate algal ponds hraps which are commonly applied in wastewater treatment plants wwtp under a permanent carbon feast regime selection strategy 1 the pmc became highly enriched in phototrophic purple bacteria ppb and two complementary conditions that can improve the selection of pha accumulating bacteria were discovered phosphate cycling where 20 pha vss 86hb 14hv in a c mol basis with a light phase productivity of 0 23 g pha l d light phase was attained and transitioning from selection under low organic loading rate olr to high olr where 17 6 pha vss 60hb 40hv in c base with a light phase productivity of 0 18 g pha l d light phase was achieved under a feast and famine regime selection strategy 2 a pmc consortium of microalgae and ppb was obtained and a multiple pulse feeding strategy during the first hours of the light phase in the selector reactor led to a 26 1 pha vss 36hb 64hv in c base content with a productivity of 0 26 g pha l d light phase and 0 52 g pha l d feast phase an accumulation test under higher light intensity led to 30 8 pha vss 85hb 15hv on

wastewater molasses mixture wwtp wastewater treatment plants 1 introduction plastics have become an essential material for our society with applications in a wide variety of markets e g agriculture packaging automotive building and construction however traditional plastics are non degradable and persist in the environment accumulating as waste to overcome this situation the plastic industry is evolving from the use of synthetic molecules to new natural feedstocks to produce biodegradable plastics polyhydroxyalkanoates pha are an example of natural polymers produced and internally stored by bacteria as carbon and energy reserves pha are fully biodegradable polyesters with thermoplastic properties which makes this material a potential substitute for traditional plastics muhammadi et al 2015 moreover pha can be produced by mixed microbial cultures fed with 2nd generation feedstocks e g solid wastes wastewater therefore not competing with crops and promoting waste valorisation also the operation of open systems combined with the utilization of cheap agro industrial wastes can decrease pha production costs making this polymer more economically attractive reis et al 2003 in line with this cost reduction effort a new pha producing system has been developed in the last years which uses phototrophic mixed cultures pmc fradinho et al 2013a b 2016 these cultures are enriched in pha accumulating phototrophic purple bacteria ppb that use light energy as a means of producing atp and are operated anaerobically saving costs regarding aeration the selection of pmcs with the capability to accumulate pha can either occur using an organic carbon feast and famine regime ff fradinho et al 2013a or an organic carbon permanent feast regime pf fradinho et al 2016 in the first case consortia of microalgae and bacteria are typically selected with results indicating that pha accumulation levels of 20 with acetate feeding under continuous illumination fradinho et al 2013a and 30 pha content in alternating light dark conditions fradinho et al 2013b are achievable under a pf regime the culture is maintained in the permanent presence of external carbon and it becomes highly enriched in pha accumulating ppb these anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria do not release oxygen when illuminated but they do produce atp phototrophically they thrive in anaerobic conditions and when fed with reduced organic molecules like volatile fatty acids vfa they can dissipate excess reducing power through pha production therefore unlike the ff strategy where organisms are selected for their capability of growing on the accumulated pha the pf strategy selects organisms for their capability of internally regulating the cell s reducing power through pha formation studies with pmcs selected under the pf strategy with acetate as the carbon source indicated the culture capability to accumulate up to 60 pha content in accumulation trials the maximum value ever reported for a pmc fradinho et al 2016 until now these promising studies were mostly conducted using synthetic feedstocks and ideal illuminated conditions fradinho et al 2019 however it is essential to evaluate pmc s capability of producing pha when they are fed with real feedstocks and subjected to light temperature conditions that are naturally found outdoors a critical factor widely recognised in this field capson tojo et al 2020 the real feedstocks contain several carbon sources and other compounds that may have an impact on the selection and metabolism of the pmc as a first approach for this evaluation the operating conditions tested in the present work were based on the operating conditions currently applied in high rate algal ponds hrap these are photosynthetic systems that rely on microalgae bacterial consortia to perform wastewater treatment being commonly used worldwide either for wastewater pre treatment in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp or to directly treat wastewater prior to water discharge into surface waters mahaprata et al 2013 usually hrap are operated under open and sunlight illuminated conditions presenting liquid heights in the range of 0 3 0 6 m young et al 2017 craggs et al 2012 and diverse mixing systems like paddle wheels submersible jet mixers or low energy algae reactor lear mixers kohlheb et al al 2020 monti et al 2013 depending on the operating liquid height and mixing system ponds are more prone to experience oxidative conditions and as such different operating strategies can be devised in order to promote the development of microbial consortia adapted to the ponds oxidative state since the referred hrap conditions are very similar to those that pmc can face in outdoor conditions this work intends to evaluate pmc s capability to produce pha following two operating strategies that best suit the oxidative conditions found in hrap the first strategy is based on ponds that present suboxic conditions i e ponds that are operated with high liquid height low volumetric light availability and use submersible mixers low oxygen diffusion at the liquid surface for ponds with these characteristics herein called submersible mixed ponds the strategy involves operating pmc under a permanent feast strategy which as mentioned before requires anaerobic conditions the second strategy is based on ponds that present more oxidative conditions typically ponds with lower liquid height higher volumetric light availability and higher presence of oxygen producing microalgae and use paddle wheel thrust higher oxygen diffusion for these ponds herein called paddle wheel ponds the strategy involves operating the pmc under a feast and famine strategy that requires microaerophilic conditions both types of ponds are currently utilised in full scale operations and represent the state of the art in hrap operations de godos et al 2016 this study investigates the impact of operational strategies on pha production by pmcs using real fermented feedstocks under conditions representative of the mixing light intensity and temperature found in outdoor systems such as hraps this represents both a novel and needed progress with respect to advancing pmc technology for pha production by feeding pmc with real fermented feedstocks and operating them using the two aforementioned operating strategies this work will allow the evaluation of pmc s pha production performance under the two sets of conditions and ascertain the pha production potential of pmcs for outdoor operation the focus of the work is on the evaluation of pha productivity as well as maximum pha content achieved under these realistic operational strategies 2 methods 2 1 mixed photosynthetic culture operation two sequencing batch reactors sbr1 and sbr2 with a working volume of 5 8 l each were inoculated with mixotrophic microalgae sludge biomass from a 10 m3 hrap hrt 7 days from el torno wwtp aqualia at chiclana andalucia spain fed with urban wastewater both reactors were operated for 210 days with a temperature controlled at 25 c and under a 24 hour cycle with alternating periods of light 12 h and dark 12 h being externally illuminated by a halogen lamp 60 w the adaptation period stage 0 started with a single pulse of carbon feed with no purge or complementary feeding along that stage sbr1 simulated a submersible jet mixed hrap that presented a kla of 0 0035 min 1 and a liquid height of 0 60 m low oxygen and low light availability hrap the kla in sbr1 was set solely through reactor mixing the reactor was operated under a permanent feast regime at a light intensity of 193 w m2 which corresponded to a volumetric light intensity of 1 14 w l supplementary material appendix a1 and a2 sbr2 simulated a paddle wheel hrap with kla of 0 0064 min 1 and a liquid height of 30 cm higher oxygen and light availability hrap the higher kla was set in sbr2 by reactor mixing and system aeration with an air disperser fig a1 sbr2 was operated under a feast and famine regime illuminated with a light intensity of 315 6 w m2 which corresponded to a volumetric light intensity of 1 90 w l both reactors were operated with a hydraulic retention time and sludge retention time of 6 days at the end of each light phase under continuous stirring 1 l of the reactor volume was removed by gravity through a valve installed at 5 6 height of the total operational volume the valve was opened for 30 min to assure the volume discharge the reactors operational conditions kla light intensity temperature and liquid height were established according to the summer operational conditions in the hrap from chiclana wwtp concerning the ammonium and phosphate availability in the system during the adaptation period small amounts of ammonia and phosphate were fed into the reactor to prevent nutrient depletion and determine the required nutrient dosing for subsequent stages from the 20th day beginning of stage 1 both systems were daily fed with mineral medium containing ammonium and phosphate initial loading rates sbr1 plr 0 3 pmmol l d and nlr 0 86 nmmol l d sbr2 plr 0 50 pmmol l d and nlr 1 05 nmmol l furthermore to ensure the continuous presence of nutrients and avoid inhibitory concentrations in the system the nlr and the plr were adjusted along the study to suit the nutrient demand loading rates ranges sbr1 plr 0 3 0 9 pmmol l d nlr 0 7 1 5 nmmol l d sbr2 plr 0 3 0 9 pmmol l d nlr 1 0 2 0 nmmol l d the fermented feedstock contained insufficient ammonium and phosphate content necessary to sustain typical pmc functions fermented feedstock composition 0 pmmol l 1 4 nmmol l however a supply of n and p is typically available onsite at full scale hraps such as via anaerobic supernatant streams thus the nutrient demand of the pmc would not likely represent an additional cost to the wwtp further characterization of the feedstock is detailed in supplementary material appendix a7 similarly the olr was adjusted to the different feedstock compositions and organic carbon demand of the culture in sbr1 the olr was adjusted to ensure the constant presence of organic carbon while in sbr2 the olr was adjusted according to the required feast length table 1 summarizes the different conditions olr and feeding process used for each sbr along the operation time and the respective carbon feed composition average value along the period stage and indicates the maximum and minimum ph registered in each stage along the sbrs operation the ph was monitored but not controlled and varied between 6 and 7 during the 24 h cycle as an exception ph adjustments with 4 m naoh were manually performed in sbr2 during operation with single pulse feeding ph adjusted to 6 5 after the pulse feeding 2 2 fermentation of wastewater with molasses sbr1 and sbr2 were both fed with an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb effluent which consisted of a fermented mixture of domestic pre treated wastewater de sanding and degreasing supplemented with 1 v v of molasses provided by the guadalete sugar plant the molasses codt 1070 65 go2 l addition to the municipal wastewater codt 592 114 mgo2 l augmented the chemical oxygen demand cod to enable the production of an effluent rich in organic acids more details about the uasb operation are available in the supplementary material appendix a3 uasb effluent was collected daily and frozen 20 c before feeding the sbrs the feedstock was defrosted and settled overnight then the supernatant was transferred to a schott bottle that supplied both sbrs and kept at 4 6 c under continuous stirring the total suspended solids in the feedstock were 0 23 0 33 g tss l 2 3 pha accumulation tests to evaluate the pha accumulation capacity of the pmcs of sbr2 operation experimental trials were carried out in external batch reactors working volume 0 5 l operated for 8 h and externally illuminated with halogen lamps 30 w the tests occurred at 25 c under a light intensity of 6 17 w l 5 4 times higher than the 1 14 w l of the sbr2 a value that takes into account the maximum values that can be obtained in a typical hrap fradinho et al 2019 the biomass for the batch tests was taken directly from the selector sbrs at the end of the dark phase and while both tests occurred in the presence of nutrients n p the feedstock for test a contained sugar carbon feed composition in cmmol lactate 4 acetate 19 propionate 19 butyrate 21 valerate 28 sugars 9 and for test b no sugar was present carbon feed composition in cmmol acetate 19 propionate 11 ethanol 18 butyrate 27 valerate 25 supplementary material appendix a5 the ph was controlled at 5 5 6 5 ph of the culture during sbr2 stage 4 through feedstock pulses addition i e pulse addition in response to ph increase 2 4 analytical methods the light intensity in the selector and accumulator reactors was measured using a li cor light metre li 250 a equipped with a pyranometer sensor li 200 sa the concentrations of the organic acids ethanol and sugars were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a refractive index detector and an aminex hpx 87h biorad column sulphuric acid at 0 01 n was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min and 30 c operating temperature total carbohydrates were determined using the method described by lanham et al 2012 with minor changes described in fradinho et al 2013a polyhydroxyalkanoates determination was performed by gas chromatography according to lanham et al 2013 with minor modifications also described in fradinho et al 2013a ammonia and phosphate were analysed by a colorimetric method implemented in a flow segmented flow analyser skalar 5100 skalar analytical the netherlands total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were determined according to standard methods apha et al 1995 the evolution of the microbial culture regarding its bacteriochlorophyll a b and chlorophyll a contents was performed by ethanol extraction biomass was centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in a proportional volume of absolute ethanol after overnight incubation in dark conditions at room temperature the mixture was centrifuged and the absorbence spectra of the supernatant was measured in an uv visible spectrophotometer with a quartz cuvette 2 5 calculation of kinetic and stoichiometric parameters the biomass pha content was determined in terms of percentage of vss on a mass basis pha 100 pha vss g pha g vss considering that vss consists of active biomass x pha and total carbohydrates active biomass was calculated by subtracting pha and total carbohydrates from vss and its value in c mol was determined considering a standard biomass chemical formula of ch1 8o0 5n0 2p0 02 that is typically applied in mixed microbial cultures the specific biomass growth rate µ was determined through the uptake rate of ammonium divided by the respective n c molar biomass ratio of 0 2 according to the above mentioned biomass chemical formula since nh4 was never limiting preventing nitrogen fixation the biomass growth was estimated through ammonium consumption the specific ammonium consumption rate was measured through a nitrogen mass balance of the system during the illuminated phase divided by the initial active biomass concentration xi regarding the specific phosphate consumption rate q p it was assessed through a phosphate mass balance of the system during the illuminated phase divided by the initial active biomass concentration xi the phosphate release rate q p was achieved similarly considering the release phase the average specific pha production rate q pha in cmmol pha cmmol x d was determined by calculating the change in pha concentration as a function of time during the illuminated phase per initial active biomass concentration the pha productivity in the light phase in g pha l d light phase was determined by dividing the amount of pha produced during the light phase by the 12 h of the light phase in g pha h divided per the respective reactor volume l and multiplied by 24 h for sbr2 an additional productivity was determined in g pha l d feast phase diving the pha produced per the number of hours of feast the pha productivity in the accumulation tests was similarly calculated but referring to an 8 h batch test the substrate concentration corresponds to the sum of lactic acetic butyric isovaleric propionic and valeric acids concentrations organic acids in terms of cmmol l plus ethanol and sugar glucose and fructose the average specific substrate uptake rate q s in cmmol s cmmol x d was calculated through an organic carbon mass balance per initial active biomass concentration similarly to that described above for n the percentage of carbon removal was calculated by considering the total organic carbon consumed during the light phase divided by the total organic carbon that enters in the sbr in the same interval of time multiplied by 100 the reactor yields of pha and active biomass per substrate y pha s cmmol pha cmmol s yx s cmmol x cmmol s were determined by dividing the production rate of pha cmmol pha d and growth rate cmmol x d by the substrate uptake rate cmmol s d the feast to famine ratio f f was calculated by dividing the number of hours where the organic carbon was present feast phase per total hours of the famine phase the food to microorganism ratio f m was obtain by dividing the substrate concentration in cmmol per the active biomass in cmmol the ratio between bacteriochlorophyll a b and chlorophyll a was estimated by dividing the extracted pigments absorbence at 775 nm corresponding to bacteriochlorophyll a b by the absorbence at 665 nm corresponding to chlorophyll a in this analysis it is important to refer that bacteriochlorophyll c from green bacteria can also absorb at 665 nm however microscopic observations performed until day 195 of operation did not reveal the presence of green bacteria and therefore the pigments absorbence at 665 nm were ascribed to chl a 3 results and discussion the pmc s capability to produce pha with a real waste feedstock and under the physical and operating characteristics temperature and light intensity of the hraps of chiclana s wwtp was evaluated for both the submersible jet mixed sbr1 and paddle wheel sbr2 systems the two sbrs were fed with real fermented feedstock domestic wastewater plus molasses wwm composed of a mixture of different compounds especially organic acids lactic acetic propionic butyric valeric as well as ethanol and sugars the composition and content of the fermented feedstock fluctuated over time where sometimes the fermentation process was incomplete leading to the presence of considerable amounts of sugars namely glucose and fructose the composition of the fermented feed solution over time can be found in table 1 3 1 phototrophic mixed culture enrichment in sbr1 sbr1 operation started with its inoculation with algae sludge from a hrap and addition of one pulse of the fermented wwm rich in organic acids the culture underwent an 11 day batch adaptation period to promote the growth of purple bacteria over microalgae in fig 1 a the carbon substrate started to be consumed from day zero while biomass steadily grew from the 0 44 g l of the initial algae inoculum up to 0 80 g vss l fig 1d by day 15 purple bacteria were already present in the reactor as observed by the increase of the bacteriochlorophyll a b content fig 1d it should be noted that bacteriochlorophyll a b indicates the presence of organisms performing anoxygenic photosynthesis such as purple phototrophic bacteria while chlorophyll a indicates the presence of organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis such as microalgae as such stage 1 was initiated and sbr1 started being continuously fed during the 12 hours light period with a corresponding organic loading rate olr of 12 16 cmmol l d the simultaneous feeding of fermented wwm and respective substrate consumption by the sbr1 culture naturally stabilized the ph between 6 5 7 0 also sbr1 presented orp values between 400 mv and 300 mv which indicates that despite the open operating conditions and the stirring the culture was under anaerobic conditions these are precisely the ideal conditions for operating pmc under a permanent feast regime fradinho et al 2016 during stage 1 operation the imposed operating conditions led to a stabilization of the biomass concentration 1 72 0 2 g vss l supplementary material appendix a6 and to a further enrichment of the culture in purple bacteria with an increase of bacteriochlorophyll a b fig 1d in relation to the pha profile the culture increased its pha content from 1 3 pha 0 06 cmmol pha l in the beginning of stage 1 up to 20 of pha 14 09 cmmol pha l 86hb 14hv in c base stabilizing at an average value of 12 of pha 10 30 2 69 cmmol pha l 85hb 15hv in c base during the last 20 days of stage 1 it is worth noting that at this stage the culture presented a phosphorous uptake release profile along the 24 h cycle which may have resulted from the initial culture selection stage 0 being under limiting p concentrations this could potentially be linked with the higher pha accumulation observed at this stage in the reactor operation further discussed in section 3 1 1 from stage 1 to stage 2 there was a change in the influent composition and a considerable amount of sugars mostly glucose and fructose which accounted for 20 of the total organic carbon were still present in the feedstock see table 1 the high sugar concentration in the feed solution along with the reactor anaerobic conditions led to a fermentative process that acidified the system and diminished the ph down to 4 the culture conversion into a fermentative mode may explain the loss of capability to accumulate pha residual values moreover the low ph led to a large decrease in the biomass concentration only 0 2 g vss l in the reactor due to biomass decay fig 1d stage 2 however the bacteriochlorophyll a b was consistently higher than chlorophyll a this might be due to ph being a very important factor in microalgae and cyanobacteria growth which have generally been reported to prefer neutral to slightly alkaline ph levels for optimum growth li et al 2014 nayak and prasanna 2007 while purple bacteria are more resilient to extreme environments such as acidic conditions madigan and jung 2009 since in stage 2 the biomass concentration decreased dramatically due to the sugar rich influent fully fermented feed was added in stage 3 without sugars see table 1 and the olr was lowered to approximately 4 cmmol l d 3 5 times lower adjusting it to the low biomass concentration as the biomass concentration increased during culture recovery the olr was steadily increased over time however between day 115 and day 151 low concentrations of organic acids were registered and this was likely responsible for the observed bchl a b chl a decrease 1 28 0 55 indicating a period of stable coexistence of microalgae and purple bacteria since the former are autotrophic organisms when organic carbon is limited their presence is expected as they compete with the heterotrophic purple bacteria for light and nutrients at the end of stage 3 the biomass concentration quadrupled reaching 0 8 g vss l as a low amount of pha was accumulated during this period 0 71 0 43 cmmol pha l it was hypothesised that organic carbon was limiting pha production thus additional fermented wwm was added by increasing the olr at the beginning of stage 4 the culture responded with a fast increase in the pha content reaching up to 17 6 pha vss 6 99 cmmol pha l 60hb 40hv in c base this suggests that despite the residual pha concentrations in the selector reactor the continuous operation under low organic carbon selected for pha accumulating bacteria which could quickly accumulate pha once organic carbon was no longer limiting see section 3 1 1 for further discussion also and as planned the increase of organic acids also directly impacted the purple bacteria content with a fast increase in the bchl a b chl a ratio and concomitant decrease in chlorophyll a this increase in bchl a b chl a ratio continued during stage 4 despite this clear indication of the high dominance of purple bacteria during stage 4 the culture presented low values of pha 2 pha vss 1 29 0 38 cmmol pha l fig 1b significantly the fermented feedstock used in stage 4 contained sugars once again see table 1 this time a lower sugar concentration was observed 11 3 cmmol l 7 of the total organic carbon and the reactor did not suffer biomass loss likely because the ph in the reactor ranged between 5 5 5 values that are still suitable for growth of ppb madigan and jung 2009 however and similarly to what happened in stage 2 the microbial culture lost its capability to accumulate pha this result is in line with the previous finding that the presence of sugar under anaerobic conditions likely leads to a fermentative metabolism through the growth of fermentative anaerobic bacteria and a decrease of ph to 4 5 the loss of pha accumulation capability by the ppb may be related to 1 inhibition by low ph or 2 the preference of ppb to perform sugar fermentation in detriment of photoheterotrophic organic acids uptake for growth or pha production this is an important finding confirming that for the successful operation of a pmc under anaerobic conditions strict control of the upstream fermentation step is required to guarantee a fully fermented influent without sugars under a permanent feast regime it was possible to select a pmc rich in ppb starting from an inoculum rich in microalgae and fed with a real fermented waste feedstock despite the considerable negative impact observed in the presence of a high sugar concentration in general phosphate cycling and the selection under periods of low to high organic acids in the medium appear to be a good complementary selection strategy to favour the selection of a pmc with higher pha accumulation capacity 3 1 1 operating conditions that favour pha accumulation the highest amounts of pha were accumulated during stage 1 and stage 4 fig 2 presents two profiles of the pmc during 24 hour cycles under the two complementary selection processes that lead to pha production in the selector reactor a phosphorus uptake and release by the pmc observed during stage 1 and b short term response of a culture selected under low olr stage 3 to an increase of olr beginning of stage 4 in stage 1 the culture performed phosphate uptake 0 0025 pmmol cmmol x d and pha production during the light phase and release of phosphate 0 0015 pmmol cmmol x d during the dark phase fig 2a during the dark phase phosphate was released but with no apparent association neither with organic acids uptake nor pha accumulation as typically observed in the well studied systems enriched in polyphosphate accumulating organisms oehmen et al 2006 poly p storage during the light phase likely served as an energy source during the dark phase for cell maintenance increasing its resilience under the operational conditions of the reactor nevertheless the observation of p cycling is consistent with the increased pha accumulation during this period suggesting the selection of pha accumulating bacteria ppb have previously been observed to accumulate polyphosphate and release it as phosphate during dark periods as an energy source lai et al 2017 liang et al 2010 which is also associated with pha accumulation lai et al 2017 during stage 1 the pha content reached levels of 20 of pha 14 09 cmmol pha l 86hb 14hv on a c mole basis which was the highest value registered during reactor operation fig 1a with the biomass decay observed in stage 2 due to the growth of fermentative organisms the microbial culture lost this p cycling ability which was also no longer observed during the subsequent reactor operational stages fig 2b q p 0 0003 pmmol cmmol x d q p 0 pmmol cmmol x d another operating condition that seemed to play an important role in enriching the culture with pha accumulating organisms was the continuous presence of carbon in the reactor but at very low concentrations 0 02 to 2 cmmol l under the continuous presence of n and p fig 2 b represents one cycle of the reactor where after a selection period under low organic carbon availability end of stage 3 olr 3 79 1 53 cmmol l d the olr was increased to 6 9 cmmol l d while fig 2a is representative of the culture behaviour along stage 1 fig 2b represents a transitory behaviour of a pmc selected under a low carbon availability when exposed to a higher carbon concentration after the reactor came from an initial phase where substrate was scarce stage 3 and after a quick increase of the substrate concentration beginning of stage 4 the pha content achieved 17 6 pha vss 6 99 cmmol pha l 60hb 40hv in c base fig 2b it is possible that under low availability of organic acids the competition for substrate favoured the growth of bacteria that had the capability to accumulate pha as an internal carbon reserve once exposed to higher carbon availability the pha storing organisms could achieve higher pha content in this period pha accumulation was favoured in comparison with the biomass growth y x s 0 05 ypha s 0 53 leading to phosphate accumulation as shown in fig 2b since this higher pha production was observed only during a 3 days transition period between the change from low olr to higher olr it would be of interest in the future to evaluate two possible operating scenarios 1 culture selection under low olr with a parallel reactor accumulation at higher organic content 2 culture selection with alternating low olr high olr conditions to study the dynamic feeding impact on the pmc performance namely if a consistently high pha productivity could be maintained a dynamic feeding with continuous substrate supply at low concentrations low olr with short peaks of high carbon dosage high olr has been observed as a viable strategy to select pha accumulating bacteria in aerobic mixed culture systems marang et al 2018 3 1 2 phosphorous cycling vs low to high olr strategy upon comparing both scenarios identified to be favourable to pha production in sbr1 the selected culture possessed some differences in the observed stoichiometric and kinetic behaviour table 2 enables the comparison between the two selection methods despite the different operational conditions and different feedstock composition table 1 at the time of scenario a stage 1 and scenario b end of stage 3 operation propionic acid appears to be the preferred organic acids in both situations other differences in organic acids preferences cannot be clearly linked to either changes in the fermented feedstock composition see table 1 or to changes in operational conditions it is clear however that a link exists between the organic acids consumption behaviour and the resulting pha composition where acetate and butyrate lead to phb production and propionate and valerate to phv in case a the pha produced was composed of 20 hv while in case b it presented a content of 35 hv furthermore during sbr1 operation a preference for the less reduced organic acids acetate and propionate was observed as compared to the more reduced organic acids butyrate and valerate this behaviour may be associated to the permanent feast selection strategy used where regulation of internal reducing power acts as a stress factor to produce pha indeed on a c mol basis the degree of reduction of acetic acid ĸ 4 is lower than phb ĸ 4 5 unlike butyric acid ĸ 5 similarly the degree of reduction of propionic acid ĸ 4 67 is also lower than phv ĸ 4 8 unlike valeric acid ĸ 5 2 naturally to overcome this stress the microorganisms will have a higher propensity to consume the less reduced compounds these results suggest that the operational conditions of feedstock fermentation should be altered to promote greater acetogenesis prior to its addition to pmcs as this will increase the y pha s in chart b the culture displayed negligible ethanol consumption residual rate of 0 007 cmmol cmmol x d and ethanol did not appear to have a negative impact on the system a lower yield of pha per substrate consumed was found with phosphate cycling y pha s 0 28 cmmol pha cmmol s as compared to the olr increase response of the culture selected under low organic substrate levels y pha s 0 53 cmmol pha cmmol s due to the extended period of low organic carbon availability the pmc displayed very low growth rates after the increase in organic carbon loading rate the culture accumulated more of the newly available organic carbon in the form of pha presenting a higher pha production rate and yield of pha per substrate table 2 overall results show that under a permanent feast regime there are two possible ways to select a pmc with higher pha accumulation capacity namely under phosphate cycling obtaining a 20 pha vss 14 09 cmmol pha l 86hb 14hv in c base with a productivity of 0 23 g pha l d light phase or under low concentrations of organic acids in the medium achieving a 17 6 pha vss 6 99 cmmol pha l 60hb 40hv in c base with a productivity of 0 18 g pha l d light phase result obtained in a short term response of the culture to an increase of the carbon content 3 2 phototrophic mixed culture enrichment in sbr2 sbr2 was operated to study the pmc s pha production performance under higher volumetric light availability and higher oxygen diffusion conditions as found in shallow paddle wheel mixed hrap the enrichment of the pmc used in this study was carried out under a feast and famine regime with alternating periods of 12 h of light and 12 h of dark sbr2 was fed with the same fermented mixture of domestic wastewater with 1 v v sugar molasses used in sbr1 table 1 during the 8 months of operation efforts were made to achieve the optimal duration of the feast and famine periods to maximise the growth of pha accumulating bacteria this implied adjustments of the olr during sbr2 operation it should be noted that although a high content of pha accumulating ppb is desired the microalgae presence is also typically important during a feast and famine enrichment process since they are the oxygen producers that allow pha consumption during the famine phase as reported in fradinho et al 2013a however unlike fradinho et al 2013a that operated with continuous illumination transient illumination 12 h light 12 h dark was applied in the present study therefore it was of interest to assess if the feast and famine phases should occur entirely during the 12 h light period when there is oxygen available from algae i e a cycle consisting of a short light feast phase up to 4 h 8 h light famine phase 12 h dark famine or if the feast phase could be extended up to 8 10 h of the light phase maximising the period of pha production and potentially the pha productivity in this latter scenario the dark phase despite not allowing pha consumption could act as a period of low cell metabolism simulating the starvation conditions of a traditional famine phase thus the first scenario implies the presence of algae non pha producers during the light phase along with 12 h of a non productive dark phase while in the second scenario algae are not required and the dark phase potentially contributes towards the selection process the impact of a light dark famine phase vs a dark only famine phase was addressed during sbr2 operation during stage 1 2 and 3 a light dark famine phase was implemented while in stage 4 a dark only famine phase was implemented similarly to sbr1 sbr2 operation started with an adaptation period between days 0 and 15 achieving a biomass concentration of 0 89 0 2 g vss l after this adaptation period and to implement a ff regime during the light phase two feeding methods were tested in stage 1 until day 45 both with an olr 3 4 cmmol l d 1 continuous feeding during the first 4 h of the light phase and 2 one single pulse addition at the beginning of the light phase as observed in fig 3 a both feeding methods led to low concentrations of organic acids which combined with the higher light intensity of sbr2 favoured microalgae growth thus a low bchl a b chl a fig 3c and pha were observed fig 3b during the remainder of stage 1 and stage 2 the olr of the single pulse was increased up to 9 5 cmmol l d to achieve a longer feast phase range 1 h 4 h although this promoted the growth of purple bacteria fig 3c day 50 onwards the quick load of organic acids in a single pulse also led to a sharp ph drop 5 that inhibited the culture decreasing the organic acids consumption rate and sometimes eliminating the famine phase during this period the ph was adjusted to 6 5 after feeding to reverse the inhibition of the culture due to low ph to overcome this periodical pulses with a lower olr 2 cmmol l d each were implemented in stage 3 to maintain a 4 h feast period f f 0 2 without the ph limitation after 20 days of stage 3 operation the multi pulse feeding method stabilized the ppb content and the biomass concentration at 1 05 0 12 g vss l and led to the highest pha value of 26 1 pha vss 11 97 cmmol pha l 36hb 64hv on a c mol basis with a productivity of 0 26 g pha l d light phase and 0 52 g pha l d feast phase by the end of stage 3 during stage 4 the feast phase was extended up to 8 h 10 h f f 0 7 to study the dark famine phase possibility although a strong increase in ppb was observed with the higher olr the extension of the feast phase decreased the overall pha productivity as further discussed in section 3 2 1 as such the olr was continuously adjusted in stage 4 fig 3a to attempt to maintain both a long feast phase and a famine period unlike sbr1 the presence of high concentrations of sugar in the feed solution stage 2 and stage 4 did not significantly affect the reactor performance in terms of ph and biomass losses the presence of oxygen along the light phase particularly in the light famine phase likely inhibited any fermentative state from developing both in terms of repressing the growth of anaerobic fermentative bacteria and avoiding ph decreases as well as preventing any eventual sugar fermentation by some ppb 3 2 1 influence of the f f ratio on the pha accumulation capacity of sbr2 during the 210 days of sbr2 operation it was possible to observe changes in the pha accumulating capacity of the culture selected under different feast to famine ratios f f fig 4 and table 3 summarize the results of three representative pmc cycles performed in sbr2 at stage 1 fig 4a and stage 4 fig 4b and c under different f f ratios and different organic carbon and bchl a b chl a ratio comparing cycles a and b a higher pha productivity of the pmc was found in case b a 0 17 g pha l d feast phase and 0 06 g pha l d light phase b 0 71 g pha l d feast phase and 0 24 g pha l d light phase the higher specific pha production rate and higher yield of pha per substrate are related to the higher ppb content of the culture in chart b responsible for pha production this is coupled with the increased biomass concentration that led to a substantially higher pha productivity in case a under a low olr operation the biomass content is consequently lower and with more oxygen availability more hours with higher orp levels fig 4a aerobic pha accumulating bacteria are likely present and consuming the substrate through decarboxylation leading to lower y pha s and naturally lower productivity in case c a decrease in the pmc pha accumulation rate was found in comparison to case b although bchl a b chl a in the pmc in case c is the same that in case b the lack of a substantial famine phase while light was available and inherent presence of oxygen produced by algae did not allow the consumption of pha with an extended feast phase the culture did not fully consume the pha and along the cycles started to lose its capability to accumulate the polymer this indicates that the 12 h dark period cannot act as a substitute to the famine phase being essential for the f f regime to contain an extended famine period during the light phase in stages 1 to 3 higher orp levels were observed during the light famine phase fig 4a the lower level of orp in stage 4 also suggested that oxygen production by algae was minimal and insufficient to oxidise pha in the dark famine phase fig 4c the organic acids uptake rates by the pmc varied in accordance with organic acids abundance of the feed butyrate and valerate were more abundant in cases b and c stage 4 table 1 presenting higher uptake rates while acetate and propionate were the most abundant and more rapidly taken up in case a stage 1 table 1 the higher algae content in case a may also have contributed to the higher preference for acetate since some algae are capable of consuming acetate ogbonna et al 2000 perez garcia et al 2011 overall in sbr2 there is no stress associated to the reductive power as observed in sbr1 which explains not existing a preference for the less reductive organic acids acetate and propionate comparing with the higher reductive organic acids butyrate and valerate the multiple pulse feeding strategy was the best way to achieve higher f f ratios without causing substrate limitations increasing the bchl a b chl a ratio however both the feast and famine phases must occur in the light phase to ensure pha consumption through the oxygen produced by algae an alternative to maximize the pha production is to increase the light availability operating an accumulation reactor in parallel with the selector reactor as discussed below in section 3 2 2 3 2 2 sbr2 pha accumulation tests during pha accumulation tests a higher light intensity was applied in parallel accumulator reactors to increase the kinetic rates of pha production and to determine the maximum pha accumulating capacity of the pmc it should be noted that this higher light intensity is still representative of realistic light levels that could be achieved in an hrap with natural sunlight as shown in fig 5 two batch accumulation tests were performed with sbr2 s pmc in stage 4 during a f f 0 2 the first test was performed when sugar was present in the fermented feed fig 5a while the second test did not contain sugar in the feed fig 5b as previously mentioned in the selection reactor for sbr2 under a feast and famine regime the presence of sugar did not seem to affect the culture in terms of ph and biomass losses however the capability to accumulate pha seems to be affected as shown through the lower pha production and substrate consumption rates when sugar is present table 4 under the presence of sugar chart 5a the pmc achieved a pha content of 24 6 pha vss 23 4 cmmol pha l 85hb 15hv on a c mol basis with a productivity of 1 66 g pha l d in 8 h of operation under no sugar presence chart 5b the pha content was similar achieving a 30 8 pha vss 31 56 cmmol pha l 85hb 15hv on a c mol basis with a productivity of 2 67 g pha l d in 8 h it must be referred however that the food to microorganism ratio f m could have also influenced the higher kinetic rates of test 5b since the ph was controlled through the pulse addition of feedstock the much faster ph increase observed during test 5b was counterbalanced with a more frequent addition of feedstock pulses this eventually led to a higher f m in relation to test 5a where a slower ph increase led to a shorter demand of pulse addition supplementary material appendix a5 future tests under acid base ph control and similar f m can provide further insight on the real impact of this parameter in fig 5a 2 and 5b2 it is possible to observe the cumulative consumption profile of each organic compound in fig 5a 2 the pmc presents a homogeneous consumption of all the organic compounds showing preference for butyrate valerate and acetate in fig 5b 2 with no sugar in the feedstock but with a high percentage of ethanol 18 on a c mol basis the culture displayed a preference for ethanol butyrate and acetate while in test a the glucose consumed by the culture was not likely leading to pha production in test b the ethanol could contribute to pha production duque et al 2014 which might be a further explanation to the higher pha content observed in this test regarding the effect of tests operation under higher light intensity and as anticipated it increased the specific kinetic rates for pha production and substrate consumption in comparison to the ones observed in the selector sbr2 test 4b table 4 a similar behaviour was also observed for the sbr1 culture in external batch tests consult supplementary material a4 for more details on sbr1 batch tests at higher light intensity the increased pha production under high light intensity highlights the advantage of an accumulator reactor in this process fradinho et al 2013b studied the effect of dark light periods in the pha production of a pmc operated in a feast and famine regime but fed with synthetic medium containing acetic acid as carbon source obtaining a 30 phb vss content a very similar value was achieved in the present work 5b test with no sugar presence but with the advantage of being produced a phbv co polymer under a complex feedstock feeding containing a mixture of different organic acids regarding the substrate uptake and pha production rates fradinho et al 2013b presented similar rates attained under lower light intensity which might be due to the selection of the culture only under synthetic acetic acid feeding when sbr2 pha production tests are compared with aerobic mixed culture systems also fed with fermented molasses we observed that the pmc s productivities are lower in accumulation assays duque et al 2014 obtained a specific pha production rate of 3 36 cmol pha cmol x d 1 8 times higher with a pha volumetric productivity of 8 88 g pha l d 3 3 times higher likewise in albuquerque et al 2011 pha production rates of 3 36 4 8 cmol pha cmol x d 1 8 2 6 times higher with pha volumetric productivities of 7 2 12 g pha l d 2 7 4 5 times higher were achieved it is important to note that while the specific pha production rates between the phototrophic and the aerobic systems have only a 2 fold difference the volumetric productivities present a higher gap due to the lower biomass concentration of the phototrophic culture 1 5 g vss l in comparison to 4 6 g vss l of aerobic cultures light is known to be a critical factor of phototrophic systems and the optimization of light supply can enhance the biomass growth and consequently enable higher pha productivities fradinho et al 2021 future developments in this field will positively contribute to the increase of pha productivities in pmcs 3 3 permanent feast pf vs feast and famine ff two pmcs were tested in parallel under the same conditions simulating an outdoor environment following two operating strategies pf and ff that best suit the oxidative conditions found in model hraps both strategies were tested using the same feedstock solution allowing to compare the different pmcs behaviour along the feedstock fluctuations the work developed under a pf regime shows that there are two complementary strategies that improve pha accumulation namely the phosphate cycling and transitioning from low to high olr the best strategy seems to be the phosphate cycling that led to the highest pha content of 20 pha vss 14 09 cmmol pha l 86hb 14hv in c base with a respective productivity of 0 23 g pha l d light phase in terms of cost efficiency phosphate cycling strategy is perhaps more appealing not only because of the higher pha productivities but also because it requires less operational space one single reactor and it has a simpler process control however the sensitivity of the pmc selected under a permanent feast regime to the presence of considerable amounts of sugar is a drawback if the up stream fermentation is not complete and in the phosphate cycling strategy the feedstock solution must also allow the p limitation condition under the ff regime the highest pha content obtained in the selection reactor was 26 1 of pha vss 11 97 cmmol pha l 36hb 64hv in c base with a respective productivity 0 26 g pha l d light phase and 0 52 g pha l d feast phase the productivity could be increased up to 2 67 g pha l d by operating parallel accumulation reactors under higher light intensity final pha content after 8 h of accumulation of 30 8 pha vss 31 56 cmmol pha l 85hb 15hv on a c mol basis this regime has the advantage of not requiring nutrient limitation and not presenting high sensitivity to the presence of sugar in the feedstock however the feast and famine phases must occur only during the light phase since during the dark phase the culture does not present any productive activity in the future it will be interesting to study the possibility of a culture selected under high f f ratio to use aeration in the dark phase this could promote pha consumption in the dark while maximising the pha productive period of the light feast phase during natural sunlight hours furthermore oxygen demand in the famine phase is typically less than in the feast phase in traditional mixed culture pha production processes third et al 2003 lowering the cost of the process this approach could lead to increased productivities in one single reactor thus avoiding the need for a second accumulator reactor this outcome opens the possibility towards the implementation of this new technology in an outdoor environment through the retrofitting of already existing infrastructure such as hraps into ppb ponds furthermore it will require the adaptation of hraps to accommodate the operational strategies studied and proposed here potentially as an sbr rather than continuous flow operation further work should also address the integration of pha production with wastewater treatment and nutrient removal by ppb ppb have been shown to be effective at removing organic carbon and nutrients from domestic wastewaters hülsen et al 2016 puyol et al 2020 in the present study for both sbrs the domestic wastewater had to be supplemented with n p and organic carbon for efficient ppb selection and pha production the supplementation could be sourced from local waste streams agricultural industrial wastes or the readily available internal waste streams of the wwtp e g sludge concentrate from anaerobic digestion regarding the cod removed it was found that under p cycling stage 1 in the pf regime the culture was capable of removing 94 of the organic carbon in the 12 hour light phase similar to the value obtained by hülsen et al 2016 in a continuous photo anaerobic membrane bioreactor panmbr selected for purple bacteria in the future studies should also evaluate the potential of a pmc system to produce pha and perform simultaneous wastewater treatment under a pf or ff 3 4 conclusion a new low cost photosynthetic technology was developed where pmc enriched in phototrophic purple bacteria can produce an added value product poly 3 hydroxybutyric co 3 hydroxyvaleric copolymer while valorising residues within the permanent feast regime transitioning from low to high olr and the p cycling appear to be the best promising strategies when operating without sugars presence the best results were obtained with phosphorous cycling with a productivity of 0 23 g pha l d light phase regarding the ff regime the multiple pulses appears to be the best feeding method to control the feast length achieving a productivity of 0 26 g pha l d light phase and 0 52 g pha l d feast phase in the selector reactor or 2 67 g pha l d under higher light intensity in 8 h accumulation tests it was also noticed that the ff must take place only during the light phase further studies should focus on the prospect of integrating this new technology with wwtp processes exploring the capability of pmc to produce pha from complex feedstocks while treating wastewater under outdoor conditions using

17048,the treatment of organic waste or wastewater with high organic solvent content has been challenging in industries as it cannot be done effectively using conventional wastewater treatment technologies such as biodegradation and advanced oxidation process solvent resistant membrane distillation sr md was proposed as an energy efficient alternative to treat these waste streams but its application is hampered by the lack of solvent resistant membranes and there is a research gap in studying the feeds with water solvent mixtures in this work ceramic tubular membranes with different pore sizes and structures were molecularly grafted with 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane to obtain hydrophobic ceramic membranes for sr md the modified membranes exhibited excellent hydrophobicity and solvent resistant properties and they were tested for sr md performance with a wide range of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso feed concentrations from 3 5 to 85 wt the membranes exhibited a high dmso rejection of 98 and the separation factor of 170 with permeation flux 4 4 kg m 2 h 1 when the dmso concentration in feed was below 65 wt the separation performance was found strongly dependent on the evaporation step and the vapour liquid equilibrium near the interface the dmso rejection was also comparable to pervaporation while the permeation flux was much higher at the feed concentration of 50 wt this study establishes the strategy of using sr md as a promising membrane process in treating complex industrial wastes with high organic solvent content graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solvent resistant membrane distillation water dmso separation ceramic membranes hydrophobic modification industrial wastes 1 introduction organic solvents have been widely used in chemical and pharmaceutical industries for chemical syntheses and product purification firestone and gospe 2009 the solvents normally cannot be reused after one process cycle without a proper treatment as a high solvent purity is required in most of the processes seyler et al 2006 therefore a large amount of organic wastes is generated and many of these waste streams also contain a significant amount of water the treatment of organic waste or wastewater with high organic solvent content is challenging as it cannot be done effectively using the conventional chemical or biological methods while the incineration of the waste is not a green pathway a typical example is dimethyl sulfoxide dmso which is considered as a comparatively green dipolar aprotic organic solvent because of its low toxicity and good stability alder et al 2016 xiang et al 2017 dmso has been frequently used as a reactant or a reaction medium in the production of pharmaceuticals due to its strong solubility to numerous chemical compounds and good miscibility with many organic solvents and water mountford 2010 however high concentration of dmso remaining in the pharmaceutical waste streams is often a challenge to the conventional sewage plants both chemical and biological treatments carry their drawbacks the advanced oxidation process such as fenton oxidation is costly while the biological treatment is inhibited by the toxic intermediate products and releases unpleasant odour from dimethyl sulfide cheng et al 2009 he et al 2011 in fact wastewater with high dmso content is difficult to be treated in bioreactor because of the biological effect caused by the invasion of dmso into microorganisms smallwood 2002 the upper limit of dmso concentration for microbial acclimation in biological process is often reported in the range of 0 10 0 15 wt cheng et al 2019 hwang et al 2012 yang and myint 2003 meanwhile incineration is another common method used to treat these wastes but it has a large carbon footprint and a risk of releasing harmful gases and particulates into the atmosphere chea et al 2020 seyler et al 2006 for these issues the separation of solvent water mixtures is important to reduce the volume and improve the treatability of solvent containing waste streams distillation is a common industrial process to separate water and organic solvents with high water miscibility kolesnichenko et al 2019 ravikumar et al 2013 smallwood 2002 in this process the feed is heated to a temperature close to the boiling point and a huge amount of energy is required for this conventional separation process sometimes more than one column may be required to achieve desirable product quality in the case of water dmso mixtures the reboiler temperature of distillation column was reported to be around 120 150 c even when operating under vacuum horváth et al 2017 in addition the high temperature in distillation may accelerate the hydrolysis of some solvents such as dimethyl formamide and dimethylacetamide where the hydrolysed products can result in azeotrope problem to the distillation process smallwood 2002 therefore an energy efficient separation process is highly desirable to treat organic waste streams that contain water and organic solvents the separation process can reclaim clean water recycle valuable solvents or concentrate the waste streams for secondary treatment membrane based separation is an emerging technology that has been widely used in wastewater treatment however the commonly used pressure driven membrane process could not separate water solvent mixtures effectively due to the similar size between water and solvents and the high osmotic pressure fane et al 2011 instead thermally driven membrane processes such as pervaporation pv and membrane distillation md could be used the pv has been applied to separate water and a wide range of solvents such as alcohols aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon etc saw et al 2019 the pv process is governed by selective sorption and diffusion of species via non porous membranes and it has an unique strength in separating azeotrope mixtures or mixtures with close boiling points mountford 2010 generally organophilic pv membranes favour the permeation of organic solvents enabling the extraction of solvents while hydrophilic pv membranes are suitable to reclaim water from water solvent mixtures hydrophobic pv membranes made of cross linked poly dimethyl siloxane poly methyl hydrogen siloxane were reported to remove dmso from water a separation factor of 57 can be achieved at 70 c for feed organic concentration of 10 wt while the dmso flux was 0 5 kg m 2 h 1 hosseini and ameri 2017 on the other hand perfluoropolymer based membranes were studied for the dehydration of dmso aqueous solution tang and sirkar 2012 a separation factor over 1000 was reported for the dehydration of 90 wt dmso at 30 c but the water permeation flux was only 0 0098 kg m 2 h 1 as it can be seen pv membranes often have low permeation flux as the mass transfer is restricted by the low diffusion rate in the dense membranes in fact md is also a potential membrane technology for separating water solvent mixtures porous hydrophobic membranes are used in the md process and the permeation was driven by the vapour pressure gradient across the membrane this non isothermal membrane process has been extensively studied to reclaim water from various aqueous effluents including saline water deka et al 2019 radioactive wastewater jia et al 2018 produced water chew et al 2019 and blackish groundwater dao et al 2016 in addition to separating water from non volatile compounds like inorganic salts the application of md can be further expanded to separate water solvent mixtures based on their difference in vapour pressure it can be used to separate water from solvents with a high boiling point such as dimethylacetamide 165 c dmso 189 c and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone 202 c as they have a lower vapor pressure compared to water for instance the vapour pressure of pure dmso is only 0 7 kpa while that of water is 19 9 kpa at 60 c nishimura et al 1972 thus the vapour condensed subsequently on the permeate side of the md membrane will have a low dmso proportion in order to successfully utilize solvent resistant membrane distillation sr md hydrophobic membranes with an excellent chemical stability are required among all the polymeric membranes polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polypropylene pp membranes have strong chemical resistance and high hydrophobicity gupta et al recently developed carbon nanotube immobilized ptfe membranes for the separation of 5 15 vol isopropyl alcohol ipa from an aqueous solution via sweeping gas md ipa with a higher vapour pressure permeated through the membranes faster but the separation factor was fairly low below 13 due to the small difference in the vapour pressure for ipa and water gupta et al 2018 besides that pp membranes were applied in the dehydration of n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp through vacuum md vmd the membranes exhibited a high water permeation flux of 9 5 l m 2 h 1 and a rejection of 98 when the feed contained 10 wt nmp at 80 c shao et al 2014 despite its potential in separating solvent water mixtures sr md processes are less studied as compared to the pv because of the limited availability of sr md membranes both ptfe and pp membranes with appropriate pore sizes are difficult to fabricate using common membrane fabrication techniques feng et al 2018 tan and rodrigue 2019b furthermore the stability of the polymeric membranes has not been extensively studied and the solvent concentration range tested by far was relatively narrow in comparison ceramic membranes have natural advantages for sr md because of their intrinsic solvent resistant property and good stability in harsh environment which means they hardly swell or dissolve in organic solvents like polymeric membrane substrates chong and wang 2019 marchetti et al 2014 however hydrophobic modification is necessary to transform their hydrophilic nature resulted from the rich hydroxyl groups on the membrane surface surface grafting is the most commonly used method to modify the surface functional groups of ceramic membranes and many compounds have been previously studied among them fluoroalkylsilane fas is widely used because of the low surface energy of fluoroalkyl compounds lu et al 2019 the fas compound consists of three hydrolysable groups which can react with hydroxyl groups on ceramic membranes to form strong covalent bonds and a fluoroalkane chain that can provide hydrophobic character to the membranes wei and li 2009 hendren et al studied ceramic membranes modified by fas trichloromethylsilane and trimethyl chlorosilane and they found that fas modified membrane had a higher flux and better resistance to chlorine hendren et al 2009 compared to other silane agents without fluorocarbon chain or with a short fluoroalkyl chain a fas agent with a longer fluoroalkyl chain imparts better wetting resistance property to the anodized aluminium oxide membranes li et al 2020 modified hydrophobic ceramic membranes have been studied for various applications such as md hubadillah et al 2019b membrane contactor abdulhameed et al 2017 lin et al 2016 and ultrafiltration ke et al 2013 for md application hydrophobic ceramic membranes were used for desalination heavy metal removal as well as voc removal cerneaux et al 2009 chen et al 2018 garcía fernández et al 2017 huang et al 2018 hubadillah et al 2019a kujawa et al 2019 kujawski et al applied modified ceramic membranes to separate dilute ethyl acetate solution with a concentration up to 4 wt kujawski et al 2016 the performance of md was found to be comparable with pv and the separation factor of ethyl acetate was in the range of 32 60 besides separating light solvents hydrophobic ceramic membranes can potentially be used to separate water from heavy solvents through sr md nevertheless the application of sr md in a broader solvent concentration and for a longer operating time is still understudied in this work we proposed sr md as a novel and effective alternative for separating water from solvents with high boiling points dmso was selected in this study because of its relatively low toxicity and increasing use in the industry alder et al 2016 xiang et al 2017 hydrophobic ceramic membranes were modified by grafting fas onto the substrates and then their performance in water dmso separation was examined by a series of vmd experiments the effects of feed concentration temperature and membrane structure were studied in order to understand the separation and transport mechanisms in the sr md process moreover a commercial pv membrane was used to separate the water dmso feed stream and the results were compared with the counterparts of the sr md process this study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of sr md in separating water dmso mixtures over a wide range of dmso concentrations and facilitate sr md applications for other water solvent systems associated with high boiling point solvents 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals three types of alumina ceramic tubular membranes from coorstek b v netherlands were used as the membrane substrates they were named as 20 asy 200 asy 200 sym according to their pore size 20 or 200 nm and matrix structures symmetric or asymmetric as illustrated in fig 1 the alumina substrates have an average outer diameter of 4 5 mm and an average inner diameter of 3 mm hydrophobic ptfe hollow fibre membranes were kindly supplied by a commercial company and hybrid silica hybsi ar tubular membranes were purchased from pervatech b v netherlands they were tested for md and pv as a comparative study dmso was purchased from merck millipore singapore 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane c16h19f17o3si 97 fas f17 methanol ch3oh 99 9 were bought from sigma aldrich singapore all chemicals were used as received deionized water was produced by a milli q system of merck millipore usa 2 2 hydrophobic grafting of ceramic membranes the hydrophobic grafting of ceramic membranes is similar to the method reported by other research groups koonaphapdeelert and li 2007 kujawski et al 2007 firstly the virgin ceramic membranes were immersed in an ultrasonic water bath for at least 10 min to remove contaminants beforehand after drying in an oven at 60 c for overnight the ceramic membranes were then immersed into the grafting solution at 30 c for 2 h which was prepared by dissolving 2 wt fas f17 in methanol then the membranes were washed in an ultrasonic methanol bath followed by drying in air for 1 h and in an oven at 110 c for 1 h after taking out from the oven the same grafting and drying processes were conducted once again to enhance the grafting efficiency the modified membranes were named as 20 masy 200 masy and 200 msym accordingly the schematic of grafting reaction among the fas f17 molecules and ceramic membranes is shown in fig 2 2 3 membrane characterizations the morphologies of the pristine and modified membranes were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jsm 7200f jeol japan the measurement of membrane surface porosity was calculated based on the graph of surface morphology with a magnification of 30 000 times the inner surface roughness of modified membranes was captured by an atomic force microscope afm nx 100 park systems republic of korea through a non contact mode the average pore size and distribution of the membranes were tested by a capillary flow porometer cfp 1500a porous material inc usa ipa was used to fill the membranes pores before measurement and nitrogen was used as the pressurised gas to replace the entrapped ipa in order to examine the grafting reaction occurred on ceramic membranes the 20 asy and 20 masy were tested by x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps axis supra kratos analytical japan with monochromatic al kα x ray source hv 1486 6 ev the water contact angles wca and solvent contact angles sca of the modified membranes were tested through the sessile drop method by a goniometer contact angle system oca 15ec dataphysics germany water or pure dmso droplets were dropped onto the inner surface of membranes and then the droplets were allowed to stabilize for 3 min before measurement afterwards the display was captured by a camera and the contact angles were defined by the tangent lines of the droplet and the inner circle of membranes in addition to evaluate the linkage stability of the hydrophobic chains on the membranes the contact angles tests were performed after the modified membranes were immersed in pure dmso at room temperature for 14 and 30 days respectively liquid entry pressure lep was tested in order to evaluate the entry pressure of feed liquid flooding the membrane pores lepw and leps indicate the entry pressure of water and pure dmso respectively the measurement of lep was performed in a dead end configuration where the hollow fibre was connected to a pressure vessel filled with water or dmso during the tests the pressure supplied by compressed n2 gas was increased with 2 psi every 5 min rose bengal was used to stain the tested liquid to give it red colour when the first drop of water or dmso appeared on the outer surface of ceramic membranes the pressure was recorded as the lepw and leps respectively 2 4 vmd performance tests in water dmso solution a series of vmd tests were conducted on the modified ceramic membranes and the diagram of the setup used is shown in fig 3 membrane modules with an effective length of 0 18 m were used in this study during the vmd tests the feed solution was heated up to 60 c in a heating jacket tank and circulated by a peristaltic pump masterflex cole parmer usa with a flow rate of 170 ml min 1 through the lumen of the membranes a vacuum condensation system was applied in the shell side of the membranes to control the vacuum level at 5 kpa the generated permeate stream was extracted from the system by a vacuum pump rv3 edwards uk and was condensed in a glass condenser cooled by liquid nitrogen the collected product was weighted by a mass balance and its dmso concentration was measured by a gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector gc fid 7890 gc system agilent technologies usa the permeate flux j was calculated by eq 1 1 j m a δ t m π d l δ t where m is the mass of the collected product a is the effective area of the membrane δ t is the time interval d is the inner diameter of the membrane l is the effective length of membrane contacting feed stream the separation performance was evaluated by dmso rejection r and separation factor α which were presented as eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 2 r 1 c p c f 100 3 α y w y s o l x w x s o l where c p and c f are the dmso concentrations of the permeate and the feed stream y w and y s o l are the weight fractions of water and dmso in permeate x w and x s o l are the weight fractions of water and dmso in feed respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface hydrophobic modification of ceramic membranes three types of ceramic tubular membranes were used as the substrate 20 asy 200 asy and 200 sym and their pristine properties were first examined before the hydrophobic modification figs 4 a and 4b show the characterization of their pore sizes the 200 sym and 200 asy membranes have an average pore size of 228 and 218 nm respectively and a fairly narrow pore size distribution the 20 asy membrane has a much smaller average pore size which is hardly measured using the gas liquid porometry instead the molecular weight cut off mwco was evaluated by measuring the dextran rejection the 20 asy membrane has an mwco of 94 kda and the pore size was estimated to be about 12 8 nm ren et al 2006 fig 4c shows their structure characteristics the 200 sym membrane has a homogeneous pore structure while the 200 asy and 20 asy membranes have a surface layer of about 20 and 10 μm respectively the inner surface morphologies of the modified membranes 200 msym 200 masy and 20 masy are shown in fig 5 compared with the pristine membranes shown in fig 4c it can be concluded that the surface morphologies had no significant change after the chemical grafting as the grafting step only imparted a molecular layer of perfluorinated chains to the membrane surface similar observations were reported in previous studies associated with fas f17 grafting garcía fernández et al 2017 koonaphapdeelert and li 2007 zhong et al 2017 xps scan was carried out to analyse the elements on the surfaces of the 20 asy 20 masy and 20 masy 30d membranes the 20 masy 30d refers to the sample that has been immersed in pure dmso for 30 days to evaluate the stability of the hydrophobic modification as shown in fig 6 the 20 masy membrane spectra clearly shows the characteristic peaks of silicon si and fluoride f in addition to carbon c oxygen o and aluminium al while the 20 asy membranes are lack of si and f element it suggests the successful grafting of fas f17 koonaphapdeelert and li 2007 for the o signals both si o bonds and oxygen in al2o3 lattice can be detected at the range of 531 6 and 533 2 ev respectively furthermore the 20 masy 30d membrane has similar characteristic peaks and spectrum as the 20 masy membrane indicating good stability of the hydrophobic grafting to determine the surface wettability of the grafted membranes the contact angles of the membranes were tested and the results are depicted in fig 7 it can be seen that the newly modified 0 d 200 masy and 200 msym membranes have similar wca 150 and sca 118 the lower sca was ascribed to the lower surface tension of dmso compared to water lide 2004 meanwhile the 20 masy membrane possesses slightly smaller contact angles than the membranes with larger pore sizes but still shows high hydrophobicity though the grafting method used in all three membranes was identical the difference in the apparent contact angles of hydrophobic surfaces could be contributed by the difference in surface roughness table 1 shows the surface roughness parameters of three modified membranes obtained from afm the 200 masy and 200 msym membranes have much higher surface roughness which can contribute to higher apparent contact angles than the 20 masy membranes moreover the grafted membranes also show good stability in solvent environment evidenced by the stable contact angles after immersing in pure dmso for 14 and 30 days although there were slight decrements all modified membranes maintained good hydrophobicity with wca 144 and sca 110 after 30 days the results of lepw and leps in table 1 are in good agreement with the contact angle tests before hydrophobic grafting the ceramic membranes are extremely hydrophilic and both water and dmso would disperse and penetrate into the pores quickly however after the grafting process the modified membranes possess high lepw 30 psi and leps 12 psi which are much higher than the operating pressure in sr md the good hydrophobicity and high liquid entry barrier can prevent the modified membranes from being wetted by the feed solution especially when the feed contains high concentration of solvent 3 2 vmd performance in water dmso system 3 2 1 feed stream with various dmso concentrations to study the feasibility of applying the modified ceramic membranes for sr md to separate water dmso mixtures the 200 msym membranes were first tested with 3 5 85 wt dmso feed streams at 60 c as depicted in fig 8 a the membrane showed high permeate flux of 7 3 kg m 2 h 1 at dmso concentration of 3 5 wt and the rejection could reach as high as 99 7 however both the permeate flux and the solvent rejection decreased with increasing dmso concentration in the feed the permeate flux and dmso rejection was only 1 7 kg m 2 h 1 and 88 4 respectively when feed dmso concentration was 85 wt fig 8b indicates the impact of feed dmso concentration on the permeate purity and the separation factor generally when dmso in the feed stream became more concentrated the dmso concentration in the permeate increased slightly too this trend became more distinct when the dmso concentration in the feed was higher than 65 wt as for the separation factor it reached the best value of 284 4 at 3 5 wt and remained fairly constant at about 170 when the feed dmso concentration was between 20 and 65 wt nevertheless it decreased significantly when the feed concentration was higher than 65 wt to understand the behaviours of water and dmso permeation through the membranes the transport mechanisms of water and dmso need to be analysed during the md separation process a vapour liquid interface was formed on the membrane surface as illustrated in fig 9 the feed solution underwent an evaporative phase change near the pore entrance and the vapour transported across the membrane under the effect of the partial pressure difference p1 p0 here p0 was close to zero because of the applied vacuum and the vapour permeation was highly dependent on the partial pressure near the vapour liquid interface different from vmd in desalination where the solute is non volatile both water and dmso will evaporate at the vapour liquid interface nevertheless the vmd process could still effectively separate water from dmso because of the considerably higher saturated pressure of pure water which is 19 9 kpa compared to 0 7 kpa of pure dmso at 60 c nishimura et al 1972 however when the dmso concentration increased in the feed solution the partial pressure of dmso near the interface increased too leading to the lower rejection at the same time the total vapour pressure of the mixture decreased as the proportion of water in the feed became smaller resulting in the flux reduction to evaluate the separation performance of vmd theoretical values of dmso concentration in permeate and dmso rejection were estimated based on the raoult s law by assuming the gas mixture was ideal the vapour pressure of the pure substance was calculated from antoine empirical equation the dmso mass composition of the permeate can be obtained by eq 4 and the rejection was then calculated using eq 2 4 c p e s t x s o l p s o l m s x s o l p s o l m s x w p w m w where x s o l and x w are the liquid mole fraction p s o l and p w are the vapour pressure of pure substance m s and m w are the molecular mass of dmso and water respectively accordingly when the feed dmso concentration increases from 3 5 to 85 wt the dmso component in the vapour phase will increase from 0 1 to 16 6 wt and the dmso rejection will decrease from 96 4 to 80 4 nonetheless the actual dmso rejection in the experiments was much higher than the estimation only reduced from 99 7 to 88 4 wt to understand the reason behind the diffusion of vapour molecules in the membrane pores should be considered in addition to the evaporation of feed stream at the interfaces in the case of vmd the mean free path of transporting molecules was much higher than the membrane pore sizes thus the diffusion phase was dominated by the knudsen model which emphasizes the interactions between molecules and membrane pore walls schofield et al 1990 knudsen diffusion favours the transport of smaller molecules water so it has a positive effect on the transportation of water although the hydrophobic interaction was weak in gas vapour phase the hydrophobic tails of dmso molecules may still have affinity to the hydrophobic membrane walls and parts of dmso may be attached on the membrane surface during the collision and thus slowing down the transport to the permeate side as a result the dmso rejection in the vmd process could exceed the estimated value the extent of transcendence would be even higher if the tortuosity of the membrane pores was considered 3 2 2 effects of feed temperature and membrane structure to explore the impact of the feed temperature on the membrane performance vmd tests were carried out with a 50 wt dmso feed solution at temperature ranging from 30 to 60 c three different types of membranes 200 masy 200 msym and 20 masy were tested and the effects of membrane pore size and structure were also studied as shown in fig 10 a the permeation fluxes of all three membranes improved consistently with the increasing temperature the 20 masy exhibited the highest permeation flux among them where the flux increased from 1 5 kg m 2 h 1 at 30 c to 6 9 kg m 2 h 1 at 60 c the increase of permeation flux could be explained by the higher vapour pressure generated at high temperature subsequently rendering a higher driving force of mass transfer at the same time all three membranes maintained a high rejection 98 of dmso with a separation factor higher than 105 as discussed in the previous section the rejection of dmso highly depends on the vapour pressure of both water and dmso at the vapour liquid interface for 50 wt liquid mixture the partial pressure of dmso increases from 0 02 to 0 1 kpa while the partial pressure of water increases from 3 5 to 16 1 kpa when the temperature rises from 30 to 60 c nishimura et al 1972 though the percentage of increase in vapour pressure of dmso was higher than water the vapour pressure was still much lower than water and therefore a high rejection of dmso could still be maintained to further understand the effect of temperature ln j versus t 1 was plotted in fig 10b the linear relationship indicates that the permeation fluxes increase exponentially with increasing temperature following the arrhenius type equation the activation energy can be calculated and it ranges from 38 0 43 6 kj mol the activation energy is a combination of the enthalpy of vaporization and energy of diffusion huang et al 2014 water is the main component in the vapour phase at the vapour liquid equilibrium as shown in the rejection data where the concentration of dmso was less than 1 wt in the permeate the enthalpy of vaporization was mainly contributed by water and the heat of evaporation of water was 42 48 43 78 kj mol in this temperature range lide 2004 the similar value between the enthalpy of vaporization and activation energy may suggest the predominant effect of the evaporation step in affecting the permeation flux there is no significant difference between the performances of the 200 masy and 200 msym membranes even though their matrix structures are different the 200 msym has a similar pore structure across the membrane while the 200 masy consists of two layers a top layer with similar structure as the 200 msym and the support layer with a larger pore size the asymmetric structure of 200 masy did not enhance the permeation flux and the reason could be laid on the fact that the evaporation step near the vapour liquid interface presented the predominant impact on the permeation rate on the other hand it was found that the 20 masy membrane exhibited a higher permeation flux compared to the 200 masy and 200 msym membranes despite its smaller pore size this can be explained by the higher surface porosity and smaller membrane thickness of the 20 masy membrane as the evaporation step had a strong effect on the permeation flux the total surface area of the vapour liquid interface may directly affect the total permeation flux as illustrated in fig 11 the inner surface porosity of the 20 asy membrane is 21 6 which is higher than the 200 sym and 200 asy membranes allowing a larger vapour liquid interface for vapour evaporation also the 20 asy membranes thickness of 0 75 mm were 17 thinner than the 200 sym membranes thickness of 0 9 mm which could in turn posed a lower mass transfer resistance to the permeation flux 3 2 3 24 hour performance in water dmso feed solution 24 hour vmd tests were conducted to study the stability of the membranes in solvent containing system the hydrophobic ceramic membranes were prepared through surface functionalization and their stability in md was highly dependent on the stability of the functionalization layer as shown in section 3 1 the wca and sca of the membranes remained high values even after immersing in dmso for a month besides that the membranes are more likely to suffer from membrane wetting in vmd compared to direct contact md because of the pressure gradient across the membranes rezaei et al 2018 if the membranes were wetted by the feed solution the arc shaped interface at the pore entrance will no longer be maintained the liquid would start to permeate through the membranes via a viscous flow and the dmso rejection would subsequently deteriorate during the experiments the 200 msym membranes were fed with 20 75 wt dmso and the vmd process was run for 24 hours for each concentration as shown in fig 12 the membrane presented consistent performance with no sign of wetting though there were some minor fluctuations the modified membranes were able to maintain an average rejection at higher than 95 the high rejection reflected that the membrane pores survived from wetting by the feed stream even when the dmso concentration in the feed was as high as 75 wt also the permeate flux kept reasonably stable in the whole experiment period which was in accordance with the results of previous tests when the dmso concentrations were lower than 50 wt the average flux was higher than 4 7 kg m 2 h 1 3 3 separation performance of other types of membranes currently there are limited types of membranes that can be used for sr md due to the lack of solvent resistance of most polymeric membranes commonly used md membranes such as pvdf membrane fabricated by phase inversion method cannot withstand strong solvents such as dmso and nmp tan and rodrigue 2019a meanwhile the pp and ptfe membranes mainly fabricated by melt spinning cold stretching or thermally induced phase separation methods tan and rodrigue 2019b can be potentially used for sr md because they have both high hydrophobicity and excellent chemical resistance therefore in this study we also used commercial ptfe hollow fibres for water dmso separation ptfe membrane with similar pore size bubble point pore size 361 nm and mean pore size 112 nm was tested and results are shown in figure 13 the membrane showed a much lower permeation flux 2 6 kg m 2 h 1 compared to the modified ceramic membranes at feed concentration of 50 wt furthermore the membrane started to wet when the feed dmso concentration was increased to 85 wt the fast wetting of ptfe membranes could be due to the large pore size distribution resulting from the stretching method used in the membrane fabrication tan and rodrigue 2019b in this study we also tested the commercial hybrid silica hybsi ar membranes used in the pv process to compare the efficiency of vmd and pv in separating water dmso mixtures as shown in fig 13 vmd membranes showed great superiority in permeate flux which was 156 and 588 higher than that of pv process when treating 50 and 85 wt dmso with the 20 masy membrane respectively the dmso rejection of vmd was as great as pv 98 when the feed dmso concentration was 50 wt however when the feed concentration was 85 wt the rejection of the 20 masy and 200 msym membranes dropped to 86 3 and 88 4 respectively while the rejection of pv remained high at 95 6 pv is hardly restricted by the vapour liquid equilibrium at the interface and the more selective sorption step contributed to the high dmso rejection at high feed concentration guo et al 2004 however the permeation flux was significantly lower as diffusion through the dense pv membranes was much slower than knudsen diffusion in summary sr md has been demonstrated to be a promising separation process to separate water dmso effectively the modified ceramic membranes exhibited a high permeation flux for a wide range of dmso feed concentrations and they also showed rejection higher than 90 when the feed concentration was lower than 85 wt water with low organic content can be produced on the permeate side and it can then undergo a simple secondary purification process for further processing before reuse or discharge for example dmso content in the permeate is smaller than the bioreactor limit 0 10 0 15 wt when the dmso concentration in the sr md feed stream is lower than 20 wt the permeate product can be sent directly to the bioreactor where dmso will be degraded completely at the same time the sr md process can dehydrate and concentrate dmso in a diluted feed stream making it more viable for reuse in manufacturing the application of sr md is not limited to water dmso separation but can potentially be used to treat wastewater containing other organic solvents that have a high boiling point 150 c like nmp and some typical degradation resistant solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide kong et al 2019 peng et al 2018 to give an example the 20 masy membrane was tested with a 50 wt nmp feed stream at 60 c and showed excellent rejection of 96 4 0 3 and separation factor of 53 9 4 2 with high flux of 7 3 0 2 kg m 2 h 1 therefore the treatment strategy involving sr md can be extended to treat more complicated industrial feeds containing various organic solvents 4 conclusions hydrophilic ceramic membranes were successfully transformed into hydrophobic ones by chemical grafting of fas f17 and the analysis showed that the hydrophobic modification was stable even after immersing in pure dmso over 30 days the modified ceramic membranes were subsequently used in sr md to separate water dmso mixtures the membranes kept unwetted and showed excellent performance in vmd tests using feed streams with a wide range of dmso concentrations 3 5 85 wt especially the separation factor was as high as 284 at feed concentration of 3 5 wt dmso and stayed constant at about 170 at feed concentration of 20 65 wt dmso in comparison the commercial ptfe md membranes failed to resist the penetration of feed containing 85 wt dmso additionally all the modified ceramic membranes could maintain a rejection higher than 98 when treating 50 wt dmso solution which was at the same level as the commercial pv membrane tested the permeation flux of 20 masy membranes was also much higher 156 and 588 higher than that of pv process when treating 50 and 85 wt of dmso respectively the separation performance of sr md was found strongly dependent on the vapour liquid equilibrium near the interface and the permeation flux was predominantly affected by the evaporation step this study demonstrates that sr md can be a promising technique to treat complex wastewater containing organic solvents declaration of competing interest we wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge funding support from the singapore economic development board to the singapore membrane

17048,the treatment of organic waste or wastewater with high organic solvent content has been challenging in industries as it cannot be done effectively using conventional wastewater treatment technologies such as biodegradation and advanced oxidation process solvent resistant membrane distillation sr md was proposed as an energy efficient alternative to treat these waste streams but its application is hampered by the lack of solvent resistant membranes and there is a research gap in studying the feeds with water solvent mixtures in this work ceramic tubular membranes with different pore sizes and structures were molecularly grafted with 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane to obtain hydrophobic ceramic membranes for sr md the modified membranes exhibited excellent hydrophobicity and solvent resistant properties and they were tested for sr md performance with a wide range of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso feed concentrations from 3 5 to 85 wt the membranes exhibited a high dmso rejection of 98 and the separation factor of 170 with permeation flux 4 4 kg m 2 h 1 when the dmso concentration in feed was below 65 wt the separation performance was found strongly dependent on the evaporation step and the vapour liquid equilibrium near the interface the dmso rejection was also comparable to pervaporation while the permeation flux was much higher at the feed concentration of 50 wt this study establishes the strategy of using sr md as a promising membrane process in treating complex industrial wastes with high organic solvent content graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solvent resistant membrane distillation water dmso separation ceramic membranes hydrophobic modification industrial wastes 1 introduction organic solvents have been widely used in chemical and pharmaceutical industries for chemical syntheses and product purification firestone and gospe 2009 the solvents normally cannot be reused after one process cycle without a proper treatment as a high solvent purity is required in most of the processes seyler et al 2006 therefore a large amount of organic wastes is generated and many of these waste streams also contain a significant amount of water the treatment of organic waste or wastewater with high organic solvent content is challenging as it cannot be done effectively using the conventional chemical or biological methods while the incineration of the waste is not a green pathway a typical example is dimethyl sulfoxide dmso which is considered as a comparatively green dipolar aprotic organic solvent because of its low toxicity and good stability alder et al 2016 xiang et al 2017 dmso has been frequently used as a reactant or a reaction medium in the production of pharmaceuticals due to its strong solubility to numerous chemical compounds and good miscibility with many organic solvents and water mountford 2010 however high concentration of dmso remaining in the pharmaceutical waste streams is often a challenge to the conventional sewage plants both chemical and biological treatments carry their drawbacks the advanced oxidation process such as fenton oxidation is costly while the biological treatment is inhibited by the toxic intermediate products and releases unpleasant odour from dimethyl sulfide cheng et al 2009 he et al 2011 in fact wastewater with high dmso content is difficult to be treated in bioreactor because of the biological effect caused by the invasion of dmso into microorganisms smallwood 2002 the upper limit of dmso concentration for microbial acclimation in biological process is often reported in the range of 0 10 0 15 wt cheng et al 2019 hwang et al 2012 yang and myint 2003 meanwhile incineration is another common method used to treat these wastes but it has a large carbon footprint and a risk of releasing harmful gases and particulates into the atmosphere chea et al 2020 seyler et al 2006 for these issues the separation of solvent water mixtures is important to reduce the volume and improve the treatability of solvent containing waste streams distillation is a common industrial process to separate water and organic solvents with high water miscibility kolesnichenko et al 2019 ravikumar et al 2013 smallwood 2002 in this process the feed is heated to a temperature close to the boiling point and a huge amount of energy is required for this conventional separation process sometimes more than one column may be required to achieve desirable product quality in the case of water dmso mixtures the reboiler temperature of distillation column was reported to be around 120 150 c even when operating under vacuum horváth et al 2017 in addition the high temperature in distillation may accelerate the hydrolysis of some solvents such as dimethyl formamide and dimethylacetamide where the hydrolysed products can result in azeotrope problem to the distillation process smallwood 2002 therefore an energy efficient separation process is highly desirable to treat organic waste streams that contain water and organic solvents the separation process can reclaim clean water recycle valuable solvents or concentrate the waste streams for secondary treatment membrane based separation is an emerging technology that has been widely used in wastewater treatment however the commonly used pressure driven membrane process could not separate water solvent mixtures effectively due to the similar size between water and solvents and the high osmotic pressure fane et al 2011 instead thermally driven membrane processes such as pervaporation pv and membrane distillation md could be used the pv has been applied to separate water and a wide range of solvents such as alcohols aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon etc saw et al 2019 the pv process is governed by selective sorption and diffusion of species via non porous membranes and it has an unique strength in separating azeotrope mixtures or mixtures with close boiling points mountford 2010 generally organophilic pv membranes favour the permeation of organic solvents enabling the extraction of solvents while hydrophilic pv membranes are suitable to reclaim water from water solvent mixtures hydrophobic pv membranes made of cross linked poly dimethyl siloxane poly methyl hydrogen siloxane were reported to remove dmso from water a separation factor of 57 can be achieved at 70 c for feed organic concentration of 10 wt while the dmso flux was 0 5 kg m 2 h 1 hosseini and ameri 2017 on the other hand perfluoropolymer based membranes were studied for the dehydration of dmso aqueous solution tang and sirkar 2012 a separation factor over 1000 was reported for the dehydration of 90 wt dmso at 30 c but the water permeation flux was only 0 0098 kg m 2 h 1 as it can be seen pv membranes often have low permeation flux as the mass transfer is restricted by the low diffusion rate in the dense membranes in fact md is also a potential membrane technology for separating water solvent mixtures porous hydrophobic membranes are used in the md process and the permeation was driven by the vapour pressure gradient across the membrane this non isothermal membrane process has been extensively studied to reclaim water from various aqueous effluents including saline water deka et al 2019 radioactive wastewater jia et al 2018 produced water chew et al 2019 and blackish groundwater dao et al 2016 in addition to separating water from non volatile compounds like inorganic salts the application of md can be further expanded to separate water solvent mixtures based on their difference in vapour pressure it can be used to separate water from solvents with a high boiling point such as dimethylacetamide 165 c dmso 189 c and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone 202 c as they have a lower vapor pressure compared to water for instance the vapour pressure of pure dmso is only 0 7 kpa while that of water is 19 9 kpa at 60 c nishimura et al 1972 thus the vapour condensed subsequently on the permeate side of the md membrane will have a low dmso proportion in order to successfully utilize solvent resistant membrane distillation sr md hydrophobic membranes with an excellent chemical stability are required among all the polymeric membranes polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polypropylene pp membranes have strong chemical resistance and high hydrophobicity gupta et al recently developed carbon nanotube immobilized ptfe membranes for the separation of 5 15 vol isopropyl alcohol ipa from an aqueous solution via sweeping gas md ipa with a higher vapour pressure permeated through the membranes faster but the separation factor was fairly low below 13 due to the small difference in the vapour pressure for ipa and water gupta et al 2018 besides that pp membranes were applied in the dehydration of n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp through vacuum md vmd the membranes exhibited a high water permeation flux of 9 5 l m 2 h 1 and a rejection of 98 when the feed contained 10 wt nmp at 80 c shao et al 2014 despite its potential in separating solvent water mixtures sr md processes are less studied as compared to the pv because of the limited availability of sr md membranes both ptfe and pp membranes with appropriate pore sizes are difficult to fabricate using common membrane fabrication techniques feng et al 2018 tan and rodrigue 2019b furthermore the stability of the polymeric membranes has not been extensively studied and the solvent concentration range tested by far was relatively narrow in comparison ceramic membranes have natural advantages for sr md because of their intrinsic solvent resistant property and good stability in harsh environment which means they hardly swell or dissolve in organic solvents like polymeric membrane substrates chong and wang 2019 marchetti et al 2014 however hydrophobic modification is necessary to transform their hydrophilic nature resulted from the rich hydroxyl groups on the membrane surface surface grafting is the most commonly used method to modify the surface functional groups of ceramic membranes and many compounds have been previously studied among them fluoroalkylsilane fas is widely used because of the low surface energy of fluoroalkyl compounds lu et al 2019 the fas compound consists of three hydrolysable groups which can react with hydroxyl groups on ceramic membranes to form strong covalent bonds and a fluoroalkane chain that can provide hydrophobic character to the membranes wei and li 2009 hendren et al studied ceramic membranes modified by fas trichloromethylsilane and trimethyl chlorosilane and they found that fas modified membrane had a higher flux and better resistance to chlorine hendren et al 2009 compared to other silane agents without fluorocarbon chain or with a short fluoroalkyl chain a fas agent with a longer fluoroalkyl chain imparts better wetting resistance property to the anodized aluminium oxide membranes li et al 2020 modified hydrophobic ceramic membranes have been studied for various applications such as md hubadillah et al 2019b membrane contactor abdulhameed et al 2017 lin et al 2016 and ultrafiltration ke et al 2013 for md application hydrophobic ceramic membranes were used for desalination heavy metal removal as well as voc removal cerneaux et al 2009 chen et al 2018 garcía fernández et al 2017 huang et al 2018 hubadillah et al 2019a kujawa et al 2019 kujawski et al applied modified ceramic membranes to separate dilute ethyl acetate solution with a concentration up to 4 wt kujawski et al 2016 the performance of md was found to be comparable with pv and the separation factor of ethyl acetate was in the range of 32 60 besides separating light solvents hydrophobic ceramic membranes can potentially be used to separate water from heavy solvents through sr md nevertheless the application of sr md in a broader solvent concentration and for a longer operating time is still understudied in this work we proposed sr md as a novel and effective alternative for separating water from solvents with high boiling points dmso was selected in this study because of its relatively low toxicity and increasing use in the industry alder et al 2016 xiang et al 2017 hydrophobic ceramic membranes were modified by grafting fas onto the substrates and then their performance in water dmso separation was examined by a series of vmd experiments the effects of feed concentration temperature and membrane structure were studied in order to understand the separation and transport mechanisms in the sr md process moreover a commercial pv membrane was used to separate the water dmso feed stream and the results were compared with the counterparts of the sr md process this study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of sr md in separating water dmso mixtures over a wide range of dmso concentrations and facilitate sr md applications for other water solvent systems associated with high boiling point solvents 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals three types of alumina ceramic tubular membranes from coorstek b v netherlands were used as the membrane substrates they were named as 20 asy 200 asy 200 sym according to their pore size 20 or 200 nm and matrix structures symmetric or asymmetric as illustrated in fig 1 the alumina substrates have an average outer diameter of 4 5 mm and an average inner diameter of 3 mm hydrophobic ptfe hollow fibre membranes were kindly supplied by a commercial company and hybrid silica hybsi ar tubular membranes were purchased from pervatech b v netherlands they were tested for md and pv as a comparative study dmso was purchased from merck millipore singapore 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane c16h19f17o3si 97 fas f17 methanol ch3oh 99 9 were bought from sigma aldrich singapore all chemicals were used as received deionized water was produced by a milli q system of merck millipore usa 2 2 hydrophobic grafting of ceramic membranes the hydrophobic grafting of ceramic membranes is similar to the method reported by other research groups koonaphapdeelert and li 2007 kujawski et al 2007 firstly the virgin ceramic membranes were immersed in an ultrasonic water bath for at least 10 min to remove contaminants beforehand after drying in an oven at 60 c for overnight the ceramic membranes were then immersed into the grafting solution at 30 c for 2 h which was prepared by dissolving 2 wt fas f17 in methanol then the membranes were washed in an ultrasonic methanol bath followed by drying in air for 1 h and in an oven at 110 c for 1 h after taking out from the oven the same grafting and drying processes were conducted once again to enhance the grafting efficiency the modified membranes were named as 20 masy 200 masy and 200 msym accordingly the schematic of grafting reaction among the fas f17 molecules and ceramic membranes is shown in fig 2 2 3 membrane characterizations the morphologies of the pristine and modified membranes were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jsm 7200f jeol japan the measurement of membrane surface porosity was calculated based on the graph of surface morphology with a magnification of 30 000 times the inner surface roughness of modified membranes was captured by an atomic force microscope afm nx 100 park systems republic of korea through a non contact mode the average pore size and distribution of the membranes were tested by a capillary flow porometer cfp 1500a porous material inc usa ipa was used to fill the membranes pores before measurement and nitrogen was used as the pressurised gas to replace the entrapped ipa in order to examine the grafting reaction occurred on ceramic membranes the 20 asy and 20 masy were tested by x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps axis supra kratos analytical japan with monochromatic al kα x ray source hv 1486 6 ev the water contact angles wca and solvent contact angles sca of the modified membranes were tested through the sessile drop method by a goniometer contact angle system oca 15ec dataphysics germany water or pure dmso droplets were dropped onto the inner surface of membranes and then the droplets were allowed to stabilize for 3 min before measurement afterwards the display was captured by a camera and the contact angles were defined by the tangent lines of the droplet and the inner circle of membranes in addition to evaluate the linkage stability of the hydrophobic chains on the membranes the contact angles tests were performed after the modified membranes were immersed in pure dmso at room temperature for 14 and 30 days respectively liquid entry pressure lep was tested in order to evaluate the entry pressure of feed liquid flooding the membrane pores lepw and leps indicate the entry pressure of water and pure dmso respectively the measurement of lep was performed in a dead end configuration where the hollow fibre was connected to a pressure vessel filled with water or dmso during the tests the pressure supplied by compressed n2 gas was increased with 2 psi every 5 min rose bengal was used to stain the tested liquid to give it red colour when the first drop of water or dmso appeared on the outer surface of ceramic membranes the pressure was recorded as the lepw and leps respectively 2 4 vmd performance tests in water dmso solution a series of vmd tests were conducted on the modified ceramic membranes and the diagram of the setup used is shown in fig 3 membrane modules with an effective length of 0 18 m were used in this study during the vmd tests the feed solution was heated up to 60 c in a heating jacket tank and circulated by a peristaltic pump masterflex cole parmer usa with a flow rate of 170 ml min 1 through the lumen of the membranes a vacuum condensation system was applied in the shell side of the membranes to control the vacuum level at 5 kpa the generated permeate stream was extracted from the system by a vacuum pump rv3 edwards uk and was condensed in a glass condenser cooled by liquid nitrogen the collected product was weighted by a mass balance and its dmso concentration was measured by a gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector gc fid 7890 gc system agilent technologies usa the permeate flux j was calculated by eq 1 1 j m a δ t m π d l δ t where m is the mass of the collected product a is the effective area of the membrane δ t is the time interval d is the inner diameter of the membrane l is the effective length of membrane contacting feed stream the separation performance was evaluated by dmso rejection r and separation factor α which were presented as eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 2 r 1 c p c f 100 3 α y w y s o l x w x s o l where c p and c f are the dmso concentrations of the permeate and the feed stream y w and y s o l are the weight fractions of water and dmso in permeate x w and x s o l are the weight fractions of water and dmso in feed respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface hydrophobic modification of ceramic membranes three types of ceramic tubular membranes were used as the substrate 20 asy 200 asy and 200 sym and their pristine properties were first examined before the hydrophobic modification figs 4 a and 4b show the characterization of their pore sizes the 200 sym and 200 asy membranes have an average pore size of 228 and 218 nm respectively and a fairly narrow pore size distribution the 20 asy membrane has a much smaller average pore size which is hardly measured using the gas liquid porometry instead the molecular weight cut off mwco was evaluated by measuring the dextran rejection the 20 asy membrane has an mwco of 94 kda and the pore size was estimated to be about 12 8 nm ren et al 2006 fig 4c shows their structure characteristics the 200 sym membrane has a homogeneous pore structure while the 200 asy and 20 asy membranes have a surface layer of about 20 and 10 μm respectively the inner surface morphologies of the modified membranes 200 msym 200 masy and 20 masy are shown in fig 5 compared with the pristine membranes shown in fig 4c it can be concluded that the surface morphologies had no significant change after the chemical grafting as the grafting step only imparted a molecular layer of perfluorinated chains to the membrane surface similar observations were reported in previous studies associated with fas f17 grafting garcía fernández et al 2017 koonaphapdeelert and li 2007 zhong et al 2017 xps scan was carried out to analyse the elements on the surfaces of the 20 asy 20 masy and 20 masy 30d membranes the 20 masy 30d refers to the sample that has been immersed in pure dmso for 30 days to evaluate the stability of the hydrophobic modification as shown in fig 6 the 20 masy membrane spectra clearly shows the characteristic peaks of silicon si and fluoride f in addition to carbon c oxygen o and aluminium al while the 20 asy membranes are lack of si and f element it suggests the successful grafting of fas f17 koonaphapdeelert and li 2007 for the o signals both si o bonds and oxygen in al2o3 lattice can be detected at the range of 531 6 and 533 2 ev respectively furthermore the 20 masy 30d membrane has similar characteristic peaks and spectrum as the 20 masy membrane indicating good stability of the hydrophobic grafting to determine the surface wettability of the grafted membranes the contact angles of the membranes were tested and the results are depicted in fig 7 it can be seen that the newly modified 0 d 200 masy and 200 msym membranes have similar wca 150 and sca 118 the lower sca was ascribed to the lower surface tension of dmso compared to water lide 2004 meanwhile the 20 masy membrane possesses slightly smaller contact angles than the membranes with larger pore sizes but still shows high hydrophobicity though the grafting method used in all three membranes was identical the difference in the apparent contact angles of hydrophobic surfaces could be contributed by the difference in surface roughness table 1 shows the surface roughness parameters of three modified membranes obtained from afm the 200 masy and 200 msym membranes have much higher surface roughness which can contribute to higher apparent contact angles than the 20 masy membranes moreover the grafted membranes also show good stability in solvent environment evidenced by the stable contact angles after immersing in pure dmso for 14 and 30 days although there were slight decrements all modified membranes maintained good hydrophobicity with wca 144 and sca 110 after 30 days the results of lepw and leps in table 1 are in good agreement with the contact angle tests before hydrophobic grafting the ceramic membranes are extremely hydrophilic and both water and dmso would disperse and penetrate into the pores quickly however after the grafting process the modified membranes possess high lepw 30 psi and leps 12 psi which are much higher than the operating pressure in sr md the good hydrophobicity and high liquid entry barrier can prevent the modified membranes from being wetted by the feed solution especially when the feed contains high concentration of solvent 3 2 vmd performance in water dmso system 3 2 1 feed stream with various dmso concentrations to study the feasibility of applying the modified ceramic membranes for sr md to separate water dmso mixtures the 200 msym membranes were first tested with 3 5 85 wt dmso feed streams at 60 c as depicted in fig 8 a the membrane showed high permeate flux of 7 3 kg m 2 h 1 at dmso concentration of 3 5 wt and the rejection could reach as high as 99 7 however both the permeate flux and the solvent rejection decreased with increasing dmso concentration in the feed the permeate flux and dmso rejection was only 1 7 kg m 2 h 1 and 88 4 respectively when feed dmso concentration was 85 wt fig 8b indicates the impact of feed dmso concentration on the permeate purity and the separation factor generally when dmso in the feed stream became more concentrated the dmso concentration in the permeate increased slightly too this trend became more distinct when the dmso concentration in the feed was higher than 65 wt as for the separation factor it reached the best value of 284 4 at 3 5 wt and remained fairly constant at about 170 when the feed dmso concentration was between 20 and 65 wt nevertheless it decreased significantly when the feed concentration was higher than 65 wt to understand the behaviours of water and dmso permeation through the membranes the transport mechanisms of water and dmso need to be analysed during the md separation process a vapour liquid interface was formed on the membrane surface as illustrated in fig 9 the feed solution underwent an evaporative phase change near the pore entrance and the vapour transported across the membrane under the effect of the partial pressure difference p1 p0 here p0 was close to zero because of the applied vacuum and the vapour permeation was highly dependent on the partial pressure near the vapour liquid interface different from vmd in desalination where the solute is non volatile both water and dmso will evaporate at the vapour liquid interface nevertheless the vmd process could still effectively separate water from dmso because of the considerably higher saturated pressure of pure water which is 19 9 kpa compared to 0 7 kpa of pure dmso at 60 c nishimura et al 1972 however when the dmso concentration increased in the feed solution the partial pressure of dmso near the interface increased too leading to the lower rejection at the same time the total vapour pressure of the mixture decreased as the proportion of water in the feed became smaller resulting in the flux reduction to evaluate the separation performance of vmd theoretical values of dmso concentration in permeate and dmso rejection were estimated based on the raoult s law by assuming the gas mixture was ideal the vapour pressure of the pure substance was calculated from antoine empirical equation the dmso mass composition of the permeate can be obtained by eq 4 and the rejection was then calculated using eq 2 4 c p e s t x s o l p s o l m s x s o l p s o l m s x w p w m w where x s o l and x w are the liquid mole fraction p s o l and p w are the vapour pressure of pure substance m s and m w are the molecular mass of dmso and water respectively accordingly when the feed dmso concentration increases from 3 5 to 85 wt the dmso component in the vapour phase will increase from 0 1 to 16 6 wt and the dmso rejection will decrease from 96 4 to 80 4 nonetheless the actual dmso rejection in the experiments was much higher than the estimation only reduced from 99 7 to 88 4 wt to understand the reason behind the diffusion of vapour molecules in the membrane pores should be considered in addition to the evaporation of feed stream at the interfaces in the case of vmd the mean free path of transporting molecules was much higher than the membrane pore sizes thus the diffusion phase was dominated by the knudsen model which emphasizes the interactions between molecules and membrane pore walls schofield et al 1990 knudsen diffusion favours the transport of smaller molecules water so it has a positive effect on the transportation of water although the hydrophobic interaction was weak in gas vapour phase the hydrophobic tails of dmso molecules may still have affinity to the hydrophobic membrane walls and parts of dmso may be attached on the membrane surface during the collision and thus slowing down the transport to the permeate side as a result the dmso rejection in the vmd process could exceed the estimated value the extent of transcendence would be even higher if the tortuosity of the membrane pores was considered 3 2 2 effects of feed temperature and membrane structure to explore the impact of the feed temperature on the membrane performance vmd tests were carried out with a 50 wt dmso feed solution at temperature ranging from 30 to 60 c three different types of membranes 200 masy 200 msym and 20 masy were tested and the effects of membrane pore size and structure were also studied as shown in fig 10 a the permeation fluxes of all three membranes improved consistently with the increasing temperature the 20 masy exhibited the highest permeation flux among them where the flux increased from 1 5 kg m 2 h 1 at 30 c to 6 9 kg m 2 h 1 at 60 c the increase of permeation flux could be explained by the higher vapour pressure generated at high temperature subsequently rendering a higher driving force of mass transfer at the same time all three membranes maintained a high rejection 98 of dmso with a separation factor higher than 105 as discussed in the previous section the rejection of dmso highly depends on the vapour pressure of both water and dmso at the vapour liquid interface for 50 wt liquid mixture the partial pressure of dmso increases from 0 02 to 0 1 kpa while the partial pressure of water increases from 3 5 to 16 1 kpa when the temperature rises from 30 to 60 c nishimura et al 1972 though the percentage of increase in vapour pressure of dmso was higher than water the vapour pressure was still much lower than water and therefore a high rejection of dmso could still be maintained to further understand the effect of temperature ln j versus t 1 was plotted in fig 10b the linear relationship indicates that the permeation fluxes increase exponentially with increasing temperature following the arrhenius type equation the activation energy can be calculated and it ranges from 38 0 43 6 kj mol the activation energy is a combination of the enthalpy of vaporization and energy of diffusion huang et al 2014 water is the main component in the vapour phase at the vapour liquid equilibrium as shown in the rejection data where the concentration of dmso was less than 1 wt in the permeate the enthalpy of vaporization was mainly contributed by water and the heat of evaporation of water was 42 48 43 78 kj mol in this temperature range lide 2004 the similar value between the enthalpy of vaporization and activation energy may suggest the predominant effect of the evaporation step in affecting the permeation flux there is no significant difference between the performances of the 200 masy and 200 msym membranes even though their matrix structures are different the 200 msym has a similar pore structure across the membrane while the 200 masy consists of two layers a top layer with similar structure as the 200 msym and the support layer with a larger pore size the asymmetric structure of 200 masy did not enhance the permeation flux and the reason could be laid on the fact that the evaporation step near the vapour liquid interface presented the predominant impact on the permeation rate on the other hand it was found that the 20 masy membrane exhibited a higher permeation flux compared to the 200 masy and 200 msym membranes despite its smaller pore size this can be explained by the higher surface porosity and smaller membrane thickness of the 20 masy membrane as the evaporation step had a strong effect on the permeation flux the total surface area of the vapour liquid interface may directly affect the total permeation flux as illustrated in fig 11 the inner surface porosity of the 20 asy membrane is 21 6 which is higher than the 200 sym and 200 asy membranes allowing a larger vapour liquid interface for vapour evaporation also the 20 asy membranes thickness of 0 75 mm were 17 thinner than the 200 sym membranes thickness of 0 9 mm which could in turn posed a lower mass transfer resistance to the permeation flux 3 2 3 24 hour performance in water dmso feed solution 24 hour vmd tests were conducted to study the stability of the membranes in solvent containing system the hydrophobic ceramic membranes were prepared through surface functionalization and their stability in md was highly dependent on the stability of the functionalization layer as shown in section 3 1 the wca and sca of the membranes remained high values even after immersing in dmso for a month besides that the membranes are more likely to suffer from membrane wetting in vmd compared to direct contact md because of the pressure gradient across the membranes rezaei et al 2018 if the membranes were wetted by the feed solution the arc shaped interface at the pore entrance will no longer be maintained the liquid would start to permeate through the membranes via a viscous flow and the dmso rejection would subsequently deteriorate during the experiments the 200 msym membranes were fed with 20 75 wt dmso and the vmd process was run for 24 hours for each concentration as shown in fig 12 the membrane presented consistent performance with no sign of wetting though there were some minor fluctuations the modified membranes were able to maintain an average rejection at higher than 95 the high rejection reflected that the membrane pores survived from wetting by the feed stream even when the dmso concentration in the feed was as high as 75 wt also the permeate flux kept reasonably stable in the whole experiment period which was in accordance with the results of previous tests when the dmso concentrations were lower than 50 wt the average flux was higher than 4 7 kg m 2 h 1 3 3 separation performance of other types of membranes currently there are limited types of membranes that can be used for sr md due to the lack of solvent resistance of most polymeric membranes commonly used md membranes such as pvdf membrane fabricated by phase inversion method cannot withstand strong solvents such as dmso and nmp tan and rodrigue 2019a meanwhile the pp and ptfe membranes mainly fabricated by melt spinning cold stretching or thermally induced phase separation methods tan and rodrigue 2019b can be potentially used for sr md because they have both high hydrophobicity and excellent chemical resistance therefore in this study we also used commercial ptfe hollow fibres for water dmso separation ptfe membrane with similar pore size bubble point pore size 361 nm and mean pore size 112 nm was tested and results are shown in figure 13 the membrane showed a much lower permeation flux 2 6 kg m 2 h 1 compared to the modified ceramic membranes at feed concentration of 50 wt furthermore the membrane started to wet when the feed dmso concentration was increased to 85 wt the fast wetting of ptfe membranes could be due to the large pore size distribution resulting from the stretching method used in the membrane fabrication tan and rodrigue 2019b in this study we also tested the commercial hybrid silica hybsi ar membranes used in the pv process to compare the efficiency of vmd and pv in separating water dmso mixtures as shown in fig 13 vmd membranes showed great superiority in permeate flux which was 156 and 588 higher than that of pv process when treating 50 and 85 wt dmso with the 20 masy membrane respectively the dmso rejection of vmd was as great as pv 98 when the feed dmso concentration was 50 wt however when the feed concentration was 85 wt the rejection of the 20 masy and 200 msym membranes dropped to 86 3 and 88 4 respectively while the rejection of pv remained high at 95 6 pv is hardly restricted by the vapour liquid equilibrium at the interface and the more selective sorption step contributed to the high dmso rejection at high feed concentration guo et al 2004 however the permeation flux was significantly lower as diffusion through the dense pv membranes was much slower than knudsen diffusion in summary sr md has been demonstrated to be a promising separation process to separate water dmso effectively the modified ceramic membranes exhibited a high permeation flux for a wide range of dmso feed concentrations and they also showed rejection higher than 90 when the feed concentration was lower than 85 wt water with low organic content can be produced on the permeate side and it can then undergo a simple secondary purification process for further processing before reuse or discharge for example dmso content in the permeate is smaller than the bioreactor limit 0 10 0 15 wt when the dmso concentration in the sr md feed stream is lower than 20 wt the permeate product can be sent directly to the bioreactor where dmso will be degraded completely at the same time the sr md process can dehydrate and concentrate dmso in a diluted feed stream making it more viable for reuse in manufacturing the application of sr md is not limited to water dmso separation but can potentially be used to treat wastewater containing other organic solvents that have a high boiling point 150 c like nmp and some typical degradation resistant solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide kong et al 2019 peng et al 2018 to give an example the 20 masy membrane was tested with a 50 wt nmp feed stream at 60 c and showed excellent rejection of 96 4 0 3 and separation factor of 53 9 4 2 with high flux of 7 3 0 2 kg m 2 h 1 therefore the treatment strategy involving sr md can be extended to treat more complicated industrial feeds containing various organic solvents 4 conclusions hydrophilic ceramic membranes were successfully transformed into hydrophobic ones by chemical grafting of fas f17 and the analysis showed that the hydrophobic modification was stable even after immersing in pure dmso over 30 days the modified ceramic membranes were subsequently used in sr md to separate water dmso mixtures the membranes kept unwetted and showed excellent performance in vmd tests using feed streams with a wide range of dmso concentrations 3 5 85 wt especially the separation factor was as high as 284 at feed concentration of 3 5 wt dmso and stayed constant at about 170 at feed concentration of 20 65 wt dmso in comparison the commercial ptfe md membranes failed to resist the penetration of feed containing 85 wt dmso additionally all the modified ceramic membranes could maintain a rejection higher than 98 when treating 50 wt dmso solution which was at the same level as the commercial pv membrane tested the permeation flux of 20 masy membranes was also much higher 156 and 588 higher than that of pv process when treating 50 and 85 wt of dmso respectively the separation performance of sr md was found strongly dependent on the vapour liquid equilibrium near the interface and the permeation flux was predominantly affected by the evaporation step this study demonstrates that sr md can be a promising technique to treat complex wastewater containing organic solvents declaration of competing interest we wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for

17049,invasive quagga mussels dreissena rostriformis bugensis are an emerging threat to the functioning and management of freshwater ecosystems quagga mussels were first recorded in the uk in 2014 and have subsequently established at high densities in a number of major reservoirs through implementing a progressive change bacips before after control impact paired series analysis we found that the following trends were observed following quagga mussel establishment reduced diatom and cyanobacteria abundances increased soluble reactive phosphorus and reactive silica concentrations and reduced abundances of aphanizomenon sp a potentially toxic cyanobacterium we also found reservoirs with established quagga mussel populations experienced slightly increased overall chlorophyll a concentration but no changes in turbidity or microcystis sp abundance which are often considered common indicators of dreissenid invasion our results show that progressive change bacips analysis is a powerful tool which can be used to interrogate industry standard long term datasets of water quality metrics in order to identify and quantify the impacts of invasive species when the approximate timeframe of species arrival is known we also demonstrate that quagga mussels may have had significant effects on reservoir ecosystems which primarily through their impacts on phytoplankton communities may have implications for reservoir management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords quagga mussel invasive species mussels water management reservoirs cyanobacteria 1 introduction the introduction of invasive non native species inns can have pronounced effects on the ecosystem services provided by reservoirs gallardo and aldridge 2020 for example the predatory fishhook water flea

algal blooms through reduced grazing pressure vanderploeg et al 2002 invasive non native bivalve molluscs such as zebra mussels dreissena polymorpha can reach densities of over 700 000 m 2 pathy 1994 and individually filter large volumes of water elliott et al 2008 these characteristics enable zebra mussels to drive especially dramatic change in algal and cyanobacterial dynamics sousa et al 2009 in a meta analysis of dreissenid impacts on freshwater systems it was shown that dreissenids significantly reduce overall phytoplankton abundances by 35 to 78 after invasion due to their filter feeding behaviour higgins and vander zanden 2010 this included significant reductions in cyanobacterial abundance of up to 58 which has also been noted in reservoir specific studies kirsch and dzialowski 2012 despite these overall reductions in cyanobacterial biomass there is a body of evidence that suggests in the presence of dreissenid mussels certain individual cyanobacterial species increase in abundance in some but not all ecosystems higgins and vander zanden 2010 particularly in north american lakes a pattern of increases in nuisance cyanobacteria such as microcystis aeruginosa have been observed raikow et al 2004 knoll et al 2008 it is thought that dreissenids may increase levels of toxic cyanobacteria through the mechanism of selective rejection whereby toxic or unpalatable phytoplankton are ejected by mussels in pseudofaeces where it can then be resuspended in the water column vanderploeg et al 2013 tang et al 2014 the quagga mussel dreissena rostriformis bugensis is an emerging inns which is rapidly spreading around the world as a result of its prolific biofouling characteristics karatayev et al 2007 in recent decades quagga mussels have displaced

there is a dearth of research of dreissenid impacts on man made reservoirs relative to other aquatic habitats which needs to be addressed kirsch and dzialowski 2012 thames water utilities thames water is responsible for the management of the reservoir network across southwest london and has collected standardised data on water quality parameters including abundance of algae and cyanobacteria for over three decades as the arrival and rapid population increase of quagga mussels can be attributed to a short window in time this provides an opportunity to employ a progressive change bacips before after control impact paired series design to interrogate this dataset to identify any potential effects of the recent quagga mussel invasion on key abiotic and biotic parameters bacips analysis is recognised as an effective and valuable method for evaluating both natural and anthropogenic perturbations on ecological variables when the treatment site cannot be randomly chosen stewart oaten et al

mutsert and cowan 2012 the bacips methodology allows the evaluation of both the before versus after measurements at impacted sites and the control sites versus impacted sites this is why bacips

scope of bacips analysis thiault et al 2017 wauchope et al 2021 whereas traditional bacips analyses assume that effects are sudden long lasting and constant i e exhibit a step change progressive change bacips allows for the identification of step linear asymptotic or sigmoid responses to an impact thiault et al 2017 2019 the aim of this study was to apply the progressive change bacips methodology to routinely collected reservoir water quality measurements in order to identify the potential abiotic and biotic impacts of quagga mussels in invaded reservoirs based on the observations expressed in the wider literature documenting ecosystem level shifts following quagga mussel invasions our research had several key hypotheses following quagga mussel invasion we expected to observe reductions in overall abundances of green algae cyanobacteria and diatoms as a result of mussel grazing activity higgins and vander zanden 2010 decreases in turbidity and chlorophyll a concentrations from reduced phytoplankton abundances higgins and vander zanden 2010 kirsch and dzialowski 2012 increases in abundance of toxin forming cyanobacteria as a result of the selective rejection of these species in mussel pseudofaeces raikow et al 2004 vanderploeg et al 2013 tang et al 2014 increases in reactive silica as sio2 as a result of reduced assimilation into diatom biomass as mussel grazing reduces diatom populations rockwell et al 2005 and increases in soluble reactive phosphorus srp and ammonium nh4 attributed to mussels excreting a high level of dissolved nutrients karatayev et al 2015 ozersky et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 the reservoirs data were collated from ten reservoirs located in southwest london situated within a 9 km radius queen mother reservoir 51 28 57 06 n 0 33 1 57 w wraysbury reservoir 51 27 41 26 n 0 31 31 40 w king george reservoir 51 26 59 44 n 0 30 9 63 w staines north reservoir 51 27 1 28 n 0 29 23 92 w staines south reservoir 51 26 38 95 n 0 29

and the island barn reservoir 51 23 27 26 n 0 21 51 89 w surveys to assess the presence and abundance of quagga mussels and zebra mussels were conducted at all reservoirs during 2015 aldridge 2015 surveys included inspection of marginal walls of reservoirs boat based dredging sampling on undersides of pontoons and marker buoys inspection of accessible underdrains and culverts and use of an rov camera data were complemented by data held by the uk environment agency aldridge 2015 queen mother and wraysbury reservoirs contained a high abundance of quagga mussels characterised by a continuous crust of mussels at least 2 cm thick across all submerged hard surfaces at 1 m depth the remaining reservoirs were either uninvaded or had very low abundances of zebra and or quagga mussels occasional individuals encountered but hard surfaces were 95 clear of mussels therefore the wraysbury and queen mother reservoirs were considered impacted sites and the remainder of the reservoirs were considered controls 2 2 selection of variables the following abiotic water quality metrics were selected for analysis in this study ammonium as nh4 mg l turbidity in formazin turbidity units ftu reactive silica as sio2 mg l and soluble reactive phosphorus srp as po4 mg l the biotic water quality metrics selected were chlorophyll a ug l average cyanobacteria abundance cells ml average green algae abundance cells ml and average diatom abundance cells ml common nuisance phytoplankton abundances cells ml of species known to cause toxic blooms under favourable conditions were also considered microcystis sp anabaena sp aphanizomenon sp and euglena sp zimba et al 2017 huisman et al 2018 2 3 estimation of algal cell abundance phytoplankton abundances were measured by thames water using a cell counting chamber and recorded by ascribing a rating on an acfor scale where abundant 20 cells mm2 common 20 cells mm2 frequent 21 100 cells per slide occasional 3 20 cells per slide and rare 1 2 cells per slide in order to estimate the abundance of algal cells denoted by the acfor scale ratings each ranking was normalised to represent the lowest bound of cells per ml which would be required to achieve each rating based on the use of a standard 9 mm2 cell counting chamber of 0 1mm depth therefore all phytoplankton abundance estimates represent the lowest possible cell numbers present 2 4 selection of study timeframe data from january 2001 until november 2018 were used for all variables this timeframe was selected because as of january 2001 weekly algae abundance data were collected from each reservoir to satisfy the paired sample criteria of the progressive change bacips methodology for each reservoir a monthly average value was calculated for each water quality metric in months for which only invaded or uninvaded reservoirs had data for a specific metric the data for that month were omitted the monthly averaged data were then averaged between impact sites queen mother and wraysbury reservoirs and control sites king george reservoir staines north and south reservoirs queen mary reservoir knight reservoir bessborough reservoir queen elizabeth reservoir and the island barn reservoir to create a paired dataset of monthly measurements for impact and control sites 2 5 assigning the impact date for progressive change bacips analysis the date of january 2014 was used in the analysis as the likely date of invasion aldridge et al 2014 estimate that the mussels arrived in the waterways surrounding the invaded reservoirs in late 2013 or early 2014 these dates of establishment are reinforced from observations in aldridge 2015 of populations dominated by year 1 and 2 quagga mussels and the absence of any dead shells in the wraysbury and queen mother reservoirs therefore measurements before january 2014 are considered to be before the impact and measurements from and including january 2014 are considered to be after the impact for the purposes of the progressive change bacips analysis 2 6 progressive change bacips analysis the data were analysed in order to identify both overall changes and seasonal changes which may arise as the result of quagga mussel invasion spring was designated as march to may summer was june to august autumn was september to november and winter was december to february the progressive change bacips was implemented following the methodology outlined by thiault et al 2017 figure s1 for each variable the difference δ was determined between the impact and paired control sites for each month the analysis assesses whether there is a significant change in δ for each variable from before and after the establishment of quagga mussels in 2014 unlike traditional bacips analysis which assumes and tests for a step change in δ this methodology compares how the data conforms to four competing models step change eq 1 linear eq 2 asymptotic eq 3 and sigmoid models eq 4 as for all bacips analysis the assumption is made that in the before period δ was stationary through time i e there was no consistent temporal trend in the difference between impact and control sites prior to the establishment of quagga mussels however after mussel establishment δ changed with time with an increase indicating a positive effect of mussel establishment and decreases indicating a negative effect the differences between an impact site and its control after the arrival of mussels δ after can be described as 1 step change response δ a f t e r i m δ b e f o r e ε i 2 linear response δ a f t e r i r t i δ b e f o r e ε i 3 asymptotic response δ a f t e r i m t l t δ b e f o r e ε i 4 sigmoid response δ a f t e r i m t l k 1 t l k δ b e f o r e ε i where t is time in years since 1 january 2001 associated with the i th sampling survey δbefore is the underlying spatial variation between the impact and control sites in the absence of quagga mussels estimated during the before period r and m are the rate of divergence and magnitude of change between the impact and control sites respectively l is the time required to reach half of the long term effect k is a scaling parameter in the sigmoid model that affects the steepness of the curve and ε is the error associated with the i th survey each candidate model was fitted setting the before data to have t 0 and the magnitude of the response to mussel establishment effect size was then measured based on the predictions of the best fit model highest aicc score after identifying the most appropriate model a glm was implemented with the prescribed interaction in order to estimate the effect size for step change interactions the effect size indicates the change in δ from before to after the impact for linear interactions the effect size indicates the average change in δ per year figure s1 as only step change and linear models were identified for the variables in this study the glm used a gaussian distribution and identity error distribution for seasonal trends the same methodology was followed however the data was partitioned so that only the data for the desired season was fitted to the models and subsequently analysed using glm the 95 confidence intervals for all significant effect sizes were calculated to ensure that they did not overlap zero therefore confirming that the effect size is significantly different from zero all analysis was performed in r studio v 1 1 442 r core team 2018 3 results the pattern of change in response to quagga mussel establishment for all variables demonstrating significant effect sizes supported either a linear change in which the difference between impact and control sites increased linearly with time since mussel establishment or a step change where an immediate shift was noted in the impact relative to the control site in no cases were asymptotic or sigmoidal models supported by the data for two variables winter average diatom abundance and overall srp concentration the likelihood ω of the second best model was comparable to the best fit model within 10 for consistency only the results of the best fit model are presented and are summarised in table 1 3 1 changes in abiotic

changes in δ for average abundances of green algae microcystis sp anabaena sp or euglena sp 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of quagga mussel establishment 4 1 1 diatom abundance and reactive silica an overall decline in diatom abundance by 1205 cells ml year was observed declining consistently in all seasons despite limited research on the specific impact of quagga mussels on diatom communities large quagga mussels 16 mm have been shown to demonstrate a grazing preference for colonial diatoms in mesocosm experiments tang et al 2014 in natural systems declines in diatom abundance have been linked to the establishment of zebra mussels in short term experiments in saginaw bay lake huron heath et al 1995 lavrentyev et al 1995 the increase in reactive silica concentrations in impacted reservoirs can likely be linked to the grazing activities of quagga mussels and removal of diatoms which incorporate silica into their cell walls frustules de tommasi et al 2017 reduced diatom abundances at impacted reservoirs may have reduced the usual levels of silica uptake from the environment for frustule formation leading to the observed positive step change in reactive silica concentrations noted in our study the same effect and seasonal changes were noted in lake erie following the invasion of zebra mussels with the greatest changes occurring in the spring and autumn nicholls et al 1997 rockwell et al 2005 which are the seasons when diatom blooms typically occur sigee 2005 4 1 2 cyanobacteria and aphanizomenon sp abundance overall average cyanobacterial abundance decreased by 604 cells ml year with the greatest decrease of 1655 cells ml year occurring in the autumn these results suggest that quagga mussel establishment acted to supress cyanobacterial abundance in invaded reservoirs in european studies quagga mussels have been suggested as management tools for harmful algal blooms in urban ponds where they have been shown to supress cyanobacterial abundance waajen et al 2016 similarly in both uk mesocosm experiments reynolds et al 2019 and in dutch lakes reeders and bij de vaate 1990 dionisio pires et al 2005 zebra mussels have been shown to supress overall cyanobacteria abundance equally they have been shown to remove a broad size range of cyanobacteria regardless of toxicity dionisio pires et al 2005 however particularly in the north american great lakes dreissenids have been linked to increases in cyanobacterial biomass particularly of the toxic bloom forming cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa vanderploeg et al 2001 nicholls et al 2002 pillsbury et al 2002 bierman et al 2005 conroy and culver 2005 naddafi et al 2007 only aphanizomenon sp of all the nuisance phytoplankton species included in our study demonstrated any significant changes in abundance following the invasion of quagga mussels decreasing by 1817 cells ml year on average with the greatest effect in the autumn in the uk aphanizomenon sp is often at its peak during the autumn months henderson et al 2008 which may explain why the greatest decrease relative to control reservoirs was during this season in recent mesocosm experiments the presence of aphanizomenon sp at bloom level concentrations was shown to negatively affect sperm motility veliger survival and fully inhibit spawning events in quagga mussels boegehold et al 2018 2019b 2019a active removal of aphanizomenon sp may serve to reduce overall exposure of the mussels to harmful cyanotoxins 4 1 3 chlorophyll a despite declines in diatom and cyanobacterial abundance no significant decline in chlorophyll a concentration was observed in fact overall average chlorophyll a concentration increased by an estimated 2 77 ug l with the biggest increase occurring in the winter research suggests this observation is not unusual even in shallow well mixed lakes such as lake shawano wisconsin where a 2 7 ug l increase in chlorophyll a concentration was observed post dreissenid invasion cha et al 2013 the winter increase in chlorophyll a concentration may be explained by seasonal declines in mussel clearance rates combined with the observed autumn rise in srp mesocosm studies have shown that winter clearance rates of quagga mussels are halved compared to the rest of the year diggins 2001 this could have led to increased overwintering of phytoplankton after quagga mussel establishment additionally our dataset does not encompass all algal species present in each reservoir as during routine data collection only the ten most abundant species were recorded therefore the overall increase in chlorophyll a may be driven by small cumulative increases in phytoplankton species of lower abundance that were not specifically recorded 4 1 4 green algae and nuisance phytoplankton species we hypothesised that green algae abundances would decline in impacted reservoirs due to the grazing activity of quagga mussels higgins and vander zanden 2010 however no effect was observed in our study impacts of zebra mussels on green algae are mixed some studies have expressed that zebra mussels avoid green algae in preference for other phytoplankton taxa naddafi et al 2007 fahnenstiel et al 2010 reynolds et al 2019 while others noted significant falls in green algae abundance heath et al 1995 kirsch and dzialowski 2012 quagga mussel clearance rate experiments have shown that green algae particularly species with thick cell walls are cleared at low rates and often rejected in pseudofaeces tang et al 2014 quagga mussels have also demonstrated preferential removal of large colonial diatoms and cyanobacteria species tang et al 2014 waajen et al 2016 in our study impacted reservoirs prior to invasion hosted abundances of cyanobacteria up to six times higher and diatom abundances up to seven times higher than green algae the high abundances of potentially preferential food sources in diatoms and cyanobacteria may explain why grazing impacts on green algae were not observed in our study moreover the low abundance of green algae in comparison to cyanobacteria and diatoms may have led them to be under represented in the data making it more difficult to tease out changes in their abundance our study did not identify an effect of quagga mussel establishment on potentially toxic microcystis sp anabaena sp or euglena sp abundance however other studies have noted increases in toxic algae abundance following dreissenid establishment potentially as a result of selective rejection of toxic cyanobacteria in mussel pseudofaeces raikow et al 2004 vanderploeg et al 2013 tang et al 2014 an effect on microcystis sp may not have been observed in our study as nuanced nutrient and strain dependant relationships have been noted between microcystis sp and dreissenids firstly in systems with total phosphorus levels of 25 ug l as was observed in all reservoirs in our study dreissenids were shown to have no effect on microcystis sp abundance raikow et al 2004 sarnelle et al 2005 secondly vanderploeg et al 2013 demonstrated extreme variance in the grazing response of zebra and quagga mussels to different strains of m aeruginosa observing significant differences in the uptake and rejection of m aeruginosa between laboratory strains and even strains from the same lake which could not be explained by toxicity or colony size in the case of anabaena sp tang et al 2014 observed that filamentous cyanobacteria such as anabaena and aphanizomenon sp were readily ingested by quagga mussels in mesocosm experiments in our study the filamentous cyanobacteria aphanizomenon sp which did experience a significant decline after quagga mussel establishment occurred at twice the density of anabaena sp within all reservoirs prior to quagga mussel invasion the lower abundance of anabaena sp in comparison with aphanizomenon sp could be responsible for the absence of an impact in our study finally in the case of euglena sp which is the only known green algae to produce a toxin zimba et al 2017 there are no studies which directly assess its relationship with dreissenids it may be that the specific potent toxin euglenophycin prevents euglena sp from being ingested by quagga mussels or that the motile nature of euglena sp allows it to occupy areas of the water column unaffected by the substrate fixed quagga mussels 4 1 5 turbidity declines in turbidity are widely reported as an impact of dreissenid invasion vanderploeg et al 2002 higgins and vander zanden 2010 karatayev et al 2015 however this was not observed in our study although dreissenids have been shown to reduce turbidity caused by phytoplankton biomass the impact of dreissenids on non algal turbidity is less well understood kirsch and dzialowski 2012 research suggests that zebra mussels are capable of removing some suspended solids from the water column however quagga mussel mesocosm experiments found that they had no significant impact on total suspended solids higgins and vander zanden 2010 mei et al 2016 therefore if the turbidity of a system is largely as a result of high abundances of suspended solids opposed to phytoplankton biomass quagga mussels may be unlikely to reduce the turbidity of the system the reservoirs we studied are fed from the river thames which experiences frequent high flow events which can result in high suspended sediment loads the results of our study suggest turbidity in the impacted reservoirs may have been driven by non algal suspended solids rather than phytoplankton biomass 4 1 6 soluble reactive phosphorus and ammonium the overall srp increase of 5 ug l year at impacted reservoirs can likely be tied to the grazing activities of quagga mussels as dreissenids play an important role in nutrient cycling vanderploeg et al 2002 the phosphorus associated with phytoplankton biomass is ingested by the mussels and although some phosphorus is retained as mussel biomass excess is remineralised and is excreted as po4 ozersky et al 2015 ozersky et al 2015 noted that quagga mussel srp excretion rates peaked in october at 16ug gram of shell free dry mass hour this previously observed seasonality of quagga mussel excretion rates may explain the 12 ug l year increase observed in invaded reservoirs in our study during the autumn srp excretion in zebra mussels is thought to be weight dependant with larger mussels excreting higher levels of srp this may help to explain the linear nature of the relationship as increasing densities and biomass of older larger mussels enhance nutrient cycling fishman et al 2009 it was hypothesised that ammonium concentrations may increase in invaded reservoirs as a result of the quagga mussels feeding behaviour returning nutrients stored in phytoplankton biomass to the water column through excretion of dissolved nutrients ozersky et al 2015 although ammonium concentrations have been shown to increase in some enclosure experiments containing quagga mussels no consistent effects have yet been recorded in natural systems higgins and vander zanden 2010 kirsch and dzialowski 2012 in many studies of natural systems and in our study measurements were constrained to a single location at a shallow depth this potentially makes it difficult to assess the degree of depth and spatial variation in nutrient cycling occurring within waterbodies ozersky et al 2015 dreissenids have been shown to redirect nutrients from offshore pelagic zones to nearshore benthic zones known as nearshore shunt hecky et al 2004 in our study the occurrence of nearshore shunt may have been obscured by the method of data collection 4 2 implications for reservoir management the results of our study indicate that quagga mussels may have impacts on recipient ecosystems that can be of both positive and negative value to reservoir managers and the ecosystem services provided there are several potentially beneficial effects of quagga mussel establishment for reservoir management firstly although reductions in diatom abundances are unlikely to have any significant effects on water quality as diatom blooms are rarely toxic reduced abundances may act to reduce filter blockages at water treatment plants henderson et al 2008 secondly reduced cyanobacteria abundance may improve water quality by reducing the risk of cyanotoxins entering the water supply cyanotoxins can be hazardous to human and animal health leading authorities to prevent access to waterbodies for recreational activities and potentially poisoning native fish birds and mammals world health organization 2003 graham et al 2010 hilborn and beasley 2015 huisman et al 2018 many cyanobacterial species including aphanizomenon sp are known to produce cyanotoxins which are a concern for human health deteriorate water taste and create unpleasant odours the majority of cyanotoxins remain even after mechanical filtration and have taste thresholds of only a few nanograms per litre graham et al 2010 world health organization 2017 thirdly reductions in cyanobacterial abundance may reduce the likelihood of harmful bloom events which can create anoxic water conditions waajen et al 2016 large blooms threaten the survival of all oxygen dependant species in the waterbody potentially affecting biodiversity and recreational value from fishing wolf et al 2017 finally when blooms die and are washed up on shorelines the decay creates a foul smell which further limits the recreational use of the waterbody nalepa 2010 therefore the observed declines in cyanobacterial biomass may reduce risks posed by cyanotoxins reduce the frequency of bloom events and associated risks to native biota while reducing the frequency of reservoir closures while declines in cyanobacteria and diatoms may potentially reduce some management burdens long term reductions in diatom abundances which are key contributors of primary production and a preferred high quality food source for primary consumers stenger kovács et al 2007 winder et al 2009 may have implications for the reservoir s wider ecology and may result in fundamental changes to nutrient and energy cycling shifting pelagic production to the benthos rowe et al 2015 quagga mussels compete directly with native species for phytoplankton resources as a result it has been observed that zooplankton biomass can decline by 40 after dreissenid invasion although this varies largely between waterbodies higgins and vander zanden 2010 additionally the arrival of dreissenid mussels in the north american great lakes led to declines in native fauna particularly of the benthic amphipod diporeia mckenna et al 2017 both zooplankton and amphipods are highly nutritious food for most benthic and demersal fish mckenna 2019 therefore quagga mussel invasion could have consequences for the health size and abundance of fish stocks in invaded systems any deleterious effects on fish stocks will negatively affect angling activities and may also have implications for piscivorous native and migratory waterfowl a further risk to native fish and bird species from the establishment of quagga mussels is the prospect of expediating invasional meltdown whereby the establishment of one inns can facilitate the establishment of an invader of common origin as they have co evolved under similar environmental conditions simberloff and von holle 1999 this is of particular concern for the sites identified in our study which are located in the south east of england an area identified as the highest risk of invasion by multiple ponto caspian species gallardo and aldridge 2015 facilitating the establishment of additional inns is likely to exacerbate any impacts of inns on existing communities and reduce the ability of invaded waterbodies to conserve native species it may be that in species rich reservoirs of high ecological and conservation value or where angling is of high priority quagga mussel reduction measures should be considered to limit their impact on the local biota and nutrient flows whereas in reservoirs deemed as ecologically deficient quagga mussels may bring beneficial changes through reductions in cyanobacteria abundance while we do not advocate for intentional introductions of quagga mussels with appropriate risk assessment and consultation with the relevant authorities there may be scenarios where maintenance of a quagga mussel population could be beneficial mclaughlan and aldridge 2013 waajen et al 2016 4 3 progressive change bacips analysis for informing reservoir management the progressive change bacips methodology provides a powerful tool which can be applied to routinely collected data collated by water resource managers this methodology can easily be applied to other reservoir systems hosting invasive dreissenid populations with a known arrival date to quantify their effects on the environment furthermore if the overall and seasonal changes observed in this study are found to be consistent across other known invaded reservoir systems they could serve as potentially useful indicators of dreissenid invasions in reservoirs where benthic biodiversity monitoring or water drawdowns are not performed regularly these potential indicators could include progressive declines in diatom and cyanobacteria abundances combined with an otherwise unexplained increase in srp progressive change bacips is not only informative in the context of invasive dreissenid populations but also allows investigation of other major perturbations which can be attributed to a time point these perturbations could include installation of new treatment processes pollution events water drawdowns fish introductions for angling and establishment of other high impact inns such as killer shrimps madgwick and aldridge 2011 understanding which aspects of the reservoir environment are being impacted and the magnitude of the effects will provide useful guidance for developing effective and desirable management strategies 5 conclusions we believe progressive change bacips should be more widely applied to help quantify impacts of inns especially in reservoir systems where extensive timeseries data are often routinely collected for reservoir management and currently represents a largely untapped resource invaded reservoirs observed declines in cyanobacterial abundance and the nuisance cyanobacterium aphanizomenon sp indicating that quagga mussels could perhaps be harnessed in depleted ecosystems to prevent cyanobacterial dominance and suppress harmful algal blooms in biologically diverse and pristine aquatic environments and those which provide recreational angling quagga mussels may have negative consequences for native biota through their removal of diatom species which are key primary producers and the preferential food source of most primary consumers this research helps to address the current dearth of literature focused on the direct observation of quagga mussels impacts in reservoir ecosystems as much of the existing research focuses on the impacts of quagga mussels on natural ecosystems or in laboratory based mesocosm studies declaration of

17049,invasive quagga mussels dreissena rostriformis bugensis are an emerging threat to the functioning and management of freshwater ecosystems quagga mussels were first recorded in the uk in 2014 and have subsequently established at high densities in a number of major reservoirs through implementing a progressive change bacips before after control impact paired series analysis we found that the following trends were observed following quagga mussel establishment reduced diatom and cyanobacteria abundances increased soluble reactive phosphorus and reactive silica concentrations and reduced abundances of aphanizomenon sp a potentially toxic cyanobacterium we also found reservoirs with established quagga mussel populations experienced slightly increased overall chlorophyll a concentration but no changes in turbidity or microcystis sp abundance which are often considered common indicators of dreissenid invasion our results show that progressive change bacips analysis is a powerful tool which can be used to interrogate industry standard long term datasets of water quality metrics in order to identify and quantify the impacts of invasive species when the approximate timeframe of species arrival is known we also demonstrate that quagga mussels may have had significant effects on reservoir ecosystems which primarily through their impacts on phytoplankton communities may have implications for reservoir management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords quagga mussel invasive species mussels water management reservoirs cyanobacteria 1 introduction the introduction of invasive non native species inns can have pronounced effects on the ecosystem services provided by reservoirs gallardo and aldridge 2020 for example the predatory fishhook water flea cercopagis pengoi native to the ponto caspian region of eastern europe has established in lakes and reservoirs in north america leading to declines in native zooplankton and knock on increases in algal blooms through reduced grazing pressure vanderploeg et al 2002 invasive non native bivalve molluscs such as zebra mussels dreissena polymorpha can reach densities of over 700 000 m 2 pathy 1994 and individually filter large volumes of water elliott et al 2008 these characteristics enable zebra mussels to drive especially dramatic change in algal and cyanobacterial dynamics sousa et al 2009 in a meta analysis of dreissenid impacts on freshwater systems it was shown that dreissenids significantly reduce overall phytoplankton abundances by 35 to 78 after invasion due to their filter feeding behaviour higgins and vander zanden 2010 this included significant reductions in cyanobacterial abundance of up to 58 which has also been noted in reservoir specific studies kirsch and dzialowski 2012 despite these overall reductions in cyanobacterial biomass there is a body of evidence that suggests in the presence of dreissenid mussels certain individual cyanobacterial species increase in abundance in some but not all ecosystems higgins and vander zanden 2010 particularly in north american lakes a pattern of increases in nuisance cyanobacteria such as microcystis aeruginosa have been observed raikow et al 2004 knoll et al 2008 it is thought that dreissenids may increase levels of toxic cyanobacteria through the mechanism of selective rejection whereby toxic or unpalatable phytoplankton are ejected by mussels in pseudofaeces where it can then be resuspended in the water column vanderploeg et al 2013 tang et al 2014 the quagga mussel dreissena rostriformis bugensis is an emerging inns which is rapidly spreading around the world as a result of its prolific biofouling characteristics karatayev et al 2007 in recent decades quagga mussels have displaced existing invasive populations of zebra mussels often leading to increased overall mussel densities which has significant environmental and economic implications strayer et al 2019 originally native to the dnieper river system in the northern region of the black sea son 2007 less is known of the life history biology and impacts of quagga mussels compared to zebra mussels the quagga mussel was first discovered in the great lakes region in north america in 1989 and has since spread to all five lakes although its spread was slower than the previous zebra mussel invasion once established it replaced zebra mussels in nearshore regions and colonised deeper regions where zebra mussels were never found nalepa 2010 the quagga mussel s ability to displace zebra mussels is attributed to its lower respiration rate accelerated shell growth and mass faster filtration rate and superior assimilation efficiency diggins 2001 baldwin et al 2003 stoeckmann 2003 although ecological impacts are thought to be similar to the zebra mussel it is suggested that changes may be more severe and pervasive in scope nalepa 2010 based on the widespread ecological change that has been observed following quagga mussel invasions the species was identified as the largest risk to britain s biodiversity in a multi taxon multi ecosystem horizon scan of inns roy et al 2014 subsequently in 2014 the quagga mussel was discovered for the first time in the uk in the wraysbury river surrey 51 26 55 n 00 31 25 w aldridge et al 2014 and has since established large populations in a number of reservoirs in southwest london aldridge 2015 with quagga mussels becoming a more pressing threat to the uk s freshwater ecosystems and infrastructure there is a growing need for research focussed on this species specifically there is a dearth of research of dreissenid impacts on man made reservoirs relative to other aquatic habitats which needs to be addressed kirsch and dzialowski 2012 thames water utilities thames water is responsible for the management of the reservoir network across southwest london and has collected standardised data on water quality parameters including abundance of algae and cyanobacteria for over three decades as the arrival and rapid population increase of quagga mussels can be attributed to a short window in time this provides an opportunity to employ a progressive change bacips before after control impact paired series design to interrogate this dataset to identify any potential effects of the recent quagga mussel invasion on key abiotic and biotic parameters bacips analysis is recognised as an effective and valuable method for evaluating both natural and anthropogenic perturbations on ecological variables when the treatment site cannot be randomly chosen stewart oaten et al 1986 downes et al 2002 popescu et al 2012 russell et al 2015 conner et al 2016 bacips has been applied to a range of studies including the effects of rainforest logging on birds and small mammals crome et al 1996 nuclear power plants on kelp bence et al 2007 invasive catfish on invertebrates kadye and booth 2012 and the diversion of the mississippi river on nekton community structure de mutsert and cowan 2012 the bacips methodology allows the evaluation of both the before versus after measurements at impacted sites and the control sites versus impacted sites this is why bacips analysis is preferential for ecological systems as it incorporates not only time but controls conger and portier 2006 progressive change bacips is a new approach which generalises and expands the scope of bacips analysis thiault et al 2017 wauchope et al 2021 whereas traditional bacips analyses assume that effects are sudden long lasting and constant i e exhibit a step change progressive change bacips allows for the identification of step linear asymptotic or sigmoid responses to an impact thiault et al 2017 2019 the aim of this study was to apply the progressive change bacips methodology to routinely collected reservoir water quality measurements in order to identify the potential abiotic and biotic impacts of quagga mussels in invaded reservoirs based on the observations expressed in the wider literature documenting ecosystem level shifts following quagga mussel invasions our research had several key hypotheses following quagga mussel invasion we expected to observe reductions in overall abundances of green algae cyanobacteria and diatoms as a result of mussel grazing activity higgins and vander zanden 2010 decreases in turbidity and chlorophyll a concentrations from reduced phytoplankton abundances higgins and vander zanden 2010 kirsch and dzialowski 2012 increases in abundance of toxin forming cyanobacteria as a result of the selective rejection of these species in mussel pseudofaeces raikow et al 2004 vanderploeg et al 2013 tang et al 2014 increases in reactive silica as sio2 as a result of reduced assimilation into diatom biomass as mussel grazing reduces diatom populations rockwell et al 2005 and increases in soluble reactive phosphorus srp and ammonium nh4 attributed to mussels excreting a high level of dissolved nutrients karatayev et al 2015 ozersky et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 the reservoirs data were collated from ten reservoirs located in southwest london situated within a 9 km radius queen mother reservoir 51 28 57 06 n 0 33 1 57 w wraysbury reservoir 51 27 41 26 n 0 31 31 40 w king george reservoir 51 26 59 44 n 0 30 9 63 w staines north reservoir 51 27 1 28 n 0 29 23 92 w staines south reservoir 51 26 38 95 n 0 29

and the island barn reservoir 51 23 27 26 n 0 21 51 89 w surveys to assess the presence and abundance of quagga mussels and zebra mussels were conducted at all reservoirs during 2015 aldridge 2015 surveys included inspection of marginal walls of reservoirs boat based dredging sampling on undersides of pontoons and marker buoys inspection of accessible underdrains and culverts and use of an rov camera data were complemented by data held by the uk environment agency aldridge 2015 queen mother and wraysbury reservoirs contained a high abundance of quagga mussels characterised by a continuous crust of mussels at least 2 cm thick across all submerged hard surfaces at 1 m depth the remaining reservoirs were either uninvaded or had very low abundances of zebra and or quagga mussels occasional individuals encountered but hard surfaces were 95 clear of mussels therefore the wraysbury and queen mother reservoirs were considered impacted sites and the remainder of the reservoirs were considered controls 2 2 selection of variables the following abiotic water quality metrics were selected for analysis in this study ammonium as nh4 mg l turbidity in formazin turbidity units ftu reactive silica as sio2 mg l and soluble reactive phosphorus srp as po4 mg l the biotic water quality metrics selected were chlorophyll a ug l average cyanobacteria abundance cells ml average green algae abundance cells ml and average diatom abundance cells ml common nuisance phytoplankton abundances cells ml of species known to cause toxic blooms under favourable conditions were also considered microcystis sp anabaena sp aphanizomenon sp and euglena sp zimba et al 2017 huisman et al 2018 2 3 estimation of algal cell abundance phytoplankton abundances were measured by thames water using a cell counting chamber and recorded by ascribing a rating on an acfor scale where abundant 20 cells mm2 common 20 cells mm2 frequent 21 100 cells per slide occasional 3 20 cells per slide and rare 1 2 cells per slide in order to estimate the abundance of algal cells denoted by the acfor scale ratings each ranking was normalised to represent the lowest bound of cells per ml which would be required to achieve each rating based on the use of a standard 9 mm2 cell counting chamber of 0 1mm depth therefore all phytoplankton abundance estimates represent the lowest possible cell numbers present 2 4 selection of study timeframe data from january 2001 until november 2018 were used for all variables this timeframe was selected because as of january 2001 weekly algae abundance data were collected from each reservoir to satisfy the paired sample criteria of the progressive change bacips methodology for each reservoir a monthly average value was calculated for each water quality metric in months for which only invaded or uninvaded reservoirs had data for a specific metric the data for that month were omitted the monthly averaged data were then averaged between impact sites queen mother and wraysbury reservoirs and control sites king george reservoir staines north and south reservoirs queen mary reservoir knight reservoir bessborough reservoir queen elizabeth reservoir and the island barn reservoir to create a paired dataset of monthly measurements for impact and control sites 2 5 assigning the impact date for progressive change bacips analysis the date of january 2014 was used in the analysis as the likely date of invasion aldridge et al 2014 estimate that the mussels arrived in the waterways surrounding the invaded reservoirs in late 2013 or early 2014 these dates of establishment are reinforced from observations in aldridge 2015 of populations dominated by year 1 and 2 quagga mussels and the absence of any dead shells in the wraysbury and queen mother reservoirs therefore measurements before january 2014 are considered to be before the impact and measurements from and including january 2014 are considered to be after the impact for the purposes of the progressive change bacips analysis 2 6 progressive change bacips analysis the data were analysed in order to identify both overall changes and seasonal changes which may arise as the result of quagga mussel invasion spring was designated as march to may summer was june to august autumn was september to november and winter was december to february the progressive change bacips was implemented following the methodology outlined by thiault et al 2017 figure s1 for each variable the difference δ was determined between the impact and paired control sites for each month the analysis assesses whether there is a significant change in δ for each variable from before and after the establishment of quagga mussels in 2014 unlike traditional bacips analysis which assumes and tests for a step change in δ this methodology compares how the data conforms to four competing models step change eq 1 linear eq 2 asymptotic eq 3 and sigmoid models eq 4 as for all bacips analysis the assumption is made that in the before period δ was stationary through time i e there was no consistent temporal trend in the difference between impact and control sites prior to the establishment of quagga mussels however after mussel establishment δ changed with time with an increase indicating a positive effect of mussel establishment and decreases indicating a negative effect the differences between an impact site and its control after the arrival of mussels δ after can be described as 1 step change response δ a f t e r i m δ b e f o r e ε i 2 linear response δ a f t e r i r t i δ b e f o r e ε i 3 asymptotic response δ a f t e r i m t l t δ b e f o r e ε i 4 sigmoid response δ a f t e r i m t l k 1 t l k δ b e f o r e ε i where t is time in years since 1 january 2001 associated with the i th sampling survey δbefore is the underlying spatial variation between the impact and control sites in the absence of quagga mussels estimated during the before period r and m are the rate of divergence and magnitude of change between the impact and control sites respectively l is the time required to reach half of the long term effect k is a scaling parameter in the sigmoid model that affects the steepness of the curve and ε is the error associated with the i th survey each candidate model was fitted setting the before data to have t 0 and the magnitude of the response to mussel establishment effect size was then measured based on the predictions of the best fit model highest aicc score after identifying the most appropriate model a glm was implemented with the prescribed interaction in order to estimate the effect size for step change interactions the effect size indicates the change in δ from before to after the impact for linear interactions the effect size indicates the average change in δ per year figure s1 as only step change and linear models were identified for the variables in this study the glm used a gaussian distribution and identity error distribution for seasonal trends the same methodology was followed however the data was partitioned so that only the data for the desired season was fitted to the models and subsequently analysed using glm the 95 confidence intervals for all significant effect sizes were calculated to ensure that they did not overlap zero therefore confirming that the effect size is significantly different from zero all analysis was performed in r studio v 1 1 442 r core team 2018 3 results the pattern of change in response to quagga mussel establishment for all variables demonstrating significant effect sizes supported either a linear change in which the difference between impact and control sites increased linearly with time since mussel establishment or a step change where an immediate shift was noted in the impact relative to the control site in no cases were asymptotic or sigmoidal models supported by the data for two variables winter average diatom abundance and overall srp concentration the likelihood ω of the second best model was comparable to the best fit model within 10 for consistency only the results of the best fit model are presented and are summarised in table 1 3 1 changes in abiotic

changes in δ for average abundances of green algae microcystis sp anabaena sp or euglena sp 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of quagga mussel establishment 4 1 1 diatom abundance and reactive silica an overall decline in diatom abundance by 1205 cells ml year was observed declining consistently in all seasons despite limited research on the specific impact of quagga mussels on diatom communities large quagga mussels 16 mm have been shown to demonstrate a grazing preference for colonial diatoms in mesocosm experiments tang et al 2014 in natural systems declines in diatom abundance have been linked to the establishment of zebra mussels in short term experiments in saginaw bay lake huron heath et al 1995 lavrentyev et al 1995 the increase in reactive silica concentrations in impacted reservoirs can likely be linked to the grazing activities of quagga mussels and removal of diatoms which incorporate silica into their cell walls frustules de tommasi et al 2017 reduced diatom abundances at impacted reservoirs may have reduced the usual levels of silica uptake from the environment for frustule formation leading to the observed positive step change in reactive silica concentrations noted in our study the same effect and seasonal changes were noted in lake erie following the invasion of zebra mussels with the greatest changes occurring in the spring and autumn nicholls et al 1997 rockwell et al 2005 which are the seasons when diatom blooms typically occur sigee 2005 4 1 2 cyanobacteria and aphanizomenon sp abundance overall average cyanobacterial abundance decreased by 604 cells ml year with the greatest decrease of 1655 cells ml year occurring in the autumn these results suggest that quagga mussel establishment acted to supress cyanobacterial abundance in invaded reservoirs in european studies quagga mussels have been suggested as management tools for harmful algal blooms in urban ponds where they have been shown to supress cyanobacterial abundance waajen et al 2016 similarly in both uk mesocosm experiments reynolds et al 2019 and in dutch lakes reeders and bij de vaate 1990 dionisio pires et al 2005 zebra mussels have been shown to supress overall cyanobacteria abundance equally they have been shown to remove a broad size range of cyanobacteria regardless of toxicity dionisio pires et al 2005 however particularly in the north american great lakes dreissenids have been linked to increases in cyanobacterial biomass particularly of the toxic bloom forming cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa vanderploeg et al 2001 nicholls et al 2002 pillsbury et al 2002 bierman et al 2005 conroy and culver 2005 naddafi et al 2007 only aphanizomenon sp of all the nuisance phytoplankton species included in our study demonstrated any significant changes in abundance following the invasion of quagga mussels decreasing by 1817 cells ml year on average with the greatest effect in the autumn in the uk aphanizomenon sp is often at its peak during the autumn months henderson et al 2008 which may explain why the greatest decrease relative to control reservoirs was during this season in recent mesocosm experiments the presence of aphanizomenon sp at bloom level concentrations was shown to negatively affect sperm motility veliger survival and fully inhibit spawning events in quagga mussels boegehold et al 2018 2019b 2019a active removal of aphanizomenon sp may serve to reduce overall exposure of the mussels to harmful cyanotoxins 4 1 3 chlorophyll a despite declines in diatom and cyanobacterial abundance no significant decline in chlorophyll a concentration was observed in fact overall average chlorophyll a concentration increased by an estimated 2 77 ug l with the biggest increase occurring in the winter research suggests this observation is not unusual even in shallow well mixed lakes such as lake shawano wisconsin where a 2 7 ug l increase in chlorophyll a concentration was observed post dreissenid invasion cha et al 2013 the winter increase in chlorophyll a concentration may be explained by seasonal declines in mussel clearance rates combined with the observed autumn rise in srp mesocosm studies have shown that winter clearance rates of quagga mussels are halved compared to the rest of the year diggins 2001 this could have led to increased overwintering of phytoplankton after quagga mussel establishment additionally our dataset does not encompass all algal species present in each reservoir as during routine data collection only the ten most abundant species were recorded therefore the overall increase in chlorophyll a may be driven by small cumulative increases in phytoplankton species of lower abundance that were not specifically recorded 4 1 4 green algae and nuisance phytoplankton species we hypothesised that green algae abundances would decline in impacted reservoirs due to the grazing activity of quagga mussels higgins and vander zanden 2010 however no effect was observed in our study impacts of zebra mussels on green algae are mixed some studies have expressed that zebra mussels avoid green algae in preference for other phytoplankton taxa naddafi et al 2007 fahnenstiel et al 2010 reynolds et al 2019 while others noted significant falls in green algae abundance heath et al 1995 kirsch and dzialowski 2012 quagga mussel clearance rate experiments have shown that green algae particularly species with thick cell walls are cleared at low rates and often rejected in pseudofaeces tang et al 2014 quagga mussels have also demonstrated preferential removal of large colonial diatoms and cyanobacteria species tang et al 2014 waajen et al 2016 in our study impacted reservoirs prior to invasion hosted abundances of cyanobacteria up to six times higher and diatom abundances up to seven times higher than green algae the high abundances of potentially preferential food sources in diatoms and cyanobacteria may explain why grazing impacts on green algae were not observed in our study moreover the low abundance of green algae in comparison to cyanobacteria and diatoms may have led them to be under represented in the data making it more difficult to tease out changes in their abundance our study did not identify an effect of quagga mussel establishment on potentially toxic microcystis sp anabaena sp or euglena sp abundance however other studies have noted increases in toxic algae abundance following dreissenid establishment potentially as a result of selective rejection of toxic cyanobacteria in mussel pseudofaeces raikow et al 2004 vanderploeg et al 2013 tang et al 2014 an effect on microcystis sp may not have been observed in our study as nuanced nutrient and strain dependant relationships have been noted between microcystis sp and dreissenids firstly in systems with total phosphorus levels of 25 ug l as was observed in all reservoirs in our study dreissenids were shown to have no effect on microcystis sp abundance raikow et al 2004 sarnelle et al 2005 secondly vanderploeg et al 2013 demonstrated extreme variance in the grazing response of zebra and quagga mussels to different strains of m aeruginosa observing significant differences in the uptake and rejection of m aeruginosa between laboratory strains and even strains from the same lake which could not be explained by toxicity or colony size in the case of anabaena sp tang et al 2014 observed that filamentous cyanobacteria such as anabaena and aphanizomenon sp were readily ingested by quagga mussels in mesocosm experiments in our study the filamentous cyanobacteria aphanizomenon sp which did experience a significant decline after quagga mussel establishment occurred at twice the density of anabaena sp within all reservoirs prior to quagga mussel invasion the lower abundance of anabaena sp in comparison with aphanizomenon sp could be responsible for the absence of an impact in our study finally in the case of euglena sp which is the only known green algae to produce a toxin zimba et al 2017 there are no studies which directly assess its relationship with dreissenids it may be that the specific potent toxin euglenophycin prevents euglena sp from being ingested by quagga mussels or that the motile nature of euglena sp allows it to occupy areas of the water column unaffected by the substrate fixed quagga mussels 4 1 5 turbidity declines in turbidity are widely reported as an impact of dreissenid invasion vanderploeg et al 2002 higgins and vander zanden 2010 karatayev et al 2015 however this was not observed in our study although dreissenids have been shown to reduce turbidity caused by phytoplankton biomass the impact of dreissenids on non algal turbidity is less well understood kirsch and dzialowski 2012 research suggests that zebra mussels are capable of removing some suspended solids from the water column however quagga mussel mesocosm experiments found that they had no significant impact on total suspended solids higgins and vander zanden 2010 mei et al 2016 therefore if the turbidity of a system is largely as a result of high abundances of suspended solids opposed to phytoplankton biomass quagga mussels may be unlikely to reduce the turbidity of the system the reservoirs we studied are fed from the river thames which experiences frequent high flow events which can result in high suspended sediment loads the results of our study suggest turbidity in the impacted reservoirs may have been driven by non algal suspended solids rather than phytoplankton biomass 4 1 6 soluble reactive phosphorus and ammonium the overall srp increase of 5 ug l year at impacted reservoirs can likely be tied to the grazing activities of quagga mussels as dreissenids play an important role in nutrient cycling vanderploeg et al 2002 the phosphorus associated with phytoplankton biomass is ingested by the mussels and although some phosphorus is retained as mussel biomass excess is remineralised and is excreted as po4 ozersky et al 2015 ozersky et al 2015 noted that quagga mussel srp excretion rates peaked in october at 16ug gram of shell free dry mass hour this previously observed seasonality of quagga mussel excretion rates may explain the 12 ug l year increase observed in invaded reservoirs in our study during the autumn srp excretion in zebra mussels is thought to be weight dependant with larger mussels excreting higher levels of srp this may help to explain the linear nature of the relationship as increasing densities and biomass of older larger mussels enhance nutrient cycling fishman et al 2009 it was hypothesised that ammonium concentrations may increase in invaded reservoirs as a result of the quagga mussels feeding behaviour returning nutrients stored in phytoplankton biomass to the water column through excretion of dissolved nutrients ozersky et al 2015 although ammonium concentrations have been shown to increase in some enclosure experiments containing quagga mussels no consistent effects have yet been recorded in natural systems higgins and vander zanden 2010 kirsch and dzialowski 2012 in many studies of natural systems and in our study measurements were constrained to a single location at a shallow depth this potentially makes it difficult to assess the degree of depth and spatial variation in nutrient cycling occurring within waterbodies ozersky et al 2015 dreissenids have been shown to redirect nutrients from offshore pelagic zones to nearshore benthic zones known as nearshore shunt hecky et al 2004 in our study the occurrence of nearshore shunt may have been obscured by the method of data collection 4 2 implications for reservoir management the results of our study indicate that quagga mussels may have impacts on recipient ecosystems that can be of both positive and negative value to reservoir managers and the ecosystem services provided there are several potentially beneficial effects of quagga mussel establishment for reservoir management firstly although reductions in diatom abundances are unlikely to have any significant effects on water quality as diatom blooms are rarely toxic reduced abundances may act to reduce filter blockages at water treatment plants henderson et al 2008 secondly reduced cyanobacteria abundance may improve water quality by reducing the risk of cyanotoxins entering the water supply cyanotoxins can be hazardous to human and animal health leading authorities to prevent access to waterbodies for recreational activities and potentially poisoning native fish birds and mammals world health organization 2003 graham et al 2010 hilborn and beasley 2015 huisman et al 2018 many cyanobacterial species including aphanizomenon sp are known to produce cyanotoxins which are a concern for human health deteriorate water taste and create unpleasant odours the majority of cyanotoxins remain even after mechanical filtration and have taste thresholds of only a few nanograms per litre graham et al 2010 world health organization 2017 thirdly reductions in cyanobacterial abundance may reduce the likelihood of harmful bloom events which can create anoxic water conditions waajen et al 2016 large blooms threaten the survival of all oxygen dependant species in the waterbody potentially affecting biodiversity and recreational value from fishing wolf et al 2017 finally when blooms die and are washed up on shorelines the decay creates a foul smell which further limits the recreational use of the waterbody nalepa 2010 therefore the observed declines in cyanobacterial biomass may reduce risks posed by cyanotoxins reduce the frequency of bloom events and associated risks to native biota while reducing the frequency of reservoir closures while declines in cyanobacteria and diatoms may potentially reduce some management burdens long term reductions in diatom abundances which are key contributors of primary production and a preferred high quality food source for primary consumers stenger kovács et al 2007 winder et al 2009 may have implications for the reservoir s wider ecology and may result in fundamental changes to nutrient and energy cycling shifting pelagic production to the benthos rowe et al 2015 quagga mussels compete directly with native species for phytoplankton resources as a result it has been observed that zooplankton biomass can decline by 40 after dreissenid invasion although this varies largely between waterbodies higgins and vander zanden 2010 additionally the arrival of dreissenid mussels in the north american great lakes led to declines in native fauna particularly of the benthic amphipod diporeia mckenna et al 2017 both zooplankton and amphipods are highly nutritious food for most benthic and demersal fish mckenna 2019 therefore quagga mussel invasion could have consequences for the health size and abundance of fish stocks in invaded systems any deleterious effects on fish stocks will negatively affect angling activities and may also have implications for piscivorous native and migratory waterfowl a further risk to native fish and bird species from the establishment of quagga mussels is the prospect of expediating invasional meltdown whereby the establishment of one inns can facilitate the establishment of an invader of common origin as they have co evolved under similar environmental conditions simberloff and von holle 1999 this is of particular concern for the sites identified in our study which are located in the south east of england an area identified as the highest risk of invasion by multiple ponto caspian species gallardo and aldridge 2015 facilitating the establishment of additional inns is likely to exacerbate any impacts of inns on existing communities and reduce the ability of invaded waterbodies to conserve native species it may be that in species rich reservoirs of high ecological and conservation value or where angling is of high priority quagga mussel reduction measures should be considered to limit their impact on the local biota and nutrient flows whereas in reservoirs deemed as ecologically deficient quagga mussels may bring beneficial changes through reductions in cyanobacteria abundance while we do not advocate for intentional introductions of quagga mussels with appropriate risk assessment and consultation with the relevant authorities there may be scenarios where maintenance of a quagga mussel population could be beneficial mclaughlan and aldridge 2013 waajen et al 2016 4 3 progressive change bacips analysis for informing reservoir management the progressive change bacips methodology provides a powerful tool which can be applied to routinely collected data collated by water resource managers this methodology can easily be applied to other reservoir systems hosting invasive dreissenid populations with a known arrival date to quantify their effects on the environment furthermore if the overall and seasonal changes observed in this study are found to be consistent across other known invaded reservoir systems they could serve as potentially useful indicators of dreissenid invasions in reservoirs where benthic biodiversity monitoring or water drawdowns are not performed regularly these potential indicators could include progressive declines in diatom and cyanobacteria abundances combined with an otherwise unexplained increase in srp progressive change bacips is not only informative in the context of invasive dreissenid populations but also allows investigation of other major perturbations which can be attributed to a time point these perturbations could include installation of new treatment processes pollution events water drawdowns fish introductions for angling and establishment of other high impact inns such as killer shrimps madgwick and aldridge 2011 understanding which aspects of the reservoir environment are being impacted and the magnitude of the effects will provide useful guidance for developing effective and desirable management strategies 5 conclusions we believe progressive change bacips should be more widely applied to help quantify impacts of inns especially in reservoir systems where extensive timeseries data are often routinely collected for reservoir management and currently represents a largely untapped resource invaded reservoirs observed declines in cyanobacterial abundance and the nuisance cyanobacterium aphanizomenon sp indicating that quagga mussels could perhaps be harnessed in depleted ecosystems to prevent cyanobacterial dominance and suppress harmful algal blooms in biologically diverse and pristine aquatic environments and those which provide recreational angling quagga mussels may have negative consequences for native biota through their removal of diatom species which are key primary producers and the preferential food source of most primary consumers this research helps to address the current dearth of literature focused on the direct observation of quagga mussels impacts in reservoir ecosystems as much of the existing research focuses on the impacts of quagga mussels on natural ecosystems or in laboratory based mesocosm studies declaration of
