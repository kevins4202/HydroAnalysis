10875,quinoa is well known for its great ability to tolerate water stress however very little information is available about its potential growth under full irrigation particularly in hot and semi arid regions in this experiment a newly released quinoa cv q5 bred for hot and dry regions was grown under three planting densities pds of 150 000 185 000 and 270 000 in the drainable lysimeters south of iran the highest and lowest grain yields were observed in the middle and low pds of 3 65 mg ha 1 and 2 86 mg ha 1 respectively quinoa showed very high crop evapotranspiration etc and transpiration t rates etc and t varied in the range of 1448 1687 mm and 777 1228 mm among the pds respectively these high values resulted in high single crop coefficients kc that overall varied between around 1 and 2 4 during the growing season the basal crop coefficient kcb of the dual kc kc kcb ke reached about 1 9 and 1 2 in the high and low pds respectively indicating high transpiration capacity the main reasons of high kc and kcb were high soil evaporation rate due to very frequent irrigations of 3 4 days and soil wetting and the prevailing regional sensible heat advection that increased transpiration it was concluded that quinoa has a specific physiological systems that transpire continually for allowing better leaf cooling at high temperature which results in high water use moreover a vigorous root system that extended down to 1 2 m with high root length densities in the deep layers rld 1 cm cm 3 helped quinoa to supply the water use this extensive root system down to 1 2 m could help to increase irrigation interval and reducing soil evaporation however the effect of pd on the root length and root mass was mainly observed in the top 40 cm below which its effect diminished and root length and root mass were nearly identical among the pds overall it is concluded that quinoa q5 is a super crop that not only can tolerate water stress but also can potentially grow well and produce acceptable grain yield in the hot and semi arid areas adapting appropriate pd and irrigation management such as drip irrigation surface and subsurface mulching increasing irrigation interval attributed to the deep rooting system and water saving irrigation managements would substantially reduce soil evaporation and increase water productivity keywords quinoa planting density evapotranspiration crop coefficients root growth grain yield water productivity 1 introduction accurate estimation of irrigation water requirement is important for irrigation planning in the arid and semi arid climates in these areas reducing evaporation is a challenge to increase water use efficiency wue evaporation from soil surface has been reported 30 of the seasonal maize and wheat etc in the south of iran shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 plant density pd which may increase yield is a potential approach to reduce soil evaporation shuttleworth and wallace 1985 appropriate pd with minimum plant competition can increase yield production and wue previous studies showed that pd played an important role in canola production through significant effect on branching french et al 2016 diepenbrock 2000 however low pd would result in high soil evaporation and reduced yield on the other hand high pd may decrease soil evaporation but would induce competition for water and nutrient uptake among plants that leads to yield decline nasiri et al 2017 however high pd may prevent light penetration into lower canopy layers that reduces photosynthesis which in turn leads to decreased evapotranspiration therefore it seems there should be an optimum pd in different regions to reach maximum grain yield root growth behavior plays a major role in irrigation management root distribution depends on crop characteristic soil water content soil texture and structure ahmadi et al 2011 van wijk 2011 root length density rld and root mass density rmd are the popular root features that characterize the root system size in soil profile in addition specific root length srl as the ratio of rld to rmd represents root thickness and is an important factor in water uptake capacity and exploration ability of roots ostonen et al 2007 quinoa is a c3 andean crop and is well adapted to grow in poor soils and extreme climatic conditions razzaghi et al 2011 garcia et al 2003 in addition to its great adaptability to harsh environments and global changing due to its valuable and wide genetic diversity bazile and baudron 2015 jacobsen and stølen 1993 quinoa is rapidly gaining global interest because of higher protein content 14 18 oil content 6 compared to 2 in cereals nutrients excellent quality of their proteins good balance of all amino acids and their high content of minerals and vitamins that would be part of a healthy food diet jacobsen 2015 bazile and baudron 2015 in this regard the united nations declared the international year of quinoa in 2013 bazile and santivanez 2015 quinoa cultivation has been expanded globally bazile and baudron 2015 in europe africa and asia such as italy pulvento et al 2015a b 2013 turkey yazar et al 2015 france piva et al 2015 greece noulas et al 2015 morocco azaykou et al 2018 benlhabib et al 2015 india bhargava and ohri 2015 and the mediterranean regions choukr allah et al 2016 due to proper and modernized irrigation systems quinoa has responded well to deficit irrigation that was highly beneficial in various experimental locations where grain yield was hardly affected by deficit irrigation yazar et al 2015 razzaghi et al 2012 2011 geerts et al 2008a b although the literatures emphasized that quinoa has good potential for water stress and harsh environments such as drought salinity and temperature hinojosa et al 2018 choukr allah et al 2016 noulas et al 2015 razzaghi et al 2011 geerts et al 2009 there are few studies that suggested full irrigation increases quinoa grain yield and biomass compared to deficit irrigation walters et al 2016 fghire et al 2015 yazar et al 2015 several attempts bred new quinoa cultivars that are susceptible for growth in the marginal arid and hot environments of middle east and north africa mena azaykou et al 2018 hirich 2016 choukr allah et al 2016 except few studies in the arid and semi arid mediterranean regions fghire et al 2015 yazar et al 2015 jacobsen et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge there are no other field studies in hot and arid environments with high temperature during the growing season in addition due to the large differences between diverse quinoa genotypes and climate conditions bazile and baudron 2015 there is a gap on determining the optimum pd of quinoa so the targets of this study were set i to determine quinoa water requirement and single and dual crop coefficients of quinoa in three pds ii to determine potential grain yield water use efficiency and water productivity in three pds and iii to determine the root growth traits and characteristics rld rmd and srl 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted during the spring and summer of 2018 in three experimental lysimeters in the bajgah area faculty of agriculture shiraz university iran 29 36 n 52 32 e that is a sunny high level valley 1810 msl the drainable lysimeters had an area of 2 m2 and a depth of 1 7 m some soil physical properties of the soil are summarized in table 1 the study area is located in a semi arid area with a warm climate and long term annual average rainfall of about 386 mm ahmadi et al 2018 meteorological data were obtained from a nearby station located just 10 m from the lysimeters the main metrological data are shown in fig 1 the reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated by the penman montieth equation allen et al 1998 2 2 crop cultivation the newly released fast growing and early maturing quinoa variety q5 accession no nsl 106 398 provided by the international center for biosaline agriculture was sown on april 11 2018 in three different pds of 270 000 high 185 000 middle and 150 000 low plants per ha in three circular drainable lysimeters at 0 20 m 0 25 m and 0 30 m space between row and 0 15 m inter row spacing respectively this led to 7 5 and 4 planting rows in the lysimeters each lysimeter was assigned to one of the planting densities surrounding area was cultivated with the same plant the total area of cultivating was 100 m2 weeds were removed by hand frequently when appeared and thus there was no weed stress during the growing season 350 kg n ha 1 as urea was supplied to prevent any nitrogen deficiency and fertility stress according to unpublished preliminary assessment in the study area and ørum et al 2013 that indicated that n application rate up to 375 or even higher would increase potential grain yield 2 3 irrigation management and crop evapotranspiration crops in the three lysimeters were fully irrigated during the growing season the irrigation events were done every 3 4 days to prevent any water stress soil water content was measured by neutron probe in each lysimeter separately seven times during the growing season drainage water was collected in containers that were placed in an underground room below each lysimeter crop evapotranspiration etc was measured by the water balance method 1 etc p i d δw where etc is the crop evapotranspiration mm p is rainfall mm i is the irrigation water depth mm d is the deep percolation mm and δw mm is the change in soil water content between two soil water content measurements using the neutron meter in 0 20 m intervals soil evaporation e was measured by micro lysimeters that were pvc tubes with a 0 30 m height and 0 09 m diameter they were filled with the same soil of lysimeters and were placed between rows and in the same elevation with soil surface they were irrigated with other crops and weighed immediately before and a day after each irrigation to allow free drainage of excess water the weight difference during two irrigation events resulted in soil evaporation the single crop coefficient kc was obtained by the ratio of etc and eto as 2 k c e t c e t o the dual crop coefficient obtained from the ratio of soil evaporation to etc and the ratio of transpiration to etc 3 k c d u a l t e t o e e t o k c b k e where e is the soil evaporation mm and t is the transpiration mm 2 4 grain yield biomass and water productivity crops were harvested on september 4 2018 146 days after planting dap when all seeds were fully ripened and dry according to the guidelines of sosa zuniga et al 2017 plant height and total number of productive branches were measured the heads were cut off from shoots and then the shoots were cut off above the soil surface for dry mater measurement seeds were separated from the coating and weighted by a precision balance 1 mg to determine grain yield gy shoot was oven dried at 80 c for 48 h and weighted to measure shoot biomass the total biomass b was calculated as the sum of gy and shoot biomass water productivity wp kg m 3 and water use efficiency wue kg m 3 were calculated as 4 w p g y i 5 w u e g y e t c the normalized water productivity wp kg m 2 steduto et al 2007

the crop transpiration in the growth period i and eto i is the reference evapotranspiration i is an index of growth period when soil water has been measured at the beginning and the end of the period i and n is the total number of growth stage periods 2 5 root sampling and measurement soil cores were collected by a 0 05 m diameter and 1 2 m height hand driven augar soil cores were divided into 10 cm parts and were kept in plastic bags and were stored at 6 c the samples were sink in a 3 l pot for 24 h and later the roots were separated from the soil by mildly shaking the mixture the buoyant roots were collected by a 250 μm mesh size sieve the previous procedure was repeated until no more roots were seen in water ahmadi et al 2017 after segregating the living roots in a suitable plate the singular fresh root samples were collected by a 250 μm mesh size sieve the root samples were placed in some bottles and 10 acetic acid solution were add to them and stored 6 c for further analysis the root length cm was determined by the newman method ahmadi et al 2011 and then converted to rld cm cm 3 based on the associated soil volume 196 25 cm3 for 0 10 m soil section after determining the root length the root samples were oven dried at 60 c for 24 h to determine root mass density rmd mg cm 3 as the ratio of root dry mass precision 1 mg to the associated soil sample volume 196 25 cm3 for 0 10 m soil section also the srl estimated by the ratio of root length by the dry root mass m g 1 ahmadi et al 2018 3 results 3 1 crop evapotranspiration total irrigation total rainfall total drainage water total soil surface evaporation and total transpiration are shown in table 2 crop etc varied between nearly 1500 and 1690 mm among the three pds which demonstrates the effect of plant population on crop etc maximum etc was related to the high pd due to greater plant population though the minimum etc was observed in the middle pd although low pd had less plant population it had greater etc than the middle pd because lower pds caused greater soil evaporation due to less shading the high and middle pds had 58 and 20 higher t than the lowest pd similarly the low and middle pds increased e by 56 and 13 compared to the high pd soil evaporation was 27 36 and 48 of the total seasonal etc of quinoa for high to low pds respectively table 2 which e accounts for nearly half of total etc in the low pd in our study high and middle pd had an acceptable amount of evaporation that was in the range of local soil evaporation of 30 2 and 29 8 of the total etc for wheat and maize respectively shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 however evaporation in low pd was considerably high 3 2 crop coefficients 3 2 1 single kc the single kc values are shown in fig 2 the kc values are time averaged and determined for each growth period i at the first glance it is clear that the kc values are much higher than the common accepted values for the other crops reported in the literature and reference fao56 allen et al 1998 the three pds showed different responses to kc but the highest difference were seen in the third and fifth stages in the other stages the differences are not considerable the highest and lowest kc values that occurred in the middle growth stage kcmid are 1 9 and 2 4 corresponding to the lowest and highest pds respectively in the fifth stage that is attributed to the late middle growth stage however the highest and lowest kc values of 2 1 and 1 6 were related to high and middle pds respectively in fact it seems that it is not probably possible to assign a single kcmid for the middle growth stage due to high kc variations unlike the third growth stage the minimum value was related to the middle pd while the low pd had higher single kc in this growth stage despite lower plant population it shows that low pd had higher rates of et in this growth stage which seems higher soil evaporation rates had higher weight in kc this issue is discussed in details in the dual kc section at the end of the growing season 147 dap single kc values substantially decreased due to the canopy senescence single kc values ranged between 0 96 and 1 21 which were related to the middle and high pds respectively similar to the previous growth stage the effect of direct soil evaporation caused higher single kc values in low pd compared to middle pd generally this represents the effect of pd in single kc which is directly related to water consumption and indirectly related to water productivity 3 2 2 dual kc the kc is equal to kcb ke the single kc integrates the effect of both crop transpiration t and soil evaporation e into a single crop coefficient the dual kc differentiates evaporation and transpiration during the growing season that elucidate the consumptive t and non consumptive e components of crop coefficient the highest kcb was observed in the third kcb 1 75 and fifth kcb 1 63 growth stages of the high pd fig 2 the kcb values show that t in high pd is maximum due to more plant population the lowest kcb values were also mostly found in the first period initial stage and the last period late season stage notably the low pd had higher kcb higher transpiration than the middle pd in the second and last growth periods fig 2 the maximum ke values occurred in the low pd as high as ca 0 82 during the middle growth stage fig 2 that coincided with the highest air temperature and vpd fig 1 such high ke value in the low pd is due to low canopy shading on soil surface and frequent irrigation events every 3 4 days to ensure sufficient soil water for transpiration it is seen that in the same growth period fourth and fifth stages the ke substantially declined to around 0 35 in the middle and high pds caused by canopy shading therefore it is obvious that low pd and frequent irrigation would highly increase the ke in general frequent irrigation events to ensure fi along with fully wetted soil surface has contributed to high soil evaporation component ke in the dual kc 3 3 root growth characteristics fig 3 shows the average rld of the three different planting densities down to 120 cm soil depth the average rld ranged between about 8 cm cm 3 at the topsoil layer to around 1 cm cm 3 at the deep soil layers the rld data of the three pds were pooled to gain a global root length density profile of quinoa under full irrigation in fact the variations of rld in each soil depth under different pds show the extent that pd may affect root growth the error bars in fig 3 represent rld variations among the three pds the highest variations in rld large error bars are observed in the top 0 40 cm and the error bars of the deeper soil depths are almost identical large error bars obviously indicate that the three pds affected rld mostly in the top soil layers 0 40 cm and their effect on rld diminished in the deeper depths let s say below 40 cm in the topsoil layer rld started decreasing sharply and in depth of 40 50 cm reached nearly 2 1 cm cm 3 obviously most roots were produced in the top 50 cm and root growth reached relatively constant values down to 120 cm it indicates that the most effective rooting zone of quinoa might be restricted to the top 50 cm though still high amounts of roots were present in the deeper soil depths that could substantially contribute to soil water uptake the average rmd of the three different pds are shown in fig 4 rmd varied between 1 87 mg cm 3 and 0 04 mg cm 3 in the top soil and deep soil layers respectively the rmd sharply decreased below 20 cm soil depth and reached to around 0 12 mg cm 3 in the 30 120 cm soil profile large error bars of rmd in fig 3 shows that the rmd variations among the three pds mainly occurred in the top 20 cm below which the pds had no effect on root mass this implies that quinoa produced a vigorous root system in the top 20 cm layer fig 4 shows the srl variations in different soil depth averaged across the three pds interestingly three distinct srl patterns are identified in the top 0 50 cm srl continuously increased from ca 50 m g 1 near soil surface to ca 350 m g 1 at the 50 cm depth srl remained almost constant ca 220 m g 1 in the middle layer 50 90 cm at the deep layer 90 120 cm srl had fluctuations from 220 m g 1 with a tendency to increase to 500 m g 1 at the deepest soil layer unlike the rld and rmd that the largest error bars were observed in the shallow layers indicating large variability among the three pds the largest error bars of the srl were associated to the deep layers this may imply that pds have affected the srl and root size mostly in the deep layers 3 4 cumulative rld rmd and srl fig 5 illustrates the average cumulative rld crld of the three different pds clearly 50 and 75 of the total root length has been accumulated in the 0 30 and 0 70 cm of soil layer respectively the average cumulative rmd crmd of the three pds indicates that 57 and 75 of total root mass was found in the 0 10 and 10 20 cm layers respectively the soil layer 20 120 cm accommodated only 25 of the total root mass the cumulative srl csrl follows well the patterns of crld and crmd notably csrl followed the pattern of crld in the top 0 50 cm and deep 90 120 cm where root length variations controlled the srl variation in the middle zone of 50 90 cm the pattern mostly followed the crmd where root becomes thinner with lower root mass 3 5 grain yield water productivity and water use efficiency fig 6 shows the grain yield in the three pds grain yield varied between 2 86 mg ha 1 and 3 65 mg ha 1 the low pd had the lowest grain yield and the highest grain yield was observed in the middle pd the grain yield in the high pd was 3 02 mg ha 1 that was 6 more than the low pd and 17 lower than the middle pd because of plant competition in capturing light and soil resources grain yield in high pd may have decreased though this reduction is also probable in lower pds due to lower number of plant population fig 6 however plants in the low pds may compensate yield gap by increasing the number of branches and higher plant heights compared with the middle and high pds the middle pd that produced the maximum grain yield and branch numbers fig 7 the lowest branching was observed in the high pd in the other words branching increased ca 26 by decreasing pd this might suggest an upper limit of 30 35 branches for compensating ability and represents that quinoa s branching has genetically a limitation and it does not exceed the specified limit which ultimately affect final biomass and grain yield jacobsen and stølen 1993 table 3 shows wp and wue in the three pds it is obvious that the middle pd resulted in the highest wp and wue although the lowest and highest pds had almost identical wps they were very different based on wue this means that the lowest pd used water more efficiently than the high pd even though it resulted in about 50 soil evaporation therefore the effect of pd on wue and wp is considerable due to variations in grain yield and biomass fig 6 4 discussion unlike the common idea that quinoa is a water saving crop our results showed strongly contrasting findings under fi quinoa could adapt its growth under diverse growing condition when fully irrigated it uses high amount of water as found in this study table 2 generally quinoa keeps relatively high stomatal conductance hinojosa et al 2018 razzaghi et al 2012 and keeps high leaf water potential and stomata density even under water stress razzaghi et al 2012 issa ali et al 2019 jacobsen et al 2009 that results in high transpiration when vpd and air temperature are high fig 1 in addition it seems that the newly bred and fast growing q5 cultivar targeted for the hot and arid regions of mena azaykou et al 2018 hirich 2016 choukr allah et al 2016 is very susceptible to high temperatures during the growing season fig 1 and can produce good grain yield fig 6 which agrees well with benlhabib et al 2015 findings in morocco that only early flowering quinoa cultivars can survive from the 47 c indeed tolerance of quinoa to high temperature as high as 35 c in this experiment or elsewhere in the world choukr allah et al 2016 noulas et al 2015 benlhabib et al 2015 is accompanied by higher stomata conductance and sizes hinojosa et al 2019a b becker et al 2017 hirich 2016 studies have shown that quinoa cultivars that are tolerant to high temperature reveal high stomatal conductance as a physiological mechanism to keep evaporative cooling and heat dissipation through transpiration under sufficient water supply and full irrigation hinojosa et al 2019a b kaushal et al 2016 yang et al 2016 as evidenced in our study through cooler leaf temperature average ca 25 5 c than ambient air temperature average ca 36 c in the noon 13 14 pm during the peak water requirement period for five consecutive measurement days between 96 dap and 100 dap in this regard jensen et al 2000 found stomatal conductance as high as 1 2 mol m 2 s 1 under field conditions and cool humid climate in denmark moreover in agreement with our findings increase of stomatal conductance was positively correlated with tolerance to high temperature for allowing better leaf cooling at 38 c in a recent study of tomato varieties poudyal et al 2019 so if quinoa has the ability to increase stomatal conductance under hot conditions it might to some extent explain the very high kcb values found in the study fig 2 therefore it is concluded that q5 is a super heat tolerant quinoa cultivar that is able to survive under high temperatures but it uses so much water for cooling hirich 2016 this super cooling behavior might soon turn into a drought and water stress problem although quinoa is well recognized for its high tolerance to water stress and drought conditions 4 1 why quinoa showed high kc and kcb the kc values show that the quinoa plants had a very large amount of evapotranspiration and transpiration in any of the three pds the very high transpiration capacity of quinoa under high evaporative demand fig 1 reflects its outstanding and particular physiological property such as highly vigorous and large root system fig 3 and high number of stomata size and conductance hinojosa et al 2019a b becker et al 2017 kaushal et al 2016 yang et al 2016 that facilitate water uptake and transpiration respectively this is very interesting to observe that quinoa reveals such a very high and uncommon kc value in the semi arid area compared with that obtained for the other field crops in the fao 56 paper allen et al 56 in a lysimeter study triana et al 2015 determined that kc varied from 0 4 to 1 9 for giant reed and 0 3 to 1 6 for miscanthus in a mediterranean climate in addition our kc values were particularly higher than the maximum kc value of 1 0 in high elevation and cold region of bolivia garcia et al 2003 and 1 22 in the temperate and humid region in denmark razzaghi et al 2012 nevertheless the large and distinct differences of kc and kcb between our study and the former ones could be strongly due to the climate that is the driving force for crop evapotranspiration indeed researches in the study area have revealed the existence of a strong regional advection effect of sensible heat flux from april until september that is caused by horizontal transfer of hot and dry air of the prevailing westerly wind malek 1987 1982 sepaskhah and reissi 1979 fig 8 shows the advection correction factor α defined as the α e t c r n where rn is the net radiation malek 1987 fig 8 shows that α values are greater than 1 and ranges between 1 15 in the last stage and 1 37 in the third stages respectively which means there is a regional advection during the growing period from an energy point of view higher regionally horizontal sensible heat flux has provided more energy to sustain high transpiration and soil evaporation rates that ultimately resulted in high kc and kcb overall it is concluded that a combination of physiological characteristics of quinoa vigorous and extensive root growth in the whole rooting zone fig 3 together with very high atmospheric demand has categorized quinoa as a super crop that uses so much water under full irrigation in dry and hot climates to survive so proper irrigation scheduling of quinoa in hot and dry environment is required to maintain economic yield via preventing eto underestimation de bruin and trigo 2019 kool et al 2018 figuerola and berlinger 2005 several agronomic and irrigation managements such as surface or subsurface drip irrigations mulching and water saving irrigation deficit and partial root zone drying irrigations are recommended in hot and dry environment for reducing water loss and soil evaporation so far the majority of the studies focused on the quinoa ability against abiotic stresses water and salinity stress but very few elaborated to evaluate the quinoa potential growth under no abiotic stresses when grown under hot and dry temperature and in this study we successfully showed the potential of quinoa to survive in such climates further studies are recommended if one particular life stage proves to be the yield limiting factor for yield then that particular stage could be targeted for quinoa breeding improvement peterson and murphy 2015 bazile and baudron 2015 4 2 root the rld and rmd were both high in the shallow soil layers and thus it is easy to conclude that the highest soil water uptake would take places in this rooting zone though some modeling efforts in various geographic locations and quinoa cultivars have shown that the effective rooting zone of quinoa for water uptake ranged between 30 cm geerts et al 2009 50 cm fghire et al 2015 55 cm pulvento et al 2015b and 60 cm pulvento et al 2015b geerts et al 2009 however since in this study the quinoa crops were fully irrigated every 3 4 days therefore root grew potentially the average rld at the deep 120 cm was 1 37 cm cm 3 that is pretty much more than the rld compared with the other agronomic crops at this soil depth ahmadi et al 2018 2017 2011 xu et al 2016 even though most variations of root length of quinoa under the three pds was the top 50 cm fig 3 evidences of high rld in the deep layers clearly imply that a proper irrigation management and scheduling of quinoa should take into account of the full and very extensive root zone of quinoa to increase the irrigation interval and thereby reduce soil evaporation the current study is the first one of its kind to evaluate the potential root growth and characteristics of quinoa considering different pds indeed pd could modify root growth traits and their influences in crop breeding for greater crop productivity should be understood in the context of high pds hecht et al 2016 we do not know yet whether grain yield of quinoa is correlated better with rmd or rld as there are contrasting studies that reported in some crops yield matched better with rld ahmadi et al 2018 mackerron et al 2007 blum 2005 or rmd ahmadi et al 2017 lahlou and ledent 2006 gregory et al 1997 obviously high root growth in either forms of rld or rmd implies metabolic costs of crop for soil exploration by the crop root system such that crop should invest on and allocate more carbon to the below ground lambers et al 2002 lynch and ho 2005 however there exists a trade off between root growth to capture water on one hand rld benefit and translocation of more photosynthetic assimilates to the root system rmd on the other hand cost higher srl indicates longer and thinner roots meaning more root proliferation and soil resource acquisition by exploration of larger soil volume per unit carbon investment in root length compared with that in lower srl shorter and thicker roots corneo et al 2017 ho et al 2005 lowest srl at the shallowest depth and the highest srl at the deepest layers indicate that quinoa has produced short and thick roots at the soil surface while long and thin roots are produced at the deep depths respectively which is in agreement with carvalho and foulkes 2013 that development of thick roots low srl in the shallow soil layers under full irrigation compared to the water stressed conditions is a necessity for the whole root system to support a vigorous plant and facilitate water uptake and transpiration demand as was observed in our study fig 4 we used aquacrop steduto et al 2009 for simulating grain yield biomass and soil water content of our data and found it very poor in simulating soil water content data not shown we propose that aquacrop model should consider regional advection in hot and dry regions possibility to modify kc for super crops in hot and dry environments and more flexible root water uptake pattern for crop species or varieties that may show special root growth pattern yet we have no detailed information of the root water uptake pattern of quinoa but now we at least know that deep roots might be very active in water uptake because large amount of roots rld 1 cm cm 3 is still found in 120 cm that might not be very common for a field crop this might be in contrast with schenk and jackson 2002 that reported plants in warm climates and high etc tend to have shallow rooting depth and short root length which implies quinoa does not follow this mechanism and its root growth even in hot climate is large that is a mechanism to survive and cool when water is sufficient 4 3 grain yield and water productivity the results showed that high pd might not necessraily lead to a remarkable yield difference compared with that obtained in the low pd this is in line with the plant density tolerance concept which is defined as a plant cultivar ability to maintain improve yield with increasing pd shao et al 2018 mansfield and mumm 2014 our results are in agreement with hirich 2016 who reported the grain yield of q5 cultivar of 3 9 mg ha 1 in morrcoo in addition choukr allah et al 2016 evaluated the q5 cultivar in five diverse geographic locations in the united arab emirates and reported that the grain yield varied largely between 2 mg ha 1 to 10 mg ha 1 they also tested the q5 cultivar in uzbekistan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan in different climatic conditions that were significantly different in soil types and agronomic practices and reported grain yield of 0 4 mg ha 1 in kyrgyzstan to about 5 5 mg ha 1 in uzbekistan choukr allah et al 2016 icba 2015 it is evident that high grain yields that were obtained in some agro climatic conditions in the different geographic locations indicate the great grain yield potential therefore identyfying the desirable cultivars should be followed by optimising the agronomic practices to maximize productivity under the local conditions incluidng the optimum pd nevertheless our results are in contrast with the results of spehar et al 2009 who reported that there was no relation between plantting densities due to quinoa s compensation charcaterstics by generating additional branching to increase canopy cover and increased grain yield which is also reported elsewhere as the number of lateral branches depends on quinoa genotype and crop conditions sosa zuniga et al 2017 they reported stable grain yield of 2 5 mg ha 1 in the range of 105 to 7 105 plant ha 1 based on the previous studies on quinoa pd delatorre herrera 2003 johnson and croissant 1985 and our detailed field it seems that the optimum pd of quinoa basically depneds on cultivar climate and agronomic practices which should be determied experimentally therefore by planting more number of plants per unit area it is not possible to harvest more crop and increase land productivity mangalassery et al 2019 fischer et al 2019 it is noteworthy that wp varies at the temporal and spatial scales and is not thoroughly a crop characteristic but it is also largely affected by climate condition molden et al 2003 bowen 2003 therefore wp is site specific and observed wp in each environment indicates the potential of that climate to achieve a certain amount of wp bowen 2003 to provide a feasible tool to compare wps between climates wp should be normalized wp by the reference evapotranspiration eto steduto et al 2007 which is the core of the aquacrop model for accurate simulation of grain yield and biomass ahmadi et al 2015 steduto et al 2009 eqs 6 and 7 although wp is a conservative parameter and does not generally change for a specific crop table 3 implies that wp may vary in different pds especially for the grain yield though it needs further investigations therefore whether the aquacrop model is used for simulating irrigation management strategies it is suggested to consider the appropriate locally calibrated wp for the specified pd that it is also already calibrated for five wheat pds in the study area ranging from 120 kg to 280 kg ha 1 bahadori 2011 5 conclusion fully irrigated quinoa cv q5 was grown under three planting densities of 150 000 185 000 and 270 000 in drainable lysimeters under hot and dry condition of south of iran it was found that the highest grain yield was observed in the middle planting density of 3 65 mg ha 1 quinoa showed a very high crop evapotranspiration and transpiration rates that resulted in high single and dual crop coefficients that were higher than the common values for the other field crops the main reasons of high single dual crop coefficients were high soil evaporation rate due to frequent irrigations regional advection that considerably increased evapotranspiration and transpiration and the vigorous root system that facilitated high soil water uptake based on these results it was concluded that quinoa has a specific physiological systems that transpire continually to cool off the leaves that resulted in high water use the vigorous root system that extends down to 1 2 m with high root length in the deep layer of 1 2 m rld 1 cm cm 3 helps quinoa to supply the atmospheric demand which is an advantage to increase irrigation frequency and thereby reducing soil evaporation overall it is concluded that quinoa is a super crop that not only can tolerate abiotic stresses but also it can potentially grow well and produce yield in the hot and semi arid areas adapting appropriate planting density and irrigation management such as drip irrigation surface and subsurface mulching increasing irrigation interval attributed to the deep rooting system and water saving irrigation managements would substantially reduce soil evaporation and increase water productivity declaration of competing interest the

10875,quinoa is well known for its great ability to tolerate water stress however very little information is available about its potential growth under full irrigation particularly in hot and semi arid regions in this experiment a newly released quinoa cv q5 bred for hot and dry regions was grown under three planting densities pds of 150 000 185 000 and 270 000 in the drainable lysimeters south of iran the highest and lowest grain yields were observed in the middle and low pds of 3 65 mg ha 1 and 2 86 mg ha 1 respectively quinoa showed very high crop evapotranspiration etc and transpiration t rates etc and t varied in the range of 1448 1687 mm and 777 1228 mm among the pds respectively these high values resulted in high single crop coefficients kc that overall varied between around 1 and 2 4 during the growing season the basal crop coefficient kcb of the dual kc kc kcb ke reached about 1 9 and 1 2 in the high and low pds respectively indicating high transpiration capacity the main reasons of high kc and kcb were high soil evaporation rate due to very frequent irrigations of 3 4 days and soil wetting and the prevailing regional sensible heat advection that increased transpiration it was concluded that quinoa has a specific physiological systems that transpire continually for allowing better leaf cooling at high temperature which results in high water use moreover a vigorous root system that extended down to 1 2 m with high root length densities in the deep layers rld 1 cm cm 3 helped quinoa to supply the water use this extensive root system down to 1 2 m could help to increase irrigation interval and reducing soil evaporation however the effect of pd on the root length and root mass was mainly observed in the top 40 cm below which its effect diminished and root length and root mass were nearly identical among the pds overall it is concluded that quinoa q5 is a super crop that not only can tolerate water stress but also can potentially grow well and produce acceptable grain yield in the hot and semi arid areas adapting appropriate pd and irrigation management such as drip irrigation surface and subsurface mulching increasing irrigation interval attributed to the deep rooting system and water saving irrigation managements would substantially reduce soil evaporation and increase water productivity keywords quinoa planting density evapotranspiration crop coefficients root growth grain yield water productivity 1 introduction accurate estimation of irrigation water requirement is important for irrigation planning in the arid and semi arid climates in these areas reducing evaporation is a challenge to increase water use efficiency wue evaporation from soil surface has been reported 30 of the seasonal maize and wheat etc in the south of iran shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 plant density pd which may increase yield is a potential approach to reduce soil evaporation shuttleworth and wallace 1985 appropriate pd with minimum plant competition can increase yield production and wue previous studies showed that pd played an important role in canola production through significant effect on branching french et al 2016 diepenbrock 2000 however low pd would result in high soil evaporation and reduced yield on the other hand high pd may decrease soil evaporation but would induce competition for water and nutrient uptake among plants that leads to yield decline nasiri et al 2017 however high pd may prevent light penetration into lower canopy layers that reduces photosynthesis which in turn leads to decreased evapotranspiration therefore it seems there should be an optimum pd in different regions to reach maximum grain yield root growth behavior plays a major role in irrigation management root distribution depends on crop characteristic soil water content soil texture and structure ahmadi et al 2011 van wijk 2011 root length density rld and root mass density rmd are the popular root features that characterize the root system size in soil profile in addition specific root length srl as the ratio of rld to rmd represents root thickness and is an important factor in water uptake capacity and exploration ability of roots ostonen et al 2007 quinoa is a c3 andean crop and is well adapted to grow in poor soils and extreme climatic conditions razzaghi et al 2011 garcia et al 2003 in addition to its great adaptability to harsh environments and global changing due to its valuable and wide genetic diversity bazile and baudron 2015 jacobsen and stølen 1993 quinoa is rapidly gaining global interest because of higher protein content 14 18 oil content 6 compared to 2 in cereals nutrients excellent quality of their proteins good balance of all amino acids and their high content of minerals and vitamins that would be part of a healthy food diet jacobsen 2015 bazile and baudron 2015 in this regard the united nations declared the international year of quinoa in 2013 bazile and santivanez 2015 quinoa cultivation has been expanded globally bazile and baudron 2015 in europe africa and asia such as italy pulvento et al 2015a b 2013 turkey yazar et al 2015 france piva et al 2015 greece noulas et al 2015 morocco azaykou et al 2018 benlhabib et al 2015 india bhargava and ohri 2015 and the mediterranean regions choukr allah et al 2016 due to proper and modernized irrigation systems quinoa has responded well to deficit irrigation that was highly beneficial in various experimental locations where grain yield was hardly affected by deficit irrigation yazar et al 2015 razzaghi et al 2012 2011 geerts et al 2008a b although the literatures emphasized that quinoa has good potential for water stress and harsh environments such as drought salinity and temperature hinojosa et al 2018 choukr allah et al 2016 noulas et al 2015 razzaghi et al 2011 geerts et al 2009 there are few studies that suggested full irrigation increases quinoa grain yield and biomass compared to deficit irrigation walters et al 2016 fghire et al 2015 yazar et al 2015 several attempts bred new quinoa cultivars that are susceptible for growth in the marginal arid and hot environments of middle east and north africa mena azaykou et al 2018 hirich 2016 choukr allah et al 2016 except few studies in the arid and semi arid mediterranean regions fghire et al 2015 yazar et al 2015 jacobsen et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge there are no other field studies in hot and arid environments with high temperature during the growing season in addition due to the large differences between diverse quinoa genotypes and climate conditions bazile and baudron 2015 there is a gap on determining the optimum pd of quinoa so the targets of this study were set i to determine quinoa water requirement and single and dual crop coefficients of quinoa in three pds ii to determine potential grain yield water use efficiency and water productivity in three pds and iii to determine the root growth traits and characteristics rld rmd and srl 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted during the spring and summer of 2018 in three experimental lysimeters in the bajgah area faculty of agriculture shiraz university iran 29 36 n 52 32 e that is a sunny high level valley 1810 msl the drainable lysimeters had an area of 2 m2 and a depth of 1 7 m some soil physical properties of the soil are summarized in table 1 the study area is located in a semi arid area with a warm climate and long term annual average rainfall of about 386 mm ahmadi et al 2018 meteorological data were obtained from a nearby station located just 10 m from the lysimeters the main metrological data are shown in fig 1 the reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated by the penman montieth equation allen et al 1998 2 2 crop cultivation the newly released fast growing and early maturing quinoa variety q5 accession no nsl 106 398 provided by the international center for biosaline agriculture was sown on april 11 2018 in three different pds of 270 000 high 185 000 middle and 150 000 low plants per ha in three circular drainable lysimeters at 0 20 m 0 25 m and 0 30 m space between row and 0 15 m inter row spacing respectively this led to 7 5 and 4 planting rows in the lysimeters each lysimeter was assigned to one of the planting densities surrounding area was cultivated with the same plant the total area of cultivating was 100 m2 weeds were removed by hand frequently when appeared and thus there was no weed stress during the growing season 350 kg n ha 1 as urea was supplied to prevent any nitrogen deficiency and fertility stress according to unpublished preliminary assessment in the study area and ørum et al 2013 that indicated that n application rate up to 375 or even higher would increase potential grain yield 2 3 irrigation management and crop evapotranspiration crops in the three lysimeters were fully irrigated during the growing season the irrigation events were done every 3 4 days to prevent any water stress soil water content was measured by neutron probe in each lysimeter separately seven times during the growing season drainage water was collected in containers that were placed in an underground room below each lysimeter crop evapotranspiration etc was measured by the water balance method 1 etc p i d δw where etc is the crop evapotranspiration mm p is rainfall mm i is the irrigation water depth mm d is the deep percolation mm and δw mm is the change in soil water content between two soil water content measurements using the neutron meter in 0 20 m intervals soil evaporation e was measured by micro lysimeters that were pvc tubes with a 0 30 m height and 0 09 m diameter they were filled with the same soil of lysimeters and were placed between rows and in the same elevation with soil surface they were irrigated with other crops and weighed immediately before and a day after each irrigation to allow free drainage of excess water the weight difference during two irrigation events resulted in soil evaporation the single crop coefficient kc was obtained by the ratio of etc and eto as 2 k c e t c e t o the dual crop coefficient obtained from the ratio

water productivity crops were harvested on september 4 2018 146 days after planting dap when all seeds were fully ripened and dry according to the guidelines of sosa zuniga et al 2017 plant height and total number of productive branches were measured the heads were cut off from shoots and then the shoots were cut off above the soil surface for dry mater measurement seeds were separated from the coating and weighted by a precision balance 1 mg to determine grain yield gy shoot was oven dried at 80 c for 48 h and weighted to measure shoot biomass the total biomass b was calculated as the sum

i and n is the total number of growth stage periods 2 5 root sampling and measurement soil cores were collected by a 0 05 m diameter and 1 2 m height hand driven augar soil cores were divided into 10 cm parts and were kept in plastic bags and were stored at 6 c the samples were sink in a 3 l pot for 24 h and later the roots were separated from the soil by mildly shaking the mixture the buoyant roots were collected by a 250 μm mesh size sieve the previous procedure was repeated until no more roots were seen in water ahmadi et al 2017 after segregating the living roots in a suitable plate the singular fresh root samples were collected by a 250 μm mesh size sieve the root samples were placed in some bottles and 10 acetic acid solution were add to them and stored 6 c for further analysis the root length cm was determined by the newman method ahmadi et al 2011 and then converted to rld cm cm 3 based on the associated soil volume 196 25 cm3 for 0 10 m soil section after determining the root

water total soil surface evaporation and total transpiration are shown in table 2 crop etc varied between nearly 1500 and 1690 mm among the three pds which demonstrates the effect of plant population on crop etc maximum etc was related to the high pd due to greater plant population though the minimum etc was observed in the middle pd although low pd had less plant population it had greater etc than the middle pd because lower pds caused greater soil evaporation due to less shading the high and middle pds had 58 and 20 higher t than the lowest pd similarly the low and middle pds increased e by 56 and 13 compared to the high pd soil evaporation was 27 36 and 48 of the total seasonal etc of quinoa for high to low pds respectively table 2 which e accounts for nearly half of total etc in the low pd in our study high and middle pd had an acceptable amount of evaporation that was in the range of local soil evaporation of 30 2 and 29 8 of the total etc for wheat and maize respectively shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 however evaporation in low pd was considerably high 3 2 crop coefficients 3 2 1 single kc the single kc values are shown in fig 2 the kc values are time averaged and determined for each growth period i at the first glance it is clear that the kc values are much higher than the common accepted values for the other crops reported in the literature and reference fao56 allen et al 1998 the three pds showed different responses to kc but the highest difference were seen in the third and fifth stages in the other stages the differences are not considerable the highest and lowest kc values that occurred in the middle growth stage kcmid are 1 9 and 2 4 corresponding to the lowest and highest pds respectively in the fifth stage that is attributed to the late middle growth stage however the highest and lowest kc values of 2 1 and 1 6 were related to high and middle pds respectively in fact it seems that it is not probably possible to assign a single kcmid for the middle growth stage due to high kc variations unlike the third growth stage the minimum value was related to the middle pd while the low pd had higher single kc in this growth stage despite lower plant population it shows that low pd had higher rates of et in this growth stage which seems higher soil evaporation rates had higher weight in kc this issue is discussed in details in the dual kc section at the end of the growing season 147 dap single kc values substantially decreased due to the canopy senescence single kc values ranged between 0 96 and 1 21 which were related to the middle and high pds respectively similar to the previous growth stage the effect of direct soil evaporation caused higher single kc values in low pd compared to middle pd generally this represents the effect of pd in single kc which is directly related to water consumption and indirectly related to water productivity 3 2 2 dual kc the kc is equal to kcb ke the single kc integrates the effect of both crop transpiration t and soil evaporation e into a single crop coefficient the dual kc differentiates evaporation and transpiration during the growing season that elucidate the consumptive t and non consumptive e components of crop coefficient the highest kcb was observed in the third kcb 1 75 and fifth kcb 1 63 growth stages of the high pd fig 2 the kcb values show that t in high pd is maximum due to more plant population the lowest kcb values were also mostly found in the first period initial stage and the last period late season stage notably the low pd had higher kcb higher transpiration than the middle pd in the second and last growth periods fig 2 the maximum ke values occurred in the low pd as high as ca 0 82 during the middle growth stage fig 2 that coincided with the highest air temperature and vpd fig 1 such high ke value in the low pd is due to low canopy shading on soil surface and frequent irrigation events every 3 4 days to ensure sufficient soil water for transpiration it is seen that in the same growth period fourth and fifth stages the ke substantially declined to around 0 35 in the middle and high pds caused by canopy shading therefore it is obvious that low pd and frequent irrigation would highly increase the ke in general frequent irrigation events to ensure fi along with fully wetted soil surface has contributed to high soil evaporation component ke in the dual kc 3 3 root growth characteristics fig 3 shows the average rld of the three different planting densities down to 120 cm soil depth the average rld ranged between about 8 cm cm 3 at the topsoil layer to around 1 cm cm 3 at the deep soil layers the rld data of the three pds were pooled to gain a global root length density profile of quinoa under full irrigation in fact the variations of rld in each soil depth under different pds show the extent that pd may affect root growth the error bars in fig 3 represent rld variations among the three pds the highest variations in rld large error bars are observed in the top 0 40 cm and the error bars of the deeper soil depths are almost identical large error bars obviously indicate that the three pds affected rld mostly in the top soil layers 0 40 cm and their effect on rld diminished in the deeper depths let s say below 40 cm in the topsoil layer rld started decreasing sharply and in depth of 40 50 cm reached nearly 2 1 cm cm 3 obviously most roots were produced in the top 50 cm and root growth reached relatively constant values down to 120 cm it indicates that the most effective rooting zone of quinoa might be restricted to the top 50 cm though still high amounts of roots were present in the deeper soil depths that could substantially contribute to soil water uptake the average rmd of the three different pds are shown in fig 4 rmd varied between 1 87 mg cm 3 and 0 04 mg cm 3 in the top soil and deep soil layers respectively the rmd sharply decreased below 20 cm soil depth and reached to around 0 12 mg cm 3 in the 30 120 cm soil profile large error bars of rmd in fig 3 shows that the rmd variations among the three pds mainly occurred in the top 20 cm below which the pds had no effect on root mass this implies that quinoa produced a vigorous root system in the top 20 cm layer fig 4 shows the srl variations in different soil depth averaged across the three pds interestingly three distinct srl patterns are identified in the top 0 50 cm srl continuously increased from ca 50 m g 1 near soil surface to ca 350 m g 1 at the 50 cm depth srl remained almost constant ca 220 m g 1 in the middle layer 50 90 cm at the deep layer 90 120 cm srl had fluctuations from 220 m g 1 with a tendency to increase to 500 m g 1 at the deepest soil layer unlike the rld and rmd that the largest error bars were observed in the shallow layers indicating large variability among the three pds the largest error bars of the srl were associated to the deep layers this may imply that pds have affected the srl and root size mostly in the deep layers 3 4 cumulative rld rmd and srl fig 5 illustrates the average cumulative rld crld of the three different pds clearly 50 and 75 of the total root length has been accumulated in the 0 30 and 0 70 cm of soil layer respectively the average cumulative rmd crmd of the three pds indicates that 57 and 75 of total root mass was found in the 0 10 and 10 20 cm layers respectively the soil layer 20 120 cm accommodated only 25 of the total root mass the cumulative srl csrl follows well the patterns of crld and crmd notably csrl followed the pattern of crld in the top 0 50 cm and deep 90 120 cm where root length variations controlled the srl variation in the middle zone of 50 90 cm the pattern mostly followed the crmd where root becomes thinner with lower root mass 3 5 grain yield water productivity and water use efficiency fig 6 shows the grain yield in the three pds grain yield varied between 2 86 mg ha 1 and 3 65 mg ha 1 the low pd had the lowest grain yield and the highest grain yield was observed in the middle pd the grain yield in the high pd was 3 02 mg ha 1 that was 6 more than the low pd and 17 lower than the middle pd because of plant competition in capturing light and soil resources grain yield in high pd may have decreased though this reduction is also probable in lower pds due to lower number of plant population fig 6 however plants in the low pds may compensate yield gap by increasing the number of branches and higher plant heights compared with the middle and high pds the middle pd that produced the maximum grain yield and branch numbers fig 7 the lowest branching was observed in the high pd in the other words branching increased ca 26 by decreasing pd this might suggest an upper limit of 30 35 branches for compensating ability and represents that quinoa s branching has genetically a limitation and it does not exceed the specified limit which ultimately affect final biomass and grain yield jacobsen and stølen 1993 table 3 shows wp and wue in the three pds it is obvious that the middle pd resulted in the highest wp and wue although the lowest and highest pds had almost identical wps they were very different based on wue this means that the lowest pd used water more efficiently than the high pd even though it resulted in about 50 soil evaporation therefore the effect of pd on wue and wp is considerable due to variations in grain yield and biomass fig 6 4 discussion unlike the common idea that quinoa is a water saving crop our results showed strongly contrasting findings under fi quinoa could adapt its growth under diverse growing condition when fully irrigated it uses high amount of water as found in this study table 2 generally quinoa keeps relatively high stomatal conductance hinojosa et al 2018 razzaghi et al 2012 and keeps high leaf water potential and stomata density even under water stress razzaghi et al 2012 issa ali et al 2019 jacobsen et al 2009 that results in high transpiration when vpd and air temperature are high fig 1 in addition it seems that the newly bred and fast growing q5 cultivar targeted for the hot and arid regions of mena azaykou et al 2018 hirich 2016 choukr allah et al 2016 is very susceptible to high temperatures during the growing season fig 1 and can produce good grain yield fig 6 which agrees well with benlhabib et al 2015 findings in morocco that only early flowering quinoa cultivars can survive from the 47 c indeed tolerance of quinoa to high temperature as high as 35 c in this experiment or elsewhere in the world choukr allah et al 2016 noulas et al 2015 benlhabib et al 2015 is accompanied by higher stomata conductance and sizes hinojosa et al 2019a b becker et al 2017 hirich 2016 studies have shown that quinoa cultivars that are tolerant to high temperature reveal high stomatal conductance as a physiological mechanism to keep evaporative cooling and heat dissipation through transpiration under sufficient water supply and full irrigation hinojosa et al 2019a b kaushal et al 2016 yang et al 2016 as evidenced in our study through cooler leaf temperature average ca 25 5 c than ambient air temperature average ca 36 c in the noon 13 14 pm during the peak water requirement period for five consecutive measurement days between 96 dap and 100 dap in this regard jensen et al 2000 found stomatal conductance as high as 1 2 mol m 2 s 1 under field conditions and cool humid climate in denmark moreover in agreement with our findings increase of stomatal conductance was positively correlated with tolerance to high temperature for allowing better leaf cooling at 38 c in a recent study of tomato varieties poudyal et al 2019 so if quinoa has the ability to increase stomatal conductance under hot conditions it might to some extent explain the very high kcb values found in the study fig 2 therefore it is concluded that q5 is a super heat tolerant quinoa cultivar that is able to survive under high temperatures but it uses so much water for cooling hirich 2016 this super cooling behavior might soon turn into a drought and water stress problem although quinoa is well recognized for its high tolerance to water stress and drought conditions 4 1 why quinoa showed high kc and kcb the kc values show that the quinoa plants had a very large amount of evapotranspiration and transpiration in any of the three pds the very high transpiration capacity of quinoa under high evaporative demand fig 1 reflects its outstanding and particular physiological property such as highly vigorous and large root system fig 3 and high number of stomata size and conductance hinojosa et al 2019a b becker et al 2017 kaushal et al 2016 yang et al 2016 that facilitate water uptake and transpiration respectively this is very interesting to observe that quinoa reveals such a very high and uncommon kc value in the semi arid area compared with that obtained for the other field crops in the fao 56 paper allen et al 56 in a lysimeter study triana et al 2015 determined that kc varied from 0 4 to 1 9 for giant reed and 0 3 to 1 6 for miscanthus in a mediterranean climate in addition our kc values were particularly higher than the maximum kc value of 1 0 in high elevation and cold region of bolivia garcia et al 2003 and 1 22 in the temperate and humid region in denmark razzaghi et al 2012 nevertheless the large and distinct differences of kc and kcb between our study and the former ones could be strongly due to the climate that is the driving force for crop evapotranspiration indeed researches in the study area have revealed the existence of a strong regional advection effect of sensible heat flux from april until september that is caused by horizontal transfer of hot and dry air of the prevailing westerly wind malek 1987 1982 sepaskhah and reissi 1979 fig 8 shows the advection correction factor α defined as the α e t c r n where rn is the net radiation malek 1987 fig 8 shows that α values are greater than 1 and ranges between 1 15 in the last stage and 1 37 in the third stages respectively which means there is a regional advection during the growing period from an energy point of view higher regionally horizontal sensible heat flux has provided more energy to sustain high transpiration and soil evaporation rates that ultimately resulted in high kc and kcb overall it is concluded that a combination of physiological characteristics of quinoa vigorous and extensive root growth in the whole rooting zone fig 3 together with very high atmospheric demand has categorized quinoa as a super crop that uses so much water under full irrigation in dry and hot climates to survive so proper irrigation scheduling of quinoa in hot and dry environment is required to maintain economic yield via preventing eto underestimation de bruin and trigo 2019 kool et al 2018 figuerola and berlinger 2005 several agronomic and irrigation managements such as surface or subsurface drip irrigations mulching and water saving irrigation deficit and partial root zone drying irrigations are recommended in hot and dry environment for reducing water loss and soil evaporation so far the majority of the studies focused on the quinoa ability against abiotic stresses water and salinity stress but very few elaborated to evaluate the quinoa potential growth under no abiotic stresses when grown under hot and dry temperature and in this study we successfully showed the potential of quinoa to survive in such climates further studies are recommended if one particular life stage proves to be the yield limiting factor for yield then that particular stage could be targeted for quinoa breeding improvement peterson and murphy 2015 bazile and baudron 2015 4 2 root the rld and rmd were both high in the shallow soil layers and thus it is easy to conclude that the highest soil water uptake would take places in this rooting zone though some modeling efforts in various geographic locations and quinoa cultivars have shown that the effective rooting zone of quinoa for water uptake ranged between 30 cm geerts et al 2009 50 cm fghire et al 2015 55 cm pulvento et al 2015b and 60 cm pulvento et al 2015b geerts et al 2009 however since in this study the quinoa crops were fully irrigated every 3 4 days therefore root grew potentially the average rld at the deep 120 cm was 1 37 cm cm 3 that is pretty much more than the rld compared with the other agronomic crops at this soil depth ahmadi et al 2018 2017 2011 xu et al 2016 even though most variations of root length of quinoa under the three pds was the top 50 cm fig 3 evidences of high rld in the deep layers clearly imply that a proper irrigation management and scheduling of quinoa should take into account of the full and very extensive root zone of quinoa to increase the irrigation interval and thereby reduce soil evaporation the current study is the first one of its kind to evaluate the potential root growth and characteristics of quinoa considering different pds indeed pd could modify root growth traits and their influences in crop breeding for greater crop productivity should be understood in the context of high pds hecht et al 2016 we do not know yet whether grain yield of quinoa is correlated better with rmd or rld as there are contrasting studies that reported in some crops yield matched better with rld ahmadi et al 2018 mackerron et al 2007 blum 2005 or rmd ahmadi et al 2017 lahlou and ledent 2006 gregory et al 1997 obviously high root growth in either forms of rld or rmd implies metabolic costs of crop for soil exploration by the crop root system such that crop should invest on and allocate more carbon to the below ground lambers et al 2002 lynch and ho 2005 however there exists a trade off between root growth to capture water on one hand rld benefit and translocation of more photosynthetic assimilates to the root system rmd on the other hand cost higher srl indicates longer and thinner roots meaning more root proliferation and soil resource acquisition by exploration of larger soil volume per unit carbon investment in root length compared with that in lower srl shorter and thicker roots corneo et al 2017 ho et al 2005 lowest srl at the shallowest depth and the highest srl at the deepest layers indicate that quinoa has produced short and thick roots at the soil surface while long and thin roots are produced at the deep depths respectively which is in agreement with carvalho and foulkes 2013 that development of thick roots low srl in the shallow soil layers under full irrigation compared to the water stressed conditions is a necessity for the whole root system to support a vigorous plant and facilitate water uptake and transpiration demand as was observed in our study fig 4 we used aquacrop steduto et al 2009 for simulating grain yield biomass and soil water content of our data and found it very poor in simulating soil water content data not shown we propose that aquacrop model should consider regional advection in hot and dry regions possibility to modify kc for super crops in hot and dry environments and more flexible root water uptake pattern for crop species or varieties that may show special root growth pattern yet we have no detailed information of the root water uptake pattern of quinoa but now we at least know that deep roots might be very active in water uptake because large amount of roots rld 1 cm cm 3 is still found in 120 cm that might not be very common for a field crop this might be in contrast with schenk and jackson 2002 that reported plants in warm climates and high etc tend to have shallow rooting depth and short root length which implies quinoa does not follow this mechanism and its root growth even in hot climate is large that is a mechanism to survive and cool when water is sufficient 4 3 grain yield and water productivity the results showed that high pd might not necessraily lead to a remarkable yield difference compared with that obtained in the low pd this is in line with the plant density tolerance concept which is defined as a plant cultivar ability to maintain improve yield with increasing pd shao et al 2018 mansfield and mumm 2014 our results are in agreement with hirich 2016 who reported the grain yield of q5 cultivar of 3 9 mg ha 1 in morrcoo in addition choukr allah et al 2016 evaluated the q5 cultivar in five diverse geographic locations in the united arab emirates and reported that the grain yield varied largely between 2 mg ha 1 to 10 mg ha 1 they also tested the q5 cultivar in uzbekistan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan in different climatic conditions that were significantly different in soil types and agronomic practices and reported grain yield of 0 4 mg ha 1 in kyrgyzstan to about 5 5 mg ha 1 in uzbekistan choukr allah et al 2016 icba 2015 it is evident that high grain yields that were obtained in some agro climatic conditions in the different geographic locations indicate the great grain yield potential therefore identyfying the desirable cultivars should be followed by optimising the agronomic practices to maximize productivity under the local conditions incluidng the optimum pd nevertheless our results are in contrast with the results of spehar et al 2009 who reported that there was no relation between plantting densities due to quinoa s compensation charcaterstics by generating additional branching to increase canopy cover and increased grain yield which is also reported elsewhere as the number of lateral branches depends on quinoa genotype and crop conditions sosa zuniga et al 2017 they reported stable grain yield of 2 5 mg ha 1 in the range of 105 to 7 105 plant ha 1 based on the previous studies on quinoa pd delatorre herrera 2003 johnson and croissant 1985 and our detailed field it seems that the optimum pd of quinoa basically depneds on cultivar climate and agronomic practices which should be determied experimentally therefore by planting more number of plants per unit area it is not possible to harvest more crop and increase land productivity mangalassery et al 2019 fischer et al 2019 it is noteworthy that wp varies at the temporal and spatial scales and is not thoroughly a crop characteristic but it is also largely affected by climate condition molden et al 2003 bowen 2003 therefore wp is site specific and observed wp in each environment indicates the potential of that climate to achieve a certain amount of wp bowen 2003 to provide a feasible tool to compare wps between climates wp should be normalized wp by the reference evapotranspiration eto steduto et al 2007 which is the core of the aquacrop model for accurate simulation of grain yield and biomass ahmadi et al 2015 steduto et al 2009 eqs 6 and 7 although wp is a conservative parameter and does not generally change for a specific crop table 3 implies that wp may vary in different pds especially for the grain yield though it needs further investigations therefore whether the aquacrop model is used for simulating irrigation management strategies it is suggested to consider the appropriate locally calibrated wp for the specified pd that it is also already calibrated for five wheat pds in the study area ranging from 120 kg to 280 kg ha 1 bahadori 2011 5 conclusion fully irrigated quinoa cv q5 was grown under three planting densities of 150 000 185 000 and 270 000 in drainable lysimeters under hot and dry condition of south of iran it was found that the highest grain yield was observed in the middle planting density of 3 65 mg ha 1 quinoa showed a very high crop evapotranspiration and transpiration rates that resulted in high single and dual crop coefficients that were higher than the common values for the other field crops the main reasons of high single dual crop coefficients were high soil evaporation rate due to frequent irrigations regional advection that considerably increased evapotranspiration and transpiration and the vigorous root system that facilitated high soil water uptake based on these results it was concluded that quinoa has a specific physiological systems that transpire continually to cool off the leaves that resulted in high water use the vigorous root system that extends down to 1 2 m with high root length in the deep layer of 1 2 m rld 1 cm cm 3 helps quinoa to supply the atmospheric demand which is an advantage to increase irrigation frequency and thereby reducing soil evaporation overall it is concluded that quinoa is a super crop that not only can tolerate abiotic stresses but also it can potentially grow well and produce yield in the hot and semi arid areas adapting appropriate planting density and irrigation management such as drip irrigation surface and subsurface mulching increasing irrigation interval attributed to the deep rooting system and water saving irrigation managements would substantially reduce soil evaporation and increase water productivity declaration of competing interest the

10876,crop yield forecasting at the field level is essential for decision making and the prediction of agricultural economic returns for farmers thus this study evaluated the performance of a methodology for corn yield prediction in irrigated fields in the western region of the state of bahia brazil this methodology integrates a time series of the basal crop coefficient kcb estimated from the soil adjusted vegetation index savi into a simple model based on the water productivity as presented in the fao 66 manual in this context an extensive field level dataset of 52 center pivot fields of cultivated with corn was used for four consecutive growing seasons 2013 to 2016 surface reflectance images from the landsat series were used to calculate the savi the methodology performance was assessed through rmse rrmse mbe mae and r² the results revealed that the difference between the predicted and actual yield values ranged between 12 2 and 18 8 but that the majority of the estimates remained between 10 and 10 considering that a single harvest index hi was used for the hybrids cultivated in the growing seasons of 2014 2015 and 2016 after a new reanalysis by grouping the similar hybrids and using specific his the performance of the predictions increased especially for the pioneer hybrids the majority of the differences between the predicted yield values and the measured yield values remained between 5 and 5 the results of this research showed that it is essential to work with different his when considering different hybrids and years under different weather conditions keywords corn productivity biomass remote sensing data basal crop coefficient vegetation indices 1 introduction yield estimation prior to harvest plays a vital role in agricultural development worldwide jin et al 2018 and is fundamental to world food security decision making and crop management mokhtari et al 2018 xie et al 2017 therefore it is important to estimate crop yields prior to harvest as aboveground dry biomass agb through an effective methodology such as the use of crop growth models cgms a cgm translates the relationship between plants and the environment and considers the primary biophysical and biochemical processes in the soil crop atmosphere system which include photosynthesis respiration transpiration biomass yield and senescence simulating these processes at different time scales boote 1996 kasampalis et al 2018 wang et al 2013 however cgms have a great limitation for large scale applications in the lack of spatial information such as information on different crop varieties soil types and crop management practices guo et al 2017 huang et al 2019 kasampalis et al 2018 remote sensing rs data can provide nondestructive temporal information on plant responses to dynamic weather conditions and management practices at large scales with low cost foster et al 2019 battude et al 2016 frampton et al 2013 lin et al 2009 veloso et al 2017 thus this technology also shows a large potential for crop yield estimation as well as variability across fields and years there are three main approaches of rs methods to estimate biomass and yield according to sadras et al 2018 a biomass accumulation models b direct reflectance based empirical relationships on selected dates and c integration of rs derived variables into cgm the direct reflectance based empirical relationships on selected dates assume basically that the vigor of the crop canopy observed in the spectral rs data is directly related to the yield these models are relatively simple because these rs data yield relations are described in simple formulas but without any deeper physiological background ferencz et al 2004 kasampalis et al 2018 in addition these relationships must be locally calibrated considering the uncertainties related to the selection of the most representative date for the assessment of biomass production and spatial variability campos gonzález gómez et al 2018 biomass accumulation models normally consider the close relationship between biomass production and the photosynthetically active portion of solar radiation absorbed by the canopy daughtry et al 1992 liu et al 2010 monteith 1972 while the use of radiation energy for the estimation of plant biomass production represents the fundamental processes that govern crop growth and yield liu et al 2004 the integration of rs data with a cgm can be achieved by using two distinct methods doraiswamy et al 2013 in the first method a time series of remotely sensed measurements is used to calibrate the cgm in a second method the integration is performed by estimating crop parameters e g leaf area index and canopy cover or vegetation indices from rs data and using them as a direct inputs to the growth model maas 2010 according to huang et al 2019 combining cgm and rs data is desirable in other words the integration allows us to join the monitoring properties of rs data with the predictive and explanatory abilities of cgm forming a more effective approach given these advantages research has been conducted in this direction in recent years for monitoring crop growth status and estimating yield examples can be seen in the works of levitan and gross 2018 and ma et al 2013 it is important to point out that among the several available crop models in scientific literature that can be combined with rs data the aquacrop model is one of those that has been refined and updated to better simulate crop growth status and crop yield jin et al 2018 thus the coupling of this model with rs data is very interesting and a recent example of this combination is a model developed by campos et al 2018a b the methodology proposed by these authors integrates a time series of the basal crop coefficient kcb into the aquacrop crop growth and yield partitioning model steduto et al 2012 then the kcb is estimated from the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 by means of a calibrated linear equation campos et al 2017 in sequence kcb accumulates over a predefined period using numerical integration campos et al 2018a b from kcb accumulated and multiplied by a parameter of water use efficiency for biomass production wue b the potential agb can be obtained therefore to obtain the actual agb from the potential stress by water deficit and thermal stress must be considered in the methodology campos et al 2018a b finally the grain yield is estimated by multiplying the actual agb by a harvest index hi this approach was applied to commercial corn zea mays l fields that were managed in irrigated conditions in the western region of the state of bahia brazil corn is considered the third most important crop in this region occupying an area corresponding to 180 000 ha in 2016 17 with a total production of 1 404 000 tons and an average yield of 7 8 mg ha 1 aiba 2017 the use of orbital rs data in agriculture especially in large scale agriculture e g farms with many central pivots is essential for decision making crop development monitoring identification of biotic and abiotic stress and obviously for agb and yield estimation however there is a lack of research on corn yield estimates under real conditions on farms in brazil most of the studies focused on small experimental plots and when extrapolated to real situations tended to present a low accuracy considering these aspects the main objective was to estimate corn yield at the farm level in brazil using a new and simplified rs approach based on the fao 66 approach and on the savi and was initially validated for north american corn production conditions campos et al 2018a b specific objectives refer to the changes made to the original model namely i the use of a different methodology for water stress coefficient determination than the fao 56 approach ii the definition of kcb accumulation interval based on growing degree days gdds instead of on the savi values and iii the use of an empirical hi based on previous harvestings and the consideration of the possible effect of the corn variety in the actual values of hi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the data analyzed in this work were obtained in commercial fields located in the municipality of são desidério in the western region of the state of bahia brazil fig 1 a the area is located in the rectangle bound by the coordinate pairs 12 28 08 s 45 45 12 w and 12 25 40 s 45 34 55 w with an average altitude of 750 m above sea level fig 1b according to köppen s climatic classification alvares et al 2013 the climate of region is a tropical climate aw with a rainy season in summer and a dry winter with an annual normal precipitation in the region of 1003 4 mm inmet 2018 which is concentrated in the rainy season october to april yellow latosol constitutes the predominant soil type of the fields santos et al 2011 the farm has 17 center pivots 16 of which are towable as indicated by the letters a and b in fig 1b and are able to irrigate an area of 1598 ha 2 2 field data the ground and meteorological datasets were obtained during four consecutive corn growing seasons 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 meteorological data such as air temperature tm c wind speed at 2 m height u2 m s 1 radiation ra mj m2 day 1 relative humidity rh and rainfall mm were obtained from the automated meteorological station located near the fields fig 1b these data were used to determine the daily reference evapotranspiration eto using the fao 56 grass reference equation allen et al 1998 and then corn actual evapotranspiration et using the modified fao method mfao mantovani et al 2006 mantovani and costa 1998 additionally temperature data were used to determine the temperature stress coefficient kst the temporal variations in these meteorological data over the four years are shown in fig 2 in relation to the ground dataset the corn hybrids used at each field for each year are presented in table 1 2 3 satellite data landsat 8 oli and landsat 7 etm data the cloud free surface reflectance images of the enhanced thematic mapper plus etm sensor landsat 7 and operational land imager oli sensor landsat 8 wrs 2 path 220 row 069 for the corn season usually april october for each year 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 were used and downloaded from the archives of the usgs earth explorer website http earthexplorer usgs gov we acquired 57 images of the study area including images from both oli and etm sensors for the crop seasons of 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 the number of images used for yield estimation varied by pivot and season according to different sowing dates and the presence of clouds in the area of interest however two criteria were adopted i at least four images were used per center pivot and ii among the four images there had to an image with a date close to the beginning middle and end of the crop cycle to adequately describe it the dates with available images are shown in fig 3 2 4 basis of the model for the estimation of the aboveground dry biomass agb and grain yield according to the methodology of campos et al 2018a b aboveground dry biomass agb in g m 2 is estimated as the product of a normalized water use efficiency for biomass production wue b in g m 2 times the adjusted basal crop coefficient kcbadj dimensionless kcbadj is estimated through the product of the basal crop coefficient kcb of the water stress coefficient ksw and a temperature cold stress coefficient kst the relationship between the factors affecting biomass production is presented in eq 1 1 agb wue b k c b k st k sw yield grain is estimated as the product of the simulated agb multiplied by the hi eq 2 the hi represents the ratio of weight grains plant to the aboveground dry biomass caviglia et al 2014 2 yield agb hi in this work the same principles were applied however some changes were necessary to make the original model applied to brazilian farm conditions thus all the terms of eqs 1 and 2 are discussed below with the focus on performed changes fig 4 provides the overall processes followed in this study 2 4 1 normalized water use efficiency for biomass production wue b campos et al 2018a b used the normalized water use efficiency for biomass production wue b which is commonly referred to as the normalized crop water productivity wp raes et al 2009 2017 razzaghi et al 2017 steduto et al 2007 vanuytrecht et al 2014 the wp is considered constant for a given climate and crop and it is set between 30 and 35 g m 2 for c4 crops raes et al 2017 the wue b in this study was considered to be 33 4 g m 2 for irrigated corn a value calibrated by campos et al 2018a b and in accordance with the one recommended in the fao 66 approach i e 33 7 g m 2 steduto et al 2012 2 4 2 basal crop coefficient kcb the kcb is estimated based on the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 through eq 3 which was developed by campos et al 2017 and considers short grass for reference evapotranspiration 3 k cb 2 savi 0 17 the adjusted kcb is daily by the water and temperature stress and accumulated during a specific period of the growing season campos et al 2018a b defined the interval for kcb accumulation based on the savi values these values are 0 20 and 0 40 for the start and end respectively pretests based on the abovementioned savi values for biomass accumulation show very high estimates for brazilian conditions agb above 35 mg ha 1 we investigated the possible causes of these overestimates based on the corn crop development and on the photoassimilate distribution in the plant throughout the cycle it has been verified in many studies that during the grain filling period there is a considerable remobilization of the dry matter that has accumulated in the vegetative parts of corn plants i e the stalk leaf sheaths and leaves mainly that in the stalk to the grains which assists with their filling along with the continuation of the photosynthetic process to meet the needs of the reproductive phase allison and watson 1966 rajcan and tollenaar 1999 sangoi et al 2002 2001 based on this to avoid an overestimate due to the translocation of photoassimilates during the reproductive period a new period based on growing degree days gdds was used to obtain daily kcb through interpolation from the v2 corn stage when the plant has two fully emerged leaves and then is able to start the photosynthetic process fancelli and dourado neto 2000 until the end of the r5 stage which is called dent it is important to point out that in this stage the grains would have already accumulated most of their maximum dry weight that would be reached at physiological maturity hanway 1966 the gdd values corresponding to the initial and final periods of kcb accumulation were 250 and 1500 respectively based on the study of martins et al 2017 in terms of das this is from 14 das until 110 das a similar interval to the one adopted by kross et al 2015 for corn biomass estimation 2 4 3 water stress coefficient ksw the water stress coefficient shows how crop transpiration is affected by water stress or irrigation water deficits the model of campos et al 2018a b uses the approach proposed in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 in brazil however especially in irrigated commercial farms that have adopted any type of irrigation management it is very hard to use the fao dual kc approach and consequently the ksw because of its greater complexity for application in brazil it is more common to use a simpler methodology such as that proposed by bernardo 1989 according to eq 4 this methodology was used to obtain the water stress coefficient ks in areas of this study instead of the fao ksw the methodology can be described as follows 4 k s ln 1 csws l n 1 sws where sws is the total soil water storage mm and csws is the current soil water storage mm at a certain time 2 4 4 temperature stress coefficient kst the temperature stress coefficient kst was used according to raes et al 2009 these authors proposed a logistic relationship between kst and the relative water stress level srelt numerically srelt is a linear function of the daily mean air temperature tm and the extremes for the canopy development are tb and to eq 5 5 s r e l t t o t m t o t b if mean temperature tm optimum temperature to kst is equal to 1 and if tmean to kst is obtained using eq 6 raes et al 2009 as follows 6 k st s n s x s n s x s n exp r 1 s relt where tb and to for corn are 10 c and 30 c respectively steduto et al 2012 sx and sn are the upper and lower limits of kst and are assumed to be equal to 1 0 and 0 001 respectively and r is the rate factor 15 2 4 5 harvest index hi campos et al 2018a b suggested a new approach to determine hi based on the hypothesis that the final yield is better correlated with the maximum biomass reached by the crop in contrast to the relationship between yield and biomass at harvesting however the disadvantage of this methodology is the necessity of using grain yield to determine hi in addition these authors highlighted that the methodology needs to be validated with additional experiments and analyses on the other hand there are several studies about hi determination for corn and most of them show values varying between 0 35 and 0 6 examples can be seen in the works of bastiaanssen and ali 2003 o shaughnessy et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and zhai et al 2017 however the most common values remain between 0 4 and 0 5 bocianowski et al 2019 demétrio et al 2008 hütsch and schubert 2018 2017 djaman et al 2013 li et al 2015 thus due to the above cited limitation the value of 0 45 was chosen for hi in the growing season of 2013 a severe and sporadic attack of the bacterium erwinia chrysanthemi pv zeae which causes a disease called stalk rot of maize directly affected the hi values the center pivots 02a 03a 05a 06b 07b 08b 09b 10b 11b and 12b were the most affected while 01a and 04a were slightly less affected thus for the less affected center pivots the hi was 0 37 and for the most affected the hi was 0 24 the hi values for 2013 were calculated using eq 7 as follows 7 hi 2013 y 0 45 x where hi2013 refers to hi for the year 2013 y is the average yield for center pivots in 2013 02a 03a 05a 06b 07b 08b 09b 10b 11b and 12b or 01a and 04a 0 45 is the hi value used for 2014 2015 and 2016 and x is the average yield for the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2 5 data analysis to assess the accuracy of the estimations the statistical indicators root mean square error rmse relative rmse rrmse mean bias error mbe mean absolute error mae and coefficient of determination r2 between the estimated and measured values were calculated the tool for numerical integration pixel by pixel tonipbp was applied for data processing and analysis the tonipbp was developed by the gis and remote sensing group from the instituto de desarrollo regional university of castilla la mancha spain in the frame of the project fatima http fatima h2020 eu in the present study tonipbp was used to obtain the accumulated value of the relation kcb kst ks within a date interval defined based on gdds 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation management data the total irrigation applied in each center pivot varied little from year to year and from pivot to pivot due to the small variation in climatic conditions and its effect on eto table 2 the year 2013 had the smallest irrigation depth applied 400 mm because of a sporadic and severe stalk rot disease in the corn fields during this season which influenced irrigation management and strongly impacting the corn yield the growing cycle of 2016 had the highest mean value of et with 648 7 mm table 2 this is a result of the high values of temperature and solar radiation but mainly of the wind speed and low relative humidity observed during that year fig 2 3 2 water stress coefficient ks and temperature stress coefficient kst fig 5 shows the daily ks values for four selected center pivots as determined by the model of bernardo 1989 for the irrigation seasons of 2013 2016 generally during all the growing seasons the ks values were close to 1 except at the beginning of the growing season after sowing and in the late season when irrigation intervals are longer because corn has almost reached physiological maturity fig 5 bernardo s methodology causes a logarithmic decrease in the ks value with the reduction in total soil water storage see eq 4 unlike the fao 56 approach which considers a fraction of the total soil water available in the root zone that the crop can extract without suffering water stress then bernardo s ks is more limiting to the estimation of crop transpiration than is the fao 56 method in this sense it is possible to affirm that cultivated fields did not have any problems with water stress as ks remained close to 1 and high yields were obtained in the fields table 1 which did not occur in the presence of a water deficit during the growing season of 2013 the period of irrigation had a duration of 100 days fig 5a due to the phytosanitary problem in the other years fig 5b d the period extended to approximately 125 days when the corn reached physiological maturity and the irrigation ended however regardless of the irrigation management duration the ks values were very similar among the four seasons analyzed fig 6 shows the temperature cold stress coefficient kst for the corn growing seasons of 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 the lowest values of kst were observed during the initial days of the winter in brazil which starts in late june with the lowest value occurring in 2015 the average values of kst were 0 96 for 2013 and 2014 and 0 97 for 2015 and 2016 indicating that cold stress has a low impact on biomass production under the brazilian conditions these results are expected because of the tropical climate and although corn is cultivated during the autumn winter season the air temperatures of the region during this period are compatible with those required for corn 25 and 30 c fancelli and dourado neto 2000 3 3 corn crop development based on savi understanding patterns of vegetation based on vi is essential for crop management and helps farmers in decision making fig 7 shows the patterns of temporal evolution of the savi in each center pivot over the growing seasons of 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 in the four seasons analyzed it is possible to observe very similar behavior with a fast increase at the start of the growing cycle a stability during the mid season and a reduction at the end the lowest savi values are observed in the first and sixth images e g june 07 and oct 21 fig 7b because of the larger amount of exposed soil and plant senescence respectively in these periods on the other hand from the second to the fourth image the highest values of the savi were verified which are mainly a consequence of leaf area increase campos et al 2017 gitelson et al 2003 the highest savi values in corn plants are normally observed from 60 das when plants tend to reach the maximum leaf area kross et al 2015 lizaso et al 2005 lukeba et al 2013 soleymani 2018 soufizadeh et al 2018 until 80 das when the plants are in the silking stage hanway 1966 fig 8 shows the curves of the savi values from the four selected center pivots in each growing season along with the positions of the stages v2 and r5 and the respective accumulated gdd values 250 and 1500 which define the beginning and end periods of the kcb accumulation fig 8c during all seasons the evolution of the savi according to the four major crop development stages can be clearly observed with fast increases during the early season and the opposite at the end fast decrease during the mid season few changes occurred in the crop canopy thus the savi stayed practically stable these results corroborate the importance of using satellites with high temporal resolution as done in the present study with landsat 7 and 8 to study crops with fast development such as corn soybean and bean to monitor the main changes in the crop the savi values during the four seasons ranged from 0 12 to 0 72 with an average value of approximately 0 5 although the maximum value reached 0 72 a few times most of the maximum values were between 0 68 and 0 7 fig 8 which are the most common in corn fields bausch 1993 campos et al 2017 the minimum values varied between 0 12 and 0 20 with great similarity among the four seasons fig 8 generally vegetation conditions were slightly variable between fields over the four growing seasons with very close amplitudes and average savi values fig 8 this was a consequence of the high technological level adopted on the farm which mainly involved high performance hybrids and correct irrigation management 3 4 adjusted basal crop coefficient kcbadj the basal crop coefficient is defined as the ratio of crop evapotranspiration over the reference evapotranspiration when the soil surface is dry but transpiration is occurring at a potential rate i e water is not limiting transpiration however when water is limited in the soil there is a reduction in kcb values which can be calculated by multiplying them by a water stress coefficient allen et al 1998 campos et al 2018a b demonstrated the clear relationship between agb production and the accumulated values of kcb derived from satellite data and subsequently the compatibility of the kcb data derived from satellite images with the transpiration coefficient described in the fao 66 manual allen et al 1998 in addition they also considered temperature cold stress on kcb instead of only water stress allen et al 1998 in other words the kcb was adjusted of water deficit and cold temperature stress campos et al 2018a b fig 9 shows the map of the kcb that was adjusted for temperature and water stress conditions kcbadj of each irrigated corn field in the four consecutive growing seasons 2013 to 2016 the kcbadj ranged from 69 to 94 with average values of 79 3 75 2 81 6 and 87 9 for 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 9 the results obtained in this study were similar to those of campos et al 2018a b which were obtained under the conditions of nebraska usa although the 2013 growing season had problems with a disease stalk rot of maize the kcbadj was slightly higher than that in 2014 fig 9a as the symptoms of attack became more evident after the period of kcb accumulation the end of the r5 stage since the attack occurred close to physiological maturation of the grains the r6 stage the 2016 growing season had the highest values among the four growing seasons fig 9b which is directly related to the relatively high yield generally the kcbadj values showed little variation within the same season and most of this small difference can be attributed to the cultivation of different corn hybrids table 1 3 5 aboveground dry biomass agb and grain yield the kcbadj times wue b determine the actual agb the data referring to agb are presented in fig 10 which shows that agb ranged between 18 and 34 mg ha 1 these results can be compared to the findings of campos et al 2018a b kross et al 2015 and yang et al 2017 relatively low agb was observed in 2013 and 2014 fig 10a in comparison to 2015 and 2016 fig 10b with the highest agb occurring in 2016 fig 10b in general the fields had an evolution of production over the season which can be seen better in the yield results presented in the sequence it is important to point out that agb can undergo considerable variations as a function of the wue b adopted because this value even if normalized is variable between 30 and 35 g m 2 raes et al 2017 fig 11 shows the measured versus estimated of corn grain yields for the growing seasons of 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 in 2013 the lowest yield among the four seasons was verified with some values near 5 mg ha 1 fig 11a which is considered very low given the level of technology adopted at the farm these results are a consequence of an attack of the bacterium erwinia chrysanthemi pv zeae regarding the estimation performance of 2013 good agreement was observed with r² 0 87 based on rrmse 8 3 which is expressed as a percentage where lower values indicate less residual variance good agreement is also observed fig 11a the statistical parameters were also good with the rmse equal to 0 573 mg ha 1 and the mae equal to 0 489 mg ha 1 with slight underestimation mbe 0 032 mg ha 1 in the 2014 harvest the regression was not statistically significant which means that there was no relationship between the measured and estimated data fig 11b additionally compared to that in 2013 there was a large decrease in r² in 2014 fig 11a on the other hand rmse and mae showed small differences in 2014 the rrmse was 5 1 while the mbe indicated overestimation 0 330 mg ha 1 regarding the 2015 growing season the rmse nrmse between the measured and simulated values was 0 646 mg ha 1 5 3 and the r² had good improvement 0 45 compared to the previous year fig 11c the mbe was 0 141 mg ha 1 which was a relatively low overestimate considering the average yield while mae was 0 534 mg ha 1 as well as in 2014 the regression value for the 2016 growing season was not statistically significant presenting the worst results of the four seasons analyzed with r² 0 03 and rmse greater than 1 1 030 mg ha 1 fig 11d the rrmse was similar to that in 2013 8 3 the mbe and mae confirmed that the values estimated for 2016 were poor with an overestimate reaching 0 727 mg ha 1 and mae equal to 0 911 mg ha 1 in the 2016 growing season six different corn hybrids were sown making it the season with the highest number of hybrids which may have contributed to these poor results due to the use of a single hi hi 0 45 for six hybrids fig 12 shows the absolute difference in percentage between estimated and measured values of yield for the growing seasons of 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 the highest difference was observed in 2013 pivot 03a with a value of 18 8 followed by 17 9 in field 02a in 2013 fig 12a the 2014 growing season had only one value greater than 10 fig 12b as did the 2015 growing season fig 12c while 2016 had the greatest amount of error values higher than 10 fig 12d additionally in some cases the differences were less than 1 and the majority remained between 10 and 10 overall there were no good results of estimated yield in fig 11 although the differences presented in fig 12 can be considered low probably as a consequence of the use of a single hi value for different hybrids and consequently their joint analysis for this reason considering the two groups a new analysis was performed on fig 13 i the pioneer hybrids and ii the status viptera 3 hybrid using data from the growing seasons of 2014 2015 and 2016 2013 was excluded because of disease occurrence regarding the pioneer hybrids which had three different hybrids planted during the abovementioned harvests i e pioneer 30f35 pioneer p2830 and pioneer p3646 the grouping was based on their similarities pioneer 2017 and according to field supervisor who directly observed the corn hybrid phenology within fields these two groups of hybrids represented 92 5 of the cultivated area at the farm during the four seasons as shown in table 1 thus an hi of 0 43 was used for pioneer hybrids because of their low relatively yield while a value of 0 45 was maintained for status viptera 3 it is also important to mention the possible effect of planting density pd on final yield since the different pd values were used in the fields however this aspect was not considered here because the differences were small means of 70 286 and 72 000 for pioneer and status viptera 3 hybrid respectively a significant correlation between the observed and predicted yields was observed when considering the hybrids separately fig 13 in fig 13a it is possible to see a good agreement for the pioneer hybrids with estimates close to the 1 1 line the estimated values explained 71 of the variation of the measured data the rmse reached 0 536 mg ha 1 a relatively low value considering the average yield of these hybrids 11 24 mg ha 1 for the 2014 2015 and 2016 harvests and a low rrmse value 4 8 with mbe 0 175 mg ha 1 the overestimates can be considered subtle in addition mae was equal to 0 477 mg ha 1 regarding the status viptera 3 hybrid a reasonable value for r² was obtained 0 45 the rmse 0 705 mg ha 1 was slightly greater than for pioneer hybrids as it also occurred for rrmse 5 7 fig 13b the mbe obtained was equal to 0 184 mg ha 1 which represents an overestimation of the data the rmse values obtained for both hybrids were similar to the results found in holzman and rivas 2016 and in sakamoto et al 2013 in comparison to the results of sibley et al 2014 the rmse values in the present study are very good since these authors found rmse values above 2 mg ha 1 for the tested approach and considered it promising fig 14 shows the absolute difference in the percentages between the estimated and measured values of yield considering the two groups of hybrids the highest difference for the pioneer hybrids was 8 8 while the smallest values were 0 4 and 0 5 for the 08a and 10a fields fig 14a the majority of the values remained between 5 and 5 the differences in status viptera 3 are the same as in fig 12 because hi was maintained equal to 0 45 but here they were grouped in a single graphic fig 14b considering the total of 22 center pivot fields 13 of them 59 presented values ranging between 5 and 5 with 90 9 being between 10 and 10 overall the predicted data after the new analysis i e considering two groups of hybrids can be considered very good given the complexity of working with field data at the farm level first an extensive dataset of 52 center pivot fields was used for the growing seasons which were not subject to the same controls as an experiment involving small plots where manual harvesting can be carried out with high precision in these 52 fields harvesting machines may have led to considerable losses a previous study by loureiro et al 2012 demonstrated that losses in corn during mechanized harvesting can reach 8 2 in addition the fields were fully harvested i e including their boundaries which were excluded from our analysis to avoid border effects thus these facts explain part of the difference in the yield estimates although the problems cited above occurred the present work is considered very useful especially because of its applicability to the real conditions of field production according to sibley et al 2014 for rs to be useful for analyzing crop yield gaps methods should be accurate at the field scale without the need for local ground calibration 3 6 yield zone map within precision agriculture management zone delineation using rs data is reliable and feasible song et al 2009 the predicted yield maps of the four growing seasons are presented in fig 15 these maps were created using two hi for 2013 corn harvest 0 24 and 0 37 0 43 for the pioneer hybrids and 0 45 for status viptera 3 and other hybrids see table 1 as previously discussed these maps showed a considerable variation in yield among all fields and low variation among individual fields normally among two or three zones by center pivots fig 15 it was not possible to clearly observe a pattern of yield class distributed across the field although the boundaries are commonly regions of low yield however after increasing the scale for two fields more details can be seen for example low yield zones were verified in the lower fig 15c in all center pivot boundaries with respect to the upper center pivot highlighted two patterns are visible very distinct and individually uniform which can be a consequence of the sowing of different hybrids or of different water and fertilization management for each slice of the center pivot additionally it is important to highlight that some yield variability is a consequence of natural soil differences e g soil patches additionally there was a notable trend of yield increase over the years mainly due to technological advancements such as fertilization irrigation management and weed control these yield zone maps can be very useful during harvesting because they can be implemented in the use of the harvesting machine and thus the harvest can be carried out by yield zones different yields sometimes require different settings of the machines so one can avoid harvesting the entire area as though yield were uniform and consequently the losses can be decreased during this step yield maps are also a valuable archive of field performance and the changes that management might have had on the fields franzen 2018 in addition yield maps are a reference for the next planting and can help in decisions about soil fertility correction and compaction soil analysis among other things fig 16 shows the percentage of area referring to each yield interval which important information for decision making in 2013 fig 16a more than 60 of the areas had 5 yields 7 0 mg ha 1 although these values are compatible with the brazilian average corn yield conab 2018 they are very low considering that they are from irrigated plantations which normally produce more than 10 mg ha 1 these low values are a consequence of the disease and reinforce that agriculture is a high risk activity where the producers may have their production reduced by several factors e g disease pest drought excess of rainfall among others with respect to 2014 2015 and 2016 which were normal production years the yields were mostly greater than 10 mg ha 1 fig 16b d in 2014 only 7 3 produced less than 10 mg ha 1 fig 16b and in 2015 almost 63 of the area had yields in the range of 12 to 13 mg ha 1 fig 16c in 2016 there were more yield classes with variation from 7 to 15 mg ha 1 but there were similarities to the years 2014 and 2015 with mostly yields of approximately 12 mg ha 1 the predominance of corn fields with yields of approximately 12 mg ha 1 for these years allowed them to be considered to have high production since the brazilian average is 5 058 mg ha 1 considering the 2017 18 harvesting data and the involvement of irrigated and rainfed fields conab 2018 in addition the yield zone analysis highlights the potential of using precision agriculture for the enhancement of productivity through managing the low yield locations for greater profitability al gaadi et al 2016 4 conclusions and remarks the remote sensing based model for forecasting corn yield at the farm scale based on the basal crop coefficient that was adjusted to water and cold temperature stress kcbadj and the water use efficiency for biomass production wue b parameters were evaluated using surface reflectance images from landsat 7 and 8 satellites in four growing seasons involving 52 center pivots in corn fields this study evaluated an extensive dataset of yield combined with the precise knowledge of the boundaries of the center pivots to perform rigorous testing of the remote sensing estimates of corn yields for a commercial farm that employs a high level of technology in its production processes compared to the original model of campos et al 2018a b the present work brings the following innovative aspects i calibration to farm level conditions b easy methodology for water stress coefficient determination in comparison with the approach proposed in the fao 56 manual and c the new method for performing the kcb calculation considering the importance of photoassimilate translocation during the reproductive period the results obtained are useful for analyzing crop yield in corn plantations established in brazilian farms the agreement between the observed and predicted yields was the highest when similar hybrids were grouped especially for the pioneer hybrids with the majority of the differences between predicted yield values and measured yield values remaining between 5 and 5 however the prediction could be better if some practices were different the first change would be a corn harvesting process that would not cause losses e g manual harvesting in small plots another practice is the utilization of a specific hi for each hybrid and considering planting density and crop management among other factors it would also be important not to include field boundaries in the harvest because during the zonal statistical analysis the vector layer of each center pivot had a 30 m buffer due to the spatial resolution of landsat this would explain part of the difference in the yield estimates finally the obtained results are promising and show that preharvest corn yield forecasting is operationally feasible because it is easy to acquire free satellite images and to implement the model preharvest forecasting based on rs data can help in food security decision making and export strategies yield zone maps can help farmers in their decision making by identifying problems in areas with low yields and therefore allowing them to adjust their management practices future research should consider some of the sources of error cited above for instance the use of individual hi values and decreasing the losses during harvesting should be considered as well as testing of the model in other regions with different hybrids and management in summary our study demonstrated that the campos et al 2018a b model with some adjustment for application under brazilian conditions is able to successfully estimate most of the yields in irrigated corn

10876,crop yield forecasting at the field level is essential for decision making and the prediction of agricultural economic returns for farmers thus this study evaluated the performance of a methodology for corn yield prediction in irrigated fields in the western region of the state of bahia brazil this methodology integrates a time series of the basal crop coefficient kcb estimated from the soil adjusted vegetation index savi into a simple model based on the water productivity as presented in the fao 66 manual in this context an extensive field level dataset of 52 center pivot fields of cultivated with corn was used for four consecutive growing seasons 2013 to 2016 surface reflectance images from the landsat series were used to calculate the savi the methodology performance was assessed through rmse rrmse mbe mae and r² the results revealed that the difference between the predicted and actual yield values ranged between 12 2 and 18 8 but that the majority of the estimates remained between 10 and 10 considering that a single harvest index hi was used for the hybrids cultivated in the growing seasons of 2014 2015 and 2016 after a new reanalysis by grouping the similar hybrids and using specific his the performance of the predictions increased especially for the pioneer hybrids the majority of the differences between the predicted yield values and the measured yield values remained between 5 and 5 the results of this research showed that it is essential to work with different his when considering different hybrids and years under different weather conditions keywords corn productivity biomass remote sensing data basal crop coefficient vegetation indices 1 introduction yield estimation prior to harvest plays a vital role in agricultural development worldwide jin et al 2018 and is fundamental to world food security decision making and crop management mokhtari et al 2018 xie et al 2017 therefore it is important to estimate crop yields prior to harvest as aboveground dry biomass agb through an effective methodology such as the use of crop growth models cgms a cgm translates the relationship between plants and the environment and considers the primary biophysical and biochemical processes in the soil crop atmosphere system which include photosynthesis respiration transpiration biomass yield and senescence simulating these processes at different time scales boote 1996 kasampalis et al 2018 wang et al 2013 however cgms have a great limitation for large scale applications in the lack of spatial information such as information on different crop varieties soil types and crop management practices guo et al 2017 huang et al 2019 kasampalis et al 2018 remote sensing rs data can provide nondestructive temporal information on plant responses to dynamic weather conditions and management practices at large scales with low cost foster et al 2019 battude et al 2016 frampton et al 2013 lin et al 2009 veloso et al 2017 thus this technology also shows a large potential for crop yield estimation as well as variability across fields and years there are three main approaches of rs methods to estimate biomass and yield according to sadras et al 2018 a biomass accumulation models b direct reflectance based empirical relationships on selected dates and c integration of rs derived variables into cgm the direct reflectance based empirical relationships on selected dates assume basically that the vigor of the crop canopy observed in the spectral rs data is directly related to the yield these models are relatively simple because these rs data yield relations are described in simple formulas but without any deeper physiological background ferencz et al 2004 kasampalis et al 2018 in addition these relationships must be locally calibrated considering the uncertainties related to the selection of the most representative date for the assessment of biomass production and spatial variability campos gonzález gómez et al 2018 biomass accumulation models normally consider the close relationship between biomass production and the photosynthetically active portion of solar radiation absorbed by the canopy daughtry et al 1992 liu et al 2010 monteith 1972 while the use of radiation energy for the estimation of plant biomass production represents the fundamental processes that govern crop growth and yield liu et al 2004 the integration of rs data with a cgm can be achieved by using two distinct methods doraiswamy et al 2013 in the first method a time series of remotely sensed measurements is used to calibrate the cgm in a second method the integration is performed by estimating crop parameters e g leaf area index and canopy cover or vegetation indices from rs data and using them as a direct inputs to the growth model maas 2010 according to huang et al 2019 combining cgm and rs data is desirable in other words the integration allows us to join the monitoring properties of rs data with the predictive and explanatory abilities of cgm forming a more effective approach given these advantages research has been conducted in this direction in recent years for monitoring crop growth status and estimating yield examples can be seen in the works of levitan and gross 2018 and ma et al 2013 it is important to point out that among the several available crop models in scientific literature that can be combined with rs data the aquacrop model is one of those that has been refined and updated to better simulate crop growth status and crop yield jin et al 2018 thus the coupling of this model with rs data is very interesting and a recent example of this combination is a model developed by campos et al 2018a b the methodology proposed by these authors integrates a time series of the basal crop coefficient kcb into the aquacrop crop growth and yield partitioning model steduto et al 2012 then the kcb is estimated from the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 by means of a calibrated linear equation campos et al 2017 in sequence kcb accumulates over a predefined period using numerical integration campos et al 2018a b from kcb accumulated and multiplied by a parameter of water use efficiency for biomass production wue b the potential agb can be obtained therefore to obtain the actual agb from the potential stress by water deficit and thermal stress must be considered in the methodology campos et al 2018a b finally the grain yield is estimated by multiplying the actual agb by a harvest index hi this approach was applied to commercial corn zea mays l fields that were managed in irrigated conditions in the western region of the state of bahia brazil corn is considered the third most important crop in this region occupying an area corresponding to 180 000 ha in 2016 17 with a total production of 1 404 000 tons and an average yield of 7 8 mg ha 1 aiba 2017 the use of orbital rs data in agriculture especially in large scale agriculture e g farms with many central pivots is essential for decision making crop development monitoring identification of biotic and abiotic stress and obviously for agb and yield estimation however there is a lack of research on corn yield estimates under real conditions on farms in brazil most of the studies focused on small experimental plots and when extrapolated to real situations tended to present a low accuracy considering these aspects the main objective was to estimate corn yield at the farm level in brazil using a new and simplified rs approach based on the fao 66 approach and on the savi and was initially validated for north american corn production conditions campos et al 2018a b specific objectives refer to the changes made to the original model namely i the use of a different methodology for water stress coefficient determination than the fao 56 approach ii the definition of kcb accumulation interval based on growing degree days gdds instead of on the savi values and iii the use of an empirical hi based on previous harvestings and the consideration of the possible effect of the corn variety in the actual values of hi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the data analyzed in this work were obtained in commercial fields located in the municipality of são desidério in the western region of the state of bahia brazil fig 1 a the area is located in the rectangle bound by the coordinate pairs 12 28 08 s 45 45 12 w and 12 25 40 s 45 34 55 w with an average altitude of 750 m above sea level fig 1b according to köppen s climatic classification alvares et al 2013 the climate of region is a tropical climate aw with a rainy season in summer and a dry winter with an annual normal precipitation in the region of 1003 4 mm inmet 2018 which is concentrated in the rainy season october to april yellow latosol constitutes the predominant soil type of the fields santos et al 2011 the farm has 17 center pivots 16 of which are towable as indicated by the letters a and b in fig 1b and are able to irrigate an area of 1598 ha 2 2 field data the ground and meteorological datasets were obtained during four consecutive corn growing seasons 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 meteorological data such as air temperature tm c wind speed at 2 m height u2 m s 1 radiation ra mj m2 day 1 relative humidity rh and rainfall mm were obtained from the automated meteorological station located near the fields fig 1b these data were used to determine the daily reference evapotranspiration eto using the fao 56 grass reference equation allen et al 1998 and then corn actual evapotranspiration et using the modified fao method mfao mantovani et al 2006 mantovani and costa 1998 additionally temperature data were used to determine the temperature stress coefficient kst the temporal variations in these meteorological data over the four years are shown in fig 2 in relation to the ground dataset the corn hybrids used at each field for each year are presented in table 1 2 3 satellite data landsat 8 oli

the corn season usually april october for each year 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 were used and downloaded from the archives of the usgs earth explorer website http earthexplorer usgs gov we acquired 57 images of the study area including images from both oli and etm sensors for the crop seasons of 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 the number of images used for yield estimation varied by pivot and season according to different sowing dates and the presence of clouds in the area of interest however two criteria were adopted i at least four images were used per center pivot and ii among the four images there had to an image with a date close to the beginning middle and end of the crop cycle to adequately describe it the dates with available images are shown in fig 3 2 4 basis of the model for the estimation of the aboveground dry biomass agb and grain yield according to the methodology of campos et al 2018a b aboveground dry biomass agb in g m 2 is estimated as the product of a normalized water use efficiency for biomass production wue b in g m 2 times the adjusted basal crop coefficient kcbadj dimensionless kcbadj is estimated through the product of the basal crop coefficient kcb of the water stress coefficient ksw and a temperature cold stress coefficient kst the relationship between the factors affecting biomass production is presented in eq 1 1 agb wue b k c b k st k sw yield grain is estimated as the product of the simulated agb multiplied by the hi eq 2 the hi represents the ratio of weight grains plant to the aboveground dry biomass caviglia et al 2014 2 yield agb hi in this work the same principles were applied however some changes were necessary to make the original model applied to brazilian farm conditions thus all the terms of eqs 1 and 2 are discussed below with the focus on performed changes fig 4 provides the overall processes followed in this study 2 4 1 normalized water use efficiency for biomass production wue b campos et al 2018a b used the normalized water use efficiency for biomass production wue b which is commonly referred to as the normalized crop water productivity wp raes et al 2009 2017 razzaghi et al 2017 steduto et al 2007 vanuytrecht et al 2014 the wp is considered constant for a given climate and crop and it is set between 30 and 35 g m 2 for c4 crops raes et al 2017 the wue b in this study was considered to be 33 4 g m 2 for irrigated corn a value calibrated by campos et al 2018a b and in accordance with the one recommended in the fao 66 approach i e 33 7 g m 2 steduto et al 2012 2 4 2 basal crop coefficient kcb the kcb is estimated based on the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 through eq 3 which was developed by campos et al 2017 and considers short grass for reference evapotranspiration 3 k cb 2 savi 0 17 the adjusted kcb is daily by the water and temperature stress and accumulated during a specific period of the growing season campos et al 2018a b defined the interval for kcb accumulation based on the savi values these values are 0 20 and 0 40 for the start and end respectively pretests based on the abovementioned savi values for biomass accumulation show very high estimates for brazilian conditions agb above 35 mg ha 1 we investigated the possible causes of these overestimates based on the corn crop development and on the photoassimilate distribution in the plant throughout the cycle it has been verified in many studies that during the grain filling period there is a considerable remobilization of the dry matter that has accumulated in the vegetative parts of corn plants i e the stalk leaf sheaths and leaves mainly that in the stalk to the grains which assists with their filling along with the continuation of the photosynthetic process to meet the needs of the reproductive phase allison and watson 1966 rajcan and tollenaar 1999 sangoi et al 2002 2001 based on this to avoid an overestimate due to the translocation of photoassimilates during the reproductive period a new period based on growing degree days gdds was used to obtain daily kcb through interpolation from the v2 corn stage when the plant has two fully emerged leaves and then is able to start the photosynthetic process fancelli and dourado neto 2000 until the end of the r5 stage which is called dent it is important to point out that in this stage the grains would have already accumulated most of their maximum dry weight that would be reached at physiological maturity hanway 1966 the gdd values corresponding to the initial and final periods of kcb accumulation were 250 and 1500 respectively based on the study of martins et al 2017 in terms of das this is from 14 das until 110 das a similar interval to the one adopted by kross et al 2015 for corn biomass estimation 2 4 3 water stress coefficient ksw the water stress coefficient shows how crop transpiration is affected by water stress or irrigation water deficits the model of campos et al 2018a b uses the approach proposed in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 in brazil however especially in irrigated commercial farms that have adopted any type of irrigation management it is very hard to use the fao dual kc approach and consequently the ksw because of its greater complexity for application in brazil it is more common to use a simpler methodology such as that proposed by bernardo 1989 according to eq 4 this methodology was used to obtain the water stress coefficient ks in areas of this study instead of the fao ksw the methodology can be described as follows 4 k s ln 1 csws l n 1 sws where sws is the total soil water storage mm and csws is the current soil water storage mm at a certain time 2 4 4 temperature stress coefficient kst the temperature stress coefficient kst was used according to raes et al 2009 these authors proposed a logistic relationship between kst and the relative water stress level srelt numerically srelt is a linear function of the daily mean air temperature tm and the extremes for the canopy development are tb and to eq 5 5 s r e l t t o t m t o t b if mean temperature tm optimum temperature to kst is equal to 1 and if tmean to kst is obtained using eq 6 raes et al 2009 as follows 6 k st s n s x s n s x s n exp r 1 s relt where tb and to for corn are 10 c and 30 c respectively steduto et al 2012 sx and sn are the upper and lower limits of kst and are assumed to be equal to 1 0 and 0 001 respectively and r is the rate factor 15 2 4 5 harvest index hi campos et al 2018a b suggested a new approach to determine hi based on the hypothesis that the final yield is better correlated with the maximum biomass reached by the crop in contrast to the relationship between yield and biomass at harvesting however the disadvantage of this methodology is the necessity of using grain yield to determine hi in addition these authors highlighted that the methodology needs to be validated with additional experiments and analyses on the other hand there are several studies about hi determination for corn and most of them show values varying between 0 35 and 0 6 examples can be seen in the works of bastiaanssen and ali 2003 o shaughnessy et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and zhai et al 2017 however the most common values remain between 0 4 and 0 5 bocianowski et al 2019 demétrio et al 2008 hütsch and schubert 2018 2017 djaman et al 2013 li et al 2015 thus due to the above cited limitation the value of 0 45 was chosen for hi in the growing season of 2013 a severe and sporadic attack of the bacterium erwinia chrysanthemi pv zeae which causes a disease called stalk rot of maize directly affected the hi values the center pivots 02a 03a 05a 06b 07b 08b 09b 10b 11b and 12b were the most affected while 01a and 04a were slightly less affected thus for the less affected center pivots the hi was 0 37 and for the most affected the hi was 0 24 the hi values for 2013 were calculated using eq 7 as follows 7 hi 2013 y 0 45 x where hi2013 refers to hi for the year 2013 y is the average yield for center pivots in 2013 02a 03a 05a 06b 07b 08b 09b 10b 11b and 12b or 01a and 04a 0 45 is the hi value used for 2014 2015 and 2016 and x is the average yield for the years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2 5 data analysis to assess the accuracy of the estimations the statistical indicators root mean square error rmse relative rmse rrmse mean bias error mbe mean absolute error mae and coefficient of determination r2 between the estimated and measured values were calculated the tool for numerical integration pixel by pixel tonipbp was applied for data processing and analysis the tonipbp was developed by the gis and remote sensing group from the instituto de desarrollo regional university of castilla la mancha spain in the frame of the project fatima http fatima h2020 eu in the present study tonipbp was used to obtain the accumulated value of the relation kcb kst ks within a date interval defined based on gdds 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation management data the total irrigation applied in each center pivot varied little from year to year and from pivot to pivot due to the small variation in climatic conditions and its effect on eto table 2 the year 2013 had the smallest irrigation depth applied 400 mm because of a sporadic and severe stalk rot disease in the corn fields during this season which influenced irrigation management and strongly impacting the corn yield the growing cycle of 2016 had the highest mean value of et with 648 7 mm table 2 this is a result of the high values of temperature and solar radiation but mainly of the wind speed and low relative humidity observed during that year fig 2 3 2 water stress coefficient ks and temperature stress coefficient kst fig 5 shows the daily ks values for four selected center pivots as determined by the model of bernardo 1989 for the irrigation seasons of 2013 2016 generally during all the growing seasons the ks values were close to 1 except at the beginning of the growing season after sowing and in the late season when irrigation intervals are longer because corn has almost reached physiological maturity fig 5 bernardo s methodology causes a logarithmic decrease in the ks value with the reduction in total soil water storage see eq 4 unlike the fao 56 approach which considers a fraction of the total soil water available in the root zone that the crop can extract without suffering water stress then bernardo s ks is more limiting to the estimation of crop transpiration than is the fao 56 method in this sense it is possible to affirm that cultivated fields did not have any problems with water stress as ks remained close to 1 and high yields were obtained in the fields table 1 which did not occur in the presence of a water deficit during the growing season of 2013 the period of irrigation had a duration of 100 days fig 5a due to the phytosanitary problem in the other years fig 5b d the period extended to approximately 125 days when the corn reached physiological maturity and the irrigation ended however regardless of the irrigation management duration the ks values were very similar among the four seasons analyzed fig 6 shows the temperature cold stress coefficient kst for the corn growing seasons of 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 the lowest values of kst were observed during the initial days of the winter in brazil which starts in late june with the lowest value occurring in 2015 the average values of kst were 0 96 for 2013 and 2014 and 0 97 for 2015 and 2016 indicating that cold stress has a low impact on biomass production under the brazilian conditions these results are expected because of the tropical climate and although corn is cultivated during the autumn winter season the air temperatures of the region during this period are compatible with those required for corn 25 and 30 c fancelli and dourado neto 2000 3 3 corn crop development based on savi understanding patterns of vegetation based on vi is essential for crop management and helps farmers in decision making fig 7 shows the patterns of temporal evolution of the savi in each center pivot over the growing seasons of 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 in the four seasons analyzed it is possible to observe very similar behavior with a fast increase at the start of the growing cycle a stability during the mid season and a reduction at the end the lowest savi values are observed in the first and sixth images e g june 07 and oct 21 fig 7b because of the larger amount of exposed soil and plant senescence respectively in these periods on the other hand from the second to the fourth image the highest values of the savi were verified which are mainly a consequence of leaf area increase campos et al 2017 gitelson et al 2003 the highest savi values in corn plants are normally observed from 60 das when plants tend to reach the maximum leaf area kross et al 2015 lizaso et al 2005 lukeba et al 2013 soleymani 2018 soufizadeh et al 2018 until 80 das when the plants are in the silking stage hanway 1966 fig 8 shows the curves of the savi values from the four selected center pivots in each growing season along with the positions of the stages v2 and r5 and the respective accumulated gdd values 250 and 1500 which define the beginning and end periods of the kcb accumulation fig 8c during all seasons the evolution of the savi according to the four major crop development stages can be clearly observed with fast increases during the early season and the opposite at the end fast decrease during the mid season few changes occurred in the crop canopy thus the savi stayed practically stable these results corroborate the importance of using satellites with high temporal resolution as done in the present study with landsat 7 and 8 to study crops with fast development such as corn soybean and bean to monitor the main changes in the crop the savi values during the four seasons ranged from 0 12 to 0 72 with an average value of approximately 0 5 although the maximum value reached 0 72 a few times most of the maximum values were between 0 68 and 0 7 fig 8 which are the most common in corn fields bausch 1993 campos et al 2017 the minimum values varied between 0 12 and 0 20 with great similarity among the four seasons fig 8 generally vegetation conditions were slightly variable between fields over the four growing seasons with very close amplitudes and average savi values fig 8 this was a consequence of the high technological level adopted on the farm which mainly involved high performance hybrids and correct irrigation management 3 4 adjusted basal crop coefficient kcbadj the basal crop coefficient is defined as the ratio of crop evapotranspiration over the reference evapotranspiration when the soil surface is dry but transpiration is occurring at a potential rate i e water is not limiting transpiration however when water is limited in the soil there is a reduction in kcb values which can be calculated by multiplying them by a water stress coefficient allen et al 1998 campos et al 2018a b demonstrated the clear relationship between agb production and the accumulated values of kcb derived from satellite data and subsequently the compatibility of the kcb data derived from satellite images with the transpiration coefficient described in the fao 66 manual allen et al 1998 in addition they also considered temperature cold stress on kcb instead of only water stress allen et al 1998 in other words the kcb was adjusted of water deficit and cold temperature stress campos et al 2018a b fig 9 shows the map of the kcb that was adjusted for temperature and water stress conditions kcbadj of each irrigated corn field in the four consecutive growing seasons 2013 to 2016 the kcbadj ranged from 69 to 94 with average values of 79 3 75 2 81 6 and 87 9 for 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 9 the results obtained in this study were similar to those of campos et al 2018a b which were obtained under the conditions of nebraska usa although the 2013 growing season had problems with a disease stalk rot of maize the kcbadj was slightly higher than that in 2014 fig 9a as the symptoms of attack became more evident after the period of kcb accumulation the end of the r5 stage since the attack occurred close to physiological maturation of the grains the r6 stage the 2016 growing season had the highest values among the four growing seasons fig 9b which is directly related to the relatively high yield generally the kcbadj values showed little variation within the same season and most of this small difference can be attributed to the cultivation of different corn hybrids table 1 3 5 aboveground dry biomass agb and grain yield the kcbadj times wue b determine the actual agb the data referring to agb are presented in fig 10 which shows that agb ranged between 18 and 34 mg ha 1 these results can be compared to the findings of campos et al 2018a b kross et al 2015 and yang et al 2017 relatively low agb was observed in 2013 and 2014 fig 10a in comparison to 2015 and 2016 fig 10b with the highest agb occurring in 2016 fig 10b in general the fields had an evolution of production over the season which can be seen better in the yield results presented in the sequence it is important to point out that agb can undergo considerable variations as a function of the wue b adopted because this value even if normalized is variable between 30 and 35 g m 2 raes et al 2017 fig 11 shows the measured versus estimated of corn grain yields for the growing seasons of 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 in 2013 the lowest yield among the four seasons was verified with some values near 5 mg ha 1 fig 11a which is considered very low given the level of technology adopted at the farm these results are a consequence of an attack of the bacterium erwinia chrysanthemi pv zeae regarding the estimation performance of 2013 good agreement was observed with r² 0 87 based on rrmse 8 3 which is expressed as a percentage where lower values indicate less residual variance good agreement is also observed fig 11a the statistical parameters were also good with the rmse equal to 0 573 mg ha 1 and the mae equal to 0 489 mg ha 1 with slight underestimation mbe 0 032 mg ha 1 in the 2014 harvest the regression was not statistically significant which means that there was no relationship between the measured and estimated data fig 11b additionally compared to that in 2013 there was a large decrease in r² in 2014 fig 11a on the other hand rmse and mae showed small differences in 2014 the rrmse was 5 1 while the mbe indicated overestimation 0 330 mg ha 1 regarding the 2015 growing season the rmse nrmse between the measured and simulated values was 0 646 mg ha 1 5 3 and the r² had good improvement 0 45 compared to the previous year fig 11c the mbe was 0 141 mg ha 1 which was a relatively low overestimate considering the average yield while mae was 0 534 mg ha 1 as well as in 2014 the regression value for the 2016 growing season was not statistically significant presenting the worst results of the four seasons analyzed with r² 0 03 and rmse greater than 1 1 030 mg ha 1 fig 11d the rrmse was similar to that in 2013 8 3 the mbe and mae confirmed that the values estimated for 2016 were poor with an overestimate reaching 0 727 mg ha 1 and mae equal to 0 911 mg ha 1 in the 2016 growing season six different corn hybrids were sown making it the season with the highest number of hybrids which may have contributed to these poor results due to the use of a single hi hi 0 45 for six hybrids fig 12 shows the absolute difference in percentage between estimated and measured values of yield for the growing seasons of 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 the highest difference was observed in 2013 pivot 03a with a value of 18 8 followed by 17 9 in field 02a in 2013 fig 12a the 2014 growing season had only one value greater than 10 fig 12b as did the 2015 growing season fig 12c while 2016 had the greatest amount of error values higher than 10 fig 12d additionally in some cases the differences were less than 1 and the majority remained between 10 and 10 overall there were no good results of estimated yield in fig 11 although the differences presented in fig 12 can be considered low probably as a consequence of the use of a single hi value for different hybrids and consequently their joint analysis for this reason considering the two groups a new analysis was performed on fig 13 i the pioneer hybrids and ii the status viptera 3 hybrid using data from the growing seasons of 2014 2015 and 2016 2013 was excluded because of disease occurrence regarding the pioneer hybrids which had three different hybrids planted during the abovementioned harvests i e pioneer 30f35 pioneer p2830 and pioneer p3646 the grouping was based on their similarities pioneer 2017 and according to field supervisor who directly observed the corn hybrid phenology within fields these two groups of hybrids represented 92 5 of the cultivated area at the farm during the four seasons as shown in table 1 thus an hi of 0 43 was used for pioneer hybrids because of their low relatively yield while a value of 0 45 was maintained for status viptera 3 it is also important to mention the possible effect of planting density pd on final yield since the different pd values were used in the fields however this aspect was not considered here because the differences were small means of 70 286 and 72 000 for pioneer and status viptera 3 hybrid respectively a significant correlation between the observed and predicted yields was observed when considering the hybrids separately fig 13 in fig 13a it is possible to see a good agreement for the pioneer hybrids with estimates close to the 1 1 line the estimated values explained 71 of the variation of the measured data the rmse reached 0 536 mg ha 1 a relatively low value considering the average yield of these hybrids 11 24 mg ha 1 for the 2014 2015 and 2016 harvests and a low rrmse value 4 8 with mbe 0 175 mg ha 1 the overestimates can be considered subtle in addition mae was equal to 0 477 mg ha 1 regarding the status viptera 3 hybrid a reasonable value for r² was obtained 0 45 the rmse 0 705 mg ha 1 was slightly greater than for pioneer hybrids as it also occurred for rrmse 5 7 fig 13b the mbe obtained was equal to 0 184 mg ha 1 which represents an overestimation of the data the rmse values obtained for both hybrids were similar to the results found in holzman and rivas 2016 and in sakamoto et al 2013 in comparison to the results of sibley et al 2014 the rmse values in the present study are very good since these authors found rmse values above 2 mg ha 1 for the tested approach and considered it promising fig 14 shows the absolute difference in the percentages between the estimated and measured values of yield considering the two groups of hybrids the highest difference for the pioneer hybrids was 8 8 while the smallest values were 0 4 and 0 5 for the 08a and 10a fields fig 14a the majority of the values remained between 5 and 5 the differences in status viptera 3 are the same as in fig 12 because hi was maintained equal to 0 45 but here they were grouped in a single graphic fig 14b considering the total of 22 center pivot fields 13 of them 59 presented values ranging between 5 and 5 with 90 9 being between 10 and 10 overall the predicted data after the new analysis i e considering two groups of hybrids can be considered very good given the complexity of working with field data at the farm level first an extensive dataset of 52 center pivot fields was used for the growing seasons which were not subject to the same controls as an experiment involving small plots where manual harvesting can be carried out with high precision in these 52 fields harvesting machines may have led to considerable losses a previous study by loureiro et al 2012 demonstrated that losses in corn during mechanized harvesting can reach 8 2 in addition the fields were fully harvested i e including their boundaries which were excluded from our analysis to avoid border effects thus these facts explain part of the difference in the yield estimates although the problems cited above occurred the present work is considered very useful especially because of its applicability to the real conditions of field production according to sibley et al 2014 for rs to be useful for analyzing crop yield gaps methods should be accurate at the field scale without the need for local ground calibration 3 6 yield zone map within precision agriculture management zone delineation using rs data is reliable and feasible song et al 2009 the predicted yield maps of the four growing seasons are presented in fig 15 these maps were created using two hi for 2013 corn harvest 0 24 and 0 37 0 43 for the pioneer hybrids and 0 45 for status viptera 3 and other hybrids see table 1 as previously discussed these maps showed a considerable variation in yield among all fields and low variation among individual fields normally among two or three zones by center pivots fig 15 it was not possible to clearly observe a pattern of yield class distributed across the field although the boundaries are commonly regions of low yield however after increasing the scale for two fields more details can be seen for example low yield zones were verified in the lower fig 15c in all center pivot boundaries with respect to the upper center pivot highlighted two patterns are visible very distinct and individually uniform which can be a consequence of the sowing of different hybrids or of different water and fertilization management for each slice of the center pivot additionally it is important to highlight that some yield variability is a consequence of natural soil differences e g soil patches additionally there was a notable trend of yield increase over the years mainly due to technological advancements such as fertilization irrigation management and weed control these yield zone maps can be very useful during harvesting because they can be implemented in the use of the harvesting machine and thus the harvest can be carried out by yield zones different yields sometimes require different settings of the machines so one can avoid harvesting the entire area as though yield were uniform and consequently the losses can be decreased during this step yield maps are also a valuable archive of field performance and the changes that management might have had on the fields franzen 2018 in addition yield maps are a reference for the next planting and can help in decisions about soil fertility correction and compaction soil analysis among other things fig 16 shows the percentage of area referring to each yield interval which important information for decision making in 2013 fig 16a more than 60 of the areas had 5 yields 7 0 mg ha 1 although these values are compatible with the brazilian average corn yield conab 2018 they are very low considering that they are from irrigated plantations which normally produce more than 10 mg ha 1 these low values are a consequence of the disease and reinforce that agriculture is a high risk activity where the producers may have their production reduced by several factors e g disease pest drought excess of rainfall among others with respect to 2014 2015 and 2016 which were normal production years the yields were mostly greater than 10 mg ha 1 fig 16b d in 2014 only 7 3 produced less than 10 mg ha 1 fig 16b and in 2015 almost 63 of the area had yields in the range of 12 to 13 mg ha 1 fig 16c in 2016 there were more yield classes with variation from 7 to 15 mg ha 1 but there were similarities to the years 2014 and 2015 with mostly yields of approximately 12 mg ha 1 the predominance of corn fields with yields of approximately 12 mg ha 1 for these years allowed them to be considered to have high production since the brazilian average is 5 058 mg ha 1 considering the 2017 18 harvesting data and the involvement of irrigated and rainfed fields conab 2018 in addition the yield zone analysis highlights the potential of using precision agriculture for the enhancement of productivity through managing the low yield locations for greater profitability al gaadi et al 2016 4 conclusions and remarks the remote sensing based model for forecasting corn yield at the farm scale based on the basal crop coefficient that was adjusted to water and cold temperature stress kcbadj and the water use efficiency for biomass production wue b parameters were evaluated using surface reflectance images from landsat 7 and 8 satellites in four growing seasons involving 52 center pivots in corn fields this study evaluated an extensive dataset of yield combined with the precise knowledge of the boundaries of the center pivots to perform rigorous testing of the remote sensing estimates of corn yields for a commercial farm that employs a high level of technology in its production processes compared to the original model of campos et al 2018a b the present work brings the following innovative aspects i calibration to farm level conditions b easy methodology for water stress coefficient determination in comparison with the approach proposed in the fao 56 manual and c the new method for performing the kcb calculation considering the importance of photoassimilate translocation during the reproductive period the results obtained are useful for analyzing crop yield in corn plantations established in brazilian farms the agreement between the observed and predicted yields was the highest when similar hybrids were grouped especially for the pioneer hybrids with the majority of the differences between predicted yield values and measured yield values remaining between 5 and 5 however the prediction could be better if some practices were different the first change would be a corn harvesting process that would not cause losses e g manual harvesting in small plots another practice is the utilization of a specific hi for each hybrid and considering planting density and crop management among other factors it would also be important not to include field boundaries in the harvest because during the zonal statistical analysis the vector layer of each center pivot had a 30 m buffer due to the spatial resolution of landsat this would explain part of the difference in the yield estimates finally the obtained results are promising and show that preharvest corn yield forecasting is operationally feasible because it is easy to acquire free satellite images and to implement the model preharvest forecasting based on rs data can help in food security decision making and export strategies yield zone maps can help farmers in their decision making by identifying problems in areas with low yields and therefore allowing them to adjust their management practices future research should consider some of the sources of error cited above for instance the use of individual hi values and decreasing the losses during harvesting should be considered as well as testing of the model in other regions with different hybrids and management in summary our study demonstrated that the campos et al 2018a b model with some adjustment for application under brazilian conditions is able to successfully estimate most of the yields in irrigated corn

10877,quantification of the availability of soil moisture at different depths of the soil profile to crop water uptake facilitates the development of scientific water management strategies a three year field irrigation experiment was conducted in a cherry orchard in north china under three micro irrigation under mulch mim situations and furrow irrigation fi was set as control treatment the objectives of this study were to i study the dynamic variation of soil moisture at different cherry tree growth stages ii further quantify the contribution ratio of soil moisture to water uptake of cherry tree by employing hydrogen isotope abundance measurement and ⅲ finally discuss the mechanism of specific contribution ratios under different irrigation regimes the contribution ratio of soil moisture to water uptake of cherry tree in the main root zone 0 60 cm was significantly enhanced by three mim treatments when compared with fi the contribution ratios were increased by 11 28 49 59 and 16 33 during the leaf expansion stage flowering stage and maturation stage respectively moreover a significant linear relationship p 0 05 between the contribution ratio and the dynamic variation coefficient of soil moisture was achieved indicating that the contribution ratio estimated by hydrogen isotope abundance was consistent with the actual variation of soil moisture in the profile further analysis revealed that a higher no3 n concentration and better coupling of water and nitrogen fertilizer in the main root zone may lead to higher contribution ratio of soil moisture to cherry tree water uptake under mim treatments keywords micro irrigation soil water availability cherry stable isotope water uptake 1 introduction soil moisture is an important factor that affects crop growth and yield however not all water in the soil can be effectively absorbed and utilized by crops generally speaking only water between the field capacity and the permanent wilting percentage is considered soil available water which can be effectively used by crops and the availability refers to contribution ratio of soil moisture to crop water uptake and dry matter output salter and haworth 1961 to maintain the availability of soil water in the main root zone traditional surface irrigation strategies such as flooding irrigation and furrow irrigation require a large amount of water because water leakage and evaporation occur quickly under these irrigation situations unfortunately there is a growing shortage of water resources worldwide cheng et al 2009 kummu et al 2016 therefore improvement of soil water availability in the main root zone using limited irrigation amounts has become a serious and urgent challenge hartzell et al 2017 jägermeyr et al 2015 topak et al 2011 previous reports indicated that micro irrigation strategies including micro sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and basin bubbler irrigation are capable of increasing the availability of soil water in the main root zone to enhance the water use efficiency wue of crops çolak et al 2018 fang et al 2018 ibragimov et al 2007 li 2018 li et al 2010 topak et al 2011 zapata et al 2018 under micro irrigation situations the watered zone of the soil profile can be precisely controlled within the main root zone thereby reducing water leakage into the deep soil layer and ensuring the uniformity of irrigation qin et al 2016 yang et al 2017 moreover micro irrigation under mulch can exert greater advantages such as reducing soil surface evaporation preventing weed growth and protecting emitters and driplines from being destroyed wang et al 2011 y zhang et al 2018a reyes cabrera et al 2016 reported that when compared with traditional seepage irrigation drip irrigation can adequately irrigate shallow root areas of the potato to enhance its wue with reduced water supply li and rao 2003 reported that micro sprinkler irrigation increased the uniformity of soil moisture and fertilizer and the distribution of soil moisture and fertilizers was confirmed to be the normal distribution function zotarelli et al 2009 found that one of the factors driving root distribution was soil moisture availability and that subsurface drip irrigation increased the wue to increase tomato yields hou et al 2010 found that the need for irrigation water and evapotranspiration were reduced by drip irrigation under mulch when compared to drip irrigation without mulch later zhang et al 2017 demonstrated that drip irrigation under mulch at 35 wetted soil percentage was most conducive to potato production in northwest china although many other reports have confirmed that micro irrigation and mulching treatments increased the soil water availability arora et al 2011 ball and sammis 2001 du et al 2008 nouri et al 2019 özmen et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2013 sun et al 2016 there have been few quantitative studies of soil moisture availability at different soil depths for perennial fruit trees bertrand et al 2014 cao et al 2018 and the mechanism responsible for the effects of different irrigation strategies on soil moisture availability of perennial fruit trees needs to be investigated in depth application of stable hydrogen or oxygen isotopes to quantify the responses of crop growth to variations in moisture availability has been recognized as a credible method of determining spatiotemporal patterns of water uptake bertrand et al 2014 chimner and cooper 2004 ma and song 2016 the abundance of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in surface water groundwater rainfall and soil water differ significantly because of physical and chemical processes such as infiltration transportation evaporation and mineral chemical reactions and the stable isotopes from different water sources do not fractionate when being transported in roots and stems cao et al 2018 gat 1996 liao et al 2017 schwinning et al 2005 2003 conducted a series of experiments to examine hydrogen isotope abundance to study the mechanisms of rainwater utilization by plants demonstrating that the most deep rooted plants would benefit from drought chimner and cooper 2004 measured the abundance of stable oxygen isotopes in rainfall groundwater water from different soil depths and xylem water to identify the potential water sources for water uptake of shrubs liao et al 2018b analyzed the hydrogen and oxygen isotope abundance to quantify the soil depths for water uptake of maize during different growth stages and similar experiments quantifying the contribution ratios of soil moisture at different soil depths to maize water were performed in other studies ma and song 2016 wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 in this study a perennial fruit tree cherry prunus avium l was selected as the reference research object furrow irrigation and three typically micro irrigation treatments were employed to study the effects of different irrigation regimes on soil moisture availability in the main root zone of cherry trees soil moisture and its coefficients of variation at different growth stages were measured and the abundance of stable hydrogen isotopes in cherry tree water and soil water were analyzed to quantify the contribution ratios of soil moisture to water uptake by cherry trees finally the effects of coupling water and nitrogen fertilizer were investigated to reveal the mechanisms by which micro irrigation strategies influence soil moisture availability 2 methods 2 1 study site the experiment was conducted in a traditional cherry prunus avium l orchard field located in beijing china fig 1 the annual average values of precipitation temperature and sunshine duration at the study site were 600 mm 11 9 c and 2459 h respectively before the experiment we rebuilt the study site by leveling the land renewing the pump digging and burying water pipes etc the head of the micro irrigation system was set at the edge of the study area which was used to control irrigation and fertilization ground water pumped from the well in the orchard was used for irrigation the soil of the study site was composed of loam clay 9 29 silt 50 and sand 40 71 sandy loam clay 5 27 silt 31 25 and sand 63 48

irrigation and three micro irrigation under mulch treatments fi furrow irrigation rdm ring drip irrigation under mulch pdm parallel drip irrigation under mulch stm small tube flow irrigation under mulch were set as described in table 1 for furrow irrigation treatment the furrow was set as a 2 m width 90 m length the drip lines and emitters for micro irrigation treatments were purchased from beijing luyuan plastic co ltd beijing china and the polypropylene and polyethylene mulch film was purchased from shandong xinhao plastic co ltd weifang china three similar cherry trees growing close to each other were selected as replicates for each treatment the trime monitor probes trime pico iph germany were set to measure the dynamic changes in soil moisture in the profile at different cherry tree growth stages to analyze the distribution of soil moisture in the entire profile the trime monitor probes were placed along the lines parallel distance and between plants vertical distance and the interval between two probes was 80 cm fig 1 the data measured by monitor probes were calibrated by comparing with data detected by the drying oven method the coefficients r2 of linear regression

started in april of 2015 and ended in october of 2017 during the experiment all experimental processes except for irrigation and fertilization events such as weeding pruning and pulling were performed by orchardists following the same local traditional methods chicken manure organic fertilizer 4 5 kg m 2 was applied to the study site as the base fertilizer for every treatment when ploughing in the middle of october every year the first base fertilizer was applied to soil in october of 2014 in 2015 the first irrigation and fertilization events during the growth period for furrow irrigation control treatment were conducted simultaneously on april 8 the amounts of irrigation and compound fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 16 18 5 for furrow irrigation were 70 mm and 600 kg hm 2 respectively which followed local traditional methods the second and third irrigation and fertilization events were conducted simultaneously on april 26 and may 16 using the same amount as the first event almost the same schedules of irrigation and fertilization were used for micro irrigation treatments however a reduced irrigation amount and 150 kg hm 2 water soluble fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 10 13 12 recommended by manufactory were applied except fertilizer was not applied on april 8 every time for micro irrigation treatments the irrigation amount was determined using the following equation cao et al 2018 yang et al 2017 ir 10 h w θ upper θ lower where ir is the irrigation amount mm and h is the designed wetting depth cm in this study the soil moisture monitoring depth was 120 cm therefore h was set to 130 cm additionally w is the percentage of soil wetting area which was set at 0 25 θ upper is the upper limit of average soil moisture content usually considered field water holding capacity 0 34 cm3 cm 3 and θ lower is the lower limit of the average soil moisture content usually considered 0 6 θ upper 0 20 cm3 cm 3 in 2016 and 2017 similar irrigation and fertilization strategies were used for furrow irrigation and micro irrigation treatments which were conducted during the cherry tree leaf expansion stage flowering stage and maturity stage the amounts of irrigation and fertilization were 70 mm and 750 kg hm 2 for furrow irrigation while they were 45 mm calculated based on equation 1 and 225 kg hm 2 for micro irrigation treatments 2 3 2 sample collection soil samples and xylem stem samples were collected at the cherry tree leaf expansion stage flowering stage and maturity stage in 2017 to determine the abundance of hydrogen stable isotope there was no rainfall or irrigation for three days before every sampling event soil samples were taken from three points around the trunk at a 120 angle to each other in the soil profile 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm using a typical soil collection auger 5 cm in diameter and 140 cm in length three samples collected from each layer were mixed evenly then immediately put into glass bottles and sealed with parafilm all samples were placed in the freezer at 20 to prevent changes in the isotopic composition in addition 8 10 cherry tree xylem stem segments were sampled from branches at 5 cm intervals after which stem samples were stored using the same method as for the soil samples a vacuum extraction was used to collect water from soil and xylem stem samples then the hydrogen stable isotope abundance of extracted water was determined using a water isotope analyzer picarro l2120 i usa in addition soil samples were collected to measure the distribution of nitrogen nh4 n no3 n for evaluating the coupling effect of water and nitrogen in the soil profile to maintain consistency with the dynamic changes in soil moisture the soil samples for nitrogen measurement were collected along and 10 cm away from the trime monitor probes using a soil collection auger 5 cm in diameter and 140 cm in length at depths of 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm the collected samples were air dried crushed and passed through a 2 mm sieve before measurement after which the nitrogen nh4 n no3 n concentrations were analyzed using a continuous flow analyzer autoanalyser iii bran luebbe germany 2 4 data analysis the coefficients of variation cvs of soil moisture in profiles were obtained by the single variable grid statistical method of the surfer 12 0 software golden software colorado usa two dimensional distribution maps of water and nitrogen nh4 n no3 n were obtained by the linear kriging method of the surfer 12 0 software the measured hydrogen isotope abundance of cherry tree stem xylem and soil water in different depth were used to determine the contribution ratio of soil moisture at different depths to cherry tree water uptake by means of the multi source mass balance method phillips et al 2005 phillips and gregg 2003 in this method the mass balance equation δd c1δd1 c2δd2 c3δd3 cnδdn is used to calculate the corresponding contribution ratio of each soil depth where δd is considered as the mixed hydrogen isotope abundance of cherry tree stem xylem from possible soil water sources c1 to cn are the mean contribution ratios of soil moisture at 1 to n depth e g 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm in this study and c1 c2 c3 cn 100 δd1 to δdn are the hydrogen isotope composition of different soil water sources at 1 to n depth significant differences between treatments were measured using one way anova spss 15 0 the relationship between the coefficient of variation of soil moisture and the contribution ratios of soil moisture to cherry tree water uptake was determined by regression analysis and the relationship between soil moisture and nitrogen nh4 n no3 n concentrations during different growth stages was also identified by regression analysis 3 results 3 1 dynamic changes in soil moisture profile during 2015 2017 the dynamic changes in moisture in response to the three micro irrigations rdm pdm stm and furrow irrigation fi in the soil profile during 2015 2017 are displayed in fig 2 1 according to the soil texture measured before the experiment the entire soil profile was divided into three typical layers 0 40 cm loam 40 60 cm sandy loam and 60 120 cm loamy sand the soil moisture levels of the three typical layers were then separately studied to show that soil moisture increased as soil depth increased both micro irrigation and furrow irrigation treatments showed the same trend in soil moisture 60 120 cm 40 60 cm 0 40 cm these values were related to the laws of soil water transport and root water uptake specifically rainfall and irrigation water will infiltrate into deep soil slowly and the main root zone of the experimental cherry trees was within 0 60 cm therefore the cherry trees will take up and utilize shallow soil water preferentially resulting in higher moisture content in deep soil when compared with the fi treatment the pdm treatment significantly p 0 05 increased the average soil moisture in the range of 0 60 cm by 7 1 8 9 and stm treatment significantly p 0 05 increased the average soil moisture in the range of 0 40 cm and 60 120 cm by 4 3 5 4 respectively fig 2 2 3 2 coefficient of variation of soil moisture at different cherry tree growth stages the average soil moisture and coefficients of variation cvs in the profiles of the four irrigation treatments rdm pdm stm and fi at different cherry tree growth stages leaf expansion stage flowering stage and maturity stage are shown in fig 3 in the leaf expansion stage compared with fi treatment stm treatment improved the soil moisture of the 0 60 cm and 60 cm depths by 1 and 4 1 while rdm and pdm treatments were comparable to fi treatment the cv values of the micro irrigation treatments were larger than those of fi treatment in the 0 60 cm depth it indicates that micro irrigation treatments increased the rangeability of moisture change in the main root zone which is supposed to be affected by changes in root water uptake capacity in the flowering stage compared with fi treatment stm treatment increased the soil moisture by 3 5 for the 0 60 cm depth and 5 1 for the 60 cm depth however the rangeability of moisture change in the main root zone 0 60 cm was gradually enhanced under fi treatment with its cv value slightly greater than that of rdm treatment in the maturation stage although pdm and stm treatments still maintained a higher moisture content than fi treatment the variation in cv values demonstrates that fi treatment further increased the rangeability of moisture change in the main root zone 0 60 cm 3 3 hydrogen isotope abundance and contribution ratio of soil moisture to water uptake of cherry trees during different growth stages the range of proportions of cherry tree water extraction from each soil depth at different cherry tree growth stages are shown in fig 4 in the leaf expansion stage under the rdm treatment the water contribution ratio of the 0 20 cm soil depth was largest reaching 71 5 while those of the 20 40 40 60 6 80 and 80 100 cm depths were 3 6 4 8 13 8 and 6 2 respectively the contribution ratios of soil moisture to cherry tree water uptake in pdm and stm treatments were similar with those of pdm treatment being 18 7 23 2 22 20 9 and 15 2 and those of stm treatment being 18 22 8 22 1 13 7 and 23 5 respectively in fi treatment soil water supply was mainly concentrated in surface and lower depth with values of 22 8 6 6 22 6 24 6 and 23 4 respectively in the flowering stage rdm pdm and stm treatments were mainly realized as surface water supply with values for rdm of 66 3 11 8 4 7 7 and 6 5 being observed while those of pdm were 72 5 1 17 9 2 6 and 2 5 and those of stm were 68 4 6 8 10 5 9 and 9 respectively fi treatment led to deep water uptake as indicated by values of 7 9 14 4 13 3 11 5 and 52 9 respectively in the maturation stage rdm treatment resulted in surface water uptake being dominant accounting for 64 1 11 3 11 3 7 3 and 5 9 respectively pdm treatment resulted in an average water uptake at all soil depths with values of 27 5 16 8 26 4 12 5 and 16 8 respectively being observed stm treatment showed surface water uptake as indicated by values of 50 4 13 9 5 7 22 3 and 7 8 respectively fi treatment resulted in surface middle and lower water supply with values of 41 6 4 9 8 38 5 and 7 1 respectively the contribution ratios of soil moisture to water uptake of cherry trees in different growth stages are shown in fig 5 the micro irrigation treatments significantly increased the water contribution ratio of the main root zone 0 60 cm with the most significant increase occurring in the flowering stage in which rdm pdm stm and fi contributed 86 95 85 and 36 of the water uptake of cherry trees respectively in the leaf expansion stage rdm pdm stm and fi contributed 80 64 63 and 52 of the water uptake of cherry trees respectively in the maturation stage the contributed ratios of rdm pdm stm and fi are87 71 70 and 54 respectively 3 4 relationship between the coefficient of variation of soil moisture and water uptake at different soil depths the cvs of soil moisture at different soil depths represent the intensity of soil moisture change over time reflecting the sensitivity of water uptake by cherry trees to soil moisture at different depths the percentage of water uptake of cherry trees from different soil depths was determined by hydrogen isotope abundance analysis which directly reflects the contribution ratios of soil moisture to cherry tree water uptake analyzing the relationship between these two data sets helps verify the accuracy of the results obtained from any single method the relationship between the cvs of soil moisture and the contribution ratios of soil moisture to water uptake of cherry trees at different soil depths is shown in fig 6 the results demonstrate a significant p 0 05 linear regression relationship between the cvs and contribution ratios at the leaf expansion and flowering stages and an extremely significant p 0 01 linear regression relationship at the maturation stage it indicates that variations in soil moisture of cherry trees coincide with the contribution ratios of soil moisture to cherry trees water uptake these findings confirmed that micro irrigation treatments enhanced cherry tree water uptake in the main root zone 4 discussion quantifying the soil water availability of cherry orchard profiles is essential to understanding the water utilization mechanisms of cherry trees at different growth stages which can be used to develop more efficient irrigation schedules in this study we quantified the contribution ratios of soil moisture to water uptake of cherry trees under different irrigation regimes at the leaf expansion flowering and maturation stages the results showed that the soil water of the main root zone 0 60 cm under micro irrigation treatments accounted for 63 95 of the contribution to cherry tree water uptake while the water contribution ratio under furrow irrigation is 36 54 fig 5 cao et al 2018 also found that cherry trees mainly utilized soil water from a soil depth of 20 50 cm in the fruit growth stage and 0 20 cm in the postharvest stage under drip irrigation treatment bertrand et al 2014 compared spatiotemporal variability of water uptake by 10 alluvial trees and found that cherry trees mainly used water from soil depths of 0 80 cm and groundwater groundwater level 1 64 m to 4 0 m in the present study the contribution ratio of groundwater to cherry tree water was not considered because the groundwater level is very deep more than 26 m in the beijing plain zhang et al 2018b another investigations of other perennial fruit trees such as apple and pear have shown that the contribution ratio of soil moisture to water uptake was concentrated in the main root zone green and clothier 1998 kang et al 2002 and the water availability in the soil profile changed in response to different irrigation regimes zheng et al 2019 nitrogen content in soil plays an important role in influencing root water uptake erenoglu et al 2010 guo et al 2002 pandey et al 2000 and the coupling effect of water and nitrogen fertilizer has been demonstrated to improve water use liu and zhang 2007 shen et al 2013 wang et al 2018 therefore the spatial distribution of water and nitrogen nh4 n no3 n in the soil profile at different stages of cherry tree growth were measured figs 7 9 the results showed that the average no3 n content of furrow irrigation was 4 6 and 10 6 greater at soil depths 60 cm than in the main root zone 0 60 cm depth in the leaf expansion stage and maturation stage respectively no3 n may be leached into deep soil under traditional flood irrigation because of the large amount of water used cassel sharmasarkar et al 2001 sharma et al 2012 the three micro irrigation treatments used in this study decreased the leaching of no3 n because of the limited amount of irrigation and controlled wetting depth resulting in the average no3 n content of the main root zone 0 60 cm being 30 78 66 9 and 41 3 higher than that of the 60 cm soil depth for the leaf expansion stage flowering stage and maturation stage respectively similar results have been reported in many previous studies gupta et al 2010 li et al 2005 li and liu 2011 rajput and patel 2006 moreover mulching was also demonstrated to be effective at decreasing no3 n leaching marui et al 2004 romic et al 2003 zhang et al 2012 regression analysis indicated many significant linear relationship between soil moisture and nitrogen concentrations nh4 n no3 n at soil depths of 0 60 cm under micro irrigation situations in the flowering and maturation stages but only one significant linear relationship between soil moisture and nh4 n concentration was observed at these depths under furrow irrigation during the maturation stage table 2 however in the leaf expansion stage a limited significant linear relationship was observed under micro irrigation treatments because no solute nitrogen fertilizer was applied with irrigation events in this study micro irrigation treatments increased the no3 n concentration in the main root zone 0 60 cm and obtained higher coupling degree of water and nitrogen it has confirmed that soil nitrogen enrichment can enhance hydraulic conductance of root adamtey et al 2010 wang et al 2012 and a sustained supply of water and nitrogen was conducive to the accumulation of nitrogen in the root system liao 2018 then improved the root water uptake rate liao et al 2018a shi et al 2013 shi and zuo 2009 the results revealed that micro irrigation under mulch treatments led to a higher no3 n concentration and better degree of coupling of water and nitrogen than furrow irrigation in the main root zone 0 60 cm which enhanced the root water uptake in this zone resulting in improvement of the contribution ratio of soil moisture to cherry tree water uptake 5 conclusion under furrow irrigation and three micro irrigation situations the contribution ratios of soil moisture to water uptake by cherry trees at different growth stages was quantified and its effect mechanism was explored it was concluded that the soil moisture availability in the main root zone 0 60 cm was enhanced by micro irrigation with soil water under micro irrigation treatments accounting for 63 95 of the contribution ratio to cherry tree water uptake while the water contribution ratio under furrow irrigation is 36 54 the detailed results showed that micro irrigation under mulch treatments significantly increased the water contribution ratio in the main root zone by 11 28 49 59 and 16 33 during the leaf development flowering and maturation stages respectively compared to furrow irrigation moreover the water contribution ratios of different soil depths obtained by hydrogen isotope abundance were consistent with the dynamic variation coefficients of soil moisture measured in situ indicating that soil horizons with higher water contributions also lead to more drastic moisture changes the better coupling effect of water and nitrogen in the main root zone 0 60 cm under micro irrigation than that of furrow irrigation may promote the growth of root systems in this zone to a certain extent then enhance its water uptake capacity this explains the higher contribution ratios of soil moisture to cherry tree water uptake at depths of 0 60 cm under micro irrigation it is important to note that the dynamic growth e g root length root nitrogen and spatial distribution of root systems in this study was not measured which limits the understanding of the mechanism for water uptake real time quantitative studies of the root systems of perennial fruit trees is difficult therefore additional studies using

10877,quantification of the availability of soil moisture at different depths of the soil profile to crop water uptake facilitates the development of scientific water management strategies a three year field irrigation experiment was conducted in a cherry orchard in north china under three micro irrigation under mulch mim situations and furrow irrigation fi was set as control treatment the objectives of this study were to i study the dynamic variation of soil moisture at different cherry tree growth stages ii further quantify the contribution ratio of soil moisture to water uptake of cherry tree by employing hydrogen isotope abundance measurement and ⅲ finally discuss the mechanism of specific contribution ratios under different irrigation regimes the contribution ratio of soil moisture to water uptake of cherry tree in the main root zone 0 60 cm was significantly enhanced by three mim treatments when compared with fi the contribution ratios were increased by 11 28 49 59 and 16 33 during the leaf expansion stage flowering stage and maturation stage respectively moreover a significant linear relationship p 0 05 between the contribution ratio and the dynamic variation coefficient of soil moisture was achieved indicating that the contribution ratio estimated by hydrogen isotope abundance was consistent with the actual variation of soil moisture in the profile further analysis revealed that a higher no3 n concentration and better coupling of water and nitrogen fertilizer in the main root zone may lead to higher contribution ratio of soil moisture to cherry tree water uptake under mim treatments keywords micro irrigation soil water availability cherry stable isotope water uptake 1 introduction soil moisture is an important factor that affects crop growth and yield however not all water in the soil can be effectively absorbed and utilized by crops generally speaking only water between the field capacity and the permanent wilting percentage is considered soil available water which can be effectively used by crops and the availability refers to contribution ratio of soil moisture to crop water uptake and dry matter output salter and haworth 1961 to maintain the availability of soil water in the main root zone traditional surface irrigation strategies such as flooding irrigation and furrow irrigation require a large amount of water because water leakage and evaporation occur quickly under these irrigation situations unfortunately there is a growing shortage of water resources worldwide cheng et al 2009 kummu et al 2016 therefore improvement of soil water availability in the main root zone using limited irrigation amounts has become a serious and urgent challenge hartzell et al 2017 jägermeyr et al 2015 topak et al 2011 previous reports indicated that micro irrigation strategies including micro sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and basin bubbler irrigation are capable of increasing the availability of soil water in the main root zone to enhance the water use efficiency wue of crops çolak et al 2018 fang et al 2018 ibragimov et al 2007 li 2018 li et al 2010 topak et al 2011 zapata et al 2018 under micro irrigation situations the watered zone of the soil profile can be precisely controlled within the main root zone thereby reducing water leakage into the deep soil layer and ensuring the uniformity of irrigation qin et al 2016 yang et al 2017 moreover micro irrigation under mulch can exert greater advantages such as reducing soil surface evaporation preventing weed growth and protecting emitters and driplines from being destroyed wang et al 2011 y zhang et al 2018a reyes cabrera et al 2016 reported that when compared with traditional seepage irrigation drip irrigation can adequately irrigate shallow root areas of the potato to enhance its wue with reduced water supply li and rao 2003 reported that micro sprinkler irrigation increased the uniformity of soil moisture and fertilizer and the distribution of soil moisture and fertilizers was confirmed to be the normal distribution function zotarelli et al 2009 found that one of the factors driving root distribution was soil moisture availability and that subsurface drip irrigation increased the wue to increase tomato yields hou et al 2010 found that the need for irrigation water and evapotranspiration were reduced by drip irrigation under mulch when compared to drip irrigation without mulch later zhang et al 2017 demonstrated that drip irrigation under mulch at 35 wetted soil percentage was most conducive to potato production in northwest china although many other reports have confirmed that micro irrigation and mulching treatments increased the soil water availability arora et al 2011 ball and sammis 2001 du et al 2008 nouri et al 2019 özmen et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2013 sun et al 2016 there have been few quantitative studies of soil moisture availability at different soil depths for perennial fruit trees bertrand et al 2014 cao et al 2018 and the mechanism responsible for the effects of different irrigation strategies on soil moisture availability of perennial fruit trees needs to be investigated in depth application of stable hydrogen or oxygen isotopes to quantify the responses of crop growth to variations in moisture availability has been recognized as a credible method of determining spatiotemporal patterns of water uptake bertrand et al 2014 chimner and cooper 2004 ma and song 2016 the abundance of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in surface water groundwater rainfall and soil water differ significantly because of physical and chemical processes such as infiltration transportation evaporation and mineral chemical reactions and the stable isotopes from different water sources do not fractionate when being transported in roots and stems cao et al 2018 gat 1996 liao et al 2017 schwinning et al 2005 2003 conducted a series of experiments to examine hydrogen isotope abundance to study the mechanisms of rainwater utilization by plants demonstrating that the most deep rooted plants would benefit from drought chimner and cooper 2004 measured the abundance of stable oxygen isotopes in rainfall groundwater water from different soil depths and xylem water to identify the potential water sources for water uptake of shrubs liao et al 2018b analyzed the hydrogen and oxygen isotope abundance to quantify the soil depths for water uptake of maize during different growth stages and similar experiments quantifying the contribution ratios of soil moisture at different soil depths to maize water were performed in other studies ma and song 2016 wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 in this study a perennial fruit tree cherry prunus avium l was selected as the reference research object furrow irrigation and three typically micro irrigation treatments were employed to study the effects of different irrigation regimes on soil moisture availability in the main root zone of cherry trees soil moisture and its coefficients of variation at different growth stages were measured and the abundance of stable hydrogen isotopes in cherry tree water and soil water were analyzed to quantify the contribution ratios of soil moisture to water uptake by cherry trees finally the effects of coupling water and nitrogen fertilizer were investigated to reveal the mechanisms by which micro irrigation strategies influence soil moisture availability 2 methods 2 1 study site the experiment was conducted in a traditional cherry prunus avium l orchard field located in beijing china fig 1 the annual average values of precipitation temperature and sunshine duration at the study site were 600 mm 11 9 c and 2459 h respectively before the experiment we rebuilt the study site by leveling the land renewing the pump digging and burying water pipes etc the head of the micro irrigation system was set at the edge of the study area which was used to control irrigation and fertilization ground water pumped from the well in the orchard was used for irrigation the soil of the study site was composed of loam clay 9 29 silt 50 and sand 40 71 sandy loam clay 5 27 silt 31 25 and sand 63 48 and loamy sand clay 2 34 silt 16 54 and sand 81 13 at depths of 0 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 120 cm respectively at 0 40 cm the field water holding capacity fc was measured to be 0 31 cm3 cm 3 the dry bulk

irrigation and three micro irrigation under mulch treatments fi furrow irrigation rdm ring drip irrigation under mulch pdm parallel drip irrigation under mulch stm small tube flow irrigation under mulch were set as described in table 1 for furrow irrigation treatment the furrow was set as a 2 m width 90 m length the drip lines and emitters for micro irrigation treatments were purchased from beijing luyuan plastic co ltd beijing china and the polypropylene and polyethylene mulch film was purchased from shandong xinhao plastic co ltd weifang china three similar cherry trees growing close to each other were selected as replicates for each treatment the trime monitor probes trime pico iph germany were set to measure the dynamic changes in soil moisture in the profile at different cherry tree growth stages to analyze the distribution of soil moisture in the entire profile the trime monitor probes were placed along the lines parallel distance and between plants vertical distance and the interval between two probes was 80 cm fig 1 the data measured by monitor probes were calibrated by comparing with data detected by the drying oven method the coefficients r2 of linear regression equations obtained by fitting these two sets of data are 0 83 0 90 and 0 86 for 0 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 120 cm respectively 2 3 experimental process 2 3 1 irrigation and fertilization the experiment started in april of 2015 and ended in october of 2017 during the experiment all experimental processes except for irrigation and fertilization events such as weeding pruning and pulling were performed by orchardists following the same local traditional methods chicken manure organic fertilizer 4 5 kg m 2 was applied to the study site as the base fertilizer for every treatment when ploughing in the middle of october every year the first base fertilizer was applied to soil in october of 2014 in 2015 the first irrigation and fertilization events during the growth period for furrow irrigation control treatment were conducted simultaneously on april 8 the amounts of irrigation and compound fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 16 18 5 for furrow irrigation were 70 mm and 600 kg hm 2 respectively which followed local traditional methods the second and third irrigation and fertilization events were conducted simultaneously on april 26 and may 16 using the same amount as the first event almost the same schedules of irrigation and fertilization were used for micro irrigation treatments however a reduced irrigation amount and 150 kg hm 2 water soluble fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 10 13 12 recommended by manufactory were applied except fertilizer was not applied on april 8 every time for micro irrigation treatments the irrigation amount was determined using the following equation cao et al 2018 yang et al 2017 ir 10 h w θ upper θ lower where ir is the irrigation amount mm and h is the designed wetting depth cm in this study the soil moisture monitoring depth was 120 cm therefore h was set to 130 cm additionally w is the percentage of soil wetting area which was set at 0 25 θ upper is the upper limit of average soil moisture content usually considered field water holding capacity 0 34 cm3 cm 3 and θ lower is the lower limit of the average soil moisture content usually considered 0 6 θ upper 0 20 cm3 cm 3 in 2016 and 2017 similar irrigation and fertilization strategies were used for furrow irrigation and micro irrigation treatments which were conducted during the cherry tree leaf expansion stage flowering stage and maturity stage the amounts of irrigation and fertilization were 70 mm and 750 kg hm 2 for furrow irrigation while they were 45 mm calculated based on equation 1 and 225 kg hm 2 for micro irrigation treatments 2 3 2 sample collection soil samples and xylem stem samples were collected at the cherry tree leaf expansion stage flowering stage and maturity stage in 2017 to determine the abundance of hydrogen stable isotope there was no rainfall or irrigation for three days before every sampling event soil samples were taken from three points around the trunk at a 120 angle to each other in the soil profile 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm using a typical soil collection auger 5 cm in diameter and 140 cm in length three samples collected from each layer were mixed evenly then immediately put into glass bottles and sealed with parafilm all samples were placed in the freezer at 20 to prevent changes in the isotopic composition in addition 8 10 cherry tree xylem stem segments were sampled from branches at 5 cm intervals after which stem samples were stored using the same method as for the soil samples a vacuum extraction was used to collect water from soil and xylem stem samples then the hydrogen stable isotope abundance of extracted water was determined using a water isotope analyzer picarro l2120 i usa in addition soil samples were collected to measure the distribution of nitrogen nh4 n no3 n for evaluating the coupling effect of water and nitrogen in the soil profile to maintain consistency with the dynamic changes in soil moisture the soil samples for nitrogen measurement were collected along and 10 cm away from the trime monitor probes using a soil collection auger 5 cm in diameter and 140 cm in length at depths of 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm the collected samples were air dried crushed and passed through a 2 mm sieve before measurement after which the nitrogen nh4 n no3 n concentrations were analyzed using a continuous flow analyzer autoanalyser iii bran luebbe germany 2 4 data analysis the coefficients of variation cvs of soil moisture in profiles were obtained by the single variable grid statistical method of the surfer 12 0 software golden software colorado usa two dimensional distribution maps of water and nitrogen nh4 n no3 n were obtained by the linear kriging method of the surfer 12 0 software the measured hydrogen isotope abundance of cherry tree stem xylem and soil water in different depth were used to determine the contribution ratio of soil moisture at different depths to cherry tree water uptake by means of the multi source mass balance method phillips et al 2005 phillips and gregg 2003 in this method the mass balance equation δd c1δd1 c2δd2 c3δd3 cnδdn is used to calculate the corresponding contribution ratio of each soil depth where δd is considered as the mixed hydrogen isotope abundance of cherry tree stem xylem from possible soil water sources c1 to cn are the mean contribution ratios of soil moisture at 1 to n depth e g 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm in this study and c1 c2 c3 cn 100 δd1 to δdn are the hydrogen isotope composition of different soil water sources at 1 to n depth significant differences between treatments were measured using one way anova spss 15 0 the relationship between the coefficient of variation of soil moisture and the contribution ratios of soil moisture to cherry tree water uptake was determined by regression analysis and the relationship between soil moisture and nitrogen nh4 n no3 n concentrations during different growth stages was also identified by regression analysis 3 results 3 1 dynamic changes in soil moisture profile during 2015 2017 the dynamic changes in moisture in response to the three micro irrigations rdm pdm stm and furrow irrigation fi in the soil profile during 2015 2017 are displayed in fig 2 1 according to the soil texture measured before the experiment the entire soil profile was divided into three typical layers 0 40 cm loam 40 60 cm sandy loam and 60 120 cm loamy sand the soil moisture levels of the three typical layers were then separately studied to show that soil moisture increased as soil depth increased both micro irrigation and furrow irrigation treatments showed the same trend in soil moisture 60 120 cm 40 60 cm 0 40 cm these values were related to the laws of soil water transport and root water uptake specifically rainfall and irrigation water will infiltrate into deep soil slowly and the main root zone of the experimental cherry trees was within 0 60 cm therefore the cherry trees will take up and utilize shallow soil water preferentially resulting in higher moisture content in deep soil when compared with the fi treatment the pdm treatment significantly p 0 05 increased the average soil moisture in the range of 0 60 cm by 7 1 8 9 and stm treatment significantly p 0 05 increased the average soil moisture in the range of 0 40 cm and 60 120 cm by 4 3 5 4 respectively fig 2 2 3 2 coefficient of variation of soil moisture at different cherry tree growth stages the average soil moisture and coefficients of variation cvs in the profiles of the four irrigation treatments rdm pdm stm and fi at different cherry tree growth stages leaf expansion stage flowering stage and maturity stage are shown in fig 3 in the leaf expansion stage compared with fi treatment stm treatment improved the soil moisture of the 0 60 cm and 60 cm depths by 1 and 4 1 while rdm and pdm treatments were comparable to fi treatment the cv values of the micro irrigation treatments were larger than those of fi treatment in the 0 60 cm depth it indicates that micro irrigation treatments increased the rangeability of moisture change in the main root zone which is supposed to be affected by changes in root water uptake capacity in the flowering stage compared with fi treatment stm treatment increased the soil moisture by 3 5 for the 0 60 cm depth and 5 1 for the 60 cm depth however the rangeability of moisture change in the main root zone 0 60 cm was gradually enhanced under fi treatment with its cv value slightly greater than that of rdm treatment in the maturation stage although pdm and stm treatments still maintained a higher moisture content than fi treatment the variation in cv values demonstrates that fi treatment further increased the rangeability of moisture change in the main root zone 0 60 cm 3 3 hydrogen isotope abundance and contribution ratio of soil moisture to water uptake of cherry trees during different growth stages the range of proportions of cherry tree water extraction from each soil depth at different cherry tree growth stages are shown in fig 4 in the leaf expansion stage under the rdm treatment the water contribution ratio of the 0 20 cm soil depth was largest reaching 71 5 while those of the 20 40 40 60 6 80 and 80 100 cm depths were 3 6 4 8 13 8 and 6 2 respectively the contribution ratios of soil moisture to cherry tree water uptake in pdm and stm treatments were similar with those of pdm treatment being 18 7 23 2 22 20 9 and 15 2 and those of stm treatment being 18 22 8 22 1 13 7 and 23 5 respectively in fi treatment soil water supply was mainly concentrated in surface and lower depth with values of 22 8 6 6 22 6 24 6 and 23 4 respectively in the flowering stage rdm pdm and stm treatments were mainly realized as surface water supply with values for rdm of 66 3 11 8 4 7 7 and 6 5 being observed while those of pdm were 72 5 1 17 9 2 6 and 2 5 and those of stm were 68 4 6 8 10 5 9 and 9 respectively fi treatment led to deep water uptake as indicated by values of 7 9 14 4 13 3 11 5 and 52 9 respectively in the maturation stage rdm treatment resulted in surface water uptake being dominant accounting for 64 1 11 3 11 3 7 3 and 5 9 respectively pdm treatment resulted in an average water uptake at all soil depths with values of 27 5 16 8 26 4 12 5 and 16 8 respectively being observed stm treatment showed surface water uptake as indicated by values of 50 4 13 9 5 7 22 3 and 7 8 respectively fi treatment resulted in surface middle and lower water supply with values of 41 6 4 9 8 38 5 and 7 1 respectively the contribution ratios of soil moisture to water uptake of cherry trees in different growth stages are shown in fig 5 the micro irrigation treatments significantly increased the water contribution ratio of the main root zone 0 60 cm with the most significant increase occurring in the flowering stage in which rdm pdm stm and fi contributed 86 95 85 and 36 of the water uptake of cherry trees respectively in the leaf expansion stage rdm pdm stm and fi contributed 80 64 63 and 52 of the water uptake of cherry trees respectively in the maturation stage the contributed ratios of rdm pdm stm and fi are87 71 70 and 54 respectively 3 4 relationship between the coefficient of variation of soil moisture and water uptake at different soil depths the cvs of soil moisture at different soil depths represent the intensity of soil moisture change over time reflecting the sensitivity of water uptake by cherry trees to soil moisture at different depths the percentage of water uptake of cherry trees from different soil depths was determined by hydrogen isotope abundance analysis which directly reflects the contribution ratios of soil moisture to cherry tree water uptake analyzing the relationship between these two data sets helps verify the accuracy of the results obtained from any single method the relationship between the cvs of soil moisture and the contribution ratios of soil moisture to water uptake of cherry trees at different soil depths is shown in fig 6 the results demonstrate a significant p 0 05 linear regression relationship between the cvs and contribution ratios at the leaf expansion and flowering stages and an extremely significant p 0 01 linear regression relationship at the maturation stage it indicates that variations in soil moisture of cherry trees coincide with the contribution ratios of soil moisture to cherry trees water uptake these findings confirmed that micro irrigation treatments enhanced cherry tree water uptake in the main root zone 4 discussion quantifying the soil water availability of cherry orchard profiles is essential to understanding the water utilization mechanisms of cherry trees at different growth stages which can be used to develop more efficient irrigation schedules in this study we quantified the contribution ratios of soil moisture to water uptake of cherry trees under different irrigation regimes at the leaf expansion flowering and maturation stages the results showed that the soil water of the main root zone 0 60 cm under micro irrigation treatments accounted for 63 95 of the contribution to cherry tree water uptake while the water contribution ratio under furrow irrigation is 36 54 fig 5 cao et al 2018 also found that cherry trees mainly utilized soil water from a soil depth of 20 50 cm in the fruit growth stage and 0 20 cm in the postharvest stage under drip irrigation treatment bertrand et al 2014 compared spatiotemporal variability of water uptake by 10 alluvial trees and found that cherry trees mainly used water from soil depths of 0 80 cm and groundwater groundwater level 1 64 m to 4 0 m in the present study the contribution ratio of groundwater to cherry tree water was not considered because the groundwater level is very deep more than 26 m in the beijing plain zhang et al 2018b another investigations of other perennial fruit trees such as apple and pear have shown that the contribution ratio of soil moisture to water uptake was concentrated in the main root zone green and clothier 1998 kang et al 2002 and the water availability in the soil profile changed in response to different irrigation regimes zheng et al 2019 nitrogen content in soil plays an important role in influencing root water uptake erenoglu et al 2010 guo et al 2002 pandey et al 2000 and the coupling effect of water and nitrogen fertilizer has been demonstrated to improve water use liu and zhang 2007 shen et al 2013 wang et al 2018 therefore the spatial distribution of water and nitrogen nh4 n no3 n in the soil profile at different stages of cherry tree growth were measured figs 7 9 the results showed that the average no3 n content of furrow irrigation was 4 6 and 10 6 greater at soil depths 60 cm than in the main root zone 0 60 cm depth in the leaf expansion stage and maturation stage respectively no3 n may be leached into deep soil under traditional flood irrigation because of the large amount of water used cassel sharmasarkar et al 2001 sharma et al 2012 the three micro irrigation treatments used in this study decreased the leaching of no3 n because of the limited amount of irrigation and controlled wetting depth resulting in the average no3 n content of the main root zone 0 60 cm being 30 78 66 9 and 41 3 higher than that of the 60 cm soil depth for the leaf expansion stage flowering stage and maturation stage respectively similar results have been reported in many previous studies gupta et al 2010 li et al 2005 li and liu 2011 rajput and patel 2006 moreover mulching was also demonstrated to be effective at decreasing no3 n leaching marui et al 2004 romic et al 2003 zhang et al 2012 regression analysis indicated many significant linear relationship between soil moisture and nitrogen concentrations nh4 n no3 n at soil depths of 0 60 cm under micro irrigation situations in the flowering and maturation stages but only one significant linear relationship between soil moisture and nh4 n concentration was observed at these depths under furrow irrigation during the maturation stage table 2 however in the leaf expansion stage a limited significant linear relationship was observed under micro irrigation treatments because no solute nitrogen fertilizer was applied with irrigation events in this study micro irrigation treatments increased the no3 n concentration in the main root zone 0 60 cm and obtained higher coupling degree of water and nitrogen it has confirmed that soil nitrogen enrichment can enhance hydraulic conductance of root adamtey et al 2010 wang et al 2012 and a sustained supply of water and nitrogen was conducive to the accumulation of nitrogen in the root system liao 2018 then improved the root water uptake rate liao et al 2018a shi et al 2013 shi and zuo 2009 the results revealed that micro irrigation under mulch treatments led to a higher no3 n concentration and better degree of coupling of water and nitrogen than furrow irrigation in the main root zone 0 60 cm which enhanced the root water uptake in this zone resulting in improvement of the contribution ratio of soil moisture to cherry tree water uptake 5 conclusion under furrow irrigation and three micro irrigation situations the contribution ratios of soil moisture to water uptake by cherry trees at different growth stages was quantified and its effect mechanism was explored it was concluded that the soil moisture availability in the main root zone 0 60 cm was enhanced by micro irrigation with soil water under micro irrigation treatments accounting for 63 95 of the contribution ratio to cherry tree water uptake while the water contribution ratio under furrow irrigation is 36 54 the detailed results showed that micro irrigation under mulch treatments significantly increased the water contribution ratio in the main root zone by 11 28 49 59 and 16 33 during the leaf development flowering and maturation stages respectively compared to furrow irrigation moreover the water contribution ratios of different soil depths obtained by hydrogen isotope abundance were consistent with the dynamic variation coefficients of soil moisture measured in situ indicating that soil horizons with higher water contributions also lead to more drastic moisture changes the better coupling effect of water and nitrogen in the main root zone 0 60 cm under micro irrigation than that of furrow irrigation may promote the growth of root systems in this zone to a certain extent then enhance its water uptake capacity this explains the higher contribution ratios of soil moisture to cherry tree water uptake at depths of 0 60 cm under micro irrigation it is important to note that the dynamic growth e g root length root nitrogen and spatial distribution of root systems in this study was not measured which limits the understanding of the mechanism for water uptake real time quantitative studies of the root systems of perennial fruit trees is difficult therefore additional studies using

10878,water is the main limiting factor for crop growth in dryland farming areas plastic film mulch pm is widely used to improve water use efficiency wue and increase crop yield over conventional methods no mulch nm in china to get a better understanding about pm influence on water use process in the field we defined wuetwi as the ratio of yield y to the total water input twi and divided wuetwi into 4 steps by means of a systematic and quantitative approach the 4 steps included ratio of available soil water sw to twi sw0 p where sw0 is available soil water at the sowing p is seasonal precipitation ratio of crop evapotranspiration etc to sw ratio of crop transpiration t to etc and transpiration efficiency wuet y t three field experiments were conducted to analyze the influence of pm on soil moisture content water consumption and the grain yield of dryland spring maize zea mays l results showed that compared with nm spring maize yield of pm was increased by 28 6 and the wuetwi of pm was increased by 26 4 on average in the experiment 1 since etc with pm was slightly higher than that with nm the etc sw was increased by 3 9 in the experiment 2 the t etc with pm was 77 7 on average 30 6 higher than that with nm the y t increased by 13 6 from nm to pm precipitation storage efficiency increased linearly with the percentage of pm improved crop growth under pm led to higher crop biomass and higher leaf area index which might result in higher transpiration rate the t etc under pm was also increased keywords spring maize yield evapotranspiration dryland farming total water input efficiency chain 1 introduction rainfed agricultural production systems occupy about 80 of the cultivated land in the world and produce 60 of the world s cereal grains rana 2008 in china the rainfed farming area accounts for about 25 million ha zhang et al 2014 the climate mainly belongs to semi arid and semi humid types in the loess plateau of china with average annual precipitation between 300 and 600 mm kang et al 2002 dryland farming is the main form of agriculture in this region where the amount of rainfall is low and distributed unevenly over the year and where available water is the primary limiting factor for crop yields due to the scarcity of water mulching e g plastic mulching and straw mulching plays an important role in rainfed agriculture in these areas from 1991 to 2011 the mass of plastic film used increased from 1 19 105 t to 1 25 106 t national bureau of statistics of china 2012 the area of agricultural land in china employing plastic film had reached about 20 million hectares by 2012 with the use of plastic film grain crop yields in china have increased by 20 35 liu et al 2014b using 1 310 yield observations from 74 studies conducted in 19 countries qin et al 2015 found that plastic mulching drastically increased yields and wue that study proved that increased yield and wue are widely substantiated effects of plastic film mulch use throughout the world theoretically plastic film mulching can reduce soil water evaporation and thereby increase available soil water for crop growth li et al 1999 2005 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2012 showed that pm increased soil water content for growth of spring maize in the loess plateau sometimes because pm improved plant growth which consumed a greater amount of water the soil water storage did not increase but the crop yield and wue increased significantly jiang et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zhou et al 2009 generally wue is calculated as the ratio of the actual crop yield y to the seasonal evapotranspiration etc i e wueet however from the perspective of field water supply etc is only part use from the total water input the use efficiency of total water input wuetwi is also an important issue it is a systematic process from field water input to seasonal transpiration which directly relates to crop yield formation in the literatures on agricultural water relations both wue and water productivity wp are used according to the point of view of pereira et al 2012 wue should be used to measure the water performance of plants or crops to produce harvestable yield under the conditions of irrigation or dryland farming in this research we focus mainly on water performance of maize in a rainfed condition hence wue is used from a systems point of view the agricultural production system can be considered as a simple input output system the inputs include nutrients water seed energy etc the outputs are crop yield and by products such as straw for a dryland field in the loess plateau precipitation during cropping season and non cropping season is the only source of water input hence water use efficiency for precipitation wuep is a reflection of wueet wuep can be defined as the ratio of output yield to input precipitation and the water use process in dryland farming can be described in several steps precipitation infiltrates into the soil to become stored soil water a fraction of the soil water evaporates from the soil surface and another fraction of the soil water is absorbed by roots and transpired to the atmosphere together these two processes make up etc not all soil water is used as etc some soil water may be lost as deep percolation and some remains stored in the soil at harvest time efficiency chain as developed by liu 1997 and hsiao et al 2007 is an effective way to analyze the input output system the overall efficiency of any process consisting of a chain of sequential steps is the product of the efficiencies output input ratios of each of the individual component steps hsiao et al 2007 in dryland farming where precipitation is the only source of water wuep can be expressed using an efficiency chain liu 1997 as 1 wuep s w p e t c s w t e t c y t where sw is soil water available for evapotranspiration which is recharged by precipitation infiltration for a given precipitation wuep reaches its greatest value when sw p ratio of precipitation collection and storage etc sw ratio of water consumption on cropland during crop growth period t etc ratio of crop transpiration to cropland evapotranspiration and y t transpiration efficiency or wuet are all maximized on the loess tableland spring maize is one of the main cereal crops it is sown in late april and harvested in late september due to the limited water resources and the low accumulated temperature only one crop per year is feasible pm is a widely used production practice in this area zhang et al 2014 therefore spring maize was chosen as the research crop for this study the influence of pm on maize water use is a complex process the objective of this research was to determine how pm influences water use process based on field experimental yield and water use data collected from three field experiments 2 materials and methods we used data from three experiments to evaluate different parts of the efficiency chain all three experiments included two treatments no mulching nm and plastic film mulching pm experiment 1 was carried out from 2009 to 2015 this experiment provided the results of how pm influenced maize yield and water use over seven years experiment 2 determined how pm influenced the distribution of t and e in etc experiment 3 quantified how pm influenced soil water storage under the condition of no maize growing from april to september 2 1 site description all three experiments were conducted in changwu county shaanxi province china 35 14 n 107 41 e and 1200 1206 m above sea level changwu county is located in the warm temperate zone and has a continental monsoon climate the average annual precipitation is 584 mm with more than 55 falling from july to september the average annual temperature is 9 1 c the soil is classified as a light silt loam heilutu series with a mean soil bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 the experiments were conducted in a flat tableland area where the groundwater table is more than 80 m below the surface 2 2 experimental descriptions for all the three experiments the surface configuration is shown in fig 1 2 2 1 experiment 1 effect of pm on maize yield and water use over seven years this experiment was conducted from 2009 to 2015 and used two management practices 1 conventional practice no plastic mulch was applied nm and 2 plastic film mulch pm the white transparent plastic film 0 05 mm thick 120 cm wide was mulched directly on the flat plot land before planting to resist the damage of wind the edges of the plastic films were covered with soil and the crosswise of the plastic film was covered by soil strips every two meters the experimental design was a randomized block design with three replications plot dimensions were 10 3 m long and 6 5 m wide fertilizer application amounts 135 kg n ha 1 and 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 were determined by soil tests and fertilizers were spread over the soil surface and incorporated into the 0 20 cm soil layer by a rotary cultivator before planting maize was planted using a handheld hole sowing machine drill a hole on the film to 4 cm deep then sow the seed in the hole in late april in rows spaced 60 cm apart at a density of 56 000 seeds ha 1 the maize hybrid was jinsui 9 from 2009 to 2011 and xianyu 335 from 2012 to 2015 the xianyu 335 is a high yield hybrid which was used in order to maintain similarity with local production practices a neutron probe access tube was installed in the center of each plot the soil water content from 20 to 600 cm was measured using a neutron moisture meter before planting and after harvesting measurement depth intervals were 10 cm in the 20 100 cm layer and 20 cm from 100 to 600 cm soil water in 0 20 cm layer was measured gravimetrically as neutron probe measurements near the soil surface are not accurate the neutron probe was calibrated annually to ensure measurement accuracy the entire plot of maize was harvested manually air dried and weighed to determine crop yield after harvest in late september all aboveground plant residue was removed from plots leaving the plastic film in the field the plastic film was removed in the following april for the next crop planting weeds were controlled by hand weeding and no major insect problems were encountered during any growing season 2 2 2 experiment 2 pm influence on t etc and y t this experiment was conducted in 2013 and 2015 there were two management practices nm and pm a planting pattern of double ridges and furrows was adopted in each field the ridges were created in an alternating pattern consisting of large ridges 60 cm wide by 10 cm high and small ridges 40 cm wide by 15 cm high the pm consisted of white transparent plastic film 120 cm wide and all ridges and furrows were mulched with the plastic film the furrow between the two ridges served to harvest rainwater each treatment was replicated three times in a randomized arrangement and each plot was 40 m2 5 m 8 m before sowing chemical fertilizers were applied at rates of 225 kg of n per ha as urea 46 n 60 kg of p per ha as calcium superphosphate 12 p2o5 and 30 kg of k per ha as potassium sulfate 45 k2o sap flow gauges flow32 1 k using sgb25 sensor with cr1000 datalogger from dynamax houston usa were calibrated by a weighing method of maize grown in pots and then used to determine leaf transpiration rate of maize in the field the soil surface of pots with maize plants were completely covered by plastic film to prevent soil evaporation and hourly and daily weight losses i e hourly and daily transpiration rates of leaves respectively of the potted maize were measured using a balance the sap flow value was measured per hour for 3 days and the mean of the hourly values for each day was taken as the daily value to avoid the influence of plant hydraulic capacitance koide 1989 there was a significant linear relationship between leaf transpiration rate measured by weight change and sap flow rate in the field experiment we selected 3 plants which had the mean diameter of stems for the treatment for each treatment to measure sap flow rate and used the sap flow value to calculate transpiration rate the transpiration rate was then converted to the value of maize community by multiplying by the planting density in this experiment leaf area was measured manually every 10 days by multiplying the length and maximal width of leaves with a shape factor k empirically determined to be 0 75 leaf area index lai was calculated as the product of the leaf area value per one plant and plant density 65 000 plants ha 1 i e lai leaf area m2 plants 1 65 000 plants ha 1 10 000 m2 ha 1 soil water and yield were measured the same way as in experiment 1 2 2 3 experiment 3 pm influence on soil water content with no crop present this experiment was conducted from april 22th to september 5th in 2015 six levels of film mulching were applied 0 no mulch 30 50 70 85 and 100 of land covered which were labeled as m0 m30 m50 m70 m85 and m100 respectively in each plot ridges 50 cm width and furrows 50 cm width were arranged alternately each test plot was 24 m2 4 m 6 m and they were arranged in a random design with 3 replications the plastic mulch used was a white transparent polyethylene film 0 08 mm thick the purpose of this experiment was to find out the effect of the pm on soil water conditions so no crop was grown in this experiment soil water content was determined gravimetrically to a depth of 100 cm every 7 15 days and to a depth of 500 cm at the beginning and at the end of the experiment during the experiment herbicide was applied to the soil surface before mulching and manual weeding was performed as necessary throughout the experimental period 2 3 analysis of wuetwi from a multi year scale precipitation is the only water input i e eq 1 is appropriate for a multi year scale or for a long term scale however not only the seasonal precipitation but also the initial soil water storage must be considered in a short term scale hence in this study we used an improved efficiency chain eq 2 liu 2015 2 wue twi sw twi et c sw t et c y t 3 t w i s w 0 p 4 s w s w 0 p r d where twi is total water input wuetwi is water use efficiency of twi sw0 is available soil water at sowing p is precipitation r is surface runoff from rainfall and d is deep percolation of soil water below the measuremental depth during the period since the ground water is deeper than 80 m below the surface in the research area capillary water that moves up from the deep layer to the active root zone can be neglected the soil layer is thick and has a high holding capacity of water in a high yielding cropland the amount of rainfall is not large enough to percolate into soil layer below 3 m depth in most years and only moves downward below 6 m in a few extreme wet years lin et al 2016 liu w et al 2010 we measured soil water content in the 0 600 cm layer and calculated sw to a depth of 6 m so d can also be neglected in most years each experimental plot was surrounded by ridges to prevent surface runoff so r 0 hence sw sw0 p and sw twi 1 in this research note that for multi season analysis the ratio of sw0 to p becomes smaller and smaller as the number of years increases wuetwi tends to be equal to wuep 2 4 water balance and precipitation storage efficiency et was determined using the soil water balance equation as follows 5 e t p u r d δ w where δ w is soil water change in the measuremental depth calculated as soil water storage in the 0 600 cm layer at the end of the period minus that at the beginning as we stated in 2 3 r u d 0 hence the field water balance function was simplified to 6 e t p δ w in this paper etc and ec stands for evapotranspiration and evaporation during crop growth period respectively etf and ef stand for evapotranspiration and evaporation during fallow period respectively as there was no crop during fallow period t 0 hence etf ef in experiment 3 precipitation storage efficiency pse nielsen and vigil 2010 during the fallow period was calculated by 7 p s e δ w p 2 5 statistical analysis mean values were calculated for each measurement and a one way anova was used to compare the effects of different practices least significant differences lsd were calculated and were deemed to be significant if p 0 05 sas 9 3 sas institute north carolina usa was used for all statistical analyses 3 results 3 1 yield and water use maize yield was significantly higher with pm than with nm throughout the seven years of the experiment 1 table 1 compared with nm yield under pm was increased by 14 0 2009 49 5 2013 with an average increase over the 7 years of 28 6 etc by spring maize under mulch was greater in all years except 2015 but significantly so in only four of the seven years in 2015 etc was significantly greater where no mulch was present the amount of soil evaporation during the fallow period was greater on the nm plots therefore the annual water consumption was statistically the same only 11 mm higher for nm for the 7 year mean value during the growing season etc was an average of 5 4 higher for pm in experiment 1 t was not measured so t etc y t should be simplified as y etc i e wueet wueet of 7 year average was 2 61 and 2 13 kg m 3 for pm and nm respectively increased by 22 5 from nm to pm wuetwi was 1 21 and 1 53 kg m 3 on average for nm and pm respectively after 7 years compared with nm wuetwi was increased by 26 5 for pm table 1 3 2 t etc and wuet under pm values of t measured by sap flow gages for pm during the growing period in exp 2 were 299 mm and 234 mm in 2013 and 2015 respectively which were significantly higher than t for nm table 2 values of etc estimated by water balance eq 5 for pm were 408 mm in 2013 and 285 mm in 2015 compared with 409 mm and 275 mm for nm in these two years etc in both years was not significantly different due to mulch treatment the t etc ratio in pm plots was 73 3 in 2013 and 82 1 in 2015 respectively significantly higher than the 55 0 and 64 0 values measured in those two years for nm pm significantly increased the t etc ratio wuet of pm was 4 39 and 5 32 kg m 3 respectively in 2013 and 2015 significantly higher than that of nm 3 38 and 5 18 kg m 3respectively in these two years transpiration rate during the season was closely related to lai fig 2 t etc increased logarithmically with increasing lai greater lai requires more water for transpiration and may also reduce soil evaporation due to greater ground shading by the canopy 3 3 pm impact on soil water content at the beginning of experiment 3 the soil water storage in the 0 100 cm soil profile was very similar in all plots but the effect of mulch became apparent after the first month fig 3 for treatment m0 with complete exposure of the soil surface the soil water content in the top 0 100 cm layer of both the furrow and the ridge decreased significantly and ranked as the lowest followed by m30 and m50 while the water content for m100 was the highest the differences in soil water content among treatments in furrows were similar to that on ridges at the end of the experiment the soil water content in the 0 100 cm soil layer using m0 and m30 cover was less than that at the beginning fig 4 the soil water content in this layer increased under all other mulch treatments at depths below 100 cm water content under all mulch treatments increased over the experiment period the more the percentage of soil covered by mulch the greater the increase in water content a total of 384 mm of rain fell during the experimental period and water storage increased by an amount from 44 mm to 214 mm for the 6 treatments with the soil water increasing with the percent coverage the sum of precipitation with 5 mm and 10 mm daily accounted for 13 3 and 35 5 of the total rain respectively such small amounts of rain can only wet the surface soil layer and likely evaporate before reaching deeper soil and may even have evaporated directly from the upper surface of film soil surface mulching can reduce soil evaporation but not eliminate it for mulch cover percentages between 0 and 85 there was still a certain proportion of soil directly exposed to the air even with 100 coverage slight soil evaporation can happen through the pores as we drilled them on the plastic film to let rainfall infiltrate into the soil evaporation potential was high during the experiment and soil water was prone to be lost by evaporation from the bare surface hence the soil water change for all of the treatments was much below the amount of rainfall received during the measurement period for the m0 treatment only 11 of the rain received during the measurement period was retained in the soil when 30 of the soil surface was mulched the pse increased to 23 when the soil surface was fully mulched the pse was 56 table 3 we found a significant linear relationship p 0 01 between the increase in soil water storage and the percentage of mulch cover 4 discussion this paper analyzed the influence of pm on maize grain yield and water use under dryland conditions in the loess plateau of china a primary aim in dryland agricultural research is to provide means for the crop to use precipitation as much as possible the partioning of wuetwi can help us understand the entire process of precipitation use by a crop from rainfall to soil water storage then to evaporation and transpiration that is also why we used wuetwi rather than wue in this study generally the maize yields harvested in these experiments were at the intermediate level for the loess plateau both with nm and pm lin and liu 2016 zhang et al 2014 higher maize yields at this location have been reported but those cases generally are the result of high resource inputs high fertilizer applications and higher seeding rates liu et al 2014c the use of pm increased maize yield compared with yield under the nm treatment but the yield increase varied among years ranging from 14 0 to 49 5 increase in yield partitioning etc into its component parts by using data from a field experiment is difficult in this study a sap flow method was used for spring maize in a field experiment to measure transpiration rate while the water balance method was used to measure etc according to the sap flow data exp 2 the average t etc ratios under nm and pm were 59 5 and 77 7 respectively the t etc ratio under nm was higher than the result reported by qin et al 2013 and lower than the result from kang et al 2003 irrigation may be one of the reason for higher t etet in kang s research the difference in annual p and atmospheric evaporative demand may be another reason reference crop evapotranspiration et0 were the highest in linyi qin s research then in changwu this research and yangling kang s research li 2012 while p showed the opposite trend in these sites under dry conditions soil water is more likely to be lost by evaporation t under plastic film mulch was increased table 2 because pm reduces soil water evaporation table 3 and may increase the available soil water in the root zone liu et al 2009 2014a higher t and lower ec lead to a higher t etc ratio the y t ratio can vary for different maize varieties french and schultz 1984 liu 1997 and field management practices our research showed that transpiration efficiency could be increased with pm table 2 only 1 5 of the water extracted from the soil by plants is used to produce tissue the remaining 95 99 of water passes into the air as transpiration feng et al 2007 yu et al 1997 according to liu y et al 2010 pm increased the emergence rate promoted the growth and development of plants and increased grain yield in experiment 3 we measured soil temperature at 15 cm soil depth and found that soil temperature increased linearly supplementary fig 1 with increased mulch cover higher soil temperature is an important factor for improving maize growth in april and may the percentage increase in yield exceeded the percentage increase in t so that y t was increased significantly the whole growth and maturation period was shortened by 12 d 15 d and 14 d in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively supplementary table 1 thereby reducing the water consuming time and the total transpiration amount for maize grown with pm liu y et al 2010 the ability of pm to reduce soil evaporation and hence increase water retention is widely recognized since stored soil water is used by crop roots in the field it is difficult to know how well pm can increase precipitation storage when crops are present in this study we studied pse when no crops were present and found the pse could be increased from 11 under no plastic film mulch to as much as 56 with 100 soil coverage with plastic mulch table 3 suggesting that pm reduced e significantly and increased the water available for t further increasing t etc in the efficiency chain table 4 shows how the use of pm influenced the four steps of the efficiency chain sw sw0 p etc p t etc and y t were increased by 0 3 9 30 6 and 13 6 respectively the ratio of sw sw0 p was assumed to reach its maximum value of 1 for both treatments so that there was no effect of pm on this ratio this was the result of the special conditions in this experiment where u r and d were equal to 0 pm increased etc in some of the years but reduced etf table 1 the 7 year experiment showed that annual water consumption etc etf was the same between pm and nm table 1 indicating that the increase of wuetwi under pm was due to reduced ec and increased t etc sw was also increased slightly over the seven years of exp 1 pm reduced ef resulting in greater stored soil water at maize planting that ultimately resulted in greater etc and greater maize yield proper use of pm in this region would lead to more efficient use of the valuable limited water resource it should be noted that in our experiments all the plots are diked and made perfectly level to prevent runoff so r was assumed to be 0 however in real field situations for the tableland on the loess plateau such runoff may happen sometimes since the land is not absolutely flat runoff amount is correlated with slope degree when the slope was 3 and the single rain was 19 4 mm and 60 6 mm the runoff in maize field was 0 42 and 1 02 mm respectively accounting for 2 2 and 1 7 of the rainfall song et al 2005 based on the further calculation of table 1 it was found that in the first year the wuetwi was 0 47 and 0 51 kg m 3 for nm and pm respectively wuep was 1 61 and 1 84 kg m 3 respectively by the seventh year wuetwi was 1 21 and 1 53 kg m 3 respectively wuep was 1 49 and 1 92 kg m 3 respectively the gap between wuep and wuetwi decreased with the increase of years the efficiency chain shows that pm improved wuetwi by improving t etc and wuet in agricultural water management what is required is not only a higher etc sw but also a higher t etc high values of etc sw accompanied by high t etc enable good crop growth and yield the value of y t represents the connection between crop yield and water consumption many factors influence y t including plant genetic properties feng et al 2007 yang et al 2002 and soil fertility more fertile soils generally lead to higher y t even with the same water consumption zhang et al 1999 5 conclusion the efficiency chain factored wuetwi into four steps and helped to show how to increase wuetwi it also provides an effective way to understand and improve water management in agriculture the experiments results show that in dryland farming areas in the loess plateau of china pm increased maize yield and hence increased wuetwi significantly by analyzing the whole water use process in the field it was found that pm may have little impact on etc but it increased t and reduced ec resulting in spring maize t etc of 73 3 and 82 1 in the two experiment years respectively 33 3 and 28 3 higher than that of nm the percentage increase in maize yield exceeded the percentage increase in plant transpiration with pm so the y t ratio increased funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41571036and41171033 the

10878,water is the main limiting factor for crop growth in dryland farming areas plastic film mulch pm is widely used to improve water use efficiency wue and increase crop yield over conventional methods no mulch nm in china to get a better understanding about pm influence on water use process in the field we defined wuetwi as the ratio of yield y to the total water input twi and divided wuetwi into 4 steps by means of a systematic and quantitative approach the 4 steps included ratio of available soil water sw to twi sw0 p where sw0 is available soil water at the sowing p is seasonal

pm on soil moisture content water consumption and the grain yield of dryland spring maize zea mays l results showed that compared with nm spring maize yield of pm was increased by 28 6 and the wuetwi of pm was increased by 26 4 on average in the experiment 1 since etc with pm was slightly higher than that with nm the etc sw was increased by 3 9 in the experiment 2 the t etc with pm was 77 7 on average 30 6 higher than that with nm the y t increased by 13 6 from nm to pm precipitation storage efficiency increased linearly with the percentage of pm improved crop growth under pm led to higher crop biomass and higher leaf area index which might result in higher transpiration rate the t etc under pm was also increased keywords spring maize yield evapotranspiration dryland farming total water input efficiency chain 1 introduction rainfed agricultural production systems occupy about 80 of the cultivated land in the world and produce 60 of the world s cereal grains rana 2008 in china the rainfed farming area accounts for about 25 million ha zhang et al 2014 the climate mainly belongs to semi arid and semi humid types in the loess plateau of china with average annual precipitation between 300 and 600 mm kang et al 2002 dryland farming is the main form of agriculture in this region where the amount of rainfall is low and distributed unevenly over the year and where available water is the primary limiting factor for crop yields due to the scarcity of water mulching e g plastic mulching and straw mulching plays an important role in rainfed agriculture in these areas from 1991 to 2011 the mass of plastic film used increased from 1 19 105 t to 1 25 106 t national bureau of statistics of china 2012 the area of agricultural land in china employing plastic film had reached about 20 million hectares by 2012 with the use of plastic film grain crop yields in china have increased by 20 35 liu et al 2014b using 1 310 yield observations from 74 studies conducted in 19 countries qin et al 2015 found that plastic mulching drastically increased yields and wue that study proved that increased yield and wue are widely substantiated effects of plastic film mulch use throughout the world theoretically plastic film mulching can reduce soil water evaporation and thereby increase available soil water for crop growth li et al 1999 2005 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2012 showed that pm increased soil water content for growth of spring maize in the loess plateau sometimes because pm improved plant growth which consumed a greater amount of water the soil water storage did not increase but the crop yield and wue increased significantly jiang et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zhou et al 2009 generally wue is calculated as the ratio of the actual crop yield y to the seasonal evapotranspiration etc i e wueet however from the perspective of field water supply etc is only part use from the total water input the use efficiency of total water input wuetwi is also an important issue it is a systematic process from field water input to seasonal transpiration which directly relates to crop yield formation in the literatures on agricultural water relations both wue and water productivity wp are used according to the point of view of pereira et al 2012 wue should be used to measure the water performance of plants or crops to produce harvestable yield under the conditions of irrigation or dryland farming in this research we focus mainly on water performance of maize in a rainfed condition hence wue is used from a systems point of view the agricultural production system can be considered as a simple input output system the inputs include nutrients water seed energy etc the outputs are crop yield and by products such as straw for a dryland field in the loess plateau precipitation during cropping season and non cropping season is the only source of water input hence water use efficiency for precipitation wuep is a reflection of wueet wuep can be defined as the ratio of output yield to input precipitation and the water use process in dryland farming can be described in several steps precipitation infiltrates into the soil to become stored soil water a fraction of the soil water evaporates from the soil surface and another fraction of the soil water is absorbed by roots and transpired to the atmosphere together these two processes make up etc not all soil water is used as etc some soil water may be lost as deep percolation and some remains stored in the soil at harvest time efficiency chain as developed by liu 1997 and hsiao et al 2007 is an effective way to analyze the input output system the overall efficiency of any process consisting of a chain of sequential steps is the product of the efficiencies output input ratios of each of the individual component steps hsiao et al 2007 in dryland farming where precipitation is the only source of water wuep can be expressed using an efficiency chain liu 1997 as 1 wuep s w p e t c s w t e t c y t where sw is soil water available for evapotranspiration which is recharged by precipitation infiltration for a given precipitation wuep reaches its greatest value when sw p ratio of precipitation collection and storage etc sw ratio of water consumption on cropland during crop growth period t etc ratio of crop transpiration to cropland evapotranspiration and y t transpiration efficiency or wuet are all maximized on the loess tableland spring maize is one of the main cereal crops it is sown in late april and harvested in late september due to the limited water resources and the low accumulated temperature only one crop per year is feasible pm is a widely used production practice in this area zhang et al 2014 therefore spring maize was chosen as the research crop for this study the influence of pm on maize water use is a complex process the objective of this research was to determine how pm influences water use process based on field experimental yield and water use data collected from three field experiments 2 materials and methods we used data from three experiments to evaluate different parts of the efficiency chain all three experiments included two treatments no mulching nm and plastic film mulching pm experiment 1 was carried out from 2009 to 2015 this experiment provided the results of how pm influenced maize yield and water use over seven years experiment 2 determined how pm influenced the distribution of t and e in etc experiment 3 quantified how pm influenced soil water storage under the condition of no maize growing from april to september 2 1 site description all three experiments were conducted in changwu county shaanxi province china 35 14 n 107 41 e and 1200 1206 m above sea level changwu county is located in the warm temperate zone and has a continental monsoon climate the average annual precipitation is 584 mm with more than 55 falling from july to september the average annual temperature is 9 1 c the soil is classified as a light silt loam heilutu series with a mean soil bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 the experiments were conducted in a flat tableland area where the groundwater table is more than 80 m below the surface 2 2 experimental descriptions for all the three experiments the surface configuration is shown in fig 1 2 2 1 experiment 1 effect of pm on maize yield and water use over seven years this experiment was conducted from 2009 to 2015 and used two management practices 1 conventional practice no plastic mulch was applied nm and 2 plastic film mulch pm the white transparent plastic film 0 05 mm thick 120 cm wide was mulched directly on the flat plot land before planting to resist the damage of wind the edges of the plastic films were covered with soil and the crosswise of the plastic film was covered by soil strips every two meters the experimental design was a randomized block design with three replications plot dimensions were 10 3 m long and 6 5 m wide fertilizer application amounts 135 kg n ha 1 and 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 were determined by soil tests and fertilizers were spread over the soil surface and incorporated into the 0 20 cm soil layer by a rotary cultivator before planting maize was planted using a handheld hole sowing machine drill a hole on the film to 4 cm deep then sow the seed in the hole in late april in rows spaced 60 cm apart at a density of 56 000 seeds ha 1 the maize hybrid was jinsui 9 from 2009 to 2011 and xianyu 335 from 2012 to 2015 the xianyu 335 is a high yield hybrid which was used in order to maintain similarity with local production practices a neutron probe access tube was installed in the center of each plot the soil water content from 20 to 600 cm was measured using a neutron moisture meter before planting and after harvesting measurement depth intervals were 10 cm in the 20 100 cm layer and 20 cm from 100 to 600 cm soil water in 0 20 cm layer was measured gravimetrically as neutron probe measurements near the soil surface are not accurate the neutron probe was calibrated annually to ensure measurement accuracy the entire plot of maize was harvested manually air dried and weighed to determine crop yield after harvest in late september all aboveground plant residue was removed from plots leaving the plastic film in the field the plastic film was removed in the following april for the next crop planting weeds were controlled by hand weeding and no major insect problems were encountered during any growing season 2 2 2 experiment 2 pm influence on t etc and y t this experiment was conducted in 2013 and 2015 there were two management practices nm and pm a planting pattern of double ridges and furrows was adopted in each field the ridges were created in an alternating pattern consisting of large ridges 60 cm wide by 10 cm high and small ridges 40 cm wide by 15 cm high the pm consisted of white transparent plastic film 120 cm wide and all ridges and furrows were mulched with the plastic film the furrow between the two ridges served to harvest rainwater each treatment was replicated three times in a randomized arrangement and each plot was 40 m2 5 m 8 m before sowing chemical fertilizers were applied at rates of 225 kg of n per ha as urea 46 n 60 kg of p per ha as calcium superphosphate 12 p2o5 and 30 kg of k per ha as potassium sulfate 45 k2o sap flow gauges flow32 1 k using sgb25 sensor with cr1000 datalogger from dynamax houston usa were calibrated by a weighing method of maize grown in pots and then used to determine leaf transpiration rate of maize in the field the soil surface of pots with maize plants were completely covered by plastic film to prevent soil evaporation and hourly and daily weight losses i e hourly and daily transpiration rates of leaves respectively of the potted maize were measured using a balance the sap flow value was measured per hour for 3 days and the mean of the hourly values for each day was taken as the daily value to avoid the influence of plant hydraulic capacitance koide 1989 there was a significant linear relationship between leaf transpiration rate measured by weight change and sap flow rate in the field experiment we selected 3 plants which had the mean diameter of stems for the treatment for each treatment to measure sap flow rate and used the sap flow value to calculate transpiration rate the transpiration rate was then converted to the value of maize community by multiplying by the planting density in this experiment leaf area was measured manually every 10 days by multiplying the length and maximal width of leaves with a shape factor k empirically determined to be 0 75 leaf area index lai was calculated as the product of the leaf area value per one plant and plant density 65 000 plants ha 1 i e lai leaf area m2 plants 1 65 000 plants ha 1 10 000 m2 ha 1 soil water and yield were measured the same way as in experiment 1 2 2 3 experiment 3 pm influence on soil water content with no crop present this experiment was conducted from april 22th to september 5th in 2015 six levels of film mulching were applied 0 no mulch 30 50 70 85 and 100 of land covered which were labeled as m0 m30 m50 m70 m85 and m100 respectively in each plot ridges 50 cm width and furrows 50 cm width were arranged alternately each test plot was 24 m2 4 m 6 m and they were arranged in a random design with 3 replications the plastic mulch used was a white transparent polyethylene film 0 08 mm thick the purpose of this experiment was to find out the effect of the pm on soil water conditions so no crop was grown in this experiment soil water content was determined gravimetrically to a depth of 100 cm every 7 15 days and to a depth of 500 cm at the beginning and at the end of the experiment during the experiment herbicide was applied to the soil surface before mulching and manual weeding was performed as necessary throughout the experimental period 2 3 analysis of wuetwi from a multi year scale precipitation is the only water input i e eq 1 is appropriate for a multi year scale or for a long term scale however not only the seasonal precipitation but also the initial soil water storage must be considered in a short term scale hence in this study we used an improved efficiency chain eq 2 liu 2015 2 wue twi sw twi et c sw t et c y t 3 t w i s w 0 p 4 s w s w 0 p r d where twi is total water input wuetwi is water use efficiency of twi sw0 is available soil water at sowing p is precipitation r is surface runoff from rainfall and d is deep percolation of soil water below the measuremental depth during the period since the ground water is deeper than 80 m below the surface in the research area capillary water that moves up from the deep layer to the active root zone can be neglected the soil layer is thick and has a high holding capacity of water in a high yielding cropland the amount of rainfall is not large enough to percolate into soil layer below 3 m depth in most years and only moves downward below 6 m in a few extreme wet years lin et al 2016 liu w et al 2010 we measured soil water content in the 0 600 cm layer and calculated sw to a depth of 6 m so d can also be neglected in most years each experimental plot was surrounded by ridges to prevent surface runoff so r 0 hence sw sw0 p and sw twi 1 in this research note that for multi season analysis the ratio of sw0 to p becomes smaller and smaller as the number of years increases wuetwi tends to be equal to wuep 2 4 water balance and precipitation storage efficiency et was determined using the soil water balance equation as follows 5 e t p u r d δ w where δ w is soil water change in the measuremental depth calculated as soil water storage in the 0 600 cm layer at the end of the period minus that at the beginning as we stated in 2 3 r u d 0 hence the field water balance function was simplified to 6 e t p δ w in this paper etc and ec stands for evapotranspiration and evaporation during crop growth period respectively etf and ef stand for evapotranspiration and evaporation during fallow period respectively as there was no crop during fallow period t 0 hence etf ef in experiment 3 precipitation storage efficiency pse nielsen and vigil 2010 during the fallow period was calculated by 7 p s e δ w p 2 5 statistical analysis mean values were calculated for each measurement and a one way anova was used to compare the effects of different practices least significant differences lsd were calculated and were deemed to be significant if p 0 05 sas 9 3 sas institute north carolina usa was used for all statistical analyses 3 results 3 1 yield and water use maize yield was significantly higher with pm than with nm throughout the seven years of the experiment 1 table 1 compared with nm yield under pm was increased by 14 0 2009 49 5 2013 with an average increase over the 7 years of 28 6 etc by spring maize under mulch was greater in all years except 2015 but significantly so in only four of the seven years in 2015 etc was significantly greater where no mulch was present the amount of soil evaporation during the fallow period was greater on the nm plots therefore the annual water consumption was statistically the same only 11 mm higher for nm for the 7 year mean value during the growing season etc was an average of 5 4 higher for pm in experiment 1 t was not measured so t etc y t should be simplified as y etc i e wueet wueet of 7 year average was 2 61 and 2 13 kg m 3 for pm and nm respectively increased by 22 5 from nm to pm wuetwi was 1 21 and 1 53 kg m 3 on average for nm and pm respectively after 7 years compared with nm wuetwi was increased by 26 5 for pm table 1 3 2 t etc and wuet under pm values of t measured by sap flow gages for pm during the growing period in exp 2 were 299 mm and 234 mm in 2013 and 2015 respectively which were significantly higher than t for nm table 2 values of etc estimated by water balance eq 5 for pm were 408 mm in 2013 and 285 mm in 2015 compared with 409 mm and 275 mm for nm in these two years etc in both years was not significantly different due to mulch treatment the t etc ratio in pm plots was 73 3 in 2013 and 82 1 in 2015 respectively significantly higher than the 55 0 and 64 0 values measured in those two years for nm pm significantly increased the t etc ratio wuet of pm was 4 39 and 5 32 kg m 3 respectively in 2013 and 2015 significantly higher than that of nm 3 38 and 5 18 kg m 3respectively in these two years transpiration rate during the season was closely related to lai fig 2 t etc increased logarithmically with increasing lai greater lai requires more water for transpiration and may also reduce soil evaporation due to greater ground shading by the canopy 3 3 pm impact on soil water content at the beginning of experiment 3 the soil water storage in the 0 100 cm soil profile was very similar in all plots but the effect of mulch became apparent after the first month fig 3 for treatment m0 with complete exposure of the soil surface the soil water content in the top 0 100 cm layer of both the furrow and the ridge decreased significantly and ranked as the lowest followed by m30 and m50 while the water content for m100 was the highest the differences in soil water content among treatments in furrows were similar to that on ridges at the end of the experiment the soil water content in the 0 100 cm soil layer using m0 and m30 cover was less than that at the beginning fig 4 the soil water content in this layer increased under all other mulch treatments at depths below 100 cm water content under all mulch treatments increased over the experiment period the more the percentage of soil covered by mulch the greater the increase in water content a total of 384 mm of rain fell during the experimental period and water storage increased by an amount from 44 mm to 214 mm for the 6 treatments with the soil water increasing with the percent coverage the sum of precipitation with 5 mm and 10 mm daily accounted for 13 3 and 35 5 of the total rain respectively such small amounts of rain can only wet the surface soil layer and likely evaporate before reaching deeper soil and may even have evaporated directly from the upper surface of film soil surface mulching can reduce soil evaporation but not eliminate it for mulch cover percentages between 0 and 85 there was still a certain proportion of soil directly exposed to the air even with 100 coverage slight soil evaporation can happen through the pores as we drilled them on the plastic film to let rainfall infiltrate into the soil evaporation potential was high during the experiment and soil water was prone to be lost by evaporation from the bare surface hence the soil water change for all of the treatments was much below the amount of rainfall received during the measurement period for the m0 treatment only 11 of the rain received during the measurement period was retained in the soil when 30 of the soil surface was mulched the pse increased to 23 when the soil surface was fully mulched the pse was 56 table 3 we found a significant linear relationship p 0 01 between the increase in soil water storage and the percentage of mulch cover 4 discussion this paper analyzed the influence of pm on maize grain yield and water use under dryland conditions in the loess plateau of china a primary aim in dryland agricultural research is to provide means for the crop to use precipitation as much as possible the partioning of wuetwi can help us understand the entire process of precipitation use by a crop from rainfall to soil water storage then to evaporation and transpiration that is also why we used wuetwi rather than wue in this study generally the maize yields harvested in these experiments were at the intermediate level for the loess plateau both with nm and pm lin and liu 2016 zhang et al 2014 higher maize yields at this location have been reported but those cases generally are the result of high resource inputs high fertilizer applications and higher seeding rates liu et al 2014c the use of pm increased maize yield compared with yield under the nm treatment but the yield increase varied among years ranging from 14 0 to 49 5 increase in yield partitioning etc into its component parts by using data from a field experiment is difficult in this study a sap flow method was used for spring maize in a field experiment to measure transpiration rate while the water balance method was used to measure etc according to the sap flow data exp 2 the average t etc ratios under nm and pm were 59 5 and 77 7 respectively the t etc ratio under nm was higher than the result reported by qin et al 2013 and lower than the result from kang et al 2003 irrigation may be one of the reason for higher t etet in kang s research the difference in annual p and atmospheric evaporative demand may be another reason reference crop evapotranspiration et0 were the highest in linyi qin s research then in changwu this research and yangling kang s research li 2012 while p showed the opposite trend in these sites under dry conditions soil water is more likely to be lost by evaporation t under plastic film mulch was increased table 2 because pm reduces soil water evaporation table 3 and may increase the available soil water in the root zone liu et al 2009 2014a higher t and lower ec lead to a higher t etc ratio the y t ratio can vary for different maize varieties french and schultz 1984 liu 1997 and field management practices our research showed that transpiration efficiency could be increased with pm table 2 only 1 5 of the water extracted from the soil by plants is used to produce tissue the remaining 95 99 of water passes into the air as transpiration feng et al 2007 yu et al 1997 according to liu y et al 2010 pm increased the emergence rate promoted the growth and development of plants and increased grain yield in experiment 3 we measured soil temperature at 15 cm soil depth and found that soil temperature increased linearly supplementary fig 1 with increased mulch cover higher soil temperature is an important factor for improving maize growth in april and may the percentage increase in yield exceeded the percentage increase in t so that y t was increased significantly the whole growth and maturation period was shortened by 12 d 15 d and 14 d in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively supplementary table 1 thereby reducing the water consuming time and the total transpiration amount for maize grown with pm liu y et al 2010 the ability of pm to reduce soil evaporation and hence increase water retention is widely recognized since stored soil water is used by crop roots in the field it is difficult to know how well pm can increase precipitation storage when crops are present in this study we studied pse when no crops were present and found the pse could be increased from 11 under no plastic film mulch to as much as 56 with 100 soil coverage with plastic mulch table 3 suggesting that pm reduced e significantly and increased the water available for t further increasing t etc in the efficiency chain table 4 shows how the use of pm influenced the four steps of the efficiency chain sw sw0 p etc p t etc and y t were increased by 0 3 9 30 6 and 13 6 respectively the ratio of sw sw0 p was assumed to reach its maximum value of 1 for both treatments so that there was no effect of pm on this ratio this was the result of the special conditions in this experiment where u r and d were equal to 0 pm increased etc in some of the years but reduced etf table 1 the 7 year experiment showed that annual water consumption etc etf was the same between pm and nm table 1 indicating that the increase of wuetwi under pm was due to reduced ec and increased t etc sw was also increased slightly over the seven years of exp 1 pm reduced ef resulting in greater stored soil water at maize planting that ultimately resulted in greater etc and greater maize yield proper use of pm in this region would lead to more efficient use of the valuable limited water resource it should be noted that in our experiments all the plots are diked and made perfectly level to prevent runoff so r was assumed to be 0 however in real field situations for the tableland on the loess plateau such runoff may happen sometimes since the land is not absolutely flat runoff amount is correlated with slope degree when the slope was 3 and the single rain was 19 4 mm and 60 6 mm the runoff in maize field was 0 42 and 1 02 mm respectively accounting for 2 2 and 1 7 of the rainfall song et al 2005 based on the further calculation of table 1 it was found that in the first year the wuetwi was 0 47 and 0 51 kg m 3 for nm and pm respectively wuep was 1 61 and 1 84 kg m 3 respectively by the seventh year wuetwi was 1 21 and 1 53 kg m 3 respectively wuep was 1 49 and 1 92 kg m 3 respectively the gap between wuep and wuetwi decreased with the increase of years the efficiency chain shows that pm improved wuetwi by improving t etc and wuet in agricultural water management what is required is not only a higher etc sw but also a higher t etc high values of etc sw accompanied by high t etc enable good crop growth and yield the value of y t represents the connection between crop yield and water consumption many factors influence y t including plant genetic properties feng et al 2007 yang et al 2002 and soil fertility more fertile soils generally lead to higher y t even with the same water consumption zhang et al 1999 5 conclusion the efficiency chain factored wuetwi into four steps and helped to show how to increase wuetwi it also provides an effective way to understand and improve water management in agriculture the experiments results show that in dryland farming areas in the loess plateau of china pm increased maize yield and hence increased wuetwi significantly by analyzing the whole water use process in the field it was found that pm may have little impact on etc but it increased t and reduced ec resulting in spring maize t etc of 73 3 and 82 1 in the two experiment years respectively 33 3 and 28 3 higher than that of nm the percentage increase in maize yield

10879,it s very important to guarantee the wheat production and improve water productivity in the north china plain ncp in order to reduce irrigation and ensure the crop production in the ncp a two year field experiment of winter wheat was conducted in 2016 2018 using micro sprinkling irrigation including different irrigation amount treatments 60 mm mi60 90 mm mi90 120 mm mi120 and 150 mm mi150 and the local traditional water saving and productive flooding irrigation method ti120 was as a control the grain yield gy dry matter accumulation dm root system distribution and water utilization were investigated the results showed that the gy of mi60 decreased by 5 1 13 4 compared with ti120 gy of mi90 was comparable with ti120 while that of mi120 and mi150 increased significantly the higher gy in micro sprinkling treatments was mainly due to the significant increase of 1 000 grain weight tgw which was the result of the significant delay of the senescence in flag leaves during grain filling and then the increase in the post anthesis dm in addition the roots mainly distributed in the 0 60 cm soil profile and micro sprinkling ensured the soil water supply in this areas at the critical growth stages what s more micro sprinkling with reducing irrigation treatments significantly promoted the growth of root system to the deep soil layer which improved the absorption and utilization of moisture stored in soil compared with ti120 the same irrigation amount treatment under micro sprinkling mi120 significantly increased water use efficiency wue due to higher gy and lower seasonal evapotranspiration et the 125 irrigation amount treatment mi150 increased wue due to higher gy and comparable et the 75 irrigation amount treatment mi90 obtained the similar wue to ti120 the 50 irrigation amount treatment mi60 got similar or lower wue to ti120 overall suitable reduction of irrigation amount under micro sprinkling mi90 can ensure the grain yield of winter wheat and efficient utilization of irrigation water in the ncp keywords micro sprinkling irrigation wheat dry matter accumulation root distribution water use efficiency 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is one of the primary areas of winter wheat in china national bureau of statistics of china 2015 and guaranteeing the production of winter wheat in this area is very important to china s food security the water consumption of winter wheat growing season is approximately 300 450 mm whereas only 110 180 mm of the rainfall occurs to the winter wheat growing season sun et al 2011 yuan et al 2015 which is far from meeting the growth needs of winter wheat and thus the production of wheat relies mainly on supplementary irrigation by exploiting groundwater in the ncp jha et al 2017 wang 2017 nevertheless the successive crop production has resulted in groundwater resources increasingly inadequate in the ncp the annual groundwater over exploitation in this area was up to 6 8 billion tons and the groundwater table is still declining at a rate of 0 5 1 m per year which has caused a series of serious environmental and ecological problems in this area currell et al 2012 feng et al 2018 therefore it is urgent to improve the productivity of irrigation water in the ncp optimizing irrigation schedule is an important measure to improve winter wheat grain yield and water use efficiency wue and researches are remarkable in recent years zhang et al 2011 2015 wang 2017 the prevailing irrigation practice in the ncp is flooding irrigation and the efficient and productive irrigation scheme in this area involves two irrigations one at jointing and one at anthesis stage during the winter wheat growing season xu et al 2018a however the serious water consumption makes it become difficult for the sustainable development of this mode in the ncp thus it is necessary to further reduce irrigation water consumption from the perspective of national strategy it is necessary to reduce groundwater resources exploitation and develop more water saving and sustainable agriculture production while the food supply of ncp also must be guaranteed the contradiction between protection of groundwater resources and guaranteeing winter wheat production in this area has increasingly become a scientific issue concerned by many researchers wang 2017 han et al 2018 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2018b and how can we reduce irrigation without yield loss or with slight yield loss in the ncp improving the utilization of deep soil moisture in winter wheat is an important means to reduce irrigation and increase grain yield and the availability of soil moisture by crops is affected by the root system distribution in soil profile xu et al 2016 winter wheat belongs to densely planted crop and possesses the deeply root system and many studies have reported that the maximum root length of winter wheat can reach to 2 m at anthesis stage feng et al 2017 jha et al 2017 some studies have also showed that the soil moisture has a great effect on the root system distribution and reducing or optimizing irrigation can promote the roots growth to the deeper soil layer therefore improved the absorption and utilization of soil moisture and increased wue of winter wheat xu et al 2016 li et al 2018 the distribution of rainfall is greatly uneven in the ncp and the rainfalls are mainly concentrated on june to august which accounts for about 70 80 of the total annual precipitation zhang et al 2006 the cropping pattern in this area is winter wheat summer maize rotation system and the maximum maize root system is about 1 m which mainly distributed in the soil layer above 60 mm guan et al 2014 chilundo et al 2017 and it s difficult for maize to use the water and nutrients leached by the summer s large amount rainfall to the deep soil layer however the water and nutrients stored in the deep soil profile can be used by winter wheat thus the moisture management could improve the annual water and nitrogen utilization of winter wheat summer maize in the ncp xu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 han et al 2018 nitrogen is one of the essential plant nutrients that affect crop growth and water utilization garnett et al 2009 cossani et al 2010 sadras and lawson 2013 researchers reported that the crop evapotranspiration et was significantly increased under the higher nitrogen fertilizer application which decreased the crop yield and wue behera and panda 2009 wang et al 2017 so the appropriate amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied is 180 240 kg ha 1 in the ncp wang et al 2017 tian et al 2018 in addition the response of crops to n fertilization is dependent on soil water condition the rainfall amount and frequency during the growing season of crops and the nitrogen fertilizer application rate and timing latiri souki et al 1998 tilling et al 2007 di paolo and rinaldi 2008 indicated that an appropriate soil moisture was in favor of n availability and the simultaneous utilization of water and supplemental irrigation is the mainly factor affecting soil moisture condition li et al 2012 guo et al 2014 moreover under the condition of traditional irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer applied method i e the flooding irrigation and one time topdressing before irrigation event n losses increased with the increase in fertilizer application rates mokhtassi bidgoli et al 2013 yand and yao 2014 reported that n leaching mainly occurred after irrigation and nitrate leaching increased as more irrigation amount was applied vázquez et al 2006 gheysari et al 2009 although reducing nitrogen application is beneficial to reduce nitrate leaching under the traditional production practice mokhtassi bidgoli et al 2013 it is easy to cause insufficient n supply during the grain filling period resulted in premature senescence of leaf and significant decrease in photosynthetic rate pn of flag leaves thus limiting the increase in crop yield and wue wang et al 2015b studies have showed that irrigation at jointing stage can obtain greater root length density in the upper soil profile li et al 2010 xu et al 2016 and more irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application is conducive to the growth of root in 0 20 cm soil layer while it will decrease the rld in the deeper soil chen et al 2018 which is not beneficial to the absorption and utilization of water and nitrogen in deep soil however the upper profile of soil are the main root distribution area and the 0 40 cm soil layer accounts for 87 4 of the total root quantity wang et al 2014 and more than 90 in the 0 80 cm soil profile under the traditional irrigation and fertilizer application li et al 2018 garnett et al 2009 indicated that the techniques of increased nitrogen use included split application of nitrogen fertilizer across the growing season better coordination of n with soil moisture status and better matching of fertilizer requirements to the crops irrigation modes have great influence on grain yield and wue of winter wheat studies have showed that compared to flooding irrigation drip irrigation can significantly increase wheat yield and reduce water consumption and improve wue jha et al 2017 sui et al 2018 similarly sprinkler irrigation also can significantly improve wue and grain yield man et al 2014 mon et al 2016 micro sprinkling irrigation is an advanced irrigation technology which has been developed based on drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation in recent years and it can easily realize the postponed application of nitrogen by integrating water and fertilizer application li et al 2019 and compared with drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation the cost of micro sprinkling hose irrigation is greatly reduced zhang et al 2009a our previous researches indicated that under the quota condition micro sprinkling hose irrigation with water and nitrogen fertilizer integration s4n2 irrigation 30 mm at jointing booting anthesis and filling stages respectively n fertilizer application was 22 5 kg ha 1 with each irrigation compared to the traditional flooding irrigation and nitrogen applied method ck irrigation with 60 mm at jointing and anthesis stage respectively n fertilizer was 90 kg ha 1 which was one time applied at jointing stage before irrigation significantly increased grain yield and wue by co locating the roots and n fertilizer distribution of winter wheat we also found that micro irrigation increased the root system distribution ratio of the deeper soil layer and promoted the absorption and utilization of water and nitrogen while reducing soil nitrate leaching to the deeper layer li et al 2018 and 2019 then can we make use of the micro sprinkling irrigation with water and fertilizer integration to realize the target of ensuring grain yield after reducing irrigation in the ncp here we hypothesized that after increasing irrigation frequency and reducing irrigation amount micro sprinkling irrigation with water and fertilizer integration could maintain the soil water supply in the mainly root system distribution zone at the critical growth stages and promote the root system penetrated to the deep soil layer and improve water utilization of deep soil profile delay leaf senescence during grain filling and promote dry matter production post anthesis so as to ensure grain yield and wue to confirm this hypothesis a two year field experiment was conducted to identify the effects of micro sprinkling with different irrigation amount on 1 grain yield and yield components of winter wheat 2 dry matter accumulation and harvest index 3 root system distribution at anthesis stage and 4 the soil moisture distribution during the winter wheat growing seasons as well as water use efficiency we expect the result will provide some reference for the sustainability of winter wheat production in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiments were carried out during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 winter wheat seasons at wuqiao experimental station of the china agriculture university which located in cangzhou city 37 41 02 n 116 37 23 e hebei province china fig 1 the soil

table 1 in this experimental field the mean field capacity and wilting point of crops was 27 6 g g 1 and 8 6 g g 1 respectively the organic matter total nitrogen available potassium and available phosphorus in the upper soil profile 0 40 cm of the experimental field were 1 17 0 95 g kg 1 104 4 mg kg 1 and 29 2 mg kg 1 respectively the total precipitation was 95 5 mm and 185 6 mm in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 winter wheat seasons fig 1 displayed the month rainfall and daily mean air temperature for the two years 2 2 experimental design two irrigation modes were conducted during the 2016 2018 winter wheat growing seasons i e the traditional flooding irrigation ti120 60 mm of irrigation volume at jointing and anthesis stages respectively and micro sprinkling irrigation mi irrigation events at jointing booting anthesis and filling stages respectively as described in li et al 2018 there are three replications for each experimental treatment and the plot size was 4 m 30 m the irrigation volume of mi was 60 mm mi60 90 mm mi90 120 mm mi120 and 150 mm mi150 respectively the traditional flooding irrigation mode ti120 was irrigated using the polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe the micro sprinkling irrigation was carried out using micro sprinkling hose it s length was 30 m and it s flow rate was 6 0 m3 h 1 under the working pressure of 0 02 mpa the irrigation amount were controlled by a flow meter installed at the head of all micro sprinkling irrigation system and the sprinkling angle of the micro sprinkling hose was 80 in this study the micro sprinkling hoses had folded diameters of 60 mm and were perforated with 86 groups of orifices there were six orifices in each group and with a group the diameter of the first and the sixth orifices was 1 2 mm while the diameter of the other four orifices was 0 8 mm the distance between two adjacent groups of orifices was 20 cm man et al 2014 li et al 2019 each experimental plot included 24 rows of winter wheat with spacing 0 15 m and the inter row spaces between the winter wheat rows were designated as l1 to l23 fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the hose of micro sprinkling was laid at l6 and l18 well water was the source of irrigation in this experiment in this study the n fertilizer n phosphate fertilizer p2o5 and potassic fertilizer k2o were applied as base fertilizer before sowing of winter wheat with 105 kg ha 1 120 kg ha 1 and 90 kg ha 1 respectively during the wheat growing season 90 kg n ha 1 as the topdressing for each micro sprinkling irrigation scheduling urea as topdressing with 22 5 kg n ha 1 was completely dissolved in a fertilization device and applied together with the irrigation volume and 90 kg n ha 1 was spread over the fields of ti120 at jointing as described in li et al 2018 the specific irrigation regimes for each treatment are shown in table 2 the high yielding winter wheat cultivar jimai22 triticum aestivum l was used in the experiment which is one of the widely popularized and applied varieties in ncp the winter wheat was sown on october 14 2016 and october 22 2017 with 15 cm row spacing and harvested on june 10 2017 and june 7 2018 respectively 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water consumption and water use efficiency soil samples were measured from 20 cm increments to a depth of 200 cm soil layer i e 10 layers labeled from 1 to 10 by using a soil corer in each experimental plot measurements were made at pre sowing booting anthesis filling and maturity stages soil volumetric water content vswc was determined by the soil gravimetric water content gswc and bulk density ρ g cm 3 the gswc was measured by oven drying method li et al 2018 the stored soil water sw i mm in each layer was calculated by vswc and the soil layer depth d mm the calculated equations are as following vswc gswc ρ 100 s w i vsw c i d soil water consumption in each soil layer δsw i was calculated as the difference in the stored soil water sw i between pre sowing and maturity stages the total water consumption of soil δsw was calculated from the sum of the first soil layer δsw1 to the tenth layer δsw10 crop seasonal evapotranspiration et was calculated using the soil water balance equation xu et al 2018a et p i δsw r d cr where p mm is rainfall during the crop growing season i mm is irrigation volume δsw mm is water consumption in 2 m soil profile r is surface runoff d is downward flux below the wheat root zone and cr is capillary rise into the root zone due to the groundwater table at the experimental site is 7 9 m 4 m below the ground surface therefore cr was negligible in this study r and d can be ignored in the ncp including the experimental site gao et al 2017 water use efficiency wue kg m 3 was calculated by the following formula zhang et al 2018 wue gy et 2 3 2 chlorophyll content of flag leaf the flag leaf chlorophyll content was performed in twenty leaves samples that randomly collected in each plot at 5 day intervals starting 5 days after anthesis daa 5 until daa 30 the fresh flag leaves samples were stored at deep freezer with 20 c before the biochemical assays the chlorophyll content of flag leaf a b was extracted with 95 alcohol under the dark conditions and measured by a spectrophotometer li et al 2018 2 3 3 dry matter accumulation and grain yield in order to determine the dry matter accumulation two adjacent 0 5 m inner rows of all plants from each plot at ground level were sampled at anthesis and maturity respectively and all plant samples were oven dried at 75 c to a constant weight the dry matter accumulation after anthesis dmpa was measured by the difference between the dry matter accumulation at maturity and anthesis stage shi et al 2016 the contribution of dry matter production post anthesis to grain yield cr was calculated by the ratio of dry matter after anthesis to grain yield the harvest index hi is the ratio of grain weight to total dry matter accumulation at maturity about one week before the wheat harvest the spike number sn was determined by investigating randomly six adjacent 1 m inner rows of wheat in each plot as well as the grain number per spike gn was investigated by counting the all grains of each spike from 60 randomly selected plants in each plot at this time grain yield with 13 water content were determined by artificial threshing and weighing of randomly cutting ten adjacent two meters of wheat plants 3 m2 in each plot at maturity the thousand grain weight which water content is 13 was calculated by weighing 1 000 grains from the yield measurement samples and including three replications 2 3 4 root distribution root sampling was collected by using a root corer diameter 8 cm in each experimental plot at anthesis stage in both years with three replications at 0 2 m intervals down to a depth of 2 m and the roots of the row and it s adjacent inter rows of wheat plants as the total roots amount of each soil layer zhang et al 2006 sample of each soil layer was placed in a string mesh bag each bag sample was first washed away the soil with tap water and then all the roots were picked out manually images of the roots were obtained by using a special scanner for root system gt f5201 epson tokyo japan these root images were analyzed with winrhizo pro vision 2009c software regent instruments inc québec qc canada to calculate the root length density rld xu et al 2016 li et al 2018 2 4 data analysis the effects of micro sprinkling with different irrigation volume on winter wheat grain yield gn yield components water utilization and dry matter production were analyzed by analysis of variance using the glm procedure in spss ver 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa differences were judged by the least significant differences test using a 0 05 level of significance all figures were created by originpro 2016 originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 grain yield and yield components grain yield gy spike number sn grain number gn and 1000 grain weight tgw of winter wheat were significantly affected by year y and irrigation i and besides sn they were also significantly affected by y i table 3 compared with 2016 2017 the grain yield of winter wheat in 2017 2018 decreased significantly which was mainly due to the late sowing caused by rainfall pre sowing the fewer tillers caused by the lower temperature before winter eventually resulting in the lower spikes at maturity in addition the grain weight also decreased due to the excessive rainfall after anthesis and higher temperature during the grain filling stage fig 1 although grain number increased it is not enough to compensate for the negative effect of grain yield caused by the lower sn and twg in this year however the results of two years experiment were consistent among different treatments gy of mi120 and mi150 was significantly higher than that of ti120 but there was no significant difference between mi120 and mi150 this result showed that further increasing irrigation amount did not significantly increase gy of winter wheat when the irrigation amount was decreased by 25 mi90 the gy was similar to ti120 when the irrigation amount was decreased by 50 mi90 the gy was significantly lower than ti120 compared to ti120 mi120 and mi150 had no significant effect on sn and gn but significantly increased tgw and thus increased gy mi60 and mi90 had no significant effect on gn but significantly decreased sn and significantly increased tgw in mi90 the increase of tgw can compensate for the decrease in sn so the gy was similar to ti120 while in mi60 the increase of tgw can t compensate for the decrease in sn so the grain yield decreased 3 2 dry matter and flag leaf chlorophyll content 3 2 1 dry matter production and the harvest index year y irrigation i and their interaction y i all had significant effects on dry matter accumulation at anthesis stage dma dry matter accumulation at maturity dmm dry matter accumulation post anthesis dmpa it s contribution to grain yield cr and harvest index hi table 4 compared with 2016 2017 dm in 2017 2018 decreased significantly especially dmm was obviously less which was also the reason why the yield was lower than the previous year table 3 compared with ti120 the same irrigation amount treatment under micro sprinkling mi120 had lower dma but higher dmm dmpa cr and hi the increased irrigation amount treatment mi150 got the similar dma to mi120 and there was no significant difference in dmm dmpa cr and hi between mi150 and mi120 the reduced irrigation amount by 25 treatment mi90 had lower dma than ti120 mi90 and ti120 obtained the similar dmm dmpa and hi but the cr of mi90 was higher than ti120 the reduced irrigation amount by 50 treatment mi60 got lower dma dmm and dmpa compared to ti120 while the regularity of cr and hi was inconsistent between the two years overall compared with that traditional irrigation method ti120 the same mi120 or 75 mi90 micro sprinkling irrigation amount treatments decreased dry matter accumulation dm at anthesis but increased dm post anthesis and it s contribution to grain yield which ensured or increased the grain yield of winter wheat the 125 irrigation amount treatment mi150 can obtain the similar dma to ti120 however it had no yield advantage compared with mi120 treatment the 50 irrigation amount treatment mi60 decreased dma and dmpa leading to the decrease of grain yield 3 2 2 chlorophyll content of flag leaf the chlorophyll content of flag leaf after anthesis in winter wheat was measured every five days in 2016 2018 growing season the results showed that the chlorophyll content of flag leaf after anthesis 10 days daa 10 gradually decreased in all treatments and the content reached to the lowest at maturity however the difference in different treatments was significant fig 3 in 2016 2017 the decreased rate of chlorophyll content after daa 15 was significantly lower in mi90 mi120 and mi150 than in ti120 and mi60 and the senescence of flag in mi60 was the fastest in 2017 2018 during the middle late grain filling stage daa 15 to daa 25 the decreased rate of chlorophyll content was slower than in 2016 2017 which may be due to the more rainfall in 2017 2018 however the flag leaf chlorophyll from daa 25 to daa 30 was sharply declined in 2017 2018 and the reduced rate was higher than in 2016 2017 growing season in briefly compared with ti120 besides mi60 which was less irrigation micro sprinkling irrigation with water and fertilizer integration significantly delayed flag leaf senescence after daa 15 which was also the main reason for more dry matter production under the micro sprinkling irrigation conditions table 4 3 3 root system distribution 3 3 1 primary and secondary root number the number of primary and secondary root at anthesis stage was significantly higher in 2016 2017 than in 2017 2018 fig 4 which may be due to the lower temperature in winter and late sowing in 2017 2018 fig 1 and the number of spike at maturity was also significantly lower in 2017 2018 than in 2016 2017 table 3 there was no significant difference in the number of primary root at anthesis among all the treatments in the two years however the secondary root number was significantly affected by the irrigation in the two years the secondary root number of mi150 was significantly higher than that of ti120 2016 2017 or similar to ti120 2017 2018 while mi120 mi90 and mi60 had lower secondary root number than ti120 and mi60 had the lowest number of secondary root 3 3 2 root distribution as shown in fig 5 the root length density rld obviously declined with soil depth i e the upper soil layers had the higher rld and the lower rld occurred in deeper soil layers across the different treatments over the two growing seasons the main area of root distribution for the different treatments was in the 0 60 cm profile which accounted for 84 0 79 9 77 1 69 1 and 71 6 of total rld in ti120 mi150 mi120 mi90 and mi60 respectively and the rld in ti120 and mi150 was higher than other treatments while in 80 200 cm soil profile the percentage of rld was higher in mi60 28 4 mi90 30 9 and mi120 22 9 than in ti120 16 0 and mi150 20 1 in 2016 2017 wheat growing season in 2017 2018 the rld in 0 60 cm was significantly lower than in 2016 2017 which was mainly due to the fewer tillers of wheat in spring and lower spikes at anthesis in this year the percentage of root distribution of ti120 and mi150 in this profile was 77 2 and 77 1 and for mi60 mi90 and mi120 treatment was 68 7 71 8 and 73 8 respectively and micro sprinkling irrigation treatments except mi150 had significantly lower rld than ti120 in each soil layer and the rld significantly decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount of micro sprinkling below the 80 cm soil profile it was similar to the previous year compared to ti120 22 8 the percentage of root distribution of mi60 mi90 and mi120 significantly increased which was 29 1 28 0 and 28 9 respectively in brief the two year s experiment results showed that the main root distribution area was in the 0 60 cm profile and micro sprinkling with decreasing irrigation amount treatments promoted the root system growth to the deeper soil layer and increased the percentage of rld below 60 cm soil profile 3 4 water consumption 3 4 1 the variation of soil water content in the mainly roots zone as shown in fig 6 compared with the traditional irrigation mode ti120 the average soil volumetrci water content vswc in the mainly winter wheat root system distribution zone 0 60 cm fig 5 under micro sprinkling irrigation was relatively stable at the critical growth period of different treatments and the vswc of micro sprinkling irrigation increased with the increase of irrigation amount at the same growth stage there was also some difference in the soil moisture content between these two years in the mainly root system distribution zone in 2016 2017 at booting stage the vswc in the mainly root system distribution area of ti120 was significantly higher than that of micro sprinkling irrigation treatments it may be due to the fact that ti120 was carried out more irrigation 60 mm at jointing stage while micro sprinkling irrigation treatments were carried out a small amount of irrigation especially mi60 had the lowest vswc due to the least irrigation amount 15 mm at anthesis stage the vswc of mi150 mi120 and mi90 in the mainly root system distribution area was significantly higher than that of ti120 and mi60 which may be due to a certain amount of irrigation by micro sprinkling at booting stage while ti120 had no irrigation event occurred and mi60 also resulted in a lower soil moisture content due to the less irrigation at jointing and booting stage at filling stage in 0 60 cm soil profile the vswc of mi150 was the highest and there was no significant difference between mi120 and ti120 which were significantly higher than mi90 and mi60 and there was no significant difference between mi90 and mi60 at maturity stage the vswc of mi150 and mi120 in 0 60 cm soil layer was significantly higher than other treatments and there was no significant difference between mi90 and ti120 but mi60 was the lowest in 2017 2018 the soil moisture content in the mainly root system distribution area of all treatments increased significantly due to the large amount of rainfall after anthesis 130 mm however besides the filling stage in 2017 2018 the changing regularity of vswc in the same growth stage was basically consistent to 2016 2017 growing season overall from anthesis to maturity the soil moisture in the main winter wheat root system zone of ti120 changed dramatically while vswc of micro sprinkling irrigation treatments decreased slowly and remained relatively stable which maybe play an important role in maintaining the water supply in the upper soil profile consequently micro sprinkling with suitable irrigation amount at the key growth stage coordinated water supply in the mainly root system zone and the water demand for post anthesis material production which was conducive to promoting material production during grain filling and efficient use of irrigation water tables 4 and 5 3 4 2 seasonal evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue as shown in table 5 et δsw and wue were significantly affected by year y irrigation i and their interaction y i in 2016 2017 the et was obviously higher than that in 2017 2018 which was mainly due to the larger of population and less rainfall in this year which led to more soil water consumption in 2016 2017 there was no significant difference in et between ti120 and mi150 but they were higher than mi120 mi90 and mi60 and mi60 had the least et as for the δsw it significantly increased with the decrease of irrigation amount mi60 consumed the most soil water mi90 was significantly higher than ti120 mi120 and mi150 were significantly lower than ti120 as for water consumption of different soil layers fig 7 under the micro sprinkling irrigation condition it decreased with the increase of irrigation amount and there were some differences in different soil layers water consumption between 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 growing season because of the difference in weather conditions in 2016 2017 the soil water consumption in mi150 mi120 and mi90 besides 0 20 cm above 100 cm soil layer was significantly higher than that of ti120 at the same time mi120 and mi90 increased the water consumption in deep soil layers in 2017 2018 compared with ti120 mi150 significantly decreased the soil water consumption in different soil layers of 0 160 cm soil profile mi120 significantly increased the soil water consumption in 0 100 cm soil layers besides 20 40 cm and there was no significant difference below 100 cm between mi120 and ti120 mi90 significantly increased the soil water consumption in 0 160 cm soil layers beside 40 60 cm the water consumption of each soil layer in mi60 was higher than other treatments due to the least irrigation amount in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons the wue in 2016 2017 were significantly higher than that in 2017 2018 table 5 compared with ti120 wue of mi150 and mi120 significantly increased the wue of mi60 significantly decreased while mi90 had similar wue to ti120 in 2017 2018 the regularity of water consumption and wue was similar to 2016 2017 in summary compared with the traditional irrigation method ti120 mi120 and mi150 significantly increased wue the treatments of reduced 25 irrigation water mi90 and reducing 50 irrigation with micro sprinkling mi60 significantly decreased the seasonal evapotranspiration but significantly increased the δsw although the wue was not increased what s more micro sprinkling irrigation with equal or reducing irrigation amount could improve the utilization of deep soil water which may have an important role to ensure the higher crop yield in this study considering the output and water saving production mi90 was the best mode 4 discussion many researchers have reported that the use of advanced irrigation methods such as surface drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation or micro sprinkling hose irrigation combined with suitable irrigation scheduling can be effective strategies for water saving and high crop yield particularly in the areas of water scarcity metin sezen and yazar 2006 kang et al 2010 liu et al 2011 rao et al 2013 li et al 2019 what s more researches have showed that the cost of production is greatly reduced and the benefit is significantly improved by using micro sprinkling hose irrigation technology xing et al 2019 in this study compared with ti120 the same irrigation amount treatment under micro sprinkling mi120 significantly increased grain yield gy and water use efficiency wue tables 3 and 5 which was consistent with our previous study li et al 2018 the 125 irrigation amount treatment mi150 also significantly increased gy and wue however there was no significant difference in gy between mi150 and mi120 which showed that under micro sprinkling irrigation much more water can t further increase gy the 75 irrigation amount treatment mi90 obtained similar gy and wue to ti120 which has the important significance to protect groundwater resources while ensuring crop production in ncp the 50 irrigation amount treatment mi60 got lower gy and similar or lower wue to ti120 the gy decreased by 13 3 in 2016 2017 and 5 1 in 2017 2018 therefore we concluded that mi90 is water saving and stable production mode while mi120 is productive and effective mode in the ncp yield components determine wheat yield including spikes number grain number per spike and grain weight and they interact with each other the current approach to increase crop yield was mainly through increasing grain number or tgw and when the capacity of the sink is difficult to further improve tgw is the most importantly restrictive factor to affect the wheat yield chen et al 2013 liang et al 2017 grain weight is the last yield component to be formed and it is largely dependent on the rate and duration of the grain filling takai et al 2005 and simultaneously it is easily affected by the external environments such as air temperature precipitation soil moisture and fertilization etc yang et al 2006 shi et al 2017 yadav and ellis 2017 thapa et al 2018 this study showed that grain weight was significantly affected by year type y irrigation treatment i and the interaction between y and i y i table 3 it was significantly higher in the 2016 2017 growing season than in 2017 2018 and micro sprinkling treatments besides mi60 in 2017 2018 growing season were significantly higher than that of ti120 due to no significant difference in sn and gn among ti120 mi120 and mi150 the increase of tgw in micro sprinkling treatments was the main contributor for yield increase in mi90 the sn was significantly decreased but the significant increase of tgw made up for the negative effect of decrease in sn so the gy was comparable to ti120 in the two growing seasons in mi60 the greatly decrease of sn can t be compensated by the slightly increase in tgw which resulted in significant decrease in gy in these two growing seasons dry matter accumulation dm is closely related to grain yield formation and the dm of post anthesis is extremely vital for grain weight formation li et al 2019 therefore increasing dm post anthesis is an important means to increase grain yield shi et al 2016 some studies showed that ensuring the supply of water and fertilizer after anthesis has a great influence on improving dry matter production zhang et al 2016a lin and wang 2017 in the present study micro sprinkling irrigation treatments mi90 mi120 mi150 significantly increased dm post anthesis and it s contribution to grain as compared to ti120 table 4 which may be the major reason for the higher tgw and gy in these treatments however the significant decrease of gy in mi60 was due to insufficient dm not only at anthesis but also post anthesis dm was determined by leaf photosynthesis water deficit during grain filling could accelerate leaf senescence by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species singh et al 2012 while ensuring the supply of water and fertilizer during grain filling is beneficial to delay flag leaf senescence and increase yield and wue of winter wheat wang et al 2013a li et al 2018 in this study under the quota irrigation condition 120 mm or 150 mm the increase of irrigation frequency with micro sprinkling irrigation had no negative effect on sn and gn and the micro sprinkling with water and nitrogen fertilizer integration delayed the flag leaf senescence besides mi60 by supplying water and nitrogen during grain filling of wheat which was advantageous to improve post anthesis dm accumulation and increase grain weight finally increased grain yield compared to the traditional irrigation mode fig 3 table 4 however the late sowing caused by rainfall pre sowing as well as the low air temperature at winter resulted in the less tillers and less sn in 2017 2018 growing season fig 1 table 3 many researches showed that the higher temperature during grain filling stage and excessive soil moisture always led to the leaf premature senescence and decreased the grain weight therefore resulted in the decrease in crop yield wang et al 2013b a in the present study the excessive rainfall of 2017 2018 growing season after anthesis may affect the micro environment of the canopy lu et al 2015 mon et al 2016 led to the lower flag leaf chlorophyll content in the late grain filling stage 25 30 d fig 3 which decreased dm at maturity and finally resulted in lower grain yield than 2016 2017 growing season table 3 many researchers have reported that deficit irrigation could promote the absorption and utilization of soil moisture by crops wang et al 2015b shi et al 2016 xu et al 2018a 2018b and some studies showed that the large rainfall in summer could be stored in the deep soil profile which could be used for the growth of winter wheat in the spring therefore water saving and high yielding could be achieved by optimizing irrigation amount and irrigation period xu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2018a in the present study the micro irrigation treatments mi90 mi120 mi150 ensured the appropriate vswc at the critical growth periods in the mainly root system distribution zone such as booting to anthesis and filling to maturity stages fig 6 which synchronized the water demand for post anthesis material production and was beneficial to increase grain yield and water use efficiency many studies have shown that wue of crops can be increased by reducing et or increasing grain yield by using quota water igbadun et al 2007 li et al 2010 in this study mi120 and mi150 obtained the higher wue than ti120 due to the significant increase in gy and the et of mi120 was also significantly decreased mi90 significantly decreased et however it had similar wue to ti120 because of the slight decrease in gy tables 3 and 5 we also found that micro sprinkling treatments besides mi150 significantly promoted the utilization of water in the deep soil profile as compared to ti120 fig 7 and the less irrigation amount the more utilization of soil moisture table 5 in totally under the condition of micro sprinkling irrigation with water and fertilizer integration the use of deep soil moisture was significantly promoted through increasing the frequency of irrigation and reducing the irrigation amount of each time or reducing the total irrigation amount and the increase of the absorption and utilization of soil moisture in the deep soil profile in the reduced irrigation treatments may prevent fertilizer moving into the deeper soil profile and improve water and fertilizer use efficiency however although micro sprinkling irrigation with increasing irrigation frequency significantly improved grain yield and wue the fewer irrigation amount of micro sprinkling irrigation each time may lead to the increase in evaporation especially during the grain filling which needs to be further studied in the future root system plays an important role in plant soil ecosystem zhang et al 2009b the distribution of root system in soil profile is closely related to the absorption and utilization of soil moisture and nutrients and the soil water and fertilizer management also has an important effect on the distribution of root system wang et al 2015b feng et al 2017 studies have showed that the roots of winter wheat could be promoted to grow into the deep soil profile by reducing irrigation which is beneficial to increase the absorption and utilization of deep moisture and fertilizer finally significantly improve irrigation water production efficiency zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2016 and our previous study also showed that micro sprinkling irrigation with water and fertilizer integration increased the root system distribution of the deep soil profile and improved grain yield and resource use efficiency by co locating the roots and n fertilizer distribution of winter wheat li et al 2018 in this study compared with ti120 the root length distribution rld of micro sprinkling with reducing irrigation in the upper soil profile 0 60 cm decreased significantly while it was increased significantly below 80 cm and there was no significant difference in rld between the increased irrigation treatment mi150 and ti120 below 140 cm fig 4 in addition the number of secondary roots of ti120 and mi150 was significantly higher than other micro sprinkling treatments however there was no significant difference in primary roots number among all the treatments at anthesis fig 3 it s also consistent with the previous studies that is the deep roots mainly were primary roots and drought promoted the primary roots growth into the deep soil profile which was beneficial to the absorption and utilization of deep soil moisture xue et al 2010 in this study at jointing stage the one off irrigation and fertilization of ti120 may play an important role in the root system growth and development while the irrigation with micro sprinkling can t meet the growth requirement of winter wheat especially for mi60 treatment which promoted the root system growing into deep soil to absorb water so the rld was the highest for mi60 below 80 cm soil layer root system has the function of pumping and absorbing water and mineral nutrients in soil it can also be used as a sensor of drought stress and other comprehensive functions jha et al 2017 and studies have showed that moderate drought stress could promote the material transport from vegetative organs such as stems and leaves to grain and increase yield zhang et al 2016b in this study the lower moisture in the soil layers about 60 100 cm formed after jointing stage of winter wheat under micro sprinkling irrigation may induce roots to release some signaling substances accelerate grain filling and material transport and play an important role in the formation of higher grain weight this needs to be further studied 5 conclusion compared with the traditional irrigation mode ti120 under the equally total irrigation amount mi120 using micro sprinkling irrigation with increasing irrigation frequency can significantly improve the gy and wue of winter wheat further increasing the irrigation amount of micro sprinkling mi150 can t continue to increase grain yield and it significantly decreased the wue compared to mi120 reducing 25 irrigation amount treatment mi90 could achieve the similar gy and wue to ti120 reducing 50 irrigation amount treatment mi60 significantly decreased gy and wue compared to ti120 in this study mi150 mi120 and mi90 increased or ensured the gy and wue mainly due to the increase of irrigation frequency with micro sprinkling guaranteeing the soil water supply in mainly root system area at the critical growth stage and coordinating the relationship between matter production after anthesis and it s demand for water and mi120 and mi90 also improved the absorption and utilization of the deeper soil moisture overall micro sprinkling with suitable decrease in irrigation amount mi90 can ensure grain yield of winter wheat and realize the real water saving and the efficient use of irrigation water in the ncp

10879,it s very important to guarantee the wheat production and improve water productivity in the north china plain ncp in order to reduce irrigation and ensure the crop production in the ncp a two year field experiment of winter wheat was conducted in 2016 2018 using micro sprinkling irrigation including different irrigation amount treatments 60 mm mi60 90 mm mi90 120 mm mi120 and 150 mm mi150 and the local traditional water saving and productive flooding irrigation method ti120 was as a control the grain yield gy dry matter accumulation dm root system distribution and water utilization were investigated the results showed that the gy of mi60 decreased by 5 1 13 4 compared with ti120 gy of mi90 was comparable with ti120 while that of mi120 and mi150 increased significantly the higher gy in micro sprinkling treatments was mainly due to the significant increase of 1 000 grain weight tgw which was the result of the significant delay of the senescence in flag leaves during grain filling and then the increase in the post anthesis dm in addition the roots mainly distributed in the 0 60 cm soil profile and micro sprinkling ensured the soil water supply in this areas at the critical growth stages what s more micro sprinkling with reducing irrigation treatments significantly promoted the growth of root system to the deep soil layer which improved the absorption and utilization of moisture stored in soil compared with ti120 the same irrigation amount treatment under micro sprinkling mi120 significantly increased water use efficiency wue due to higher gy and lower seasonal evapotranspiration et the 125 irrigation amount treatment mi150 increased wue due to higher gy and comparable et the 75 irrigation amount treatment mi90 obtained the similar wue to ti120 the 50 irrigation amount treatment mi60 got similar or lower wue to ti120 overall suitable reduction of irrigation amount under micro sprinkling mi90 can ensure the grain yield of winter wheat and efficient utilization of irrigation water in the ncp keywords micro sprinkling irrigation wheat dry matter accumulation root distribution water use efficiency 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is one of the primary areas of winter wheat in china national bureau of statistics of china 2015 and guaranteeing the production of winter wheat in this area is very important to china s food security the water consumption of winter wheat growing season is approximately 300 450 mm whereas only 110 180 mm of the rainfall occurs to the winter wheat growing season sun et al 2011 yuan et al 2015 which is far from meeting the growth needs of winter wheat and thus the production of wheat relies mainly on supplementary irrigation by exploiting groundwater in the ncp jha et al 2017 wang 2017 nevertheless the successive crop production has resulted in groundwater resources increasingly inadequate in the ncp the annual groundwater over exploitation in this area was up to 6 8 billion tons and the groundwater table is still declining at a rate of 0 5 1 m per year which has caused a series of serious environmental and ecological problems in this area currell et al 2012 feng et al 2018 therefore it is urgent to improve the productivity of irrigation water in the ncp optimizing irrigation schedule is an important measure to improve winter wheat grain yield and water use efficiency wue and researches are remarkable in recent years zhang et al 2011 2015 wang 2017 the prevailing irrigation practice in the ncp is flooding irrigation and the efficient and productive irrigation scheme in this area involves two irrigations one at jointing and one at anthesis stage during the winter wheat growing season xu et al 2018a however the serious water consumption makes it become difficult for the sustainable development of this mode in the ncp thus it is necessary to further reduce irrigation water consumption from the perspective of national strategy it is necessary to reduce groundwater resources exploitation and develop more water saving and sustainable agriculture production while the food supply of ncp also must be guaranteed the contradiction between protection of groundwater resources and guaranteeing winter wheat production in this area has increasingly become a scientific issue concerned by many researchers wang 2017 han et al 2018 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2018b and how can we reduce irrigation without yield loss or with slight yield loss in the ncp improving the utilization of deep soil moisture in winter wheat is an important means to reduce irrigation and increase grain yield and the availability of soil moisture by crops is affected by the root system distribution in soil profile xu et al 2016 winter wheat belongs to densely planted crop and possesses the deeply root system and many studies have reported that the maximum root length of winter wheat can reach to 2 m at anthesis stage feng et al 2017 jha et al 2017 some studies have also showed that the soil moisture has a great effect on the root system distribution and reducing or optimizing irrigation can promote the roots growth to the deeper soil layer therefore improved the absorption and utilization of soil moisture and increased wue of winter wheat xu et al 2016 li et al 2018 the distribution of rainfall is greatly uneven in the ncp and the rainfalls are mainly concentrated on june to august which accounts for about 70 80 of the total annual precipitation zhang et al 2006 the cropping pattern in this area is winter wheat summer maize rotation system and the maximum maize root system is about 1 m which mainly distributed in the soil layer above 60 mm guan et al 2014 chilundo et al 2017 and it s difficult for maize to use the water and nutrients leached by the summer s large amount rainfall to the deep soil layer however the water and nutrients stored in the deep soil profile can be used by winter wheat thus the moisture management could improve the annual water and nitrogen utilization of winter wheat summer maize in the ncp xu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 han et al 2018 nitrogen is one of the essential plant nutrients that affect crop growth and water utilization garnett et al 2009 cossani et al 2010 sadras and lawson 2013 researchers reported that the crop evapotranspiration et was significantly increased under the higher nitrogen fertilizer application which decreased the crop yield and wue behera and panda 2009 wang et al 2017 so the appropriate amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied is 180 240 kg ha 1 in the ncp wang et al 2017 tian et al 2018 in addition the response of crops to n fertilization is dependent on soil water condition the rainfall amount and frequency during the growing season of crops and the nitrogen fertilizer application rate and timing latiri souki et al 1998 tilling et al 2007 di paolo and rinaldi 2008 indicated that an appropriate soil moisture was in favor of n availability and the simultaneous utilization of water and supplemental irrigation is the mainly factor affecting soil moisture condition li et al 2012 guo et al 2014 moreover under the condition of traditional irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer applied method i e the flooding irrigation and one time topdressing before irrigation event n losses increased with the increase in fertilizer application rates mokhtassi bidgoli et al 2013 yand and yao 2014 reported that n leaching mainly occurred after irrigation and nitrate leaching increased as more irrigation amount was applied vázquez et al 2006 gheysari et al 2009 although reducing nitrogen application is beneficial to reduce nitrate leaching under the traditional production practice mokhtassi bidgoli et al 2013 it is easy to cause insufficient n supply during the grain filling period resulted in premature senescence of leaf and significant decrease in photosynthetic rate pn of flag leaves thus limiting the increase in crop yield and wue wang et al 2015b studies have showed that irrigation at jointing stage can obtain greater root length density in the upper soil profile li et al 2010 xu et al 2016 and more irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application is conducive to the growth of root in 0 20 cm soil layer while it will decrease the rld in the deeper soil chen et al 2018 which is not beneficial to the absorption and utilization of water and nitrogen in deep soil however the upper profile of soil are the main root distribution area and the 0 40 cm soil layer accounts for 87 4 of the total root quantity wang et al 2014 and more than 90 in the 0 80 cm soil profile under the traditional irrigation and fertilizer application li et al 2018 garnett et al 2009 indicated that the techniques of increased nitrogen use included split application of nitrogen fertilizer across the growing season better coordination of n with soil moisture status and better matching of fertilizer requirements to the crops irrigation modes have great influence on grain yield and wue of winter wheat studies have showed that compared to flooding irrigation drip irrigation can significantly increase wheat yield and reduce water consumption and improve wue jha et al 2017 sui et al 2018 similarly sprinkler irrigation also can significantly improve wue and grain yield man et al 2014 mon et al 2016 micro sprinkling irrigation is an advanced irrigation technology which has been developed based on drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation in recent years and it can easily realize the postponed application of nitrogen by integrating water and fertilizer application li et al 2019 and compared with drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation the cost of micro sprinkling hose irrigation is greatly reduced zhang et al 2009a our previous researches indicated that under the quota condition micro sprinkling hose irrigation with water and nitrogen fertilizer integration s4n2 irrigation 30 mm at jointing booting anthesis and filling stages respectively n fertilizer application was 22 5 kg ha 1 with each irrigation compared to the traditional flooding irrigation and nitrogen applied method ck irrigation with 60 mm at jointing and anthesis stage respectively n fertilizer was 90 kg ha 1 which was one time applied at jointing stage before irrigation significantly increased grain yield and wue by co locating the roots and n fertilizer distribution of winter wheat we also found that micro irrigation increased the root system distribution ratio of the deeper soil layer and promoted the absorption and utilization of water and nitrogen while reducing soil nitrate leaching to the deeper layer li et al 2018 and 2019 then can we make use of the micro sprinkling irrigation with water and fertilizer integration to realize the target of ensuring grain yield after reducing irrigation in the ncp here we hypothesized that after increasing irrigation frequency and reducing irrigation amount micro sprinkling irrigation with water and fertilizer integration could maintain the soil water supply in the mainly root system distribution zone at the critical growth stages and promote the root system penetrated to the deep soil layer and improve water utilization of deep soil profile delay leaf senescence during grain filling and promote dry matter production post anthesis so as to ensure grain yield and wue to confirm this hypothesis a two year field experiment was conducted to identify the effects of micro sprinkling with different irrigation amount on 1 grain yield and yield components of winter wheat 2 dry matter accumulation and harvest index 3 root system distribution at anthesis stage and 4 the soil moisture distribution during the winter wheat growing seasons as well as water use efficiency we expect the result will provide some reference for the sustainability of winter wheat production in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiments were carried out during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 winter wheat seasons at wuqiao experimental station of the china agriculture university which located in cangzhou city 37 41 02 n 116 37 23 e hebei province china fig 1 the soil type in this experimental field was determined to be light loam which contains 11 8 clay 78 1 silt and 10 1 sand the soil bulk density in 0 200 cm soil layers with 20 cm increment are presented in table 1 in this experimental field the mean field capacity and wilting point of crops was 27 6 g g 1 and 8 6 g g 1 respectively the organic matter total nitrogen available potassium and available phosphorus in the upper soil profile 0 40 cm of the experimental field were 1 17 0 95 g kg 1 104 4 mg kg 1 and 29 2 mg kg 1 respectively the total precipitation was 95 5 mm and 185 6 mm in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 winter wheat seasons fig 1 displayed the month rainfall and daily mean air temperature for the two years 2 2 experimental design two irrigation modes were conducted during the 2016 2018 winter wheat growing seasons i e the traditional flooding irrigation ti120 60 mm of irrigation volume at jointing and anthesis stages respectively and micro sprinkling irrigation mi irrigation events at jointing booting anthesis and filling stages respectively as described in li et al 2018 there are three replications for each experimental treatment and the plot size was 4 m 30 m the irrigation volume of mi was 60 mm mi60 90 mm mi90 120 mm mi120 and 150 mm mi150 respectively the traditional flooding irrigation mode ti120 was irrigated using the polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe the micro sprinkling irrigation was carried out using micro sprinkling hose it s length was 30 m and it s flow rate was 6 0 m3 h 1 under the working pressure of 0 02 mpa the irrigation amount were controlled by a flow meter installed at the head of all micro sprinkling irrigation system and the sprinkling angle of the micro sprinkling hose was 80 in this study the micro sprinkling hoses had folded diameters of 60 mm and were perforated with 86 groups of orifices there were six orifices in each group and with a group the diameter of the first and the sixth orifices was 1 2 mm while the diameter of the other four orifices was 0 8 mm the distance between two adjacent groups of orifices was 20 cm man et al 2014 li et al 2019 each experimental plot included 24 rows of winter wheat with spacing 0 15 m and the inter row spaces between the winter wheat rows were designated as l1 to l23 fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the hose of micro sprinkling was laid at l6 and l18 well water was the source of irrigation in this experiment in this study the n fertilizer n phosphate fertilizer p2o5 and potassic fertilizer k2o were applied as base fertilizer before sowing of winter wheat with 105 kg ha 1 120 kg ha 1 and 90 kg ha 1 respectively during the wheat growing season 90 kg n ha 1 as the topdressing for each micro sprinkling irrigation scheduling urea as topdressing with 22 5 kg n ha 1 was completely dissolved in a fertilization device and applied together with the irrigation volume and 90 kg n ha 1 was spread over the fields of ti120 at jointing as described in li et al 2018 the specific irrigation regimes for each treatment are shown in table 2 the high yielding winter wheat cultivar jimai22 triticum aestivum l was used in the experiment which is one of the widely popularized and applied varieties in ncp the winter wheat was sown on october 14 2016 and october 22 2017 with 15 cm row spacing and harvested on june 10 2017 and june 7 2018 respectively 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water consumption and water use efficiency soil samples were measured from 20 cm increments to a depth of 200 cm soil layer i e 10 layers labeled from 1 to 10 by using a soil corer in each experimental plot measurements were made at pre sowing booting anthesis filling and maturity stages soil volumetric water content vswc was determined by the soil gravimetric water content gswc and bulk density ρ g cm 3 the gswc was measured by oven drying method li et al 2018 the stored soil water sw i mm in each layer was calculated by vswc and the soil layer depth d mm the calculated equations are as following vswc gswc ρ 100 s w i vsw c i d soil water consumption in each soil layer δsw i was calculated as the difference in the stored soil water sw i between pre sowing and maturity stages the total water consumption of soil δsw was calculated from the sum of the first soil layer δsw1 to the tenth layer δsw10 crop seasonal evapotranspiration et was calculated using the soil water balance equation xu et al 2018a et p i δsw r d cr where p mm is rainfall during the crop growing season i mm is irrigation volume δsw mm is water consumption in 2 m soil profile r is surface runoff d is downward flux below the wheat root zone and cr is capillary rise into the root zone due to the groundwater table at the experimental site is 7 9 m 4 m below the ground surface therefore cr was negligible in this study r and d can be ignored in the ncp including the experimental site gao et al 2017 water use efficiency wue kg m 3 was calculated by the following formula zhang et al 2018 wue gy et 2 3 2 chlorophyll content of flag leaf the flag leaf chlorophyll content was performed in twenty leaves samples that randomly collected in each plot at 5 day intervals starting 5 days after anthesis daa 5 until daa 30 the fresh flag leaves samples were stored at deep freezer with 20 c before the biochemical assays the chlorophyll content of flag leaf a b was extracted with 95 alcohol under the dark conditions and measured by a spectrophotometer li et al 2018 2 3 3 dry matter accumulation and grain yield in order to determine the dry matter accumulation two adjacent 0 5 m inner rows of all plants from each plot at ground level were sampled at anthesis and maturity respectively and all plant samples were oven dried at 75 c to a constant weight the dry matter accumulation after anthesis dmpa was measured by the difference between the dry matter accumulation at maturity and anthesis stage shi et al 2016 the contribution of dry matter production post anthesis to grain yield cr was calculated by the ratio of dry matter after anthesis to grain yield the harvest index hi is the ratio of grain weight to total dry matter accumulation at maturity about one week before the wheat harvest the spike number sn was determined by investigating randomly six adjacent 1 m inner rows of wheat in each plot as well as the grain number per spike gn was investigated by counting the all grains of each spike from 60 randomly selected plants in each plot at this time grain yield with 13 water content were determined by artificial threshing and weighing of randomly cutting ten adjacent two meters of wheat plants 3 m2 in each plot at maturity the thousand grain weight which water content is 13 was calculated by weighing 1 000 grains from the yield measurement samples and including three replications 2 3 4 root distribution root sampling was collected by using a root corer diameter 8 cm in each experimental plot at anthesis stage in both years with three replications at 0 2 m intervals down to a depth of 2 m and the roots of the row and it s adjacent inter rows of wheat plants as the total roots amount of each soil layer zhang et al 2006 sample of each soil layer was placed in a string mesh bag each bag sample was first washed away the soil with tap water and then all the roots were picked out manually images of the roots were obtained by using a special scanner for root system gt f5201 epson tokyo japan these root images were analyzed with winrhizo pro vision 2009c software regent instruments inc québec qc canada to calculate the root length density rld xu et al 2016 li et al 2018 2 4 data analysis the effects of micro sprinkling with different irrigation volume on winter wheat grain yield gn yield components water utilization and dry matter production were analyzed by analysis of variance using the glm procedure in spss ver 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa differences were judged by the least significant differences test using a 0 05 level of significance all figures were created by originpro 2016 originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 grain yield and yield components grain yield gy spike number sn grain number gn and 1000 grain weight tgw of winter wheat were significantly affected by year y and irrigation i and besides sn they were also significantly affected by y i table 3 compared with 2016 2017 the grain yield of winter wheat in 2017 2018 decreased significantly which was mainly due to the late sowing caused by rainfall pre sowing the fewer tillers caused by the lower temperature before winter eventually resulting in the lower spikes at maturity in addition the grain weight also decreased due to the excessive rainfall after anthesis and higher temperature during the grain filling stage fig 1 although grain number increased it is not enough to compensate for the negative effect of grain yield caused by the lower sn and twg in this year however the results of two years experiment were consistent among different treatments gy of mi120 and mi150 was significantly higher than that of ti120 but there was no significant difference between mi120 and mi150 this result showed that further increasing irrigation amount did not significantly increase gy of winter wheat when the irrigation amount was decreased by 25 mi90 the gy was similar to ti120 when the irrigation amount was decreased by 50 mi90 the gy was significantly lower than ti120 compared to ti120 mi120 and mi150 had no significant effect on sn and gn but significantly increased tgw and thus increased gy mi60 and mi90 had no significant effect on gn but significantly decreased sn and significantly increased tgw in mi90 the increase of tgw can compensate for the decrease in sn so the gy was similar to ti120 while in mi60 the increase of tgw can t compensate for the decrease in sn so the grain yield decreased 3 2 dry matter and flag leaf chlorophyll content 3 2 1 dry matter production and the harvest index year y irrigation i and their interaction y i all had

similar dmm dmpa and hi but the cr of mi90 was higher than ti120 the reduced irrigation amount by 50 treatment mi60 got lower dma dmm and dmpa compared to ti120 while the regularity of cr and hi was inconsistent between the two years overall compared with that traditional irrigation method ti120 the same mi120 or 75 mi90 micro sprinkling irrigation amount treatments decreased dry matter accumulation dm at anthesis but increased dm post anthesis and it s contribution to grain yield which ensured or increased the grain yield of winter wheat the 125 irrigation amount treatment mi150 can obtain the similar dma to ti120 however it had no yield advantage compared with mi120 treatment the 50 irrigation amount treatment mi60 decreased dma and dmpa leading to the decrease of grain yield 3 2 2 chlorophyll content of flag leaf the chlorophyll content of flag leaf after anthesis in winter wheat was measured every five days in 2016 2018 growing season the results showed that the chlorophyll content of flag leaf after anthesis 10 days daa 10 gradually decreased in all treatments and the content reached to the lowest at maturity however the difference in different treatments was significant fig 3 in 2016 2017 the decreased rate of chlorophyll content after daa 15 was significantly lower in mi90 mi120 and mi150 than in ti120 and mi60 and the senescence of flag in mi60 was the fastest in 2017 2018 during the middle late grain filling stage daa 15 to daa 25 the decreased rate of chlorophyll content was slower than in 2016 2017 which may be due to the more rainfall in 2017 2018 however the flag leaf chlorophyll from daa 25 to daa 30 was sharply declined in 2017 2018 and the reduced rate was higher than in 2016 2017 growing season in briefly compared with ti120 besides mi60 which was less irrigation micro sprinkling irrigation with water and fertilizer integration significantly delayed flag leaf senescence after daa 15 which was also the main reason for more dry matter production under the micro sprinkling irrigation conditions table 4 3 3 root system distribution 3 3 1 primary and secondary root number the number of primary and secondary root at anthesis stage was significantly higher in 2016 2017 than in 2017 2018 fig 4 which may be due to the lower temperature in winter and late sowing in 2017 2018 fig 1 and the number of spike at maturity was also significantly lower in 2017 2018 than in 2016 2017 table 3 there was no significant difference in the number of primary root at anthesis among all the treatments in the two years however the secondary root number was significantly affected by the irrigation in the two years the secondary root number of mi150 was significantly higher than that of ti120 2016 2017 or similar to ti120 2017 2018 while mi120 mi90 and mi60 had lower secondary root number than ti120 and mi60 had the lowest number of secondary root 3 3 2 root distribution as shown in fig 5 the root length density rld obviously declined with soil depth i e the upper soil layers had the higher rld and the lower rld occurred in deeper soil layers across the different treatments over the two growing seasons the main area of root distribution for the different treatments was in the 0 60 cm profile which accounted for 84 0 79 9 77 1 69 1 and 71 6 of total rld in ti120 mi150 mi120 mi90 and mi60 respectively and the rld in ti120 and mi150 was higher than other treatments while in 80 200 cm soil profile the percentage of rld was higher in mi60 28 4 mi90 30 9 and mi120 22 9 than in ti120 16 0 and mi150 20 1 in 2016 2017 wheat growing season in 2017 2018 the rld in 0 60 cm was significantly lower than in 2016 2017 which was mainly due to the fewer tillers of wheat in spring and lower spikes at anthesis in this year the percentage of root distribution of ti120 and mi150 in this profile was 77 2 and 77 1 and for mi60 mi90 and mi120 treatment was 68 7 71 8 and 73 8 respectively and micro sprinkling irrigation treatments except mi150 had significantly lower rld than ti120 in each soil layer and the rld significantly decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount of micro sprinkling below the 80 cm soil profile it was similar to the previous year compared to ti120 22 8 the percentage of root distribution of mi60 mi90 and mi120 significantly increased which was 29 1 28 0 and 28 9 respectively in brief the two year s experiment results showed that the main root distribution area was in the 0 60 cm profile and micro sprinkling with decreasing irrigation amount treatments promoted the root system growth to the deeper soil layer and increased the percentage of rld below 60 cm soil profile 3 4 water consumption 3 4 1 the variation of soil water content in the mainly roots zone as shown in fig 6 compared with the traditional irrigation mode ti120 the average soil volumetrci water content vswc in the mainly winter wheat root system distribution zone 0 60 cm fig 5 under micro sprinkling irrigation was relatively stable at the critical growth period of different treatments and the vswc of micro sprinkling irrigation increased with the increase of irrigation amount at the same growth stage there was also some difference in the soil moisture content between these two years in the mainly root system distribution zone in 2016 2017 at booting stage the vswc in the mainly root system distribution area of ti120 was significantly higher than that of micro sprinkling irrigation treatments it may be due to the fact that ti120 was carried out more irrigation 60 mm at jointing stage while micro sprinkling irrigation treatments were carried out a small amount of irrigation especially mi60 had the lowest vswc due to the least irrigation amount 15 mm at anthesis stage the vswc of mi150 mi120 and mi90 in the mainly root system distribution area was significantly higher than that of ti120 and mi60 which may be due to a certain amount of irrigation by micro sprinkling at booting stage while ti120 had no irrigation event occurred and mi60 also resulted in a lower soil moisture content due to the less irrigation at jointing and booting stage at filling stage in 0 60 cm soil profile the vswc of mi150 was the highest and there was no significant difference between mi120 and ti120 which were significantly higher than mi90 and mi60 and there was no significant difference between mi90 and mi60 at maturity stage the vswc of mi150 and mi120 in 0 60 cm soil layer was significantly higher than other treatments and there was no significant difference between mi90 and ti120 but mi60 was the lowest in 2017 2018 the soil moisture content in the mainly root system distribution area of all treatments increased significantly due to the large amount of rainfall after anthesis 130 mm however besides the filling stage in 2017 2018 the changing regularity of vswc in the same growth stage was basically consistent to 2016 2017 growing season overall from anthesis to maturity the soil moisture in the main winter wheat root system zone of ti120 changed dramatically while vswc of micro sprinkling irrigation treatments decreased slowly and remained relatively stable which maybe play an important role in maintaining the water supply in the upper soil profile consequently micro sprinkling with suitable irrigation amount at the key growth stage coordinated water supply in the mainly root system zone and the water demand for post anthesis material production which was conducive to promoting material production during grain filling and efficient use of irrigation water tables 4 and 5 3 4 2 seasonal evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue as shown in table 5 et δsw and wue were significantly affected by year y irrigation i and their interaction y i in 2016 2017 the et was obviously higher than that in 2017 2018 which was mainly due to the larger of population and less rainfall in this year which led to more soil water consumption in 2016 2017 there was no significant difference in et between ti120 and mi150 but they were higher than mi120 mi90 and mi60 and mi60 had the least et as for the δsw it significantly increased with the decrease of irrigation amount mi60 consumed the most soil water mi90 was significantly higher than ti120 mi120 and mi150 were significantly lower than ti120 as for water consumption of different soil layers fig 7 under the micro sprinkling irrigation condition it decreased with the increase of irrigation amount and there were some differences in different soil layers water consumption between 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 growing season because of the difference in weather conditions in 2016 2017 the soil water consumption in mi150 mi120 and mi90 besides 0 20 cm above 100 cm soil layer was significantly higher than that of ti120 at the same time mi120 and mi90 increased the water consumption in deep soil layers in 2017 2018 compared with ti120 mi150 significantly decreased the soil water consumption in different soil layers of 0 160 cm soil profile mi120 significantly increased the soil water consumption in 0 100 cm soil layers besides 20 40 cm and there was no significant difference below 100 cm between mi120 and ti120 mi90 significantly increased the soil water consumption in 0 160 cm soil layers beside 40 60 cm the water consumption of each soil layer in mi60 was higher than other treatments due to the least irrigation amount in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons the wue in 2016 2017 were significantly higher than that in 2017 2018 table 5 compared with ti120 wue of mi150 and mi120 significantly increased the wue of mi60 significantly decreased while mi90 had similar wue to ti120 in 2017 2018 the regularity of water consumption and wue was similar to 2016 2017 in summary compared with the traditional irrigation method ti120 mi120 and mi150 significantly increased wue the treatments of reduced 25 irrigation water mi90 and reducing 50 irrigation with micro sprinkling mi60 significantly decreased the seasonal evapotranspiration but significantly increased the δsw although the wue was not increased what s more micro sprinkling irrigation with equal or reducing irrigation amount could improve the utilization of deep soil water which may have an important role to ensure the higher crop yield in this study considering the output and water saving production mi90 was the best mode 4 discussion many researchers have reported that the use of advanced irrigation methods such as surface drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation or micro sprinkling hose irrigation combined with suitable irrigation scheduling can be effective strategies for water saving and high crop yield particularly in the areas of water scarcity metin sezen and yazar 2006 kang et al 2010 liu et al 2011 rao et al 2013 li et al 2019 what s more researches have showed that the cost of production is greatly reduced and the benefit is significantly improved by using micro sprinkling hose irrigation technology xing et al 2019 in this study compared with ti120 the same irrigation amount treatment under micro sprinkling mi120 significantly increased grain yield gy and water use efficiency wue tables 3 and 5 which was consistent with our previous study li et al 2018 the 125 irrigation amount treatment mi150 also significantly increased gy and wue however there was no significant difference in gy between mi150 and mi120 which showed that under micro sprinkling irrigation much more water can t further increase gy the 75 irrigation amount treatment mi90 obtained similar gy and wue to ti120 which has the important significance to protect groundwater resources while ensuring crop production in ncp the 50 irrigation amount treatment mi60 got lower gy and similar or lower wue to ti120 the gy decreased by 13 3 in 2016 2017 and 5 1 in 2017 2018 therefore we concluded that mi90 is water saving and stable production mode while mi120 is productive and effective mode in the ncp yield components determine wheat yield including spikes number grain number per spike and grain weight and they interact with each other the current approach to increase crop yield was mainly through increasing grain number or tgw and when the capacity of the sink is difficult to further improve tgw is the most importantly restrictive factor to affect the wheat yield chen et al 2013 liang et al 2017 grain weight is the last yield component to be formed and it is largely dependent on the rate and duration of the grain filling takai et al 2005 and simultaneously it is easily affected by the external environments such as air temperature precipitation soil moisture and fertilization etc yang et al 2006 shi et al 2017 yadav and ellis 2017 thapa et al 2018 this study showed that grain weight was significantly affected by year type y irrigation treatment i and the interaction between y and i y i table 3 it was significantly higher in the 2016 2017 growing season than in 2017 2018 and micro sprinkling treatments besides mi60 in 2017 2018 growing season were significantly higher than that of ti120 due to no significant difference in sn and gn among ti120 mi120 and mi150 the increase of tgw in micro sprinkling treatments was the main contributor for yield increase in mi90 the sn was significantly decreased but the significant increase of tgw made up for the negative effect of decrease in sn so the gy was comparable to ti120 in the two growing seasons in mi60 the greatly decrease of sn can t be compensated by the slightly increase in tgw which resulted in significant decrease in gy in these two growing seasons dry matter accumulation dm is closely related to grain yield formation and the dm of post anthesis is extremely vital for grain weight formation li et al 2019 therefore increasing dm post anthesis is an important means to increase grain yield shi et al 2016 some studies showed that ensuring the supply of water and fertilizer after anthesis has a great influence on improving dry matter production zhang et al 2016a lin and wang 2017 in the present study micro sprinkling irrigation treatments mi90 mi120 mi150 significantly increased dm post anthesis and it s contribution to grain as compared to ti120 table 4 which may be the major reason for the higher tgw and gy in these treatments however the significant decrease of gy in mi60 was due to insufficient dm not only at anthesis but also post anthesis dm was determined by leaf photosynthesis water deficit during grain filling could accelerate leaf senescence by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species singh et al 2012 while ensuring the supply of water and fertilizer during grain filling is beneficial to delay flag leaf senescence and increase yield and wue of winter wheat wang et al 2013a li et al 2018 in this study under the quota irrigation condition 120 mm or 150 mm the increase of irrigation frequency with micro sprinkling irrigation had no negative effect on sn and gn and the micro sprinkling with water and nitrogen fertilizer integration delayed the flag leaf senescence besides mi60 by supplying water and nitrogen during grain filling of wheat which was advantageous to improve post anthesis dm accumulation and increase grain weight finally increased grain yield compared to the traditional irrigation mode fig 3 table 4 however the late sowing caused by rainfall pre sowing as well as the low air temperature at winter resulted in the less tillers and less sn in 2017 2018 growing season fig 1 table 3 many researches showed that the higher temperature during grain filling stage and excessive soil moisture always led to the leaf premature senescence and decreased the grain weight therefore resulted in the decrease in crop yield wang et al 2013b a in the present study the excessive rainfall of 2017 2018 growing season after anthesis may affect the micro environment of the canopy lu et al 2015 mon et al 2016 led to the lower flag leaf chlorophyll content in the late grain filling stage 25 30 d fig 3 which decreased dm at maturity and finally resulted in lower grain yield than 2016 2017 growing season table 3 many researchers have reported that deficit irrigation could promote the absorption and utilization of soil moisture by crops wang et al 2015b shi et al 2016 xu et al 2018a 2018b and some studies showed that the large rainfall in summer could be stored in the deep soil profile which could be used for the growth of winter wheat in the spring therefore water saving and high yielding could be achieved by optimizing irrigation amount and irrigation period xu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2018a in the present study the micro irrigation treatments mi90 mi120 mi150 ensured the appropriate vswc at the critical growth periods in the mainly root system distribution zone such as booting to anthesis and filling to maturity stages fig 6 which synchronized the water demand for post anthesis material production and was beneficial to increase grain yield and water use efficiency many studies have shown that wue of crops can be increased by reducing et or increasing grain yield by using quota water igbadun et al 2007 li et al 2010 in this study mi120 and mi150 obtained the higher wue than ti120 due to the significant increase in gy and the et of mi120 was also significantly decreased mi90 significantly decreased et however it had similar wue to ti120 because of the slight decrease in gy tables 3 and 5 we also found that micro sprinkling treatments besides mi150 significantly promoted the utilization of water in the deep soil profile as compared to ti120 fig 7 and the less irrigation amount the more utilization of soil moisture table 5 in totally under the condition of micro sprinkling irrigation with water and fertilizer integration the use of deep soil moisture was significantly promoted through increasing the frequency of irrigation and reducing the irrigation amount of each time or reducing the total irrigation amount and the increase of the absorption and utilization of soil moisture in the deep soil profile in the reduced irrigation treatments may prevent fertilizer moving into the deeper soil profile and improve water and fertilizer use efficiency however although micro sprinkling irrigation with increasing irrigation frequency significantly improved grain yield and wue the fewer irrigation amount of micro sprinkling irrigation each time may lead to the increase in evaporation especially during the grain filling which needs to be further studied in the future root system plays an important role in plant soil ecosystem zhang et al 2009b the distribution of root system in soil profile is closely related to the absorption and utilization of soil moisture and nutrients and the soil water and fertilizer management also has an important effect on the distribution of root system wang et al 2015b feng et al 2017 studies have showed that the roots of winter wheat could be promoted to grow into the deep soil profile by reducing irrigation which is beneficial to increase the absorption and utilization of deep moisture and fertilizer finally significantly improve irrigation water production efficiency zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2016 and our previous study also showed that micro sprinkling irrigation with water and fertilizer integration increased the root system distribution of the deep soil profile and improved grain yield and resource use efficiency by co locating the roots and n fertilizer distribution of winter wheat li et al 2018 in this study compared with ti120 the root length distribution rld of micro sprinkling with reducing irrigation in the upper soil profile 0 60 cm decreased significantly while it was increased significantly below 80 cm and there was no significant difference in rld between the increased irrigation treatment mi150 and ti120 below 140 cm fig 4 in addition the number of secondary roots of ti120 and mi150 was significantly higher than other micro sprinkling treatments however there was no significant difference in primary roots number among all the treatments at anthesis fig 3 it s also consistent with the previous studies that is the deep roots mainly were primary roots and drought promoted the primary roots growth into the deep soil profile which was beneficial to the absorption and utilization of deep soil moisture xue et al 2010 in this study at jointing stage the one off irrigation and fertilization of ti120 may play an important role in the root system growth and development while the irrigation with micro sprinkling can t meet the growth requirement of winter wheat especially for mi60 treatment which promoted the root system growing into deep soil to absorb water so the rld was the highest for mi60 below 80 cm soil layer root system has the function of pumping and absorbing water and mineral nutrients in soil it can also be used as a sensor of drought stress and other comprehensive functions jha et al 2017 and studies have showed that moderate drought stress could promote the material transport from vegetative organs such as stems and leaves to grain and increase yield zhang et al 2016b in this study the lower moisture in the soil layers about 60 100 cm formed after jointing stage of winter wheat under micro sprinkling irrigation may induce roots to release some signaling substances accelerate grain filling and material transport and play an important role in the formation of higher grain weight this needs to be further studied 5 conclusion compared with the traditional irrigation mode ti120 under the equally total irrigation amount mi120 using micro sprinkling irrigation with increasing irrigation frequency can significantly improve the gy and wue of winter wheat further increasing the irrigation amount of micro sprinkling mi150 can t continue to increase grain yield and it significantly decreased the wue compared to mi120 reducing 25 irrigation amount treatment mi90 could achieve the similar gy and wue to ti120 reducing 50 irrigation amount treatment mi60 significantly decreased gy and wue compared to ti120 in this study mi150 mi120 and mi90 increased or ensured the gy and wue mainly due to the increase of irrigation frequency with micro sprinkling guaranteeing the soil water supply in mainly root system area at the critical growth stage and coordinating the relationship between matter production after anthesis and it s demand for water and mi120 and mi90 also improved the absorption and utilization of the deeper soil moisture overall micro sprinkling with suitable decrease in irrigation amount mi90 can ensure grain yield of winter wheat and realize the real water saving and the efficient use of irrigation water in the ncp
