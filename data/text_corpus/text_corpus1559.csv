7795,study region scandinavia norway and sweden study focus transborder cooperation and knowledge of transboundary aquifers tbas has evolved through an inventory under the convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes water convention from 1992 within eu countries the water framework directive wfd from 2000 intends to contribute to achieve the objectives of the water convention this study analyses the national groundwater management systems in norway and sweden and their implementation of the wfd emphasis has been placed on international river basin districts irbd and transborder cooperation the findings offer recommendations for authorities and policy makers on how they could improve the long term management and ensuring transparent decision making of transboundary groundwater management new hydrological insights for the region in norway and sweden tbas play a minor role in supplying freshwater resources and sustaining socio economic development in transborder areas the analysis shows that surface water overrules the invisible groundwater this study highlights several factors that need to be addressed first the norwegian national water management systems are fragmented and over complex which complicates national and transnational cooperation second swedish legislation must be revised to meet the requirements of the wfd regarding irbd delineation finally transborder dialogue and joint projects on groundwater mapping are necessary for mobilising resources and the necessary political support to obtain knowledge on tbas

water convention water framework directive transboundary cooperation scandinavia governance data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction insufficient and fragmented management of tbas might affect sustainable development both within and beyond a country s borders there are several examples worldwide of disagreements over whether a certain infrastructure scheme planned by one riparian country would have negative impacts on a riparian state examples of such conflicts include the dispute between mekong riparian states over laos mainstream hydropower dams soukhaphon et al 2021 the conflict between ethiopia and egypt over the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd pemunta et al 2021 and the conflict between tajikistan and downstream uzbekistan over the rogun dam on the vakhsh river a tributary of the amu darya jalilov et al 2011 tanrisever and sakal 2022 early in the 20th century sweden and norway recognised that transboundary water cooperation fosters peace and development by generating economic social environmental and political benefits which in long time would foster development and stabilise these societies a treaty might also prevent conflicts and consolidating peace in post conflict situations as a result only 15 years after the end of the swedish norwegian union in 1905 a treaty on transborder waters was signed kld 1929 this act covers construction work or other interventions in watercourses in norway or sweden which are of such extent that they causes a noticeable change in watercourses within the other kingdom with regard to depth direction water level or amount of water or causes obstruction to the passage of fish which damage fishing within the neighbouring kingdom the treaty was particularly important at that time due to the increased development of hydropower but also for fisheries and tourism the transborder rivers were also important for transport of timer by floating logging international frameworks include all waters however surface water gets most of the attention while groundwater seems in many countries to be more or less invisible https www fao org fao stories article en c 1479581 this is a paradox as groundwater accounts for more than 90 of global freshwater resources this also applies in a high degree to norway and to a lesser extent sweden although norway has 1400 groundwater bodies gwbs few are mapped the lack of knowledge is illustrated by the missing results of the assessment of groundwater state in the norwegian national water databases low national attention to groundwater probably affects sustainable and effective cooperation on transborder gwbs the importance of transboundary waters was in a larger scale initially recognised under the convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes unece 1992 2013a the so called water convention have many similarities with the treaty between norway and sweden however it provides a more comprehensive intergovernmental platform for the day to day development and advancement of transboundary cooperation the water convention provides a legal and institutional framework and covers both groundwaters and surface waters it is applied across europe and in 2016 it was opened for accession to all un member states the secretariat of the water convention is hosted by the united nations economic commission for europe unece under the reporting of the sustainable development goals sdg indicator 6 5 2 on transboundary water cooperation for which the unece and the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco function as co custodians parties get a detailed insight into the status of their cooperation and what needs to be done to achieve target sdg 6 5 unece 2018 the implementation of the convention involves three main steps first the parties must enact laws and regulations and enter or adapt bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements second the parties must adopt sufficient administrative measures third the parties must ensure that sufficient human financial and technical resources are available for the implementation unece 2013b the obligations under the convention include prevention control and reduction of significant transboundary impacts and improving water resource management at the national level reporting under the convention was introduced in 2015 and the first reporting cycle was held in 2017 2018 unece 2018 the european parliament launched a framework for the community action in the field of water policy or in short the eu water framework directive wfd in 2000 directive 2000 60 ec the wfd addresses all waters to be characterised according to their biological chemical and hydromorphological characteristics in eu countries the wfd is also intended to contribute to achieving the objectives of the water convention given the wide scope of the directive there are several interactions with other horizontal and vertical regulations e g the ec nitrates directive the ec habitats directive and the ec groundwater directive thereby making implementation complex fulfilling the wfd the groundwater directive requires that e g groundwater threshold values quality standards are established this requires a high level of cooperation between countries to ensure that threshold values will be set in a consistent and comparable manner throughout the eu and in agreement with non eu neighbouring countries the wfd has also been adopted by countries such as norway associated to the european economic area eea and the european free trade association efta non eu members countries such as armenia azerbaijan belarus georgia moldova and ukraine are implementing the wfd through the european union water initiative plus euwi several studies on the national implementation of the wfd have been published iital et al 2008 hammer et al 2011 nielsen et al 2013 hovik and hanssen 2016 hanssen et al 2016 yara et al 2018 in addition to transnational comparisons of e g geographical conditions as well as political and institutional experiences with the wfd rautio et al 2006 halleraker et al 2013 jager et al 2016 rimmert et al 2020 a literature synthesis of 89 journal articles studying the implementation of the wfd in europe was done by boeuf and fritsch 2016 one of their conclusions was that cross country comparisons are in the minority and that future research would benefit from a departure from single country studies studies of transborder water cooperation are mainly based on the reporting of the sdg indicator 6 5 2 https unece org national country reports sdg indicator 652 accessed 30 march 2022 and the wfd lipponen and chilton 2018 mccracken and meyer 2018 szocs et al 2018 rieu clarke et al 2022 these studies indicate that both the water convention and the wfd seem to increase in importance of establishing cooperation management systems for transborder waters in europe this paper examines the implementation practices of the wfd in norway and sweden with focus on irbd and transborder cooperation on gwbs we are addressing the reason for insufficient or fragmented management of tbas and if this affects sustainable development to understand the present situation national and transborder geological conditions and geographically parameters are analysed giving a status of the importance of groundwater resources for humans ecology and economy in addition the effects on transborder groundwater management and cooperation due to differences in existing legal regimes are addressed the present study is framed in the context of the necessity of enlighten the reasons for low political attention and funding of mapping tbas a review of national legislation implementation of the wfd and transnational agreements and treaties is carried out to evaluate the functionality of the water management systems national legislation and features of water cooperation through river basins and river basin districts are studied evaluation of the degree of transnational cooperation on tbas is mainly based on the reporting of the wfd requirements to the european environmental agency and the european union database wise https water europa eu in addition to reporting of the sdg indicator 6 5 2 on transboundary water cooperation to unece https unece org national country reports sdg indicator 652 accessed 30 march 2022 key prospective transboundary groundwater concerns and recommendations for fulfilling of the objectives of the water convention and the wfd are given 2 study area 2 1 geological and geographical description norway and sweden have the longest joint national border between two countries in europe the border which to a large degree follows watershed divides is over 1630 km and has largely been unchanged for several centuries fig 1 both sweden and norway are part of the fennoscandian shield an area of old crystalline and metamorphic rocks common rocks are gneiss granite granodiorite sandstone and marble most of which are very compact with few fractures and low values of hydraulic conductivity resulting in generally low groundwater well yields nevertheless fractured aquifers in crystalline hard rocks are the most common type of aquifer in both countries knutsson 2008 the landscape of scandinavia and the unconsolidated overburden are to a large extent formed by numerous glaciations and deglaciations during the quaternary time period moving glaciers scoured off younger sedimentary rocks and deep weathered bedrock fredin et al 2013 ice marginal deposits as well as fluvial and glaciofluvial deposits such as eskers glaciofluvial deltas and alluvial plains are the most important and productive aquifers in norway knutsson 2008 isostatic rebound after deglaciation raised areas holding fine grained marine sediments above the current sea level fredin et al 2013 these marine sediments have very poor hydraulic conductivity however below the marine sediments useful productive aquifers may be found tassis et al 2016 as a result of the geological formations the number of aquifers in unconsolidated quaternary deposits in norway and sweden is large many thousands the exact number in not known as many of them are very small and most aquifers have never been mapped quaternary geology maps have been used to delineate aquifer outlines digitally the resulting polygons are grouped and simplified as gwbs for administrative purposes sweden has reported approximately 3000 gwbs to the european union database wise while norway has reported about 1400 gwbs as most rock types in norway and sweden are very compact and have generally poor water bearing capacity aquifers in crystalline bedrock play a minor role for water supply however for many households in rural areas in both sweden and norway local groundwater wells drilled in bedrock are a good and often the only alternative for drinking water supply accordingly groundwater wells in bedrock are far more common than water wells drilled in porous aquifers in unconsolidated quaternary deposits nevertheless only two aquifers in crystalline bedrock are characterised in norway and a few more in sweden according to the norwegian groundwater database for drilled wells granada geological survey of norway 2021 95 of all registered water wells are established in crystalline bedrock inland aquifers are mainly unconfined and therefore vulnerable to pollution but they are generally without significant anthropogenic influence kløve et al 2017 aquifers in both norway and sweden range from unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits to karst and fracture aquifers in crystalline rocks due to large variations in settlement patterns climate as well as hydrogeological conditions and water quality of surface waters the usage of groundwater as drinking water source varies considerably between as well as within the countries in norway approximately 15 of domestic water supply is groundwater while in sweden about 60 of the population uses groundwater as their main water supply kvitsand and fiksdal 2010 transboundary gwbs between norway and sweden are compared to other parts of europe scarce and small bgr and unesco 2019 only seven transborder gwbs have been identified table 1 the delineation of the transborder gwbs polygon was not harmonised across the border for any of these in the reporting to wise in 2016 this was to some extent improved in the 2022 reporting in which two of seven polygons were harmonised table 1 the most important transboundary gwbs belong to the drainage basin skagerrak and kattegat västerhavet fig 1 the respective aquifers are made up of fluvial and glaciofluvial deposits as large parts of the gwbs are situated in uninhabited forests there are few stressors towards groundwater chemistry an overview of the area is given in the attached google earth file however in some areas extensive forestry might have an effect not only on the surface water but also on groundwater quality futter et al 2011 in sweden all major transboundary gwbs are mapped and classified as having good quantitative and qualitative status the largest registered transboundary groundwater body is crossing the national border between magnor norway and charlottenberg sweden with an approximate area of 40 km2 this is the only transborder groundwater body that has been geophysically mapped by geo radar in norway fig 1 upper left small figure 2 2 national legislation and bilateral agreements the swedish norwegian union ended in a peaceful dissolution in 1905 however the swedish authorities had the power to claim some norwegian concessions in return for their cooperation one of the swedish claims was that the two countries should abstain from future regulation of any of their common watercourses if such regulations were not accepted beforehand by the neighbouring state the main reason for the swedish demand was the crucial importance of the river klar river trysil that represented substantial swedish commercial interests the need for securing norwegian guarantees against harming these interests grew out of the topography along the river the economical and geographical environment from the river s sources and to its outlet and the fact that sweden was a downstream party in this river system the historical context behind the convention between norway and sweden on watercourse rights first sign in 1905 is well described by berg and jakobsson 2006 in 1929 the 1905 convention was supplemented with an agreement on formal procedures for the regulation of watercourses that have an impact on the neighbouring country the convention between norway and sweden on certain questions relating to the law on watercourses kld 1929 is the oldest convention on watercourses still valid in europe the agreement might be the reason why norway and sweden have avoided upstream downstream conflicts which characterise many water interest conflicts both in national and in international politics despite the extensive hydropower developments during the first decade of the twentieth century jakobsson 2002 berg 2009 sovacool and walter 2019 gives an overview of several historical examples of international hydropower conflicts well known examples of upstream downstream conflicts are also the disagreement between india and pakistan over a dam on the kishanganga river munir et al 2021 and the turkey syria and iraq conflict over the euphrates tigris el fadel et al 2002 kibaroglu and sayan 2021 the historical relationship between water scarcity and interstate conflict between upstream and downstream riparian countries might also relate to the country s relative military power yousef 2021 as an eu member state sweden started to implement the wfd in 2000 before the wfd the 290 municipalities played a key role in swedish water management through their responsibility for land and water resource planning the 21 county boards act as regional supervisory authorities linked to the national government implementing the wfd sweden introduced a new regional level for water management by establishing a water authority as the competent authority in each of the five new defined water districts vattendistrikt franzen et al 2015 the water districts comprise the swedish rbd areas that are parts of the swedish land area sfs 2004 including the swedish parts of irbd shared with norway fig 1 the swedish agency for marine and water management swam supports the water authorities through guidance and issues binding rules so called regulations for how the work is to be carried out the geological survey of sweden sgu is the guiding and prescribing authority for groundwater the five water authorities are responsible for developing the river basin management plans rbmps and programmes of measures poms these documents define legally binding environmental quality objectives the municipalities develop land and water plans according to these objectives sfs 2004 the wfd was incorporated into the agreement on the european economic area eea by joint commission decision no 125 2007 of 28 september 2007 however the formal incorporation was delayed until 2009 due to iceland s negotiations with the european commission on special adaptations to the directive entson and gipperth 2010 anon 2013 despite these negotiations the wfd was transposed into the norwegian regulation by a framework for water management in 2007 usually referred to as vannforskriften or the water regulation kld 2006 the same year norway also prepared and uploaded data to the eea central data repository according to the wfd article 3 establishment of rbds irbds and competent authorities then in 2009 data fulfilling the wfd article 5 characterisation of the waterbodies was delivered in addition to uploading data norway voluntarily prepared rbmps in selected rbds across the country from 2007 to 2009 as a pilot activity thus gaining experience in rbm planning rbmps for the selected rbds were adopted by the county councils in 2009 and approved by the national government in june 2010 rbmps covering the entire country were prepared from 2010 to 2015 for 13 of the rbds reported on article 3 in 2007 of these only two separate plans were made for the irbds with runoff across the national border the other five irdbs belonging to finland and or sweden were in varying degree integrated in the national rbmps this reporting was synchronised with the time schedule of the second cycle of implementation for the eu countries due 22 march 2016 norway implemented a regional administrative reform that came into effect on january 1 2020 this reform led to a reduction of rbds to 16 fig 1 which are administered by nine competent authorities in each rbd broad multi level and cross sector networks comprised of all relevant public authorities are established in order to formulate a joint rbmp the wfd ecosystem based network structure is introduced as a secondary structure added to the primary hierarchical structure based on the sectoral principle e g hovik 2019 the water regulation kld 2006 is founded on the pollution control act the planning and building act and the water resources act the norwegian ministry of climate and environment kld is the central competent authority under the wfd and is responsible for water quality and biodiversity the national authority for the implementation of the wfd is the norwegian environment agency nea the ministry of petroleum and energy is responsible for the water resources act the general management of watercourses and the quantitative usage of water drinking water management is the responsibility of the ministry of health regional water management plans are adopted as a regional plan according to the planning and building act 8 4 with the special rules that follow from the water regulation the rbds and irbds are subdivided into 107 water areas wherein the municipalities cooperate to solve water issues in shared watercourses and coastal areas the most relevant ministries and governmental agencies cooperate in guiding regional authorities in their work under the wfd the historical implementation of the wfd in norway and sweden is well described by halleraker et al 2013 the 2018 report to unece on sdg indicator 6 5 2 states that transboundary issues between sweden and norway are handled in accordance with the convention between norway and sweden on certain questions relating to the law on watercourses kld 1929 the water convention unece 1992 an informal memorandum of understanding mou from 2008 and an informal strategy for international cooperation on transboundary waters formulated in 2013 unece 2018 the informal strategy document prepared for the management of norwegian swedish transborder watercourses describes how the countries are to cooperate on the coordination of shared water bodies monitoring and classification of ecological chemical and quantitative status nea and swam 2013 it also describes how the coordination of the work with management plans environmental goals and action programs is to take place the strategy documents were based on the informal mou from 2008 it follows from article 3 of the wfd that a catchment area extending into the territory of another country shall be defined as an irbd swedish legislation only relates to the five water districts established which define the watershed divide to run along the country s border with norway in the description of the rbds they are all described as fully draining towards the baltic sea including the parts which drain into norway sfs 2004 the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve and the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi have harmonised the polygons of water catchments lake waterbodies and river waterbodies along the border according to the wfd despite this sweden has not made separate irbmps for the norwegian irbds these areas are only described as part of chapters in the swedish rbd plans https ec europa eu environment water water framework impl reports htm accessed 10 may 2022 in 2018 swam and nea signed an agreement on cooperation on water management in accordance with the wfd nea 2018 the purpose of the collaboration was to create common preconditions and principles mutual understanding and to utilise synergies in the work of the two authorities the collaboration creates arenas for joint development of methods tools and guidance as well as opportunities to share resources models reference stations and data for the years 2019 2021 the collaboration was focused on sustainable hydropower and hydromorphology environmental monitoring and mapping and other ongoing cooperation such as liming of acidified watercourses and cooperation on border crossing precipitation fields the new plan covering the period 2021 2027 continues to focus on physical impacts such as acidification liming and over fertilisation to assess ecological condition and chemical status in addition research development and management in cross border catchment areas should be coordinated in view of a changing climate nea 2021a groundwater is not mentioned in any of the two cooperation agreements 3 analysis of transborder cooperation sweden and norway have both reported under the water convention and on the global sdg indicator 6 5 2 to unece https unece org national country reports sdg indicator 652 accessed 20 may 2022 from the first to the second reporting sweden has provided more total area estimates of their aquifers unece 2021 the unece report on sdg 6 target 5 also states that sweden and norway have undertaken steps to further improve their transboundary water cooperation following the first reporting exercise in 2017 2018 unece 2021 this statement refers to the agreement between nea and swam regarding cooperation on water management according to the eu wfd nea 2021a the ministry of climate and environment kld has instructed nea who are responsible for the implementation of the wfd in norway not to prioritise groundwater in the period 2021 2027 kld 2021 nea 2021b in sweden the responsibility for groundwater is delegated to sgu since sgu is not a part of the agreement the cooperation agreement between nea and swam is only related to surface water nea 2021a in the first and the second reporting round under the water convention for the global sdg indicator 6 5 2 to unece both norway and sweden state that an mou was established between the two countries in 2008 describing the implementation of the wfd by the countries however the document referred to is not an mou in the sense of a treaty as it might sound like in the reporting but a meeting minutes nea 2022 in norway neither the minutes nor the strategy agreement built on the minutes are files registered in governmental journals the documents are only available upon request to nea in sweden the strategy document is available through the water information system viss under case number 537 5712 2011 therefore norway and sweden have not entered into any formal permanent cooperative agreement under the water convention for any of its cross border bodies of water with the exception of the watercourse law from 1929 kld 1929 nor established any joint decision making bodies for these however both nations states that a result of the implementation of the wfd is a closer and more formalised cooperation at the local regional and the national level it is also claimed that this will lead to better management of transboundary waters as they are viewed more holistically and in a set of system framework that the countries follow https unece org national country reports sdg indicator 652 despite this the commissions assessment of the swedish rbmp for the 3rd wfd implementation report states that sweden needs to ensure full cooperation with neighbouring countries including the correct designation of transboundary river basin districts and cooperation on measures to ensure achievement of the environmental objectives ec 2012 norway and sweden have chosen a regional approach with weak central coordination requiring a greater effort to coordinate among the rbd authorities to ensure similar conditions across the districts several publications describe this highly fragmented and complex water governance system in both countries e g nielsen et al 2013 jager et al 2016 solli 2020 the need for consistent water management was one of the reasons for the establishment of a new national authority in sweden in 2011 swam nielsen et al 2013 jager et al 2016 management plans for the norwegian parts of the swedish irbd skagerrak and kattegat västerhavet gulf of bothnian bottenviken and bothnian sea bottenhavet fig 1 have been through consultation procedures in sweden and are available at neas information site vannportalen https www vannportalen no in addition these plans are available in the swedish rbmp at the swams home page https www vattenmyndigheterna se sweden has as mentioned chosen to define the watershed divide to run along the country border and in the description of the rbds they all drain towards the baltic sea sfs 2004 as a result sweden is not developing rbmps for the swedish parts of the norwegian irbds swam 2021 in addition this causes a lack of harmonisation of the irbd id coding table 1 in the 2016 reporting to wise the swedish coding of river basins that drain to norway was correct groundwater body no 123 392 g was assigned to se1102 which are parts of the troendelag irbd that drains from sweden to norway after the norwegian regional administrative reform in 2020 this groundwater body should be assigned to se1107 in the present reporting to wise 2022 sweden does not separate between gwbs draining to norway or to sweden and have replaced se1102 with the code se2 int which is the swedish river basin draining towards the east table 1 this procedure is not in accordance with paragraph 11 in the wfd which states that each member state shall ensure the establishment of a pom for each rbd or for the part of an irbd within its territory sweden s choice not to delineate river basins draining toward norway is a step backwards regarding transborder cooperation the strategy document nea and swam 2013 shows that there is an awareness on the mismatch in the norwegian and the swedish definitions of the rbd as it states that a prerequisite for the strategy proposed to be implemented is that the swedish regulations are changed so that the swedish water districts have boundaries that correspond to the norwegian rbd this awareness might come from the above statement from the commissions assessment of the swedish river basin management plans for the 3rd wfd ec 2012 the above analysis shows that norway and sweden do not cooperate to an extent that ensures a system or framework that enables the countries to monitor classify and ensure good ecological status in all transnational waters in a holistic manner both national and transnational cooperation appears to be dependent on individual persons initiatives additionally important agreements and instructions from the ministry are not archived in a traceable manner impeding involvement of stakeholders outside public administration such as environmental organisations thus sweden and norway are neither fulfilling the water conventions provisions nor the wfd this has been acknowledged by the norwegian authorities and kld has taken the initiative to evaluate the possibility of instituting an agreement that covers administrative and cooperation principles for all cross border waterbodies between norway and sweden following the same principles as the swedish finish agreement gränsälvsoverenskommelse sfs 2010 and or the finnish russian agreement administered by the finnish russian joint commission on the utilisation of frontier waters https rajavesistokomissio fi en agreement accessed 5 may 2022 on transboundary waters kld 2020 the response from nea to this initiative after discussions with swam was that such arrangement would cause too much bureaucracy and formalities and it would not be very flexible nea recommends that the cooperation continue as is but that a small working group should be established to update transborder water strategies between norway and sweden nea 2021c the working group suggested consist of swam nea the norwegian river basin districts authorities and the swedish water authorities again groundwater seems to be ignored or given less attention as sgu is not a part of the suggested working group the main possible reason for the low attention given to groundwater at the norwegian swedish country border area is probably that the authorities have not seen any public utility of groundwater in these areas groundwater use within norway is currently limited due to the country s abundant surface water resources with the majority of the area supplied with drinking water by piped network coverage groundwater abstraction is often limited to private borehole supplies the same applies to sweden even though to a lesser extent the geology at the norwegian swedish border causing many small aquifers with low water well yield also contributes to the absence of interest in using groundwater for water supply the population along the 1630 km long norwegian swedish border is also low on both sides on average less than 1 5 inhabitants per km2 grunfelder et al 2018 groundwater is however not only important for water supply to private households groundwater has large influence on surface water temperature chemistry and water level and can act both as a medium for the propagation of stressors to surface water and as a buffer of stressors in time and space it is thus important to map and monitor groundwater quantity and quality groundwater surface water interaction has also received increased focus in e g in africa due to its importance to ecologic systems and sustainability levy and xu 2012 the importance of the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater surface water interactions in rivers for e g juvenile salmonid and trout habitats has been demonstrated in several studies worldwide brabrand et al 2002 olsen and young 2009 saltveit and brabrand 2013 casas mulet et al 2015 larsen and woelfle erskine 2018 campbell et al 2020 carlson et al 2020 4 discussion 4 1 moving forward with transboundary aquifer management norway an efta country and sweden an eu member country have both implemented the eu wfd which is also intended to fulfil the objectives of the water convention the two regulations emphasise that nations must ensure reasonable and impartial use of resources ecologically reliable water management conservation of resources and environmental protection including restoration of ecosystems where necessary the concept of ecological status is not used for groundwater however the groundwater qualitative and quantitative conditions can through water exchange between groundwater and surface water sources have an important effect on the ecological condition of the surface water saether and de cariat 1997 groundwater can therefore play a vital role in the ecological assessment of water bodies and as a source for drinking and industry water and geothermal energy sweden is ahead of norway in the implementation of wfd as the efta countries are one reporting cycle behind eu countries in sweden all major transboundary gwbs are mapped and classified as having good quantitative and qualitative status https viss lansstyrelsen se sweden has also updated the delineation of their groundwater bodies but this has not been followed up by norway https www vann nett no portal the lack of harmonisation of the polygons showing transborder gwbs becomes very visible when displaying the swedish and the norwegian gwb data together https www vann nett no portal in the maps some gwbs are only registered in one country and do not continue on the other side of the border table 1 this is probably due to poor mapping but might also be due to geological and hydrological conditions quaternary geology maps have been used to delineate aquifer outlines digitally the resulting polygons have been merged and simplified as gwbs for administrative purposes scotland with similar quaternary geology to norway and sweden has chosen a different approach where both bedrock and sedimentary groundwater are delineated as waterbodies https www sepa org uk data visualisation water environment hub accessed 30 may 2022 these are divided into horizons as the wfd asks for poland the czech republic slovakia and other countries in the eu have also followed this approach černák and michalko 2005 velstra 2005 this could be a methodology in a future gwb delineation also for norway and sweden the risk assessment component of gwb characterisation following the dpsir principle drivers d pressures p status s impacts i and responses r involves both an assessment of the likelihood that certain pressures will adversely affect the underlying gwb or downstream receptors to the extent that the gwb will fail to be characterised as having a good quantitative or chemical status ec 2008 by following the scottish approach of building the risk assessment on a hazard pathway receptor model o dochartaigh et al 2005 only those aquifers classified as vulnerable towards stressors have to be monitored sweden has followed such model in their classification of chemical status of gwbs along the norwegian border if no stressors are identified a good chemical quality is given in the description of the gwb in the swedish groundwater database viss https viss lansstyrelsen se in factsheets for each groundwater body the classification status risk assessments and sources of influence and measures are given in addition to a reliability rate this feature has not yet been included in the norwegian groundwater database vann nett https vann nett no portal accessed 10 june 2022 the 1630 km long swedish norwegian frontier is dominated by national parks with 1 5 inhabitants per km2 and no polluting industries thus the gwbs are assumed to have a good chemical status and the norwegian authorities therefore might not be motivated to spend resources on groundwater monitoring in these areas if norway follows the same model as sweden in classifying their gwbs either as in good or poor condition the costs should be moderate as stated above neither norway nor sweden currently meet the requirements of the wfd in relation to groundwater groundwater has often been described as an invisible resource but it is important to recognise that even in norway and sweden the use of and the stressors towards groundwater resources are increasing integrated water resource management acknowledges the important role of groundwater within frameworks that can be overly surface water focused to be able to implement a holistic water management the very fragmented organisation of water governance systems particularly in norway but also in sweden has to be changed e g stokke and indset 2012 hovik 2019 solli 2020 in norway as described previously the responsibility for regulating and guiding activities such as the production of hydropower pollution from agriculture industry fish farming households and climate change is divided between different levels of government state counties municipalities and different ministries and directorates at the national level one of the aims of the wfd was to change the fragmented governing of water to a more holistic one but this has not happened in norway to be able to reach the wfd goals a less fragmented governance system must be put into place in addition to changes in national governance systems a binding agreement between sweden and norway such as the gränsälv agreement between sweden and finland sfs 2010 with the associated establishment of finnish swedish border river commission should be set up within swedish and norwegian law the finnish swedish agreement lays down principles for the management of all waterbodies in defined border areas between sweden and finland and the border river commission is responsible for facilitating and developing cooperation on all these transboundary waterbodies there are eight irbds shared between norway and sweden a joint body that coordinates and overlooks the management of these in line with such agreement should be established an agreement can also incorporate obligations both countries have not only under the water convention but also under other agreements such as the wfd to avoid double regulation of the irbds 4 2 key prospective transboundary groundwater concerns and recommendations the wfd sets high expectations for water quality across the eu as well as towards eea efta countries and euwi countries ambitious procedure prescriptions specifically regarding rbm both nationally and internationally are requested the wfd is also intended to contribute to fulfilling the objectives of the water convention which address all transborder waters although a large set of international frameworks are developed even a groundwater directive 2006 118 ec in response to the requirements of article 17 of the wfd groundwater still seems invisible in many regions requiring transborder cooperation this applies even if the countries have implemented the regulations into national legislation most existing agreements do not explicitly refer to groundwater or their application to groundwater remains limited the responsibility for mapping characterisation and monitoring groundwater often lies with the national geological survey the responsibility for groundwater quality and quantity might also be divided between national agencies such as in norway where the responsibility is split between nea nve and ngu regulatory responsibility for water management might be situated elsewhere in government this fragmented organisation applies particularly to countries where water supply is to a large extent based on surface water as in norway and large parts of sweden for these countries there is an urgent need to improve legal frameworks for cooperation and strengthen institutions for the management of groundwater norway and sweden have chosen a decentralised approach for the implementation of the wfd with regional main rbd authorities a centralised model may make transboundary cooperation easier as less players are involved the large number of institutions that need to be coordinated in the management of transboundary waters between norway and sweden has been identified as a major obstacle in fulfilling the objectives of the wfd and the water convention at the same time it is important that regional and local stakeholders have ownership in the decision process surface water has got and gets much more attention than groundwater an obvious reason for this is that surface water is visible and if not in good ecological status it is very often easily observed by the public in contrast to low quality groundwater mapping gwbs is more expensive than mapping surface water as drilling is required to obtain 3d hydrological conceptual models in addition multi disciplinary cooperation is required between hydrologist hydrogeologists geologist and not least geophysics the institutions responsible for groundwater mapping and monitoring might not be equipped to perform the necessary research work and do not have the economy or intent to hire necessary experts from the information analysed above it is not the countries affiliation to the eu its historical political regime or its geological conditions that decide whether the transborder cooperation on groundwater is well developed or not it is instead directed by the governments recognition of the importance of groundwater economic priorities and by international political pressure for fulfilment of international agreements and directives such as the wfd and the water convention this was also one of rieu clarke s conclusions after the initial reporting exercise to the sdg took place in 2017 and 2018 rieu clarke 2020 the lack of clean safe water and sustainable use of water is recognised as an increasing threat to humans welfare and development this study concludes that international regulations and agreements are important foundations for establishing national and transborder water management systems and cooperation however legislation and agreements are not enough in themselves they have to be followed up by status reporting and feedback the national reporting of sdg indicator 6 5 2 to unece in addition to the reporting to wise hopefully provides a step towards obtaining the necessary political attention to extend both knowledge and coverage of cooperation arrangements on transboundary waters 5 conclusions analysis of the reporting to unece on the sdg indicator 6 5 2 on transboundary water cooperation by norway and sweden reveals that none of the three main implementation steps are yet completed the necessary laws and regulations in addition to bilateral arrangements between the states are not yet satisfactory governmental resources give priority to surface water whereas groundwater is mainly forgotten or neglected seven transborder gwbs are registered of these only two are harmonised by coding and polygons in the reporting to wise there is a need to establish transnational joint projects for increasing the knowledge of transborder groundwater between norway and sweden to fulfil the obligations given by international legislation the analysis of geography geology politics and legislation shows that there appears to be several reasons for the low attention on groundwater resources e g 1 the transborder gwbs are situated in uninhabited forests or national parks with few identified stressors to groundwater chemistry 2 national legislation is to some degree an obstacle for cooperation 3 the water policy is particular in norway fragmented and little transparent and 4 there is in both countries a very low political attention to groundwater even though there is an increasing use of groundwater as a heat source to overcome the identified obstacles defined lines of responsibility for mapping and monitoring groundwater should be established in norway additionally swedish legislation has to be changed to meet paragraph 11 of the wfd and delineate river basin boundaries for the irbd shard with norway a more holistic approach for cooperation on transborder waters not only groundwater but all waters would be easier to obtain through a binding agreement between sweden and norway and the establishment of a border river commission this first in depth analysis of norwegian and swedish transborder cooperation on groundwater clearly displays the importance of international pressure applied through national reporting to unece and wise the reports and feedback are important tools in the process of moving forward to a more sustainable management of transborder aquifers as it makes the nations need for improved cooperation perceptible even though the importance of transboundary waters was recognised under the convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes already in 1992 there is still a way to go before the treaty s objectives are obtained the wfd established by the european parliament in 2000 has improved not only national but also

7795,study region scandinavia norway and sweden study focus transborder cooperation and knowledge of transboundary aquifers tbas has evolved through an inventory under the convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes water convention from 1992 within eu countries the water framework directive wfd from 2000 intends to contribute to achieve the objectives of the water convention this study analyses the national groundwater management systems in norway and sweden and their implementation of the wfd emphasis has been placed on international river basin districts irbd and transborder cooperation the findings offer recommendations for authorities and policy makers on how they could improve the long term management and ensuring transparent decision making of transboundary groundwater management new hydrological insights for the region in norway and sweden tbas play a minor role in supplying freshwater resources and sustaining socio economic development in transborder areas the analysis shows that surface water overrules the invisible groundwater this study highlights several factors that need to be addressed first the norwegian national water management systems are fragmented and over complex which complicates national and transnational cooperation second swedish legislation must be revised to meet the requirements of the wfd regarding irbd delineation finally transborder dialogue and joint projects on groundwater mapping are necessary for mobilising resources and the necessary political support to obtain knowledge on tbas

water convention water framework directive transboundary cooperation scandinavia governance data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction insufficient and fragmented management of tbas might affect sustainable development both within and beyond a country s borders there are several examples worldwide of disagreements over whether a certain infrastructure scheme planned by one riparian country would have negative impacts on a riparian state examples of such conflicts include the dispute between mekong riparian states over laos mainstream hydropower dams soukhaphon et al 2021 the conflict between ethiopia and egypt over the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd pemunta et al 2021 and the conflict between tajikistan and downstream uzbekistan over the rogun dam on the vakhsh river a tributary of the amu darya jalilov et al 2011 tanrisever and sakal 2022 early in the 20th century sweden and norway recognised that transboundary water cooperation fosters peace and development by generating economic social environmental and political benefits which in long time would foster development and stabilise these societies a treaty might also prevent conflicts and consolidating peace in post conflict situations as a result only 15 years after the end of the swedish norwegian union in 1905 a treaty on transborder waters was signed kld 1929 this act covers construction work or other interventions in watercourses in norway or sweden which are of such extent that they causes a noticeable change in watercourses within the other kingdom with regard to depth direction water level or amount of water or causes obstruction to the passage of fish which damage fishing within the neighbouring kingdom the treaty was particularly important at that time due to the increased development of hydropower but also for fisheries and tourism the transborder rivers were also important for transport of timer by floating logging international frameworks include all waters however surface water gets most of the attention while groundwater seems in many countries to be more or less invisible https www fao org fao stories article en c 1479581 this is a paradox as groundwater accounts for more than 90 of global freshwater resources this also applies in a high degree to norway and to a lesser extent sweden although norway has 1400 groundwater bodies gwbs few are mapped the lack of knowledge is illustrated by the missing results of the assessment of groundwater state in the norwegian national water databases low national attention to groundwater probably affects sustainable and effective cooperation on transborder gwbs the importance of transboundary waters was in a larger scale initially recognised under the convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes unece 1992 2013a the so called water convention have many similarities with the treaty between norway and sweden however it provides a more comprehensive intergovernmental platform for the day to day development and advancement of transboundary cooperation the water convention provides a legal and institutional framework and covers both groundwaters and surface waters it is applied across europe and in 2016 it was opened for accession to all un member states the secretariat of the water convention is hosted by the united nations economic commission for europe unece under the reporting of the sustainable development goals sdg indicator 6 5 2 on transboundary water cooperation for which the unece and the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco function as co custodians parties get a detailed insight into the status of their cooperation and what needs to be done to achieve target sdg 6 5 unece 2018 the implementation of the convention involves three main steps first the parties must enact laws and regulations and enter or adapt bilateral

available for the implementation unece 2013b the obligations under the convention include prevention control and reduction of significant transboundary impacts and improving water resource management at the national level reporting under the convention was introduced in 2015 and the first reporting cycle was held in 2017 2018 unece 2018 the european parliament launched a framework for the community action in the field of water policy or in short the eu water framework directive wfd in 2000 directive 2000 60 ec the wfd addresses all waters to be characterised according to their biological chemical and hydromorphological characteristics in eu countries the wfd is also intended to contribute to achieving the objectives of the water convention given the wide scope of the directive there are several interactions with other horizontal and vertical regulations e g the ec nitrates directive the ec habitats directive and the ec groundwater directive thereby making implementation complex fulfilling the wfd the groundwater directive requires that e g groundwater threshold values quality standards are established this requires a high level of cooperation between countries to ensure that threshold values will be set in a consistent and comparable manner throughout the eu and in agreement with non eu neighbouring countries the wfd has also been adopted by countries such as norway associated to the european economic area eea and the european free trade association efta non eu members countries such as armenia azerbaijan belarus georgia moldova and ukraine are implementing the wfd through the european union water initiative plus euwi several studies on the national implementation of the wfd have been published iital et al 2008 hammer et al 2011 nielsen et al 2013 hovik and hanssen 2016 hanssen et al 2016 yara et al 2018 in addition to transnational comparisons of e g geographical conditions as well as political and institutional experiences with the wfd rautio et al 2006 halleraker et al 2013 jager et al 2016 rimmert et al 2020 a literature synthesis of 89 journal articles studying the implementation of the wfd in europe was done by boeuf and fritsch 2016 one of their conclusions was that cross country comparisons are in the minority and that future research would benefit from a departure from single country studies studies of transborder water cooperation are mainly based on the reporting of the sdg indicator 6 5 2 https unece org national country reports sdg indicator 652 accessed 30 march 2022 and the wfd lipponen and chilton 2018 mccracken and meyer 2018 szocs et al 2018 rieu clarke et al 2022 these studies indicate that both the water convention and the wfd seem to increase in importance of establishing cooperation management systems for transborder waters in europe this paper examines the implementation practices of the wfd in norway and sweden with focus on irbd and transborder cooperation on gwbs we are addressing the reason for insufficient or fragmented management of tbas and if this affects sustainable development to understand the present situation national and transborder geological conditions and geographically parameters are analysed giving a status of the importance of groundwater resources for humans ecology and economy in addition the effects on transborder groundwater management and cooperation due to differences in existing legal regimes are addressed the present study is framed in the context of the necessity of enlighten the reasons for low political attention and funding of mapping tbas a review of national legislation implementation of the wfd and transnational agreements and treaties is carried out to evaluate the functionality of the water management systems national legislation and features of water cooperation through river basins and river basin districts are studied evaluation of the degree of transnational cooperation on tbas is mainly based on the reporting of the wfd requirements to the european environmental agency and the european union database wise https water europa eu in addition to reporting of the sdg indicator 6 5 2 on transboundary water cooperation to unece https unece org national country reports sdg indicator 652 accessed 30 march 2022 key prospective transboundary groundwater concerns and recommendations for fulfilling of the objectives of the water convention and the wfd are given 2 study area 2 1 geological and geographical description norway and sweden have the longest joint national border between two countries in europe the border which to a large degree follows watershed divides is over 1630 km and has largely been unchanged for several centuries fig 1 both sweden and norway are part of the fennoscandian shield an area of old crystalline and metamorphic rocks common rocks are gneiss granite granodiorite sandstone and marble most of which are very compact with few fractures and low values of hydraulic conductivity resulting in generally low groundwater well yields nevertheless fractured aquifers in crystalline hard rocks are the most common type of aquifer in both countries knutsson 2008 the landscape of scandinavia and the unconsolidated overburden are to a large extent formed by numerous glaciations and deglaciations during the quaternary time period moving glaciers scoured off younger sedimentary rocks and deep weathered bedrock fredin et al 2013 ice marginal deposits as well as fluvial and glaciofluvial deposits such as eskers glaciofluvial deltas and alluvial plains are the most important and productive aquifers in norway knutsson 2008 isostatic rebound after deglaciation raised areas holding fine grained marine sediments above the current sea level fredin et al 2013 these marine sediments have very poor hydraulic conductivity however below the marine sediments useful productive aquifers may be found tassis et al 2016 as a result of the geological formations the number of aquifers in unconsolidated quaternary deposits in norway and sweden is large many thousands the exact number in not known as many of them are very small and most aquifers have never been mapped quaternary geology maps have been used to delineate aquifer outlines digitally the resulting polygons are grouped and simplified as gwbs for administrative purposes sweden has reported approximately 3000 gwbs to the european union database wise while norway has reported about 1400 gwbs as most rock types in norway and sweden are very compact and have generally poor water bearing capacity aquifers in crystalline bedrock play a minor role for water supply however for many households in rural areas in both sweden and norway local groundwater wells drilled in bedrock are a good and often the only alternative for drinking water supply accordingly groundwater wells in bedrock are far more common than water wells drilled in porous aquifers in unconsolidated quaternary deposits nevertheless only two aquifers in crystalline bedrock are characterised in norway and a few more in sweden according to the norwegian groundwater database for drilled wells granada geological survey of norway 2021 95 of all registered water wells are established in crystalline bedrock inland aquifers are mainly unconfined and therefore vulnerable to pollution but they are generally without significant anthropogenic influence kløve et al 2017 aquifers in both norway and sweden range from unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits to karst and fracture aquifers in crystalline rocks due to large variations in settlement patterns climate as well as hydrogeological conditions and water quality of surface waters the usage of groundwater as drinking water source varies considerably between as well as within the countries in norway approximately 15 of domestic water supply is groundwater while in sweden about 60 of the population uses groundwater as their main water supply kvitsand and fiksdal 2010 transboundary gwbs between norway and sweden are compared to other parts of europe scarce and small bgr and unesco 2019 only seven transborder gwbs have been identified table 1 the delineation of the transborder gwbs polygon was not harmonised across the border for any of these in the reporting to wise in 2016 this was to some extent improved in the 2022 reporting in which two of seven polygons were harmonised table 1 the most important transboundary gwbs belong to the drainage basin skagerrak and kattegat västerhavet fig 1 the respective aquifers are made up of fluvial and glaciofluvial deposits as large parts of the gwbs are situated in uninhabited forests there are few stressors towards groundwater chemistry an overview of the area is given in the attached google earth file however in some areas extensive forestry might have an effect not only on the surface water but also on groundwater quality futter et al 2011 in sweden all major transboundary gwbs are mapped and classified as having good quantitative and qualitative status the largest registered transboundary groundwater body is crossing the national border between magnor norway and charlottenberg sweden with an approximate area of 40 km2 this is the only transborder groundwater body that has been geophysically mapped by geo radar in norway fig 1 upper left small figure 2 2 national legislation and bilateral agreements the swedish norwegian union ended in a peaceful dissolution in 1905 however the swedish authorities had the power to claim some norwegian concessions in return for their cooperation one of the swedish claims was that the two countries should abstain from future regulation of any of their common watercourses if such regulations were not accepted beforehand by the neighbouring state the main reason for the swedish demand was the crucial importance of the river klar river trysil that represented substantial swedish commercial interests the need for securing norwegian guarantees against harming these interests grew out of the topography along the river the economical and geographical environment from the river s sources and to its outlet and the fact that sweden was a downstream party in this river system the historical context behind the convention between norway and sweden on watercourse rights first sign in 1905 is well described by berg and jakobsson 2006 in 1929 the 1905 convention was supplemented with an agreement on formal procedures for the regulation of watercourses that have an impact on the neighbouring country the convention between norway and sweden on certain questions relating to the law on watercourses kld 1929 is the oldest convention on watercourses still valid in europe the agreement might be the reason why norway and sweden have avoided upstream downstream conflicts which characterise many water interest conflicts both in national and in international politics despite the extensive hydropower developments during the first decade of the twentieth century jakobsson 2002 berg 2009 sovacool and walter 2019 gives an overview of several historical examples of international hydropower conflicts well known examples of upstream downstream conflicts are also the disagreement between india and pakistan over a dam on the kishanganga river munir et al 2021 and the turkey syria and iraq conflict over the euphrates tigris el fadel et al 2002 kibaroglu and sayan 2021 the historical relationship between water scarcity and interstate conflict between upstream and downstream riparian countries might also relate to the country s relative military power yousef 2021 as an eu member state sweden started to implement the wfd in 2000 before the wfd the 290 municipalities played a key role in swedish water management through their responsibility for land and water resource planning the 21 county boards act as regional supervisory authorities linked to the national government implementing the wfd sweden introduced a new regional level for water management by establishing a water authority as the competent authority in each of the five new defined water districts vattendistrikt franzen et al 2015 the water districts comprise the swedish rbd areas that are parts of the swedish land area sfs 2004 including the swedish parts of irbd shared with norway fig 1 the swedish agency for marine and water management swam supports the water authorities through guidance and issues binding rules so called regulations for how the work is to be carried out the geological survey of sweden sgu is the guiding and prescribing authority for groundwater the five water authorities are responsible for developing the river basin management plans rbmps and programmes of measures poms these documents define legally binding environmental quality objectives the municipalities develop land and water plans according to these objectives sfs 2004 the wfd was incorporated into the agreement on the european economic area eea by joint commission decision no 125 2007 of 28 september 2007 however the formal incorporation was delayed until 2009 due to iceland s negotiations with the european commission on special adaptations to the directive entson and gipperth 2010 anon 2013 despite these negotiations the wfd was transposed into the norwegian regulation by a framework for water management in 2007 usually referred to as vannforskriften or the water regulation kld 2006 the same year norway also prepared and uploaded data to the eea central data repository according to the wfd article 3 establishment of rbds irbds and competent authorities then in 2009 data fulfilling the wfd article 5 characterisation of the waterbodies was delivered in addition to uploading data norway voluntarily prepared rbmps in selected rbds across the country from 2007 to 2009 as a pilot activity thus gaining experience in rbm planning rbmps for the selected rbds were adopted by the county councils in 2009 and approved by the national government in june 2010 rbmps covering the entire country were prepared from 2010 to 2015 for 13 of the rbds reported on article 3 in 2007 of these only two separate plans were made for the irbds with runoff across the national border the other five irdbs belonging to finland and or sweden were in varying degree integrated in the national rbmps this reporting was synchronised with the time schedule of the second cycle of implementation for the eu countries due 22 march 2016 norway implemented a regional administrative reform that came into effect on january 1 2020 this reform led to a reduction of rbds to 16 fig 1 which are administered by nine competent authorities in each rbd broad multi level and cross sector networks comprised of all relevant public authorities are established in order to formulate a joint rbmp the wfd ecosystem based network structure is introduced as a secondary structure added to the primary hierarchical structure based on the sectoral principle e g hovik 2019 the water regulation kld 2006 is founded on the pollution control act the planning and building act and the water resources act the norwegian ministry of climate and environment kld is the central competent authority under the wfd and is responsible for water quality and biodiversity the national authority for the implementation of the wfd is the norwegian environment agency nea the ministry of petroleum and energy is responsible for the water resources act the general management of watercourses and the quantitative usage of water drinking water management is the responsibility of the ministry of health regional water management plans are adopted as a regional plan according to the planning and building act 8 4 with the special rules that follow from the water regulation the rbds and irbds are subdivided into 107 water areas wherein the municipalities cooperate to solve water issues in shared watercourses and coastal areas the most relevant ministries and governmental agencies cooperate in guiding regional authorities in their work under the wfd the historical implementation of the wfd in norway and sweden is well described by halleraker et al 2013 the 2018 report to unece on sdg indicator 6 5 2 states that transboundary issues between sweden and norway are handled in accordance with the convention between norway and sweden on certain questions relating to the law on watercourses kld 1929 the water convention unece 1992 an informal memorandum of understanding mou from 2008 and an informal strategy for international cooperation on transboundary waters formulated in 2013 unece 2018 the informal strategy document prepared for the management of norwegian swedish transborder watercourses describes how the countries are to cooperate on the coordination of shared water bodies monitoring and classification of ecological chemical and quantitative status nea and swam 2013 it also describes how the coordination of the work with management plans environmental goals and action programs is to take place the strategy documents were based on the informal mou from 2008 it follows from article 3 of the wfd that a catchment area extending into the territory of another country shall be defined as an irbd swedish legislation only relates to the five water districts established which define the watershed divide to run along the country s border with norway in the description of the rbds they are all described as fully draining towards the baltic sea including the parts which drain into norway sfs 2004 the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve and the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi have harmonised the polygons of water catchments lake waterbodies and river waterbodies along the border according to the wfd despite this sweden has not made separate irbmps for the norwegian irbds these areas are only described as part of chapters in the swedish rbd plans https ec europa eu environment water water framework impl reports htm accessed 10 may 2022 in 2018 swam and nea signed an agreement on cooperation on water management in accordance with the wfd nea 2018 the purpose of the collaboration was to create common preconditions and principles mutual understanding and to utilise synergies in the work of the two authorities the collaboration creates arenas for joint development of methods tools and guidance as well as opportunities to share resources models reference stations and data for the years 2019 2021 the collaboration was focused on sustainable hydropower and hydromorphology environmental monitoring and mapping and other ongoing cooperation such as liming of acidified watercourses and cooperation on border crossing precipitation fields the new plan covering the period 2021 2027 continues to focus on physical impacts such as acidification liming and over fertilisation to assess ecological condition and chemical status in addition research development and management in cross border catchment areas should be coordinated in view of a changing climate nea 2021a groundwater is not mentioned in any of the two cooperation agreements 3 analysis of transborder cooperation sweden and norway have both reported under the water convention and on the global sdg indicator 6 5 2 to unece https unece org national country reports sdg indicator 652 accessed 20 may 2022 from the first to the second reporting sweden has provided more total area estimates of their aquifers unece 2021 the unece report on sdg 6 target 5 also states that sweden and norway have undertaken steps to further improve their transboundary water cooperation following the first reporting exercise in 2017 2018 unece 2021 this statement refers to the agreement between nea and swam regarding cooperation on water management according to the eu wfd nea 2021a the ministry of climate and environment kld has instructed nea who are responsible for the implementation of the wfd in norway not to prioritise groundwater in the period 2021 2027 kld 2021 nea 2021b in sweden the responsibility for groundwater is delegated to sgu since sgu is not a part of the agreement the cooperation agreement between nea and swam is only related to surface water nea 2021a in the first and the second reporting round under the water convention for the global sdg indicator 6 5 2 to unece both norway and sweden state that an mou was established between the two countries in 2008 describing the implementation of the wfd by the countries however the document referred to is not an mou in the sense of a treaty as it might sound like in the reporting but a meeting minutes nea 2022 in norway neither the minutes nor the strategy agreement built on the minutes are files registered in governmental journals the documents are only available upon request to nea in sweden the strategy document is available through the water information system viss under case number 537 5712 2011 therefore norway and sweden have not entered into any formal permanent cooperative agreement under the water convention for any of its cross border bodies of water with the exception of the watercourse law from 1929 kld 1929 nor established any joint decision making bodies for these however both nations states that a result of the implementation of the wfd is a closer and more formalised cooperation at the local regional and the national level it is also claimed that this will lead to better management of transboundary waters as they are viewed more holistically and in a set of system framework that the countries follow https unece org national country reports sdg indicator 652 despite this the commissions assessment of the swedish rbmp for the 3rd wfd implementation report states that sweden needs to ensure full cooperation with neighbouring countries including the correct designation of transboundary river basin districts and cooperation on measures to ensure achievement of the environmental objectives ec 2012 norway and sweden have chosen a regional approach with weak central coordination requiring a greater effort to coordinate among the rbd authorities to ensure similar conditions across the districts several publications describe this highly fragmented and complex water governance system in both countries e g nielsen et al 2013 jager et al 2016 solli 2020 the need for consistent water management was one of the reasons for the establishment of a new national authority in sweden in 2011 swam nielsen et al 2013 jager et al 2016 management plans for the norwegian parts of the swedish irbd skagerrak and kattegat västerhavet gulf of bothnian bottenviken and bothnian sea bottenhavet fig 1 have been through consultation procedures in sweden and are available at neas information site vannportalen https www vannportalen no in addition these plans are available in the swedish rbmp at the swams home page https www vattenmyndigheterna se sweden has as mentioned chosen to define the watershed divide to run along the country border and in the description of the rbds they all drain towards the baltic sea sfs 2004 as a result sweden is not developing rbmps for the swedish parts of the norwegian irbds swam 2021 in addition this causes a lack of harmonisation of the irbd id coding table 1 in the 2016 reporting to wise the swedish coding of river basins that drain to norway was correct groundwater body no 123 392 g was assigned to se1102 which are parts of the troendelag irbd that drains from sweden to norway after the norwegian regional administrative reform in 2020 this groundwater body should be assigned to se1107 in the present reporting to wise 2022 sweden does not separate between gwbs draining to norway or to sweden and have replaced se1102 with the code se2 int which is the swedish river basin draining towards the east table 1 this procedure is not in accordance with paragraph 11 in the wfd which states that each member state shall ensure the establishment of a pom for each rbd or for the part of an irbd within its territory sweden s choice not to delineate river basins draining toward norway is a step backwards regarding transborder cooperation the strategy document nea and swam 2013 shows that there is an awareness on the mismatch in the norwegian and the swedish definitions of the rbd as it states that a prerequisite for the strategy proposed to be implemented is that the swedish regulations are changed so that the swedish water districts have boundaries that correspond to the norwegian rbd this awareness might come from the above statement from the commissions assessment of the swedish river basin management plans for the 3rd wfd ec 2012 the above analysis shows that norway and sweden do not cooperate to an extent that ensures a system or framework that enables the countries to monitor classify and ensure good ecological status in all transnational waters in a holistic manner both national and transnational cooperation appears to be dependent on individual persons initiatives additionally important agreements and instructions from the ministry are not archived in a traceable manner impeding involvement of stakeholders outside public administration such as environmental organisations thus sweden and norway are neither fulfilling the water conventions provisions nor the wfd this has been acknowledged by the norwegian authorities and kld has taken the initiative to evaluate the possibility of instituting an agreement that covers administrative and cooperation principles for all cross border waterbodies between norway and sweden following the same principles as the swedish finish agreement gränsälvsoverenskommelse sfs 2010 and or the finnish russian agreement administered by the finnish russian joint commission on the utilisation of frontier waters https rajavesistokomissio fi en agreement accessed 5 may 2022 on transboundary waters kld 2020 the response from nea to this initiative after discussions with swam was that such arrangement would cause too much bureaucracy and formalities and it would not be very flexible nea recommends that the cooperation continue as is but that a small working group should be established to update transborder water strategies between norway and sweden nea 2021c the working group suggested consist of swam nea the norwegian river basin districts authorities and the swedish water authorities again groundwater seems to be ignored or given less attention as sgu is not a part of the suggested working group the main possible reason for the low attention given to groundwater at the norwegian swedish country border area is probably that the authorities have not seen any public utility of groundwater in these areas groundwater use within norway is currently limited due to the country s abundant surface water resources with the majority of the area supplied with drinking water by piped network coverage groundwater abstraction is often limited to private borehole supplies the same applies to sweden even though to a lesser extent the geology at the norwegian swedish border causing many small aquifers with low water well yield also contributes to the absence of interest in using groundwater for water supply the population along the 1630 km long norwegian swedish border is also low on both sides on average less than 1 5 inhabitants per km2 grunfelder et al 2018 groundwater is however not only important for water supply to private households groundwater has large influence on surface water temperature chemistry and water level and can act both as a medium for the propagation of stressors to surface water and as a buffer of stressors in time and space it is thus important to map and monitor groundwater quantity and quality groundwater surface water interaction has also received increased focus in e g in africa due to its importance to ecologic systems and sustainability levy and xu 2012 the importance of the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater surface water interactions in rivers for e g juvenile salmonid and trout habitats has been demonstrated in several studies worldwide brabrand et al 2002 olsen and young 2009 saltveit and brabrand 2013 casas mulet et al 2015 larsen and woelfle erskine 2018 campbell et al 2020 carlson et al 2020 4 discussion 4 1 moving forward with transboundary aquifer management norway an efta country and sweden an eu member country have both implemented the eu wfd which is also intended to fulfil the objectives of the water convention the two regulations emphasise that nations must ensure reasonable and impartial use of resources ecologically reliable water management conservation of resources and environmental protection including restoration of ecosystems where necessary the concept of ecological status is not used for groundwater however the groundwater qualitative and quantitative conditions can through water exchange between groundwater and surface water sources have an important effect on the ecological condition of the surface water saether and de cariat 1997 groundwater can therefore play a vital role in the ecological assessment of water bodies and as a source for drinking and industry water and geothermal energy sweden is ahead of norway in the implementation of wfd as the efta countries are one reporting cycle behind eu countries in sweden all major transboundary gwbs are mapped and classified as having good quantitative and qualitative status https viss lansstyrelsen se sweden has also updated the delineation of their groundwater bodies but this has not been followed up by norway https www vann nett no portal the lack of harmonisation of the polygons showing transborder gwbs becomes very visible when displaying the swedish and the norwegian gwb data together https www vann nett no portal in the maps some gwbs are only registered in one country and do not continue on the other side of the border table 1 this is probably due to poor mapping but might also be due to geological and hydrological conditions quaternary geology maps have been used to delineate aquifer outlines digitally the resulting polygons have been merged and simplified as gwbs for administrative purposes scotland with similar quaternary geology to norway and sweden has chosen a different approach where both bedrock and sedimentary groundwater are delineated as waterbodies https www sepa org uk data visualisation water environment hub accessed 30 may 2022 these are divided into horizons as the wfd asks for poland the czech republic slovakia and other countries in the eu have also followed this approach černák and michalko 2005 velstra 2005 this could be a methodology in a future gwb delineation also for norway and sweden the risk assessment component of gwb characterisation following the dpsir principle drivers d pressures p status s impacts i and responses r involves both an assessment of the likelihood that certain pressures will adversely affect the underlying gwb or downstream receptors to the extent that the gwb will fail to be characterised as having a good quantitative or chemical status ec 2008 by following the scottish approach of building the risk assessment on a hazard pathway receptor model o dochartaigh et al 2005 only those aquifers classified as vulnerable towards stressors have to be monitored sweden has followed such model in their classification of chemical status of gwbs along the norwegian border if no stressors are identified a good chemical quality is given in the description of the gwb in the swedish groundwater database viss https viss lansstyrelsen se in factsheets for each groundwater body the classification status risk assessments and sources of influence and measures are given in addition to a reliability rate this feature has not yet been included in the norwegian groundwater database vann nett https vann nett no portal accessed 10 june 2022 the 1630 km long swedish norwegian frontier is dominated by national parks with 1 5 inhabitants per km2 and no polluting industries thus the gwbs are assumed to have a good chemical status and the norwegian authorities therefore might not be motivated to spend resources on groundwater monitoring in these areas if norway follows the same model as sweden in classifying their gwbs either as in good or poor condition the costs should be moderate as stated above neither norway nor sweden currently meet the requirements of the wfd in relation to groundwater groundwater has often been described as an invisible resource but it is important to recognise that even in norway and sweden the use of and the stressors towards groundwater resources are increasing integrated water resource management acknowledges the important role of groundwater within frameworks that can be overly surface water focused to be able to implement a holistic water management the very fragmented organisation of water governance systems particularly in norway but also in sweden has to be changed e g stokke and indset 2012 hovik 2019 solli 2020 in norway as described previously the responsibility for regulating and guiding activities such as the production of hydropower pollution from agriculture industry fish farming households and climate change is divided between different levels of government state counties municipalities and different ministries and directorates at the national level one of the aims of the wfd was to change the fragmented governing of water to a more holistic one but this has not happened in norway to be able to reach the wfd goals a less fragmented governance system must be put into place in addition to changes in national governance systems a binding agreement between sweden and norway such as the gränsälv agreement between sweden and finland sfs 2010 with the associated establishment of finnish swedish border river commission should be set up within swedish and norwegian law the finnish swedish agreement lays down principles for the management of all waterbodies in defined border areas between sweden and finland and the border river commission is responsible for facilitating and developing cooperation on all these transboundary waterbodies there are eight irbds shared between norway and sweden a joint body that coordinates and overlooks the management of these in line with such agreement should be established an agreement can also incorporate obligations both countries have not only under the water convention but also under other agreements such as the wfd to avoid double regulation of the irbds 4 2 key prospective transboundary groundwater concerns and recommendations the wfd sets high expectations for water quality across the eu as well as towards eea efta countries and euwi countries ambitious procedure prescriptions specifically regarding rbm both nationally and internationally are requested the wfd is also intended to contribute to fulfilling the objectives of the water convention which address all transborder waters although a large set of international frameworks are developed even a groundwater directive 2006 118 ec in response to the requirements of article 17 of the wfd groundwater still seems invisible in many regions requiring transborder cooperation this applies even if the countries have implemented the regulations into national legislation most existing agreements do not explicitly refer to groundwater or their application to groundwater remains limited the responsibility for mapping characterisation and monitoring groundwater often lies with the national geological survey the responsibility for groundwater quality and quantity might also be divided between national agencies such as in norway where the responsibility is split between nea nve and ngu regulatory responsibility for water management might be situated elsewhere in government this fragmented organisation applies particularly to countries where water supply is to a large extent based on surface water as in norway and large parts of sweden for these countries there is an urgent need to improve legal frameworks for cooperation and strengthen institutions for the management of groundwater norway and sweden have chosen a decentralised approach for the implementation of the wfd with regional main rbd authorities a centralised model may make transboundary cooperation easier as less players are involved the large number of institutions that need to be coordinated in the management of transboundary waters between norway and sweden has been identified as a major obstacle in fulfilling the objectives of the wfd and the water convention at the same time it is important that regional and local stakeholders have ownership in the decision process surface water has got and gets much more attention than groundwater an obvious reason for this is that surface water is visible and if not in good ecological status it is very often easily observed by the public in contrast to low quality groundwater mapping gwbs is more expensive than mapping surface water as drilling is required to obtain 3d hydrological conceptual models in addition multi disciplinary cooperation is required between hydrologist hydrogeologists geologist and not least geophysics the institutions responsible for groundwater mapping and monitoring might not be equipped to perform the necessary research work and do not have the economy or intent to hire necessary experts from the information analysed above it is not the countries affiliation to the eu its historical political regime or its geological conditions that decide whether the transborder cooperation on groundwater is well developed or not it is instead directed by the governments recognition of the importance of groundwater economic priorities and by international political pressure for fulfilment of international agreements and directives such as the wfd and the water convention this was also one of rieu clarke s conclusions after the initial reporting exercise to the sdg took place in 2017 and 2018 rieu clarke 2020 the lack of clean safe water and sustainable use of water is recognised as an increasing threat to humans welfare and development this study concludes that international regulations and agreements are important foundations for establishing national and transborder water management systems and cooperation however legislation and agreements are not enough in themselves they have to be followed up by status reporting and feedback the national reporting of sdg indicator 6 5 2 to unece in addition to the reporting to wise hopefully provides a step towards obtaining the necessary political attention to extend both knowledge and coverage of cooperation arrangements on transboundary waters 5 conclusions analysis of the reporting to unece on the sdg indicator 6 5 2 on transboundary water cooperation by norway and sweden reveals that none of the three main implementation steps are yet completed the necessary laws and regulations in addition to bilateral arrangements between the states are not yet satisfactory governmental resources give priority to surface water whereas groundwater is mainly forgotten or neglected seven transborder gwbs are registered of these only two are harmonised by coding and polygons in the reporting to wise there is a need to establish transnational joint projects for increasing the knowledge of transborder groundwater between norway and sweden to fulfil the obligations given by international legislation the analysis of geography geology politics and legislation shows that there appears to be several reasons for the low attention on groundwater resources e g 1 the transborder gwbs are situated in uninhabited forests or national parks with few identified stressors to groundwater chemistry 2 national legislation is to some degree an obstacle for cooperation 3 the water policy is particular in norway fragmented and little transparent and 4 there is in both countries a very low political attention to groundwater even though there is an increasing use of groundwater as a heat source to overcome the identified obstacles defined lines of responsibility for mapping and monitoring groundwater should be established in norway additionally swedish legislation has to be changed to meet paragraph 11 of the wfd and delineate river basin boundaries for the irbd shard with norway a more holistic approach for cooperation on transborder waters not only groundwater but all waters would be easier to obtain through a binding agreement between sweden and norway and the establishment of a border river commission this first in depth analysis of norwegian and swedish transborder cooperation on groundwater clearly displays the importance of international pressure applied through national reporting to unece and wise the reports and feedback are important tools in the process of moving forward to a more sustainable management of transborder aquifers as it makes the nations need for improved cooperation perceptible even though the importance of transboundary waters was recognised under the convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes already in 1992 there is still a way to go before the treaty s objectives are obtained the wfd established by the european parliament in 2000 has improved not only national but also

7796,study region dongting lake basin of china study focus this study aimed to analyze the nonstationary characteristics and future trends of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin the spatiotemporal variations in the flood extremes that occurred over the past 60 years were explored using the trend free prewhitening mk tfpw mk method the nonstationary characteristics of flood extremes were detected using the pettitt test and the nonstationarity analysis was performed using the gamlss model furthermore a combination of tfpw mk and the hurst exponent was employed to predict the future trends in flood extremes new hydrological insights for the region 1 evident variations were observed in the flood extremes from most hydrometric stations among the 10 stations with a decreasing extreme trend seven exhibited evident decreases such decreases probably result from the impact of water conservancy projects among the remaining six stations with an increasing extreme trend two exhibited evident increases such increases probably result from the effect of highly extreme precipitation 2 flood extremes from most 9 of 16 stations showed nonstationarity the lognormal distribution was the optimal distribution of extreme values for nonstationary stations whereas the gamma distribution was the optimal distribution of extreme values for stationary stations despite the preferable fitting efficiency of the gamlss model its simulation performance for nonstationary stations that showed significant trends must be improved 3 the flood extremes of the 14 stations will maintain existing trends in the future the xiangtan station exhibited anti persistence and might show a decreasing trend in the future whereas shimen station did not show persistence graphical abstract ga1 keywords flood extreme nonstationarity future trend gamlss model dongting lake basin data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as one of nature s most destructive forces beevers et al 2020 dottori et al 2018 floods threaten human life and the environment moreover floods cause socioeconomic disasters in many parts of the world between 1990 and 2019 china s average annual direct economic loss due to floods was 24 billion usd which accounted for 1 3 of gdp for that period in the united states disaster losses resulting from hurricanes and floods set an all time record of 300 billion usd in 2017 parizi et al 2021 in their forecast analysis of the effects of river flood on the global economy willner et al 2018 found that the risk of river floods will increase because anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions lead to atmospheric warming and the intensification of earth s hydrological cycle frequent global occurrence of flood disasters is closely correlated to the critical changes in the variability and trends of extreme hydrometeorological events lu et al 2020 tegegne et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 according to literature in many watersheds worldwide the time series of flood extremes exhibits nonstationarity in changing contexts ishak et al 2013 lópez and francés 2013 solander et al 2017 wilcox et al 2018 sun et al 2018b 2018a grandry et al 2020 engeland et al 2020 chen et al 2021 milly et al 2015 reported that stationarity is dead in changing context the stationarity assumption is no longer suitable as the default assumption for the assessment of water resource risks the utilization of existing approaches for hydrological process analyses causes the risk of design frequency distortion that results from the changing environment the stationary and nonstationary characteristics of extreme flood events have become sought after topics in the hydroclimate change research sun et al 2018b 2018a zhou 2020 salas and obeysekera 2014 defined the stationary hydrological series as a sequence without trends change points and periodicity because nonstationarity is a concept relative to stationarity a nonstationary hydrological series can be understood as occurring trends change points or periodicity in actual only the trends and change points of hydrological series are considered the mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is one of the most common methods used for analyzing trends according to von storch 1995 the autocorrelation of original data can lead to test result enhancement or reduction to a certain extent von storch accordingly proposed the prewhitening mk pw mk method yue et al 2002 found that for an autocorrelation series with trend items prewhitening processing can lead to the removal of some trend items resulting in the acceptance of invalid assumptions hence they proposed the trend free prewhitening mk tfpw mk method the pettitt test pettitt et al 1979 is one of the most common methods used for testing change points which is widely used in the mutation detection of flood extreme value time series yielding reliable results oluwaseun and vincent 2020 wang et al 2020a 2020b yang et al 2022 rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 developed a nonstationary analytical model the generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss which comprises various families of probability distributions that can flexibly reflect linear and nonlinear relationships between any statistical parameter and the explanatory variable of random variable distribution thereby allowing the diagnosis of the nonstationary characteristics of flood extreme value time series using gamlss chen et al 2021 conducted simulations on the nonstationary characteristics of flood extreme value time series at 158 stations in the uk according to literature gamlss presents high applicability to the nonstationary characteristics of flood extremes in the yangtze pearl and huai river basins of china sun et al 2018b 2018a su and chen 2019 xiong et al 2019 additionally the trend change research on flood extreme time series has mostly focused on current trends mostofi zadeh et al 2020 grandry et al 2020 venegas cordero et al 2022 and future trend has been rarely predicted to forecast the future trends of hydrological time series yu and chen 2008 used the u statistic of the mk method mann 1945 kendall 1975 and hurst exponent hurst 1951 however in calculation of the u statistic by using the mk method the influence of intrinsic data autocorrelation should be considered yue et al 2002 for nonstationary time series a large uncertainty is present in the solution of the hurst exponent zhang et al 2014 dang and molnar 1999 detected the long range dependence in signals by employing variance r s periodogram and wavelet analysis methods indicating that the nonstationarity in signals considerably influenced the detection and estimation of long range dependence estimation with variance and periodogram methods yields poor results which can be easily confused with nonstationary processes with short range dependence by contrast the estimation results obtained with r s and wavelet analysis methods exhibit excellent robustness taqquand and teverovsky 1997 stated that the presence of cycles in time series impacts exponent h estimation with a longer cycle indicating a larger estimation error moreover the estimation results obtained with the aggregated variance method and absolute value method exhibit excellent robustness hence under nonstationary conditions a comprehensive analysis based on multiple methods is required for determining the h value of the hydrological series the yangtze river has the largest basin area in china and the dongting lake basin is one of its chief tributaries the average annual runoff of the dongting lake is approximately 284 40 billion m3 which accounts for approximately 30 runoff of the yangtze river as the lake with the greatest flood regulating action in the yangtze river basin and in china the dongting lake plays a critical role in the regulation and storage of water resources in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river especially for flood control li 2018 studies have reported that highly extreme precipitation events have occurred in the dongting lake basin during 1960 2019 zou et al 2021 li et al 2021a 2021b li et al 2021 and the number of extreme hydrological events has increased considerably kuang and ma 2019 chou and zhang 2020 between 2006 and 2019 in the hunan province covered by the basin the average number of annual disaster victims was 10 415 million with the second rank across china and the average annual flood loss was 2 45 billion usd with the fourth rank across china this information indicates that the dongting lake basin has been facing severe flood disasters additionally anthropogenic activities are intense in the basin where numerous water conservancy projects have been developed until 2019 more than 14 047 reservoirs were developed in the basin with the total storage capacity of higher than 51 4 billion m3 in the dongting lake basin influenced by climate change and anthropogenic activities the hydrological processes have undergone considerable changes however studies have mainly focused on the annual runoff zou et al 2018 jian et al 2019 degree of hydrologic alteration wang et al 2019 and flood frequency under stable conditions wu et al 2019 no reports that address nonstationary characteristics and future trends of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin are available exploring the nonstationary characteristics and future trends of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin is important for reducing natural disaster and managing water resources to achieve this three mk models were selected for trend testing the pettitt test was performed for analyzing change points the gamlss model was selected for nonstationary analyses the future trends were predicted by comprehensively applying the mk u statistic and hurst exponent h the main objectives of this paper are to 1 analyze the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of flood extremes 2 determine the nonstationary characteristics of flood extremes and 3 predict the future trends of flood extremes the outcome of this study can provide scientific support for reducing the effects of extreme flood events in the dongting lake basin 2 data and methods 2 1 data the dongting lake basin located between 24 36 n 30 27 n and 107 26 e 114 20 e occupies an area of 263 000 km2 fig 1 in the basin the water system is well developed and the regional flood composition is extremely complex wu et al 2019 the basin not only presents the inflows of xiang zi yuan and li rivers but also carries and adjusts the water and sediments at the songzi taiping and ouchi mouths of the yangtze river in flood seasons the basin shows distinct features such as short flood duration high flood peak large flood volume and complex river lake relationships in this study the data for the annual maximum daily flow amdf of 16 hydrological stations situated in the dongting lake basin that occurred over the past 60 years were collected the data were obtained from the changjiang water resources commission and hunan provincial bureau of hydrology and water resources survey table 1 and fig 1 present the basic information of these 16 hydrological stations the daily precipitation records of 119 meteorological stations for 1959 2019 were obtained from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn fig 1 the daily precipitation records of 21 precipitation stations for 1959 2019 were obtained from the hunan provincial bureau of hydrology and water resources survey fig 1 furthermore the data of the characteristic parameters of major large reservoirs developed in the dongting lake were collected the data were obtained from the water resources department of hunan province fig 1 2 2 methods 2 2 1 trend analysis 1 mk the mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 a nonparametric method recommended by the world meteorological organization is widely used in the trend test of time series for hydrometeorological elements the u statistic of the mk test obeys a normal distribution positive and negative u statistic indicate the upward and downward trends of the series respectively the absolute u values of 1 96 and 1 64 indicated that the test passed at the significance levels of 0 05 and 0 1 respectively in this study the significance level was set to 0 1 to enhance the possible error of trend analysis resulting from the autocorrelation effect of hydrological series von storch 1995 and yue et al 2002 have proposed the pw mk and tfpw mk tests respectively in this study the evolutionary trends of flood extremes at the 16 control stations in the dongting lake basin were comparatively analyzed using the three mk models to identify a flood extreme trend detection method adapted to the characteristics of the studied basin the specific calculation principles of the three mk models are available in the literature su et al 2018 2 cox stuart to avoid the uncertainty of trend analysis calculation based on a single method the cox stuart test cox and stuart 1955 a nonparametric test that can be used to detect trends in the independent time series data was employed for a comparative analysis the statistical quantity is defined as follows 1a s cs s cs n 6 n 12 where s cs represents the maximum number of symbols calculated with the following formula 1b s cs max j i n 3 1 sgn x n n 3 i x i j j 1 0 1 where n 3 indicates the smallest integer greater than n 3 and 1 indicates the dirac measure the test data asymptotically follow a normal distribution whose significance level has lower power than that of the mk test militino et al 2020 2 2 2 change point analysis the pettitt method can be employed as a nonparametric approach to diagnose the change points following any distribution time series and obtain their significance level in a statistical sense this method has been well applied to the change point test of hydrometeorological elements in the major river basins worldwide oluwaseun and vincent 2020 wang et al 2020a 2020b yang et al 2022 for a hydrological time series y 1 y 2 y n of length n the statistic ut n is defined as follows 2a u t n i 1 t j t 1 n s g n y j y i 1 t n where 2b sgn 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 the most probable change point t is estimated as follows 2c t max 1 t n u t n to examine whether t is significant the significance level of the statistic ut n is estimated using the following formula 2d p 2 exp 6 u t n 2 n 2 n 3 2 2 3 gamlss model the gamlss model was proposed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 to evaluate the stationarity and nonstationarity of a time series in the gamlss model suppose there are n number of independent observations y i i 1 n which follow f y y i θ i distribution in this case θ i corresponds to the location parameter e g mean mn and median the scale parameter e g variance var and mean square and the shape parameter e g skewness coefficient and kurtosis coefficient where θ i t θ i 1 θ i 2 θ ik represents the k parameter position scale and shape vector and k is usually less than 4 the formula is as follows 3a g k θ k x k β k j m h jk x jk where θ k is a vector of length n x k is an n m matrix of explanatory variables and β k is a vector of parameters of length m h jk represents the functional relationship between the distribution parameters and explanatory variables x jk without considering the impact of random effects on the distribution parameters eq 3a can be expressed as follows 3b g k θ k x k β k the stationarity of mean and variance that correspond to the location and scale parameters respectively was evaluated considering t as the only explanatory variable a linear function was established to link the mean θ 1 and variance θ 2 eq 3b can be re written as follows 3c g 1 θ 1 t β 1 3d g 2 θ 2 t β 2 during the construction of gamlss eight probability distribution functions commonly used in the hydrologic field were utilized as the distribution functions of flood extreme value time series table 2 the distribution trend of the residual plot can help determine whether the fitted linear model meets the relevant assumptions and the status of the residual sequence distribution is important for evaluating the model fitting effect sun et al 2018b 2018a chen et al 2021 thus the residual worm residual normal qq and percentile plots were used to evaluate whether the hydrological series followed the alternative probability distribution function additionally the akaike information criterion aic was used to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of alternative models akaike 1974 the smaller the aic values the better the fitting effect all calculations were performed using the gamlss package from the r library rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 2 2 4 prediction of future trends to envisage the future trend variations of flood extreme value time series the mk u statistic mann 1945 kendall 1975 and hurst exponent h hurst 1951 were used to forecast the future trends in the hydrological series yu and chen 2008 first the h value was acquired to denote the persistence or anti persistence characteristics of the series when h 0 5 the series was completely independent when 0 h 0 5 the future changes were in contrast with the past changes indicating anti persistence the smaller the value of h the stronger the anti persistence by contrast when h 0 5 the future changes were consistent with the past changes indicating persistence the larger the value of h the stronger the persistence afterwards the time series trends were analyzed using the mk method finally the future trend characteristics were obtained by combining the two statistics table 3 presents the future trend characteristics of the series obtained by applying the two methods studies have shown that for nonstationary time series a large uncertainty is observed in the h value solution thus in this study a combination of r s aggregated variance and absolute value methods was used to analyze and determine the h value the detailed calculation principles of the three methods are available in the literature jiang and deng 2004 3 results 3 1 trend and change point analyses of flood extremes 3 1 1 trend analysis the three mk models and the cox stuart model were used to analyze the variation trends of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin in the changing environment table 4 presents the results the variation trends of flood extremes at various stations revealed by the three mk models are the same albeit slight differences in the significance level the stations with relatively large differences include leiyang dongjiang and langli the pw mk method attained greater correction of the original data autocorrelation than the tfpw mk method from the comparison of the calculation results with those obtained using the cox stuart model the significance level of the cox stuart model is close to that of mk and tfpw mk the significance levels of mk tfpw mk and cox stuart models are p 0 1 thus the pw mk method over corrects the autocorrelation of the original data with significant trends a conclusion consistent with that reached by yue et al 2002 in this study the tfpw mk method was used to analyze the trends of flood extremes at various stations the tfpw mk results table 4 and fig 2 a showed that the flood extremes of 63 stations exhibited a decreasing trend five stations namely leiyang dongjiang langli anjiang and shimen showed a significant downward trend at p 0 1 the flood extremes of 37 stations exhibited an increasing trend however only the taoyi station showed a significant upward trend at p 0 1 the stations with a significant extreme value trends are concentrated in the xiang and yuan rivers 3 1 2 change point analysis according to the change point test results presented in table 4 most stations underwent change points in the 1990 s and 2000 s however only six stations i e leiyang dongjiang langli anjiang taoyi and shimen showed significant change points at the p 0 1 level the comparison presented in table 4 reveals that in the dongting lake basin significant change points are detected using the pettitt method for all stations with significant trend variations which can be determined by employing the tfpw mk method all stations with a significant variation trend at the p 0 1 level undergo a significant change point at the same level based on the results of both trend and change point tests the flood extreme value time series of the six stations are preliminarily identified to exhibit nonstationarity 3 2 nonstationarity analysis of flood extremes 3 2 1 nonstationarity diagnosis of flood extremes for stations without significant temporal trends and change points the gamlss model was used to detect the nonstationary features of time series and the aic method was used to select the optimal model table 5 presents the results for stations without change points the gamma distribution is the optimal choice which is suitable for fitting the simulation of the annual maximum daily flow for five stations logno is the best candidate for three stations whereas weibull is the best choice for two stations from the perspective of series stationarity seven stations have the stationarity model as the optimal model one station has θ 1 as the nonstationary model and two stations have θ 2 as the nonstationary model however no station selects θ 1 and θ 2 both of which are nonstationary variables the aic values differ insignificantly between the nonstationary and stationary models even for chenglingji showing a large difference the aic value of the nonstationary model is only 1 6 less than that of the stationary model for all three nonstationary stations the aic value difference between the nonstationary and stationary models ranges between 0 8 and 1 6 the aic value clearly indicates that for the stations without change points the difference between stationary and nonstationary models is not evident thus the gamlss simulations do not show inconsistencies with the results of trend and change point analyses suggesting the absence of an evident linear trend in the aforementioned stations without change points for the stations with significant temporal trends and change points gamlss was used to detect the nonstationary features of the time series and the aic method was utilized to select the optimal model table 6 presents the results all the stations with significant trends and change points identified through tfpw mk and pettit s tests exhibited mean or variance variation which was confirmed through gamlss the lognormal distribution is optimal for change points the aic values differ largely between the nonstationary and stationary models such inter model differences in the aic value range between 2 and 28 and the aic values support the gamlss results thus the gamlss fitting results are consistent with the findings of trend and change point analyses indicating that the aforementioned stations with significant trends and change points show evident linear trends according to the results of the gamlss model tables 5 and 6 nine stations namely chenglingji leiyang dongjiang langli taojiang taoyuan anjiang taoyi and shimen in the dongting lake basin show nonstationary flood extremes 3 2 2 goodness of fit evaluation of gamlss model to quantitatively evaluate the model performance as shown in tables 5 and 6 for analyzing the annual maximum daily flow at related stations analysis of residuals by gamlss was done as illustrated in fig 3 the sample points of different stations are distributed along the red curve and located in the middle of two black curves 95 ci suggesting a preferable fitting effect of gamlss for the 16 stations fig 3 to reflect the residual distribution a normal qq plot of the residuals is presented in fig 4 four nonstationary stations with significant temporal trends namely leiyang dongjiang anjiang and taoyi show numerous residual points that deviate from the theoretical line for the remaining 12 stations the residual points of the normal qq plot fitted using gamlss that are distributed along the theoretical line are fundamentally consistent moreover the probability plot correlation coefficient r is considerably close to 1 indicating a strong correlation between the actual and theoretical residual sequences thus for residual distribution the optimal fitting function selected using gamlss which employs time as the explanatory variable shows a good fitting effect on the 16 stations in the dongting lake basin based on gamlss the optimal fitting results of the time series for annual maximum daily flow were obtained tables 5 and 6 the percentile plots fig 5 are drawn according to the parameter calculations after this calculation the actual frequency values falling under each quantile graph were counted table 7 the frequency distribution is reasonable for the seven stationary stations except for the guiyang station at 50 xiangxiang station at 25 and pushi station at 75 which show large deviations moreover the actual frequency and theoretical probability falling under each quantile graph are low with deviations of less than 5 among the nine nonstationary stations six stations i e chenglingji leiyang langli taojiang taoyuan and shimen exhibit the maximum quantile differences of less than 5 suggesting a suitable simulation effect however dongjiang anjiang and taoyi stations show differences of up to 7 1 8 9 and 7 4 respectively in the 25 50 and 50 quantiles respectively where the actual frequency distribution is not quite reasonable hence for the percentile plot the optimal fitting function selected using gamlss which uses time as the explanatory variable shows a good fitting effect on the 16 stations in the dongting lake basin however the simulation performance for the nonstationary stations showing a significant trend needs to be improved 3 2 3 gamlss model based flood extreme trend analysis as revealed by the variation trend analysis of flood extremes at various stations based on the respective percentile plots fig 5 no evident variations are present in the quantile graphs of the seven stationary stations overall the gamlss model based trend analyses are consistent with the previous results obtained using the tfpw mk method among the nine nonstationary stations for chenglingji taojiang and taoyuan 5 and 25 quantiles show an apparent downward trend despite an evident upward trend for 95 quantile although the low frequency floods are intensifying the high frequency floods are weakening for the dongjiang langli and shimen stations 75 and 95 quantiles present an apparent downward trend that is the extreme values of low frequency floods tend to decrease considerably indicating fundamental consistency with the previous results of trend analysis for the taoyi station 50 75 and 95 quantiles present an evident upward trend the flood extremes tend to increase markedly showing fundamental consistency with the previous results of the trend analysis for leiyang and anjiang stations 5 and 25 quantiles present a downward trend and 75 and 95 quantiles exhibit an evident upward trend although the low frequency floods are intensifying the high frequency floods are weakening as for the nine nonstationary stations the overall gamlss model based trend analysis results are also consistent with the previous results obtained using the tfpw mk method thus the trend analysis based on gamlss yields accurate results which enables detailed analysis of the changes in flood extremes for each quantile 3 3 prediction of future trends in flood extremes by applying the u statistic of tfpw mk and h values the future trends of the flood extreme value time series for the 16 stations in the dongting lake basin were predicted the results are shown in table 8 and fig 6 the hurst exponents calculated from r s aggregated variance and absolute value methods differ slightly in magnitude but are fundamentally identical in regularity table 8 only the h values calculated using the aggregated variance method for three stations i e hengdong leiyang and xiangxiang are inconsistent with the calculations performed using the r s and absolute value methods based on the combination of u statistic and h value table 8 except for the xiangtan station of xiang river and shimen station of lishui river the flood extremes of the remaining 14 stations can maintain the existing trends where 4 stations i e dongjiang taojiang anjiang and taoyi exhibit strong persistent the xiangtan station of xiang river exhibits anti persistence and might present a downward trend in the future the h values of the shimen station calculated using various methods considerably differed considering the uncertainty of the h value of nonstationary stations calculated using the aggregated variance method and the strong robustness of the r s method the future trend in flood extremes of shimen station was analyzed by utilizing the h value acquired from the r s method the h value of the r s method was 0 49 nearly approaching 0 5 this suggests that the series will fundamentally not show a persistent effect in the future table 8 details the future trends of the remaining stations 4 discussion 4 1 causes of significant variations in flood extremes in the dongting lake basin the results of flood extreme trend analysis show that over the past 60 years the flood extremes in the dongting lake basin have mainly exhibited a decreasing trend whereas some stations have presented an increasing trend precipitation and water conservancy projects are the most crucial factors that affect flood extremes the daily precipitation data of the 119 meteorological stations and 21 precipitation stations were collected for the dongting lake basin and the daily areal precipitation processes of eight stations with substantial trend variations were obtained using the arithmetic mean method according to the 1 15 day accumulated antecedent precipitation aap of the flood extreme value of the eight stations the pearson method was used to select the most relevant accumulated antecedent precipitation fig 7 and the tffpw mk and pettitt were used to analyze the trend and mutation respectively of the most relevant accumulated antecedent precipitation table 9 fig 8 shows the annual most relevant accumulated antecedent precipitation of eight stations in the dongting lake basin numerous water conservancy projects developed in the basin might be a major cause for the reduced flood extremes thus we recorded the features of large reservoirs built in the watersheds where the six stations with a significant downward trend in flood extremes are located table 10 to determine the effect of reservoir regulation and storage on the downstream flood runoff processes the dimensionless reservoir index ri which assumed that the regulation of runoff processes by reservoirs is positively correlated with the storage capacity and catchment area of reservoirs proposed by lópez and francés 2013 was used the specific computational formula is as follows 4a ri i 1 n a i a t c i c t where ai and at respectively denote the control areas of the i th reservoir and hydrometric station ci is the total storage capacity of the i th reservoir and ct is the annual average runoff of the hydrometric station fig 9 displays the yearly reservoir coefficient statistics of six stations in the dongting lake basin this study discusses eight stations with a significant increasing or decreasing trend namely chenglingji hengdong leiyang dongjiang langli anjiang taoyi and shimen the details are as follows the incoming water of chenglingji a control station in the dongting lake basin is influenced by not only the four rivers but also the diversion at the three mouths of the yangtze river however the three gorges reservoir a large reservoir developed on the yangtze mainstream in 2003 with a total storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 has been officially put into operation in the absence of evident inflow changes in the four rivers the average total flood peak discharge at the three mouths of the yangtze river decreased by 28 su et al 2018 however in the basin above the station precipitation showed an increasing trend table 9 and fig 8 thus the construction of the three gorges reservoir may be the main reason for the downward trend presented by the flood extremes of the chenglingji station the flood extremes of leiyang station exhibit a significant downward trend which is probably attributed to the construction of dongjiang reservoir in the basin in 1985 with a total storage capacity of up to 9 27 billion m3 table 10 the reservoir has significantly enhanced the basin s regulation and storage capacity fig 9 in addition the year with abrupt flood change is fundamentally consistent with the year of the dongjiang reservoir impoundment however in the basin above the station precipitation showed an increasing trend table 9 and fig 8 therefore the construction of the dongjiang reservoir may be the main reason for the downward trend presented by the flood extremes of the leiyang station moreover the flood extremes of the dongjiang station exhibit a considerable downward trend which can be attributed to the construction of the dongjiang reservoir in the basin in 1985 the dongjiang reservoir is located about 12 km upstream of dongjiang station which is a multi year regulating reservoir fig 9 affected by the regulation and storage of dongjiang reservoir the flood extremes of dongjiang station decreases significantly therefore the construction of the dongjiang reservoir is the main reason for the downward trend presented by the flood extremes of the dongjiang station the significant trend of flood decrease at the langli station might also be affected by reservoir construction in 1992 the zhushuqiao reservoir was built in the basin with a total storage capacity of 278 million m3 table 10 after which the basin s regulation and storage capacity has remarkably enhanced fig 9 the year with abrupt flood change is fundamentally consistent with the year of the zhushuqiao reservoir impoundment meanwhile in the basin above the station precipitation showed the decreasing trend table 9 and fig 8 therefore the flood extremes of the langli station are affected by the combined effect of precipitation and water conservancy projects by contrast the flood extremes of the hengdong station show an evident increasing trend after 1959 only two large reservoirs qingshanlong and taoshui were built in the basin with an overall storage capacity of only 641 million m3 table 10 the catchment area controlled by the hengdong station is up to 10 082 km2 and the basin s regulation and storage capacity is considerably small fig 9 however in the basin above the station precipitation shows an increasing trend table 9 and fig 8 therefore the evident increasing trend in the flood extremes of the hengdong station probably results from extreme precipitation the flood extremes of the anjiang station also exhibit evident consistency with reservoir construction the sanbanxi reservoir and tuokou reservoir were built in 2006 and 2014 respectively at the basin upstream of the station with an overall storage capacity of 5 48 billion m3 table 10 after which the basin s regulation and storage capacity has significantly enhanced fig 9 the year with abrupt flood change is fundamentally consistent with the year of the sanbanxi reservoir impoundment however in the basin above the station precipitation shows an increasing trend table 9 and fig 8 therefore the significant decrease in flood extremes of the anjiang station is likely to be affected by reservoir regulation and storage in the case of the taoyi station no large controlled reservoir has been built at the chenshui tributary basin of yuan river where it is located however in the basin above the station precipitation shows a considerable increasing trend table 9 and fig 8 additionally the river channels in the chenshui tributary basin have steep slopes and the basin has suffered many floods recently thus the evident increasing trend in the flood extremes of taoyi station is primarily caused by extreme precipitations the flood extremes of the shimen station have exhibited a significant decreasing trend recently which is attributable to the construction of two large reservoirs jiangya and zaoshi in the basin in 1999 and 2008 respectively with an overall storage capacity of 3 18 billion m3 table 10 after 1999 the basin s regulation and storage capacity has increased remarkably fig 9 the flood extremes of the basin also exhibited a significant decreasing trend after 1999 meanwhile in the basin above the station precipitation shows the decreasing trend table 9 and fig 8 therefore the flood extremes of the shimen station are affected by the combined effect of precipitation and water conservancy projects in summary the stations showing significant decreases in flood extremes in the dongting lake basin are likely to be affected by the water conservancy projects and those showing significant increases are characterized by few large scale reservoir projects weak regulation storage capacity and a marked increase in extreme precipitations 4 2 nonstationarity diagnosis and simulation effect of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin according to the results of the gamlss model tables 5 and 6 the flood extremes of nine stations i e chenglingji leiyang dongjiang langli taojiang taoyuan anjiang taoyi and shimen are nonstationary among them the flood extremes of seven stations namely chenglingji leiyang dongjiang langli anjiang taoyi and shimen exhibit an evident upward or downward trend and their nonstationarity is caused by the significant temporal trend as for the remaining two stations i e taojiang and taoyuan the analysis results obtained for stationary and nonstationarity models differ slightly where the nonstationarity is probably caused by the periodic trend from the perspectives of residual distribution and percentile plot the optimal fitting function selected using the gamlss model which uses time as the explanatory variable shows a suitable fitting effect on the 16 stations in the dongting lake basin however the simulation performance for the nonstationary stations such as dongjiang and taoyi stations which show a significant trend must be improved because by simply establishing the functional relationship between the statistical parameters of hydrological series and the time variable only the overall trend variations of the series can be described and the description of their jumping abrupt changes is disallowed from the percentile plots in fig 5 the dongjiang station shows a jumping decreasing trend and the taoyi station exhibits a jumping increasing trend thus the extreme value distribution of the gamlss model which only uses time as the explanatory variable might cause deviations in the distribution of station frequency curves which probably necessitates the introduction of physical explanatory variables for describing the nonlinear trend variations of the series li and tan 2015 furthermore in the absence of physical causal correlation between the time variables and hydrological series it is impossible to explain the causes of the series nonstationarity and their rates of contribution to the nonstationarity li et al 2017 zhou 2020 wang et al 2020b 4 3 future prediction results of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin as revealed by the future trend predictions of flood extremes table 8 the xiangtan and shimen stations undergo changes in future trends and the remaining 14 stations maintain the existing trends the increasing trend in flood extremes of xiangjiang station might be associated with the successive occurrence of the fourth largest and largest floods in 2017 and 2019 respectively kuang and ma 2019 chou and zhang 2020 if the extreme values of these two floods are not considered the increasing trend of the time series can considerably diminish the chentianhe reservoir at the xiaoshui basin in the upper reaches of the xiang river had been expanded since 2012 which was officially reoperated in 2017 its total storage capacity was expanded from the original 105 million m3 to 1 51 billion m3 further enhancing the basin s regulation and storage capacity hence the future trend in flood extremes at the xiangtan station might be opposite to the current trend showing consistency with the conclusion of a probably decreasing trend predicted by comprehensively applying the u statistic of tfpw mk and the hurst exponent for the shimen station the current decreasing trend in the flood extremes is primarily attributed to the construction of two large reservoirs jiangya and zaoshi in the basin in 1999 and 2008 respectively with the total storage capacity of 3 18 billion m3 due to the considerably enhanced regulation and storage capacity of the basin since 1999 and the recent absence of heavy precipitation in this region the flood extremes of the basin exhibit a significant decreasing trend however the lishui river basin is a high value region for heavy precipitation li and tan 2020 after the temporary reduction in flood extremes of the basin a possibility of major floods in the future remains persistent 5 conclusions in this study the annual maximum daily flow of 16 hydrological stations acquired over the past 60 years was used to analyze the nonstationary characteristics of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin by utilizing the tfpwmk pettitt and gamlss models furthermore a combination of the u statistic of tfpw mk and the hurst exponent was employed to predict the future trends in flood extremes the main findings of this study are as follows 1 flood extremes from most hydrometric stations in the dongting lake basin show evident variations a decreasing extreme trend is noted in 10 of the 16 stations where seven stations i e chenglingji leiyang dongjiang langli anjiang taoyi and shimen exhibit evident decreases among the remaining six stations with an increasing extreme trend hengdong and taoyi exhibit evident increases the significant decreasing trend in flood extremes is probably attributed to the effect of water conservancy projects the stations showing apparent increases feature few large scale reservoirs in the basins weak regulation storage capacity and marked increase in extreme precipitation 2 nonstationarity exists in the flood extremes obtained from most 9 of 16 hydrometric stations in the dongting lake basin the gamlss model supports that the stations that exhibit important trends change points and mean or variance variations for the nonstationary stations lognormal distribution is the optimal distribution function of annual maximum daily flows and gamma distribution is the optimal distribution function of annual maximum daily flows for the stationary stations 3 the gamlss model that uses time as the explanatory variable provides a good fitting for all the 16 stations in the dongting lake basin however the simulation performance of the nonstationary stations that show significant trends must be improved and physical explanatory variables must be introduced to describe the nonlinear trend variations of the series 4 in the future the flood extremes of most stations in the dongting lake basin will maintain existing trends except for the xiangtan station of xiang river and shimen station of lishui river the flood extremes of the remaining 14 stations will maintain the existing trends the xiangtan station exhibits anti persistence and might show a future decreasing trend whereas the shimen station does not show persistence although the spatiotemporal variations the nonstationary characteristics and future trends of the flood extremes in the dongting lake basin were preferably revealed however this study has some limitations the main factors that affect the nonstationary characteristics of flood extremes in the basin and a method to quantify the contribution of these influencing factors must be further

7796,study region dongting lake basin of china study focus this study aimed to analyze the nonstationary characteristics and future trends of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin the spatiotemporal variations in the flood extremes that occurred over the past 60 years were explored using the trend free prewhitening mk tfpw mk method the nonstationary characteristics of flood extremes were detected using the pettitt test and the nonstationarity analysis was performed using the gamlss model furthermore a combination of tfpw mk and the hurst exponent was employed to predict the future trends in flood extremes new hydrological insights for the region 1 evident variations were observed in the flood extremes from most hydrometric stations among the 10 stations with a decreasing extreme trend seven exhibited evident decreases such decreases probably result from the impact of water conservancy projects among the remaining six stations with an increasing extreme trend two exhibited evident increases such increases probably result from the effect of highly extreme precipitation 2 flood extremes from most 9 of 16 stations showed nonstationarity the lognormal distribution was the optimal distribution of extreme values for nonstationary stations whereas the gamma distribution was the optimal distribution of extreme values for stationary stations despite the preferable fitting efficiency of the gamlss model its simulation performance for nonstationary stations that showed significant trends must be improved 3 the flood extremes of the 14 stations will maintain existing trends in the future the xiangtan station exhibited anti persistence and might show a decreasing trend in the future whereas shimen station did not show persistence graphical

most destructive forces beevers et al 2020 dottori et al 2018 floods threaten human life and the environment moreover floods cause socioeconomic disasters in many parts of the world between 1990 and 2019 china s average annual direct economic loss due to floods was 24 billion usd which accounted for 1 3 of gdp for that period in the united states disaster losses resulting from hurricanes and floods set an all time record of 300 billion usd in 2017 parizi et al 2021 in their forecast analysis of the effects of river flood on the global economy willner et al 2018 found that the risk of river floods will increase because anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions lead to atmospheric warming and the intensification of earth s hydrological cycle frequent global occurrence of flood disasters is closely correlated to the critical changes in the variability and trends of extreme hydrometeorological events lu et al 2020 tegegne et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 according to literature in many watersheds worldwide the time series of flood extremes exhibits nonstationarity in changing contexts ishak et al 2013 lópez and francés 2013 solander et al 2017 wilcox et al 2018 sun et al 2018b 2018a grandry et al 2020 engeland et al 2020 chen et al 2021 milly et al 2015 reported that stationarity is dead in changing context the stationarity assumption is no longer suitable as the default assumption for the assessment of water resource risks the utilization of existing approaches for hydrological process analyses causes the risk of design frequency distortion that results from the changing environment the stationary and nonstationary characteristics of extreme flood events have become sought after topics in the hydroclimate change research sun et al 2018b 2018a zhou 2020 salas and obeysekera 2014 defined the stationary hydrological series as a sequence without trends change points and periodicity because nonstationarity is a concept relative to stationarity a nonstationary hydrological series can be understood as occurring trends change points or periodicity in actual only the trends and change points of hydrological series are considered the mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is one of the most common methods used for analyzing trends according to von storch 1995 the autocorrelation of original data can lead to test result enhancement or reduction to a certain extent von storch accordingly proposed the prewhitening mk pw mk method yue et al 2002 found that for an autocorrelation series with trend items prewhitening processing can lead to the removal of some trend items resulting in the acceptance of invalid assumptions hence they proposed the trend free prewhitening mk tfpw mk method the pettitt test pettitt et al 1979 is one of the most common methods used for testing change points which is widely used in the mutation detection of flood extreme value time series yielding reliable results oluwaseun and vincent 2020 wang et al 2020a 2020b yang et al 2022 rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 developed a nonstationary analytical model the generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss which comprises various families of probability distributions that can flexibly reflect linear and nonlinear relationships between any statistical parameter and the explanatory variable of random variable distribution thereby allowing the diagnosis of the nonstationary characteristics of flood extreme value time series using gamlss chen et al 2021 conducted simulations on the nonstationary characteristics of flood extreme value time series at 158 stations in the uk according to literature gamlss presents high applicability to the nonstationary characteristics of flood extremes in the yangtze pearl and huai river basins of china sun et al 2018b 2018a su and chen 2019 xiong et al 2019 additionally the trend change research on flood extreme time series has mostly focused on current trends mostofi zadeh et al 2020 grandry et al 2020 venegas cordero et al 2022 and future trend has been rarely predicted to forecast the future trends of hydrological time series yu and chen 2008 used the u statistic of the mk method mann 1945 kendall 1975 and hurst exponent hurst 1951 however in calculation of the u statistic by using the mk method the influence of intrinsic data autocorrelation should be considered yue et al 2002 for nonstationary time series a large uncertainty is present in the solution of the hurst exponent zhang et al 2014 dang and molnar 1999 detected the long range dependence in signals by employing variance r s periodogram and wavelet analysis methods indicating that the nonstationarity in signals considerably influenced the detection and estimation of long range dependence estimation with variance and periodogram methods yields poor results which can be easily confused with nonstationary processes with short range dependence by contrast the estimation results obtained with r s and wavelet analysis methods exhibit excellent robustness taqquand and teverovsky 1997 stated that the presence of cycles in time series impacts exponent h estimation with a longer cycle indicating a larger estimation error moreover the estimation results obtained with the aggregated variance method and absolute value method exhibit excellent robustness hence under nonstationary conditions a comprehensive analysis based on multiple methods is required for determining the h value of the hydrological series the yangtze river has the largest basin area in china and the dongting lake basin is one of its chief tributaries the average annual runoff of the dongting lake is approximately 284 40 billion m3 which accounts for approximately 30 runoff of the yangtze river as the lake with the greatest flood regulating action in the yangtze river basin and in china the dongting lake plays a critical role in the regulation and storage of water resources in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river especially for flood control li 2018 studies have reported that highly extreme precipitation events have occurred in the dongting lake basin during 1960 2019 zou et al 2021 li et al 2021a 2021b li et al 2021 and the number of extreme hydrological events has increased considerably kuang and ma 2019 chou and zhang 2020 between 2006 and 2019 in the hunan province covered by the basin the average number of annual disaster victims was 10 415 million with the second rank across china and the average annual flood loss was 2 45 billion usd with the fourth rank across china this information indicates that the dongting lake basin has been facing severe flood disasters additionally anthropogenic activities are intense in the basin where numerous water conservancy projects have been developed until 2019 more than 14 047 reservoirs were developed in the basin with the total storage capacity of higher than 51 4 billion m3 in the dongting lake basin influenced by climate change and anthropogenic activities the hydrological processes have undergone considerable changes however studies have mainly focused on the annual runoff zou et al 2018 jian et al 2019 degree of hydrologic alteration wang et al 2019 and flood frequency under stable conditions wu et al 2019 no reports that address nonstationary characteristics and future trends of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin are available exploring the nonstationary characteristics and future trends of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin is important for reducing natural disaster and managing water resources to achieve this three mk models were selected for trend testing the pettitt test was performed for analyzing change points the gamlss model was selected for nonstationary analyses the future trends were predicted by comprehensively applying the mk u statistic and hurst exponent h the main objectives of this paper are to 1 analyze the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of flood extremes 2 determine the nonstationary characteristics of flood extremes and 3 predict the future trends of flood extremes the outcome of this study can provide scientific support for reducing the effects of extreme flood events in the dongting lake basin 2 data and methods 2 1 data the dongting lake basin located between 24 36 n 30 27 n and 107 26 e 114 20 e occupies an area of 263 000 km2 fig 1 in the basin the water system is well developed and the regional flood composition is extremely complex wu et al 2019 the basin not only presents the inflows of xiang zi yuan and li rivers but also carries and adjusts the water and sediments at the songzi taiping and ouchi mouths of the yangtze river in flood seasons the basin shows distinct features such as short flood duration high flood peak large flood volume and complex river lake relationships in this study the data for the annual maximum daily flow amdf of 16 hydrological stations situated in the dongting lake basin that occurred over the past 60 years were collected the data were obtained from the changjiang water resources commission and hunan provincial bureau of hydrology and water resources survey table 1 and fig 1 present the basic information of these 16 hydrological stations the daily precipitation records of 119 meteorological stations for 1959 2019 were obtained from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn fig 1 the daily precipitation records of 21 precipitation stations for 1959 2019 were obtained from the hunan provincial bureau of hydrology and water resources survey fig 1 furthermore the data of the characteristic parameters of major large reservoirs developed in the dongting lake were collected the data were obtained from the water resources department of hunan province fig 1 2 2 methods 2 2 1 trend analysis 1 mk the mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 a nonparametric method recommended by the world meteorological organization is widely used in the trend test of time series for hydrometeorological elements the u statistic of the mk test obeys a normal distribution positive and negative u statistic indicate the upward and downward trends of the series respectively the absolute u values of 1 96 and 1 64 indicated that the test passed at the significance levels of 0 05 and 0 1 respectively in this study the significance level was set to 0 1 to enhance the possible error of trend analysis resulting from the autocorrelation effect of hydrological series von storch 1995 and yue et al 2002 have proposed the pw mk and tfpw mk tests respectively in this study the evolutionary trends of flood extremes at the 16 control stations in the dongting lake basin were comparatively analyzed using the three mk models to identify a flood extreme trend detection method adapted to the characteristics of the studied basin the specific calculation principles of the three mk models are available in the literature su et al 2018 2 cox stuart to avoid the uncertainty of trend analysis calculation based on a single method the cox stuart test cox and stuart 1955 a nonparametric test that can be used to detect trends in the independent time series data was employed for a comparative analysis the statistical quantity is defined as follows 1a s cs s cs n 6 n 12 where s cs represents the maximum number of symbols calculated with the following formula 1b s cs max j i n 3 1 sgn x n n 3 i x i j j 1 0 1 where n 3 indicates the smallest integer greater than n 3 and 1 indicates the dirac measure the test data asymptotically follow a normal distribution whose significance level has lower power than that of the mk test militino et al 2020 2 2 2 change point analysis the pettitt method can be employed as a nonparametric approach to diagnose the change points following any distribution time series and obtain their significance level in a statistical sense this method has been well applied to the change point test of hydrometeorological elements in the major river basins worldwide oluwaseun and vincent 2020 wang et al 2020a 2020b yang et al 2022 for a hydrological time series y 1 y 2 y n of length n the statistic ut n is defined as follows 2a u t n i 1 t j t 1 n s g n y j y i 1 t n where 2b sgn 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 the most probable change point t is estimated as follows 2c t max 1 t n u t n to examine whether t is significant the significance level of the statistic ut n is estimated using the following formula 2d p 2 exp 6 u t n 2 n 2 n 3 2 2 3 gamlss model the gamlss model was proposed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 to evaluate the stationarity and nonstationarity of a time series in the gamlss model suppose there are n number of independent observations y i i 1 n which follow f y y i θ i distribution in this case θ i corresponds to the location parameter e g mean mn and median the scale parameter e g variance var and mean square and the shape parameter e g skewness coefficient and kurtosis coefficient where θ i t θ i 1 θ i 2 θ ik represents the k parameter position scale and shape vector and k is usually less than 4 the formula is as follows 3a g k θ k x k β k j m h jk x jk where θ k is a vector of length n x k is an n m matrix of explanatory variables and β k is a vector of parameters of length m h jk represents the functional relationship between the distribution parameters and explanatory variables x jk without considering the impact of random effects on the distribution parameters eq 3a can be expressed as follows 3b g k θ k x k β k the stationarity of mean and variance that correspond to the location and scale parameters respectively was evaluated considering t as the only explanatory variable a linear function was established to link the mean θ 1 and variance θ 2 eq 3b can be re written as follows 3c g 1 θ 1 t β 1 3d g 2 θ 2 t β 2 during the construction of gamlss eight probability distribution functions commonly used in the hydrologic field were utilized as the distribution functions of flood extreme value time series table 2 the distribution trend of the residual plot can help determine whether the fitted linear model meets the relevant assumptions and the status of the residual sequence distribution is important for evaluating the model fitting effect sun et al 2018b 2018a chen et al 2021 thus the residual worm residual normal qq and percentile plots were used to evaluate whether the hydrological series followed the alternative probability distribution function additionally the akaike information criterion aic was used to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of alternative models akaike 1974 the smaller the aic values the better the fitting effect all calculations were performed using the gamlss package from the r library rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 2 2 4 prediction of future trends to envisage the future trend variations of flood extreme value time series the mk u statistic mann 1945 kendall 1975 and hurst exponent h hurst 1951 were used to forecast the future trends in the hydrological series yu and chen 2008 first the h value was acquired to denote the persistence or anti persistence characteristics of the series when h 0 5 the series was completely independent when 0 h 0 5 the future changes were in contrast with the past changes indicating anti persistence the smaller the value of h the stronger the anti persistence by contrast when h 0 5 the future changes were consistent with the past changes indicating persistence the larger the value of h the stronger the persistence afterwards the time series trends were analyzed using the mk method finally the future trend characteristics were obtained by combining the two statistics table 3 presents the future trend characteristics of the series obtained by applying the two methods studies have shown that for nonstationary time series a large uncertainty is observed in the h value solution thus in this study a combination of r s aggregated variance and absolute value methods was used to analyze and determine the h value the detailed calculation principles of the three methods are available in the literature jiang and deng 2004 3 results 3 1 trend and change point analyses of flood extremes 3 1 1 trend analysis the three mk models and the cox stuart model were used to analyze the variation trends of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin in the changing environment table 4 presents the results the variation trends of flood extremes at various stations revealed by the three mk models are the same albeit slight differences in the significance level the stations with relatively large differences include leiyang dongjiang and langli the pw mk method attained greater correction of the original data autocorrelation than the tfpw mk method from the comparison of the calculation results with those obtained using the cox stuart model the significance level of the cox stuart model is close to that of mk and tfpw mk the significance levels of mk tfpw mk and cox stuart models are p 0 1 thus the pw mk method over corrects the autocorrelation of the original data with significant trends a conclusion consistent with that reached by yue et al 2002 in this study the tfpw mk method was used to analyze the trends of flood extremes at various stations the tfpw mk results table 4 and fig 2 a showed that the flood extremes of 63 stations exhibited a decreasing trend five stations namely leiyang dongjiang langli anjiang and shimen showed a significant downward trend at p 0 1 the flood extremes of 37 stations exhibited an increasing trend however only the taoyi station showed a significant upward trend at p 0 1 the stations with a significant extreme value trends are concentrated in the xiang and yuan rivers 3 1 2 change point analysis according to the change point test results presented in table 4 most stations underwent change points in the 1990 s and 2000 s however only six stations i e leiyang dongjiang langli anjiang taoyi and shimen showed significant change points at the p 0 1 level the comparison presented in table 4 reveals that in the dongting lake basin significant change points are detected using the pettitt method for all stations with significant trend variations which can be determined by employing the tfpw mk method all stations with a significant variation trend at the p 0 1 level undergo a significant change point at the same level based on the results of both trend and change point tests the flood extreme value time series of the six stations are preliminarily identified to exhibit nonstationarity 3 2 nonstationarity analysis of flood extremes 3 2 1 nonstationarity diagnosis of flood extremes for stations without significant temporal trends and change points the gamlss model was used to detect the nonstationary features of time series and the aic method was used to select the optimal model table 5 presents the results for stations without change points the gamma distribution is the optimal choice which is suitable for fitting the simulation of the annual maximum daily flow for five stations logno is the best candidate for three stations whereas weibull is the best choice for two stations from the perspective of series stationarity seven stations have the stationarity model as the optimal model one station has θ 1 as the nonstationary model and two stations have θ 2 as the nonstationary model however no station selects θ 1 and θ 2 both of which are nonstationary variables the aic values differ insignificantly between the nonstationary and stationary models even for chenglingji showing a large difference the aic value of the nonstationary model is only 1 6 less than that of the stationary model for all three nonstationary stations the aic value difference between the nonstationary and stationary models ranges between 0 8 and 1 6 the aic value clearly indicates that for the stations without change points the difference between stationary and nonstationary models is not evident thus the gamlss simulations do not show inconsistencies with the results of trend and change point analyses suggesting the absence of an evident linear trend in the aforementioned stations without change points for the stations with significant temporal trends and change points gamlss was used to detect the nonstationary features of the time series and the aic method was utilized to select the optimal model table 6 presents the results all the stations with significant trends and change points identified through tfpw mk and pettit s tests exhibited mean or variance variation which was confirmed through gamlss the lognormal distribution is optimal for change points the aic values differ largely between the nonstationary and stationary models such inter model differences in the aic value range between 2 and 28 and the aic values support the gamlss results thus the gamlss fitting results are consistent with the findings of trend and change point analyses indicating that the aforementioned stations with significant trends and change points show evident linear trends according to the results of the gamlss model tables 5 and 6 nine stations namely chenglingji leiyang dongjiang langli taojiang taoyuan anjiang taoyi and shimen in the dongting lake basin show nonstationary flood extremes 3 2 2 goodness of fit evaluation of gamlss model to quantitatively evaluate the model performance as shown in tables 5 and 6 for analyzing the annual maximum daily flow at related stations analysis of residuals by gamlss was done as illustrated in fig 3 the sample points of different stations are distributed along the red curve and located in the middle of two black curves 95 ci suggesting a preferable fitting effect of gamlss for the 16 stations fig 3 to reflect the residual distribution a normal qq plot of the residuals is presented in fig 4 four nonstationary stations with significant temporal trends namely leiyang dongjiang anjiang and taoyi show numerous residual points that deviate from the theoretical line for the remaining 12 stations the residual points of the normal qq plot fitted using gamlss that are distributed along the theoretical line are fundamentally consistent moreover the probability plot correlation coefficient r is considerably close to 1 indicating a strong correlation between the actual and theoretical residual sequences thus for residual distribution the optimal fitting function selected using gamlss which employs time as the explanatory variable shows a good fitting effect on the 16 stations in the dongting lake basin based on gamlss the optimal fitting results of the time series for annual maximum daily flow were obtained tables 5 and 6 the percentile plots fig 5 are drawn according to the parameter calculations after this calculation the actual frequency values falling under each quantile graph were counted table 7 the frequency distribution is reasonable for the seven stationary stations except for the guiyang station at 50 xiangxiang station at 25 and pushi station at 75 which show large deviations moreover the actual frequency and theoretical probability falling under each quantile graph are low with deviations of less than 5 among the nine nonstationary stations six stations i e chenglingji leiyang langli taojiang taoyuan and shimen exhibit the maximum quantile differences of less than 5 suggesting a suitable simulation effect however dongjiang anjiang and taoyi stations show differences of up to 7 1 8 9 and 7 4 respectively in the 25 50 and 50 quantiles respectively where the actual frequency distribution is not quite reasonable hence for the percentile plot the optimal fitting function selected using gamlss which uses time as the explanatory variable shows a good fitting effect on the 16 stations in the dongting lake basin however the simulation performance for the nonstationary stations showing a significant trend needs to be improved 3 2 3 gamlss model based flood extreme trend analysis as revealed by the variation trend analysis of flood extremes at various stations based on the respective percentile plots fig 5 no evident variations are present in the quantile graphs of the seven stationary stations overall the gamlss model based trend analyses are consistent with the previous results obtained using the tfpw mk method among the nine nonstationary stations for chenglingji taojiang and taoyuan 5 and 25 quantiles show an apparent downward trend despite an evident upward trend for 95 quantile although the low frequency floods are intensifying the high frequency floods are weakening for the dongjiang langli and shimen stations 75 and 95 quantiles present an apparent downward trend that is the extreme values of low frequency floods tend to decrease considerably indicating fundamental consistency with the previous results of trend analysis for the taoyi station 50 75 and 95 quantiles present an evident upward trend the flood extremes tend to increase markedly showing fundamental consistency with the previous results of the trend analysis for leiyang and anjiang stations 5 and 25 quantiles present a downward trend and 75 and 95 quantiles exhibit an evident upward trend although the low frequency floods are intensifying the high frequency floods are weakening as for the nine nonstationary stations the overall gamlss model based trend analysis results are also consistent with the previous results obtained using the tfpw mk method thus the trend analysis based on gamlss yields accurate results which enables detailed analysis of the changes in flood extremes for each quantile 3 3 prediction of future trends in flood extremes by applying the u statistic of tfpw mk and h values the future trends of the flood extreme value time series for the 16 stations in the dongting lake basin were predicted the results are shown in table 8 and fig 6 the hurst exponents calculated from r s aggregated variance and absolute value methods differ slightly in magnitude but are fundamentally identical in regularity table 8 only the h values calculated using the aggregated variance method for three stations i e hengdong leiyang and xiangxiang are inconsistent with the calculations performed using the r s and absolute value methods based on the combination of u statistic and h value table 8 except for the xiangtan station of xiang river and shimen station of lishui river the flood extremes of the remaining 14 stations can maintain the existing trends where 4 stations i e dongjiang taojiang anjiang and taoyi exhibit strong persistent the xiangtan station of xiang river exhibits anti persistence and might present a downward trend in the future the h values of the shimen station calculated using various methods considerably differed considering the uncertainty of the h value of nonstationary stations calculated using the aggregated variance method and the strong robustness of the r s method the future trend in flood extremes of shimen station was analyzed by utilizing the h value acquired from the r s method the h value of the r s method was 0 49 nearly approaching 0 5 this suggests that the series will fundamentally not show a persistent effect in the future table 8 details the future trends of the remaining stations 4 discussion 4 1 causes of significant variations in flood extremes in the dongting lake basin the results of flood extreme trend analysis show that over the past 60 years the flood extremes in the dongting lake basin have mainly exhibited a decreasing trend whereas some stations have presented an increasing trend precipitation and water conservancy projects are the most crucial factors that affect flood extremes the daily precipitation data of the 119 meteorological stations and 21 precipitation stations were collected for the dongting lake basin and the daily areal precipitation processes of eight stations with substantial trend variations were obtained using the arithmetic mean method according to the 1 15 day accumulated antecedent precipitation aap of the flood extreme value of the eight stations the pearson method was used to select the most relevant accumulated antecedent precipitation fig 7 and the tffpw mk and pettitt were used to analyze the trend and mutation respectively of the most relevant accumulated antecedent precipitation table 9 fig 8 shows the annual most relevant accumulated antecedent precipitation of eight stations in the dongting lake basin numerous water conservancy projects developed in the basin might be a major cause for the reduced flood extremes thus we recorded the features of large reservoirs built in the watersheds where the six stations with a significant downward trend in flood extremes are located table 10 to determine the effect of reservoir regulation and storage on the downstream flood runoff processes the dimensionless reservoir index ri which assumed that the regulation of runoff processes by reservoirs is positively correlated with the storage capacity and catchment area of reservoirs proposed by lópez and francés 2013 was used the specific computational formula is as follows 4a ri i 1 n a i a t c i c t where ai and at respectively denote the control areas of the i th reservoir and hydrometric station ci is the total storage capacity of the i th reservoir and ct is the annual average runoff of the hydrometric station fig 9 displays the yearly reservoir coefficient statistics of six stations in the dongting lake basin this study discusses eight stations with a significant increasing or decreasing trend namely chenglingji hengdong leiyang dongjiang langli anjiang taoyi and shimen the details are as follows the incoming water of chenglingji a control station in the dongting lake basin is influenced by not only the four rivers but also the diversion at the three mouths of the yangtze river however the three gorges reservoir a large reservoir developed on the yangtze mainstream in 2003 with a total storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 has been officially put into operation in the absence of evident inflow changes in the four rivers the average total flood peak discharge at the three mouths of the yangtze river decreased by 28 su et al 2018 however in the basin above the station precipitation showed an increasing trend table 9 and fig 8 thus the construction of the three gorges reservoir may be the main reason for the downward trend presented by the flood extremes of the chenglingji station the flood extremes of leiyang station exhibit a significant downward trend which is probably attributed to the construction of dongjiang reservoir in the basin in 1985 with a total storage capacity of up to 9 27 billion m3 table 10 the reservoir has significantly enhanced the basin s regulation and storage capacity fig 9 in addition the year with abrupt flood change is fundamentally consistent with the year of the dongjiang reservoir impoundment however in the basin above the station precipitation showed an increasing trend table 9 and fig 8 therefore the construction of the dongjiang reservoir may be the main reason for the downward trend presented by the flood extremes of the leiyang station moreover the flood extremes of the dongjiang station exhibit a considerable downward trend which can be attributed to the construction of the dongjiang reservoir in the basin in 1985 the dongjiang reservoir is located about 12 km upstream of dongjiang station which is a multi year regulating reservoir fig 9 affected by the regulation and storage of dongjiang reservoir the flood extremes of dongjiang station decreases significantly therefore the construction of the dongjiang reservoir is the main reason for the downward trend presented by the flood extremes of the dongjiang station the significant trend of flood decrease at the langli station might also be affected by reservoir construction in 1992 the zhushuqiao reservoir was built in the basin with a total storage capacity of 278 million m3 table 10 after which the basin s regulation and storage capacity has remarkably enhanced fig 9 the year with abrupt flood change is fundamentally consistent with the year of the zhushuqiao reservoir impoundment meanwhile in the basin above the station precipitation showed the decreasing trend table 9 and fig 8 therefore the flood extremes of the langli station are affected by the combined effect of precipitation and water conservancy projects by contrast the flood extremes of the hengdong station show an evident increasing trend after 1959 only two large reservoirs qingshanlong and taoshui were built in the basin with an overall storage capacity of only 641 million m3 table 10 the catchment area controlled by the hengdong station is up to 10 082 km2 and the basin s regulation and storage capacity is considerably small fig 9 however in the basin above the station precipitation shows an increasing trend table 9 and fig 8 therefore the evident increasing trend in the flood extremes of the hengdong station probably results from extreme precipitation the flood extremes of the anjiang station also exhibit evident consistency with reservoir construction the sanbanxi reservoir and tuokou reservoir were built in 2006 and 2014 respectively at the basin upstream of the station with an overall storage capacity of 5 48 billion m3 table 10 after which the basin s regulation and storage capacity has significantly enhanced fig 9 the year with abrupt flood change is fundamentally consistent with the year of the sanbanxi reservoir impoundment however in the basin above the station precipitation shows an increasing trend table 9 and fig 8 therefore the significant decrease in flood extremes of the anjiang station is likely to be affected by reservoir regulation and storage in the case of the taoyi station no large controlled reservoir has been built at the chenshui tributary basin of yuan river where it is located however in the basin above the station precipitation shows a considerable increasing trend table 9 and fig 8 additionally the river channels in the chenshui tributary basin have steep slopes and the basin has suffered many floods recently thus the evident increasing trend in the flood extremes of taoyi station is primarily caused by extreme precipitations the flood extremes of the shimen station have exhibited a significant decreasing trend recently which is attributable to the construction of two large reservoirs jiangya and zaoshi in the basin in 1999 and 2008 respectively with an overall storage capacity of 3 18 billion m3 table 10 after 1999 the basin s regulation and storage capacity has increased remarkably fig 9 the flood extremes of the basin also exhibited a significant decreasing trend after 1999 meanwhile in the basin above the station precipitation shows the decreasing trend table 9 and fig 8 therefore the flood extremes of the shimen station are affected by the combined effect of precipitation and water conservancy projects in summary the stations showing significant decreases in flood extremes in the dongting lake basin are likely to be affected by the water conservancy projects and those showing significant increases are characterized by few large scale reservoir projects weak regulation storage capacity and a marked increase in extreme precipitations 4 2 nonstationarity diagnosis and simulation effect of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin according to the results of the gamlss model tables 5 and 6 the flood extremes of nine stations i e chenglingji leiyang dongjiang langli taojiang taoyuan anjiang taoyi and shimen are nonstationary among them the flood extremes of seven stations namely chenglingji leiyang dongjiang langli anjiang taoyi and shimen exhibit an evident upward or downward trend and their nonstationarity is caused by the significant temporal trend as for the remaining two stations i e taojiang and taoyuan the analysis results obtained for stationary and nonstationarity models differ slightly where the nonstationarity is probably caused by the periodic trend from the perspectives of residual distribution and percentile plot the optimal fitting function selected using the gamlss model which uses time as the explanatory variable shows a suitable fitting effect on the 16 stations in the dongting lake basin however the simulation performance for the nonstationary stations such as dongjiang and taoyi stations which show a significant trend must be improved because by simply establishing the functional relationship between the statistical parameters of hydrological series and the time variable only the overall trend variations of the series can be described and the description of their jumping abrupt changes is disallowed from the percentile plots in fig 5 the dongjiang station shows a jumping decreasing trend and the taoyi station exhibits a jumping increasing trend thus the extreme value distribution of the gamlss model which only uses time as the explanatory variable might cause deviations in the distribution of station frequency curves which probably necessitates the introduction of physical explanatory variables for describing the nonlinear trend variations of the series li and tan 2015 furthermore in the absence of physical causal correlation between the time variables and hydrological series it is impossible to explain the causes of the series nonstationarity and their rates of contribution to the nonstationarity li et al 2017 zhou 2020 wang et al 2020b 4 3 future prediction results of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin as revealed by the future trend predictions of flood extremes table 8 the xiangtan and shimen stations undergo changes in future trends and the remaining 14 stations maintain the existing trends the increasing trend in flood extremes of xiangjiang station might be associated with the successive occurrence of the fourth largest and largest floods in 2017 and 2019 respectively kuang and ma 2019 chou and zhang 2020 if the extreme values of these two floods are not considered the increasing trend of the time series can considerably diminish the chentianhe reservoir at the xiaoshui basin in the upper reaches of the xiang river had been expanded since 2012 which was officially reoperated in 2017 its total storage capacity was expanded from the original 105 million m3 to 1 51 billion m3 further enhancing the basin s regulation and storage capacity hence the future trend in flood extremes at the xiangtan station might be opposite to the current trend showing consistency with the conclusion of a probably decreasing trend predicted by comprehensively applying the u statistic of tfpw mk and the hurst exponent for the shimen station the current decreasing trend in the flood extremes is primarily attributed to the construction of two large reservoirs jiangya and zaoshi in the basin in 1999 and 2008 respectively with the total storage capacity of 3 18 billion m3 due to the considerably enhanced regulation and storage capacity of the basin since 1999 and the recent absence of heavy precipitation in this region the flood extremes of the basin exhibit a significant decreasing trend however the lishui river basin is a high value region for heavy precipitation li and tan 2020 after the temporary reduction in flood extremes of the basin a possibility of major floods in the future remains persistent 5 conclusions in this study the annual maximum daily flow of 16 hydrological stations acquired over the past 60 years was used to analyze the nonstationary characteristics of flood extremes in the dongting lake basin by utilizing the tfpwmk pettitt and gamlss models furthermore a combination of the u statistic of tfpw mk and the hurst exponent was employed to predict the future trends in flood extremes the main findings of this study are as follows 1 flood extremes from most hydrometric stations in the dongting lake basin show evident variations a decreasing extreme trend is noted in 10 of the 16 stations where seven stations i e chenglingji leiyang dongjiang langli anjiang taoyi and shimen exhibit evident decreases among the remaining six stations with an increasing extreme trend hengdong and taoyi exhibit evident increases the significant decreasing trend in flood extremes is probably attributed to the effect of water conservancy projects the stations showing apparent increases feature few large scale reservoirs in the basins weak regulation storage capacity and marked increase in extreme precipitation 2 nonstationarity exists in the flood extremes obtained from most 9 of 16 hydrometric stations in the dongting lake basin the gamlss model supports that the stations that exhibit important trends change points and mean or variance variations for the nonstationary stations lognormal distribution is the optimal distribution function of annual maximum daily flows and gamma distribution is the optimal distribution function of annual maximum daily flows for the stationary stations 3 the gamlss model that uses time as the explanatory variable provides a good fitting for all the 16 stations in the dongting lake basin however the simulation performance of the nonstationary stations that show significant trends must be improved and physical explanatory variables must be introduced to describe the nonlinear trend variations of the series 4 in the future the flood extremes of most stations in the dongting lake basin will maintain existing trends except for the xiangtan station of xiang river and shimen station of lishui river the flood extremes of the remaining 14 stations will maintain the existing trends the xiangtan station exhibits anti persistence and might show a future decreasing trend whereas the shimen station does not show persistence although the spatiotemporal variations the nonstationary characteristics and future trends of the flood extremes in the dongting lake basin were preferably revealed however this study has some limitations the main factors that affect the nonstationary characteristics of flood extremes in the basin and a method to quantify the contribution of these influencing factors must be further investigated this will also be our topic for future research credit authorship contribution statement yunpeng gao conceptualization methodology writing original draft investigation results analysis

hence this study aimed to delineate groundwater potential zones through an integrated approach of remote sensing geographical information system gis and analytical hierarchy process ahp in the gobele watershed numerous factors like rainfall geology land use land cover slope soil types drainage density lineament density and topographic wetness index were considered to demarcate groundwater recharge the relative weight of each factor was determined using ahp ultimately all thematic layers were aggregated by a weighted sum overly analysis in a gis environment to map groundwater potential zones using relative weights derived from the ahp finally to verify the result of the model was validated with 30 observed springs and well yield new hydrological insights the distribution of groundwater potential zones was spatially varied in that a high groundwater recharge zone covers 2 4 of the watershed a moderate 93 7 and a low 3 9 the validation analysis revealed a 90 agreement between the groundwater inventory data and the developed groundwater potential zone hence the results are reliable and enable water users and decision makers to sustainably utilize the available groundwater in

et al 2022 melese and belay 2022 have assessed groundwater potential in different parts of ethiopian river basin on the other hand few study has conducted in wabe shebele river basin the wabe shebele river basin is commonly known with surface water scant area gobele watershed is one of wabe shebele river basin which is limited with surface water the dramatically increment of population number from time to time in wabe shebelle river basin creates competition over available surface water for irrigation activities and others purpose adank et al 2008 ayala et al 2018 besides this the land use land cover and climate change woldemariam and harka 2020 abebe et al 2021 hirko et al 2021 brought challenge on available surface water thus to alleviate this water demand problems exploitation of groundwater in the gobele watershed is vital for the region as well as the country however the exploitation of groundwater in the study area was previously conducted using drill holes which is costly and tedious hence this study employed an analytical hierarchy process ahp guided gis to qualitatively investigate and compare groundwater potential zones by aggregating the most influencing factors in this research the ahp technique was used for the first time to identify the geospatial dispersal of groundwater recharge zones across the study area furthermore the relative importance of the multiple geospatial parameters was generated based on their contribution to groundwater recharge in the watershed finally observed spring and well yield data were used to verify the model performance the findings of the study will enable water users and decision makers to visualize and evaluate the current groundwater balance and predict its future status in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study was carried out in the gobele watershed located in the wabe shebelle basin ethiopia the watershed extends from 8 40 10 to 9 20 34 north and 41 41 10 to 42 11 30 east with a total area of 2804 7 km2 it has diverse topographic features with an elevation range from 957 to 3387 m above mean sea level amsl fig 1 two rainy seasons major in the summer season june september and minor in february may are common in watersheds woldemariam et al 2018 harka et al 2021 gurara et al 2021a b 2022 the watershed has a tropical climate with a mean annual temperature varying from 15 to 25 and an average annual precipitation from 1990 to 2019 of nearly 832 mm the geology of the gobele watershed is underlain by basalt and tuff sandston lime and undifferentiated aquifer materials fig 3e the hydrology in the study area is characterized by factors such as surface flow from the watershed groundwater recharge rate that is dependent upon the quantity of excess rainfall evapotranspiration soil characteristics texture and structure and bedrock permeability all these affect groundwater yield to wells springs and river channels that drain the watershed the geomorphology of the study area is characterized by colluvial with patches of alluvial deposits along the streams in general lithologically the watershed is dominated by gneiss and schist along with granitic and pegmatitic intrusions in the lower parts of the watershed irrigation water demand and domestic use in the middle parts are highly needed in the middle parts of the study area there is high competition for crop water requirements in recent times despite several springs and wells have been investigated and extracted with the local authority to balance domestic water demand there is water scarcity which needs immediate solution the methodology used in this study is shown in fig 2 2 2 data sets and sources in this research after we extensively reviewed important literature jha et al 2010 magesh et al 2012 fashae et al 2014 i p senanayake et al 2016 sener et al 2018 maity and mandal 2019 etikala et al 2019 abijitha et al 2020 achu et al 2020 murmu et al 2020 lentswe et al 2020 mahato et al 2021 pathmanandakumar et al 2021 rajasekhar et al 2021 sapkota et al 2021 ewunetu et al 2021 regarding with groundwater potential assessment the most important factors such as soil lulc rainfall geology lineament density slope gradient drainage density and topographic wetness index twi were considered in this study these data were collected from different sources for instance the 20 years of rainfall data 2000 2019 of 12 meteorological stations were collected from the national meteorology agency of ethiopia soil data was obtained from the ministry of water and energy of ethiopia the lulc data available at a spatial resolution of 10 х 10 m was downloaded from esri lulc 2020 the geology was obtained from the ethiopian geological survey drainage density twi and slope maps were generated using a digital elevation model with a 12 5 m spatial resolution that was downloaded from the advanced land observation satellite alos moreover the lineament density was derived from landsat 8 oli tirs imagery and alos dem at 12 5 m resolution this landsat 8 oli tirs of january 2022 was downloaded from https earthexplorer usgs gov furthermore the observed borehole data was collected from the local authority office to validate the model following the assignment of relative weights using multi criteria evaluation mce techniques further processes were carried out in arcgis 2 3 thematic layers preparation in this research the assessment of groundwater potential zones was achieved through integrating rainfall soil property geology and lineament density slope gradient drainage density lulc and twi in the gis environment as described below each thematic layer was prepared in raster format and finally projected with a 12 5 m spatial resolution in a gis environment 2 3 1 rainfall rainfall is the major hydrological source for groundwater recharge ahmed et al 2021 allafta et al 2021 which also determines its fluctuation agarwal and garg 2016 the heavy rainfall intensity produces high groundwater recharge thomas et al 2016 kotchoni et al 2019 he et al 2021 the rainfall map was prepared using the inverse distance weight method tool in gis the mean annual rainfall of gobele watershed exists between 425 4 mm and 953 2 mm fig 3h 2 3 2 soils soil influences the infiltration rate which in turn has an impact on groundwater recharge can highly impact the infiltration rate and deep percolation into an aquifer anbazhagan and ramasamy 2006 etikala et al 2019 soil properties grain size shape structural arrangement and the pore space can significantly influence the movement of groundwater musa et al 2017 gomboš et al 2019 coarse grained soils have high infiltration potential and result in high groundwater recharge relative to fine soils nolan and taber 2007 there are seven types of soils within the study area namely eutric luvisol eutric leptosol calcaric leptosol eutric vertosol hapalic luvisols and rhodic nitisol fig 3f in that sequence with the north west dominated by the coarser sandy soils while the finer clay soils are common in the north east fao 1985 2 3 3 land use land cover land use land cover is an important factor that affects the occurrence availability and recharge of groundwater li et al 2018 dibaba et al 2020 yifru et al 2021 and affects the quantity of water that merges into groundwater benavides et al 2018 mireille et al 2019 yimer et al 2008 in the study area the common lulc area were forest shrubland grass land crop land bare land built up area settlement and water body fig 3g the occurrence of groundwater is less in bare land compare to forest and agricultural areas lamichhane and shakya 2020 ouyang et al 2019 similarly the land cover map was obtained from esri lulc 2020 most of the watershed area is covered by cropland and grassland lulc types 2 3 4 geology lithology lithological properties determine porosity and the movement of groundwater ayazi et al 2010 higher porosity of lithology produces higher groundwater storage the study area consists of various types of geological features such as in the gobele watershed basalts and tuff sandston lime limestone and a rocky undifferentiated aquifer fig 3e 2 3 5 lineament density the lineaments are natural linear fractures in the form of faults joints and fractures agarwal and garg 2016 it represents the total length of lineaments in a unit area as expressed in eq 1 yeh et al 2016 enoh et al 2021 and also influences secondary porosity and permeability lineament density is considered an important indicator for the identification of groundwater recharge zones şener et al 2018 siddi raju et al 2019 groundwater recharge is influenced by the arrangement of lineaments in relation to the surface water bodies or where lineaments intersect babiker and gudmundsson 2004 gupta et al 2012 rajaveni et al 2014 the high lineament density corresponds to high groundwater recharge naghibi et al 2017 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 sapkota et al 2021 two methods are available to extract lineaments from satellite images however for accuracy and user friendliness automatic lineament extraction is more preferable weerasekera et al 2014 thus this study adopted automatic extraction of the linear structure of lineament from both landsat 8 oli tirs imagery and alos dem using the line tool in pci geomatica software version 12 0 geomatica 2018 then these derived linear structures were saved as shapefile shp in utm coordinates and imported into arcgis software to create a lineament density map using the line density tool of the spatial analyst toolbox the final lineament density map was created by overlaying the lineament map with the arcgis overlay analysis tool multiple berhanu and hatiye 2020 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 sapkota et al 2021 studies use this method to extract lineament density accordingly the lineament density of gobele watershed ranged from 0 to 3 87km km2 fig 3a 2 3 6 drainage density drainage density is defined as the closeness of the spacing of stream channels sar et al 2015 it is the measurement of the total length of the stream segment of all orders per unit area berhanu and hatiye 2020 doke et al 2021 rahmati et al 2015 the drainage pattern and density provide valuable information about groundwater occurrences rajaveni et al 2014 the dem was used to drive the drainage network which further required preparing a drainage density map the drainage density is inversely proportional to the groundwater potential naidu et al 2015 thus an area with a high drainage density has a lower recharge rate whereas low drainage density areas have a higher recharge rate rajaveni et al 2014 drainage density map of study area was generated by line density tool of spatial analyst toolbox in arcgis 10 2 it varied from 0 to 1 74km km2 fig 3b 2 3 7 slope the slope gradient directly influences groundwater recharge harry et al 2020 and it is widely used for the delineation of gwpzs magesh et al 2012 it is a very essential terrain parameter that shows the steepness of the ground surface the flat slope has the highest infiltration capacity hagos and andualem 2021 melese and belay 2022 thapa et al 2017 and the steeper the slope the higher runoff and lower groundwater recharge naghibi et al 2017 singh et al 2019 the rank was assigned to each slope class depending on their groundwater potential the slope of gobele watershed extend from 0 to 78 fig 3d 2 3 8 topographic wetness index twi r sorensen et al 2006 show that twi is highly correlated with soil moisture and groundwater level the higher the value of twi the higher the groundwater potential naghibi et al 2017 studies have shown that high twi areas have high groundwater potential while low twi areas have low groundwater potential mallick et al 2019 the twi was computed using the following eq 1 developed by moore and nieber 1989 1 t w i ln a s tan β the twi of gobele watershed varied from 0 to 26 15 fig 3c 2 4 assigning relative weight all indicators have different contributions to the occurrence and groundwater recharge hachem et al 2015 yeh et al 2016 arulbalaji et al 2019 their relative weight is determined by adopting the ahp method based on their influence and significance to recharge saaty 2008a ahp is used as a decision making tool in problems involving complex parameters and areas with scarce data in quantity and quality saaty and vargas 2012 jozaghi et al 2018 asadabadi et al 2019 expert judgment and eigenvector are needed to assign weight and order while principal eigenvalue is used to rank the factors carver 1991 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 malczewski 2006 the hydrogeologist expert was invited from the local authority office to determine the relative importance of indicators based on saaty s scale values table 1 the eigenvector indicates the relative weights of each of the indicators brunelli 2015 and is computed by dividing column values by column sum as shown in table 1 saaty 2008a the sum of eigenvalues principal eigenvalue λ max measures the consistency of the matrix brunelli 2015 a pairwise comparison matrix n n was generated based on the input factors each entry indicates the influence of the row relative on the column factor the reliability of the pairwise comparison matrix is checked by comparing the λ max values with several thematic layers incorporated into it the total parameters should be less than λ max values a certain level of inconsistency may occur during the pairwise decision of indicators thus it is very essential to check the accuracy of the assigned weight during pairwise comparison the ahp method incorporates a consistency index to measure deviation because the matrix deviation increases with an increasing comparison number saaty and vargas 2012 in weight determination a consistency ratio of less than 0 1 10 is acceptable mundalik et al 2018 rajasekhar et al 2021 otherwise relative weights of each indicator should be re assigned to reduce inconsistency saaty and vargas 2012 saaty 2008b 1986 the consistency index ci is the ratio of the difference between λ max and the number of indicators involved as shown in eq 2 tables 2 and 3 2 ci λ max n n 1 3 cr ci ri where ci is consistency index cr is consistency ratio ri is a random index table 4 n number of parameters involved λmax is principal eigenvalue fig 4 indicates the weight of each thematic layer incorporated in the analysis and shows that lithology was the most influential indicator 32 in determining the groundwater potential zone the lineament density 23 and the slope 16 were observed to be the second and third most influential parameters respectively on the other hand the lulc 2 2 and rainfall 3 3 is considered the least influential factors in delineating groundwater recharge areas according to table 5 the λ max value of this study was 8 40 which is greater than the number of indicators and its consistency ratio of 0 041 was also within the tolerance limit 0 1 indicating that the consistency in the pair wise comparison and assigned weight are both acceptable among the considered parameters lithology and lineament density are the first and second most influential groundwater occurrence indicators respectively table 4 2 5 thematic layers integration through weighted overlay each indicator was reclassified to a common ratio scale and integrated to produce a map of the groundwater potential index within the gobele watershed all reclassified raster maps of preferred parameters were overlaid in the weighted overlay analysis tool finally the weighted values of each raster layer are multiplied by the cell score of each input raster eq 4 further groundwater potential zones are classified based on gwpi value jha et al 2010 etikala et al 2019 murmu et al 2020 sapkota et al 2021 gwpi is a dimensionless quantity computed from both the weights of each thematic layer and its features mathematically gwpi was calculated using eq 4 jha et al 2010 andualem and demeke 2019 sapkota et al 2021 4 gwpi i 1 n wi x i where gwpi is the potential groundwater index n is the number of indicators wi is normalized weight in percentage of indicator xi is relative score for the ith indicator at the tth pixel 2 6 validation of groundwater map from a scientific significance viewpoint validating a model is essential to evaluate the reliability of the result chung and fabbri 2003 in this work the delineated groundwater potential area was verified using the spring and well yield data in the same way multiple researchers jha et al 2010 magesh et al 2012 şener et al 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 murmu et al 2020 saravanan et al 2020 doke et al 2021 sapkota et al 2021 sarwar et al 2021 also used groundwater inventory data boreholes data spring well and hand dug yield to cross validate the developed groundwater potential zone the observed groundwater data was mapped and overlaid on the delineated groundwater potential zone map in the gis environment in this case the high overlap indicates that the generated map was deemed more reliable because springs and well yield data are true indicators of groundwater recharge zone availability 3 results and discussions 3 1 the criterion for groundwater potential mapping eight parameters geology lineament density slope twi soil drainage density rainfall and lulc that mostly influence the groundwater occurrence in the study area have been carefully considered to assess the groundwater potential zone in the gobele watershed after successfully assigning the weight to each factor using ahp gwpi for each feature of the thematic layer was computed using eq 1 mentioned under section 2 5 table 6 further these gwpi values were used to indicate the overall groundwater potential recharge area table 6 shows the groundwater potential index value of each thematic layer incorporated in the groundwater recharge area assessment these values were computed by multiplying the feature rank with its corresponding feature weight 3 1 1 geology lithology geology or lithology is the most controlling parameter for the distribution and occurrence of groundwater andualem and demeke 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 doke et al 2021 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 murmu et al 2020 sapkota et al 2021 lithology directly affects both the porosity and permeability of the aquifer material ayazi et al 2010 jha et al 2010 in this study area the common geological formations are basalt and tuff undifferentiated aquifer material and sandstone lime fig 5 the basalt and tuff rocky types are characterized by high porosity and permeability which enhance groundwater recharge 3 1 2 lineament density ld lineament is the second most important indicator that helps to assess the potential groundwater zone murmu et al 2020 sapkota et al 2021 the linear structures faults cracks and joints detect the groundwater recharge areas doke et al 2021 lineament density has a direct impact i e the more lineament density the watershed has the higher the probability of groundwater recharge jha et al 2010 berhanu and hatiye 2020 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 ahmed et al 2021 tolche 2021 in general the lineament density of the gobele watershed varied from 0 3 87 km km2 in this study a high groundwater potential zone occurred at a denser lineament ld 1 56 km km2 fig 6 on the other hand a moderate medium recharge zone occurred in the watershed where lineament density ranged from 0 56 to 1 56 km km2 table 6 3 1 3 slope slope is a vital parameter that determines groundwater recharge area through significantly influencing the rate of infiltration and percolation of certain watersheds das and pal 2020 thus the watershed having a steeper slope generates lower groundwater recharge naghibi et al 2017 singh et al 2019 the slope of the gobele watershed is available between 0 and 78 the areas at gentle slopes 0 8 are categorized as low potential groundwater recharge areas medium slopes 8 30 as moderate recharge zones and at steep slopes 30 as high recharge areas fig 7 3 1 4 topographic wetness index twi the topographic wetness index is also an important indicator of groundwater potential twi is widely used to measure the effect of topography on hydrological processes and groundwater arulbalaji et al 2019 higher twi values revealed areas with a higher probability of groundwater occurrence mallick et al 2019 the topographic wetness index value of the study area varied from 1 0 to 26 4 based on these values the watershed has been classified into three classes high twi 16 corresponding to a high groundwater potential area moderate medium 10 twi 16 that generates moderate groundwater recharge in contrast a watershed with twi 10 was categorized under the low groundwater potential zone 3 1 5 soil the texture of the soil in particular is an important factor in determining the groundwater recharge area the infiltration and water holding capacity of the watershed depend on soil property i e types structures and textures kumar et al 2016 mehra et al 2016 rukundo and doğan 2019 the porosity and permeability rate depend on soil textures course silty and clay in which more infiltration takes place in sandy soils relative to clay soils therefore the higher groundwater recharge zone can occur in areas with sandy soil das and pal 2020 texturally the dominant soil types in the gobele watershed are sandy which is favorable for high recharge silt for medium recharge and clay for high runoff and low groundwater potential zone as indicated by fig 9 3 1 6 drainage density drainage density dd is another influencing parameter for assessing groundwater recharge areas jenifer and jha 2017 it is evident that areas with high drainage densities exhibit high runoff which in turn reveals low infiltration rate and groundwater recharge andualem and demeke 2019 murmu et al 2019 thomas and duraisamy 2018 in this study area drainage density is varied from 0 to 4 8 km km2 and classified into three that contribute to high groundwater dd 1 0 km km2 medium dd 1 0 1 50 km km2 and low dd 1 5 km km2 as shown in fig 10 3 1 7 rainfall rainfall plays an important role in controlling groundwater potential detailed information regarding the intensity and duration of rainfall will help to estimate runoff and groundwater recharge ramu 2014 maity and mandal 2019 the mean annual rainfall of the watershed ranges from 480 to 1200 mm and is classified into three lows r 600 correspond to low groundwater contribution area medium for mean rainfall between 600 and 800 and high above 800 mm fig 11 3 1 8 land use cover land use land cover can influence groundwater recharge for instance built up and bare land watersheds have high runoff and low groundwater recharge whereas areas covered by forest and waterbodies have a high chance of groundwater recharge li et al 2018 owuor et al 2016 cropland contributes more recharge through allowing infiltration rate than barren rocky and built up areas for groundwater recharge the dominant lulc of the gobele watershed are forest agricultural bare land including residential areas and waterbodies based on their related properties on recharge these lulc have been classified as shown in fig 12 3 2 overall potential groundwater zones assessment after the weighted overlay process has been completed based on gwpzi value the groundwater potential zone map is classified into three classes low gwpi 85 5 moderate 85 2 gwpi 467 78 and high gwpi 1444 78 table 7 these classifications were decided upon similar previous studies andualem and demeke 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 doke et al 2021 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 sapkota et al 2021 and consultation with experts familiar with the hydrogeology and geo physical settings of the gobele watershed it is noted that the gwpi value is focused on indicating qualitative groundwater potential areas the high groundwater potential areas are located where there are high 1 2 km km2 lineament density with gentle slope 0 8 sandy textured soil basalt and tuff geological area highly covered with forest and water body high twi 16 and low drainage density 1 0 fig 13 indicates the spatial distribution of groundwater potential area over the gobele watershed in that high recharge potential is more concentrated on the west side of the study area most permeable lithology high lineament density and twi value gentle slope low drainage density coarse grained soil texture and forest covered areas with high corresponding to high recharge potentials figs 5 11 characterize these high recharge areas the high groundwater potential zone covers an area of nearly 67 8 km2 2 4 of the study watershed on the other hand the low groundwater potential zone is mostly found in the middle part of the gobele watershed in an area covered by high drainage density 1 5 with bare land low lineament density steep slope 30 and undifferentiated aquifer material the low groundwater potential zone covers 111 6 km2 3 9 of the study area the moderate groundwater potential zone covers 2625 7 km2 93 7 of the total area of the gobele watershed table 8 in general the strong influence of the geology lithology lineament density slope and topographic witness index is significantly observed in the delineated groundwater potential in this study in line with this several studies ahmed et al 2021 andualem and demeke 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 doke et al 2021 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 mallick et al 2019 murmu et al 2020 sapkota et al 2021 showed that these parameters namely geology lineament density and slope significantly influence groundwater occurrence and recharge 3 3 groundwater map validation the groundwater inventory data spring and well yield data is very important to validate the qualitative groundwater potential map 30 existing groundwater inventory data springs and well yield were collected for this purpose different researchers berhanu and hatiye 2020 murmu et al 2020 sapkota et al 2021 tuinhof et al 2011 used different ranges to classify this data as low medium and high the details of their classification are shown in table 9 finally it was overlaid on a groundwater recharge potential map fig 14 in line with this several researchers bezabih bashe 2017 andualem and demeke 2019 mallick et al 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 murmu et al 2020 dar et al 2021 doke et al 2021 sapkota et al 2021 tolche 2021 also used groundwater inventory data for validation purposes it has been observed that the high recharge zones correspond to high well yield fields as in fig 14 in the west of the watershed high recharge zones coincide with two of the three recharge zones previously identified using fieldwork the validation results revealed that ahp has a fairly good prediction of 0 705 therefore the results of groundwater potential maps obtained using the ahp method have been considered a good prediction in this study since there is no standard classification rather than site specific conditions we adopted the above mentioned groundwater yield classification by researchers with some modification hence based on the collected spring and well yield data as low 0 1 1 5 l s medium yield 1 5 6 l s and high 6 l s table 10 based on this classification out of the 9 boreholes classified as high yield 6 l s 7 77 8 of them is accurately matched with the high groundwater potential zone gwpz furthermore 88 23 of the 17 borehole yield data classified as medium are falling on the medium gwpz while five boreholes 83 3 are falling on the low gwpz fig 14 on average the qualitative groundwater potential assessment fit with 90 of the groundwater inventory spring and well yield data table 10 this revealed that the groundwater inventory data is well agreed with the delineated groundwater potential zones using an analytical hierarchy process geospatial driven in a gis environment 4 conclusion the advancement of remotely sensed data and gis application simplifies the study of the natural environment groundwater investigation without direct contact this study aimed at groundwater assessment using aggregated ahp geospatial techniques in a gis environment in the gobele watershed in this study lithology lineament density slope soil property drainage density twi lulc and rainfall was used to assess the spatial distribution of groundwater potential in the study area the ahp pairwise comparison matrix method was used to assign relative weight to each indicator based on their contribution to groundwater recharge thus lithology and lineament density are the most influential factors with 32 and 23 of the weight respectively similarly respective moderate weightages of 16 11 7 5 and 2 23 for slope twi soil composition drainage density and land use land cover respectively then all the thematic layers were integrated to generate a groundwater potential map accordingly about 2 4 67 8 km2 of the watershed area corresponds to a high groundwater potential area while an extensive area of 93 7 2625 6 km2 is classified as a medium groundwater recharge area the spring and well yield data were used to test the performance of the model the first step was based on cross validation using the existing spring s data location and discharge the validation result revealed a 90 agreement between the groundwater inventory data and the gwpz furthermore qualitative validation with spring and well yield data has been found to be satisfactory for evaluating models the use of geospatial data can serve as a credible source of information for the delineation of groundwater recharge zones and help in developing and managing groundwater for the gobele watershed further the findings of this study could greatly help with proper management and utilization of groundwater resources especially to balance domestic and irrigation water demand author statement this is the first

7797,study region gobele watershed wabe shebelle river basin ethiopia study focus recently extremely increasing population numbers and irrigation demand have imposed water problems in the study area hence this study aimed to delineate groundwater potential zones through an integrated approach of remote sensing geographical information system gis and analytical hierarchy process ahp in the gobele watershed numerous factors like rainfall geology land use land cover slope soil types drainage density lineament density and topographic wetness index were considered to demarcate groundwater recharge the relative weight of each factor was determined using ahp ultimately all thematic layers were aggregated by a weighted sum overly analysis in a gis environment to map groundwater potential zones using relative weights derived from the ahp finally to verify the result of the model was validated with 30 observed springs and well yield new hydrological insights the distribution of groundwater potential zones was spatially varied in that a high groundwater recharge zone covers 2 4 of the watershed a moderate 93 7 and a low 3 9 the validation analysis revealed a 90 agreement between the groundwater inventory data and the developed groundwater potential zone hence the results are reliable and enable water users and decision makers to sustainably utilize the available groundwater in the study area furthermore this study is one of the rare groundwater investigations in the hydrogeological setting of the study area graphical abstract ga1 keywords ahp gis groundwater potential gobele watershed data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is an important resource used for domestics agriculture and industries it is a reliable water source particularly during prolonged dry periods assaf and saadeh 2008 and is preferred due to its lower susceptibility to contamination naghibi et al 2017 the demand for groundwater has recently increased dramatically due to rising populations irrigation development and industrialization jha et al 2010 several conventional methods namely geophysical hydrogeological soil moisture modeling and drilling which are costly tedious time consuming and infeasible for large watersheds are used to identify groundwater recharge areas razandi et al 2015 bhattacharya et al 2020 dahiphale et al 2020 therefore advanced technology is needed to save cost and time while identifying groundwater potential areas sapkota et al 2021 the aggregation of remote sensing rs and geographic information systems gis has proved to be a reliable and cost efficient tool in assessing groundwater potential zones sapkota et al 2021 the rs capability to gather manipulate and manage huge amounts of data at a time enables researchers to effectively investigate analyze and manage groundwater resources pathmanandakumar 2021 as a result the use of remote sensing and gis guided multi criteria decision analysis

environmental management asadabadi et al 2019 jothimani et al 2021 the existence and transmission of groundwater are influenced by multiple factors such as rainfall intensity geology soil property

et al 2019 saravanan et al 2020 pathmanandakumar et al 2021 yıldırım 2021 furthermore the assigned relative weights to the thematic layers will influence the reliability of the obtained result thus pairwise assignment of relative weight is extremely essential saaty and vargas 2012 omar and fayek 2016 singh et al 2019 prayudi et al 2020 gebre et al 2021 mahato et al 2021 and depends on expert

2021 and decreases biases on influencing parameters which in turn increases the accuracy of outcomes jha et al 2010 it is also inexpensive and less time consuming to investigate groundwater recharge areas mundalik et al 2018 şener et al 2018 it has been utilized by several researchers for computing the relative importance of thematic parameters al zuhairy et al 2017 andualem and demeke 2019 allafta et al 2021 previously several researcher tadesse et al 2010 keddi and moges 2016 bezabih 2017 andualem and demeke 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 ewunetu et al 2021 jothimani et al 2021 mengistu et al 2022 melese and belay 2022 have assessed groundwater potential in different parts of ethiopian river basin on the other hand few study has conducted in wabe shebele river basin the wabe shebele river basin is commonly known with surface water scant area gobele watershed is one of wabe shebele river basin which is limited with surface water the dramatically increment of population number from time to time in wabe shebelle river basin creates competition over available surface water for irrigation activities and others purpose adank et al 2008 ayala et al 2018 besides this the land use land cover and climate change woldemariam and harka 2020 abebe et al 2021 hirko et al 2021 brought challenge on available surface water thus to alleviate this water demand problems exploitation of groundwater in the gobele watershed is vital for the region as well as the country however the exploitation of groundwater in the study area was previously conducted using drill holes which is costly and tedious hence this study employed an analytical hierarchy process ahp guided gis to qualitatively investigate and compare groundwater potential zones by aggregating the most influencing factors in this research the ahp technique was used for the first time to identify the geospatial dispersal of groundwater recharge zones across the study area furthermore the relative importance of the multiple geospatial parameters was generated based on their contribution to groundwater recharge in the watershed finally observed spring and well yield data were used to verify the model performance the findings of the study will enable water users and decision makers to visualize and evaluate the current groundwater balance and predict its future status in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study was carried out in the gobele watershed located in the wabe shebelle basin ethiopia the watershed extends from 8 40 10 to 9 20 34 north and 41 41 10 to 42 11 30 east with a total area of 2804 7 km2 it has diverse topographic features with an elevation range from 957 to 3387 m above mean sea level amsl fig 1 two rainy seasons major in the summer season june september and minor in february may are common in watersheds woldemariam et al 2018 harka et al 2021 gurara et al 2021a b 2022 the watershed has a tropical climate with a mean annual temperature varying from 15 to 25 and an average annual precipitation from 1990 to 2019 of nearly 832 mm the geology of the gobele watershed is underlain by basalt and tuff sandston lime and undifferentiated aquifer materials fig 3e the hydrology in the study area is characterized by factors such as surface flow from the watershed groundwater recharge rate that is dependent upon the quantity of excess rainfall evapotranspiration soil characteristics texture and structure and bedrock permeability all these affect groundwater yield to wells springs and river channels that drain the watershed the geomorphology of the study area is characterized by colluvial with patches of alluvial deposits along the streams in general lithologically the watershed is dominated by gneiss and schist along with granitic and pegmatitic intrusions in the lower parts of the watershed irrigation water demand and domestic use in the middle parts are highly needed in the middle parts of the study area there is high competition for crop water requirements in recent times despite several springs and wells have been investigated and extracted with the local authority to balance domestic water demand there is water scarcity which needs immediate solution the methodology used in this study is shown in fig 2 2 2 data sets and sources in this research after we extensively reviewed important literature jha et al 2010 magesh et al 2012 fashae et al 2014 i p senanayake et al 2016 sener et al 2018 maity and mandal 2019 etikala et al 2019 abijitha et al 2020 achu et al 2020 murmu et al 2020 lentswe et al 2020 mahato et al 2021 pathmanandakumar et al 2021 rajasekhar et al 2021 sapkota et al 2021 ewunetu et al 2021 regarding with groundwater potential assessment the most important factors such as soil lulc rainfall geology lineament density slope gradient drainage density and topographic wetness index twi were considered in this study these data were collected from different sources for instance the 20 years of rainfall data 2000 2019 of 12 meteorological stations were collected from the national meteorology agency of ethiopia soil data was obtained from the ministry of water and energy of ethiopia the lulc data available at a spatial resolution of 10 х 10 m was downloaded from esri lulc 2020 the geology was obtained from the ethiopian geological survey drainage density twi and slope maps were generated using a digital elevation model with a 12 5 m spatial resolution that was downloaded from the advanced land observation satellite alos moreover the lineament density was derived from landsat 8 oli tirs imagery and alos dem at 12 5 m resolution this landsat 8 oli tirs of january 2022 was downloaded from https earthexplorer usgs gov furthermore the observed borehole data was collected from the local authority office to validate the model following the assignment of relative weights using multi criteria evaluation mce techniques further processes were carried out in arcgis 2 3 thematic layers preparation in this research the assessment of groundwater potential zones was achieved through integrating rainfall soil property geology and lineament density slope gradient drainage density lulc and twi in the gis environment as described below each thematic layer was prepared in raster format and finally projected with a 12 5 m spatial resolution in a gis environment 2 3 1 rainfall rainfall is the major hydrological source for groundwater recharge ahmed et al 2021 allafta et al 2021 which also determines its fluctuation agarwal and garg 2016 the heavy rainfall intensity produces high groundwater recharge thomas et al 2016 kotchoni et al 2019 he et al 2021 the rainfall map was prepared using the inverse distance weight method tool in gis the mean annual rainfall of gobele watershed exists between 425 4 mm and 953 2 mm fig 3h 2 3 2 soils soil influences the infiltration rate which in turn has an impact on groundwater recharge can highly impact the infiltration rate and deep percolation into an aquifer anbazhagan and ramasamy 2006 etikala et al 2019 soil properties grain size shape structural arrangement and the pore space can significantly influence the movement of groundwater musa et al 2017 gomboš et al 2019 coarse grained soils have high infiltration potential and result in high groundwater recharge relative to fine soils nolan and taber 2007 there are seven types of soils within the study area namely eutric luvisol eutric leptosol calcaric leptosol eutric vertosol hapalic luvisols and rhodic nitisol fig 3f in that sequence with the north west dominated by the coarser sandy soils while the finer clay soils are common in the north east fao 1985 2 3 3 land use land cover land use land cover is an important factor that affects the occurrence availability and recharge of groundwater li et al 2018 dibaba et al 2020 yifru et al 2021 and affects the quantity of water that merges into groundwater benavides et al 2018 mireille et al 2019 yimer et al 2008 in the study area the common lulc area were forest shrubland grass land crop land bare land built up area settlement and water body fig 3g the occurrence of groundwater is less in bare land compare to forest and agricultural areas lamichhane and shakya 2020 ouyang et al 2019 similarly the land cover map was obtained from esri lulc 2020 most of the watershed area is covered by cropland and grassland lulc types 2 3 4 geology lithology lithological properties determine porosity and the movement of groundwater ayazi et al 2010 higher porosity of lithology produces higher groundwater storage the study area consists of various types of geological features such as in the gobele watershed basalts and tuff sandston lime limestone and a rocky undifferentiated aquifer fig 3e 2 3 5 lineament density the lineaments are natural linear fractures in the form of faults joints and fractures agarwal and garg 2016 it represents the total length of lineaments in a unit area as expressed in eq 1 yeh et al 2016 enoh et al 2021 and also influences secondary porosity and permeability lineament density is considered an important indicator for the identification of groundwater recharge zones şener et al 2018 siddi raju et al 2019 groundwater recharge is influenced by the arrangement of lineaments in relation to the surface water bodies or where lineaments intersect babiker and gudmundsson 2004 gupta et al 2012 rajaveni et al 2014 the high lineament density corresponds to high groundwater recharge naghibi et al 2017 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 sapkota et al 2021 two methods are available to extract lineaments from satellite images however for accuracy and user friendliness automatic lineament extraction is more preferable weerasekera et al 2014 thus this study adopted automatic extraction of the linear structure of lineament from both landsat 8 oli tirs imagery and alos dem using the line tool in pci geomatica software version 12 0 geomatica 2018 then these derived linear structures were saved as shapefile shp in utm coordinates and imported into arcgis software to create a lineament density map using the line density tool of the spatial analyst toolbox the final lineament density map was created by overlaying the lineament map with the arcgis overlay analysis tool multiple berhanu and hatiye 2020 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 sapkota et al 2021 studies use this method to extract lineament density accordingly the lineament density of gobele watershed ranged from 0 to 3 87km km2 fig 3a 2 3 6 drainage density drainage density is defined as the closeness of the spacing of stream channels sar et al 2015 it is the measurement of the total length of the stream segment of all orders per unit area berhanu and hatiye 2020 doke et al 2021 rahmati et al 2015 the drainage pattern and density provide valuable information about groundwater occurrences rajaveni et al 2014 the dem was used to drive the drainage network which further required preparing a drainage density map the drainage density is inversely proportional to the groundwater potential naidu et al 2015 thus an area with a high drainage density has a lower recharge rate whereas low drainage density areas have a higher recharge rate rajaveni et al 2014 drainage density map of study area was generated by line density tool of spatial analyst toolbox in arcgis 10 2 it varied from 0 to 1 74km km2 fig 3b 2 3 7 slope the slope gradient directly influences groundwater recharge harry et al 2020 and it is widely used for the delineation of gwpzs magesh et al 2012 it is a very essential terrain parameter that shows the steepness of the ground surface the flat slope has the highest infiltration capacity hagos and andualem 2021 melese and belay 2022 thapa et al 2017 and the steeper the slope the higher runoff and lower groundwater recharge naghibi et al 2017 singh et al 2019 the rank was assigned to each slope class depending on their groundwater potential the slope of gobele watershed extend from 0 to 78 fig 3d 2 3 8 topographic wetness index twi r sorensen et al 2006 show that twi is highly correlated with soil moisture and groundwater level the higher the value of twi the higher the groundwater potential naghibi et al 2017 studies have shown that high twi areas have high groundwater potential while low twi areas have low groundwater potential mallick et al 2019 the twi was computed using the following eq 1 developed by moore and nieber 1989 1 t w i ln a s tan β the twi of gobele watershed varied from 0 to 26 15 fig 3c 2 4 assigning relative weight all indicators have different contributions to the occurrence and groundwater recharge hachem et al 2015 yeh et al 2016 arulbalaji et al 2019 their relative weight is determined by adopting the ahp method based on their influence and significance to recharge saaty 2008a ahp is used as a decision making tool in problems involving complex parameters and areas with scarce data in quantity and quality saaty and vargas 2012 jozaghi et al 2018 asadabadi et al 2019 expert judgment and eigenvector are needed to assign weight and order while principal eigenvalue is used to rank the factors carver 1991 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 malczewski 2006 the hydrogeologist expert was invited from the local authority office to determine the relative importance of indicators based on saaty s scale values table 1 the eigenvector indicates the relative weights of each of the indicators brunelli 2015 and is computed by dividing column values by column sum as shown in table 1 saaty 2008a the sum of eigenvalues principal eigenvalue λ max measures the consistency of the matrix brunelli 2015 a pairwise comparison matrix n n was generated based on the input factors each entry indicates the influence of the row relative on the column factor the reliability of the pairwise comparison matrix is checked by comparing the λ max values with several thematic layers incorporated into it the total parameters should be less than λ max values a certain level of inconsistency may occur during the pairwise decision of indicators thus it is very essential to check the accuracy of the assigned weight during pairwise comparison the ahp method incorporates a consistency index to measure deviation because the matrix deviation increases with an increasing comparison number saaty and vargas 2012 in weight determination a consistency ratio of less than 0 1 10 is acceptable mundalik et al 2018 rajasekhar et al 2021 otherwise relative weights of each indicator should be re assigned to reduce inconsistency saaty and vargas 2012 saaty 2008b 1986 the consistency index ci is the ratio of the difference between λ max and the number of indicators involved as shown in eq 2 tables 2 and 3 2 ci λ max n n 1 3 cr ci ri where ci is consistency index cr is consistency ratio ri is a random index table 4 n number of parameters involved λmax is principal eigenvalue fig 4 indicates the weight of each thematic layer incorporated in the analysis and shows that lithology was the most influential indicator 32 in determining the groundwater potential zone the lineament density 23 and the slope 16 were observed to be the second and third most influential parameters respectively on the other hand the lulc 2 2 and rainfall 3 3 is considered the least influential factors in delineating groundwater recharge areas according to table 5 the λ max value of this study was 8 40 which is greater than the number of indicators and its consistency ratio of 0 041 was also within the tolerance limit 0 1 indicating that the consistency in the pair wise comparison and assigned weight are both acceptable among the considered parameters lithology and lineament density are the first and second most influential groundwater occurrence indicators respectively table 4 2 5 thematic layers integration through weighted overlay each indicator was reclassified to a common ratio scale and integrated to produce a map of the groundwater potential index within the gobele watershed all reclassified raster maps of preferred parameters were overlaid in the weighted overlay analysis tool finally the weighted values of each raster layer are multiplied by the cell score of each input raster eq 4 further groundwater potential zones are classified based on gwpi value jha et al 2010 etikala et al 2019 murmu et al 2020 sapkota et al 2021 gwpi is a dimensionless quantity computed from both the weights of each thematic layer and its features mathematically gwpi was calculated using eq 4 jha et al 2010 andualem and demeke 2019 sapkota et al 2021 4 gwpi i 1 n wi x i where gwpi is the potential groundwater index n is the number of indicators wi is normalized weight in percentage of indicator xi is relative score for the ith indicator at the tth pixel 2 6 validation of groundwater map from a scientific significance viewpoint validating a model is essential to evaluate the reliability of the result chung and fabbri 2003 in this work the delineated groundwater potential area was verified using the spring and well yield data in the same way multiple researchers jha et al 2010 magesh et al 2012 şener et al 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 murmu et al 2020 saravanan et al 2020 doke et al 2021 sapkota et al 2021 sarwar et al 2021 also used groundwater inventory data boreholes data spring well and hand dug yield to cross validate the developed groundwater potential zone the observed groundwater data was mapped and overlaid on the delineated groundwater potential zone map in the gis environment in this case the high overlap indicates that the generated map was deemed more reliable because springs and well yield data are true indicators of groundwater recharge zone availability 3 results and discussions 3 1 the criterion for groundwater potential mapping eight parameters geology lineament density slope twi soil drainage density rainfall and lulc that mostly influence the groundwater occurrence in the study area have been carefully considered to assess the groundwater potential zone in the gobele watershed after successfully assigning the weight to each factor using ahp gwpi for each feature of the thematic layer was computed using eq 1 mentioned under section 2 5 table 6 further these gwpi values were used to indicate the overall groundwater potential recharge area table 6 shows the groundwater potential index value of each thematic layer incorporated in the groundwater recharge area assessment these values were computed by multiplying the feature rank with its corresponding feature weight 3 1 1 geology lithology geology or lithology is the most controlling parameter for the distribution and occurrence of groundwater andualem and demeke 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 doke et al 2021 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 murmu et al 2020 sapkota et al 2021 lithology directly affects both the porosity and permeability of the aquifer material ayazi et al 2010 jha et al 2010 in this study area the common geological formations are basalt and tuff undifferentiated aquifer material and sandstone lime fig 5 the basalt and tuff rocky types are characterized by high porosity and permeability which enhance groundwater recharge 3 1 2 lineament density ld lineament is the second most important indicator that helps to assess the potential groundwater zone murmu et al 2020 sapkota et al 2021 the linear structures faults cracks and joints detect the groundwater recharge areas doke et al 2021 lineament density has a direct impact i e the more lineament density the watershed has the higher the probability of groundwater recharge jha et al 2010 berhanu and hatiye 2020 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 ahmed et al 2021 tolche 2021 in general the lineament density of the gobele watershed varied from 0 3 87 km km2 in this study a high groundwater potential zone occurred at a denser lineament ld 1 56 km km2 fig 6 on the other hand a moderate medium recharge zone occurred in the watershed where lineament density ranged from 0 56 to 1 56 km km2 table 6 3 1 3 slope slope is a vital parameter that determines groundwater recharge area through significantly influencing the rate of infiltration and percolation of certain watersheds das and pal 2020 thus the watershed having a steeper slope generates lower groundwater recharge naghibi et al 2017 singh et al 2019 the slope of the gobele watershed is available between 0 and 78 the areas at gentle slopes 0 8 are categorized as low potential groundwater recharge areas medium slopes 8 30 as moderate recharge zones and at steep slopes 30 as high recharge areas fig 7 3 1 4 topographic wetness index twi the topographic wetness index is also an important indicator of groundwater potential twi is widely used to measure the effect of topography on hydrological processes and groundwater arulbalaji et al 2019 higher twi values revealed areas with a higher probability of groundwater occurrence mallick et al 2019 the topographic wetness index value of the study area varied from 1 0 to 26 4 based on these values the watershed has been classified into three classes high twi 16 corresponding to a high groundwater potential area moderate medium 10 twi 16 that generates moderate groundwater recharge in contrast a watershed with twi 10 was categorized under the low groundwater potential zone 3 1 5 soil the texture of the soil in particular is an important factor in determining the groundwater recharge area the infiltration and water holding capacity of the watershed depend on soil property i e types structures and textures kumar et al 2016 mehra et al 2016 rukundo and doğan 2019 the porosity and permeability rate depend on soil textures course silty and clay in which more infiltration takes place in sandy soils relative to clay soils therefore the higher groundwater recharge zone can occur in areas with sandy soil das and pal 2020 texturally the dominant soil types in the gobele watershed are sandy which is favorable for high recharge silt for medium recharge and clay for high runoff and low groundwater potential zone as indicated by fig 9 3 1 6 drainage density drainage density dd is another influencing parameter for assessing groundwater recharge areas jenifer and jha 2017 it is evident that areas with high drainage densities exhibit high runoff which in turn reveals low infiltration rate and groundwater recharge andualem and demeke 2019 murmu et al 2019 thomas and duraisamy 2018 in this study area drainage density is varied from 0 to 4 8 km km2 and classified into three that contribute to high groundwater dd 1 0 km km2 medium dd 1 0 1 50 km km2 and low dd 1 5 km km2 as shown in fig 10 3 1 7 rainfall rainfall plays an important role in controlling groundwater potential detailed information regarding the intensity and duration of rainfall will help to estimate runoff and groundwater recharge ramu 2014 maity and mandal 2019 the mean annual rainfall of the watershed ranges from 480 to 1200 mm and is classified into three lows r 600 correspond to low groundwater contribution area medium for mean rainfall between 600 and 800 and high above 800 mm fig 11 3 1 8 land use cover land use land cover can influence groundwater recharge for instance built up and bare land watersheds have high runoff and low groundwater recharge whereas areas covered by forest and waterbodies have a high chance of groundwater recharge li et al 2018 owuor et al 2016 cropland contributes more recharge through allowing infiltration rate than barren rocky and built up areas for groundwater recharge the dominant lulc of the gobele watershed are forest agricultural bare land including residential areas and waterbodies based on their related properties on recharge these lulc have been classified as shown in fig 12 3 2 overall potential groundwater zones assessment after the weighted overlay process has been completed based on gwpzi value the groundwater potential zone map is classified into three classes low gwpi 85 5 moderate 85 2 gwpi 467 78 and high gwpi 1444 78 table 7 these classifications were decided upon similar previous studies andualem and demeke 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 doke et al 2021 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 sapkota et al 2021 and consultation with experts familiar with the hydrogeology and geo physical settings of the gobele watershed it is noted that the gwpi value is focused on indicating qualitative groundwater potential areas the high groundwater potential areas are located where there are high 1 2 km km2 lineament density with gentle slope 0 8 sandy textured soil basalt and tuff geological area highly covered with forest and water body high twi 16 and low drainage density 1 0 fig 13 indicates the spatial distribution of groundwater potential area over the gobele watershed in that high recharge potential is more concentrated on the west side of the study area most permeable lithology high lineament density and twi value gentle slope low drainage density coarse grained soil texture and forest covered areas with high corresponding to high recharge potentials figs 5 11 characterize these high recharge areas the high groundwater potential zone covers an area of nearly 67 8 km2 2 4 of the study watershed on the other hand the low groundwater potential zone is mostly found in the middle part of the gobele watershed in an area covered by high drainage density 1 5 with bare land low lineament density steep slope 30 and undifferentiated aquifer material the low groundwater potential zone covers 111 6 km2 3 9 of the study area the moderate groundwater potential zone covers 2625 7 km2 93 7 of the total area of the gobele watershed table 8 in general the strong influence of the geology lithology lineament density slope and topographic witness index is significantly observed in the delineated groundwater potential in this study in line with this several studies ahmed et al 2021 andualem and demeke 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 doke et al 2021 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 mallick et al 2019 murmu et al 2020 sapkota et al 2021 showed that these parameters namely geology lineament density and slope significantly influence groundwater occurrence and recharge 3 3 groundwater map validation the groundwater inventory data spring and well yield data is very important to validate the qualitative groundwater potential map 30 existing groundwater inventory data springs and well yield were collected for this purpose different researchers berhanu and hatiye 2020 murmu et al 2020 sapkota et al 2021 tuinhof et al 2011 used different ranges to classify this data as low medium and high the details of their classification are shown in table 9 finally it was overlaid on a groundwater recharge potential map fig 14 in line with this several researchers bezabih bashe 2017 andualem and demeke 2019 mallick et al 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 murmu et al 2020 dar et al 2021 doke et al 2021 sapkota et al 2021 tolche 2021 also used groundwater inventory data for validation purposes it has been observed that the high recharge zones correspond to high well yield fields as in fig 14 in the west of the watershed high recharge zones coincide with two of the three recharge zones previously identified using fieldwork the validation results revealed that ahp has a fairly good prediction of 0 705 therefore the results of groundwater potential maps obtained using the ahp method have been considered a good prediction in this study since there is no standard classification rather than site specific conditions we adopted the above mentioned groundwater yield classification by researchers with some modification hence based on the collected spring and well yield data as low 0 1 1 5 l s medium yield 1 5 6 l s and high 6 l s table 10 based on this classification out of the 9 boreholes classified as high yield 6 l s 7 77 8 of them is accurately matched with the high groundwater potential zone gwpz furthermore 88 23 of the 17 borehole yield data classified as medium are falling on the medium gwpz while five boreholes 83 3 are falling on the low gwpz fig 14 on average the qualitative groundwater potential assessment fit with 90 of the groundwater inventory spring and well yield data table 10 this revealed that the groundwater inventory data is well agreed with the delineated groundwater potential zones using an analytical hierarchy process geospatial driven in a gis environment 4 conclusion the advancement of remotely sensed data and gis application simplifies the study of the natural environment groundwater investigation without direct contact this study aimed at groundwater assessment using aggregated ahp geospatial techniques in a gis environment in the gobele watershed in this study lithology lineament density slope soil property drainage density twi lulc and rainfall was used to assess the spatial distribution of groundwater potential in the study area the ahp pairwise comparison matrix method was used to assign relative weight to each indicator based on their contribution to groundwater recharge thus lithology and lineament density are the most influential factors with 32 and 23 of the weight respectively similarly respective moderate weightages of 16 11 7 5 and 2 23 for slope twi soil composition drainage density and land use land cover respectively then all the thematic layers were integrated to generate a groundwater potential map accordingly about 2 4 67 8 km2 of the watershed area corresponds to a high groundwater potential area while an extensive area of 93 7 2625 6 km2 is classified as a medium groundwater recharge area the spring and well yield data were used to test the performance of the model the first step was based on cross validation using the existing spring s data location and discharge the validation result revealed a 90 agreement between the groundwater inventory data and the gwpz furthermore qualitative validation with spring and well yield data has been found to be satisfactory for evaluating models the use of geospatial data can serve as a credible source of information for the delineation of groundwater recharge zones and help in developing and managing groundwater for the gobele watershed further the findings of this study could greatly help with proper management and utilization of groundwater resources especially to balance domestic and irrigation water demand author statement this is the first

7798,study region bertholène is a former uranium mine in aveyron where tailings and waste rocks are stored in a natural valley this results in acid mine drainage amd at the outlet of the tailings storage facility tsf where there is a dedicated water treatment plant study focus a detailed data analysis was conducted using data from 13 piezometers and from long term monitoring of the local climate a 3d model was developed using modflow to understand groundwater flows at the catchment scale and identify flow paths from the contamination sources within the tsf previous geochemical modeling of tsfs had indicated that amd was expected to occur for 50 100 years therefore the site must be managed with a long term view as climate change may affect not only the recharge but also the frequency and intensity of extreme events its impact on water balance and water levels at the site has to be studied for the next 100 years new hydrological insights for the region data analysis provides information about the unsaturated conditions within the tailings then water balance calculations at the tsf outlet validate the contribution of two different water zones modeling using the recharge estimation supports the current functioning of the catchment the impact study of extreme events shows that the water table should not permanently reach the tailings over the next century

from 1948 2001 france mined uranium within its borders the total production obtained of 76 000 tu over this period represents just a year and half of worldwide production today wma 2020 this activity generated nearly 200 mt of waste rock and 52 mt of mill tailings cartomines and orano mining 2021 french uranium sites were generally small and exploited either by open pit mines and or by underground mine workings the ore process usually starts by crushing and grinding the ore then depending on the carbonate concentration in the ore leaching is undertaken with acidic or alkaline substances two types of leaching are used depending on the ore concentration dynamic for high concentrations and static for low concentrations this process results in a yellow cake from which the uranium is extracted and also the waste known as mill tailings tailings can be stored at ground level or underground or submerged these facilities contain several million tons of dynamic static and combined process tailings brgm 1997 tailings are frequently studied to assist in the prevention of the environmental dispersion of contaminants of concern and to understand the geochemical mechanisms of the mobility of residual uranium or radium 226 in france and abroad déjeant et al 2014 2016 chautard et al 2017 2020 lestini et al 2019 ballini et al 2020 besançon et al 2020 lahrouch et al 2021 seigneur et al 2021 the tailings stored at ground level are usually deposited in piles from 10 m to 150 m high and cover a surface area between one and a dozen hectares these stockpiles have an environmental impact depending on the type of ore mined the chemical treatment and the mineral composition khoeurn et al 2019 in france uranium mill tailings must be stored satisfactorily for the long term to achieve this tailings storage facilities tsf are made of several layers acting as a mechanical and radiological barrier the catchment water is collected and if necessary sent to a treatment plant with a dedicated environmental monitoring of the water soil air food chain when geomaterials enriched in sulfide minerals mainly pyrite are in contact with rainfall and oxygen they react with their environment and can lead to acid mine drainage amd blowes et al 2014 amd is generally characterized by low ph and high concentrations of sulfate heavy metals copper cu lead pb zinc zn and cadmium cd and toxic metalloids arsenic as and selenium se descostes et al 2004 tabelin et al 2018 this is one of the main causes of water contamination worldwide bell et al 2001 in the mining context this reaction occurs when waste rocks are enriched in sulfide minerals but can be also exacerbated when tailings subjected to acidic treatment have not been neutralized the long term management of tailings must therefore take amd into account in order to minimize any damage they may be caused to the environment for this purpose accurate monitoring of the hydrogeochemical variables water level discharges ph electrical conductivity and environmental tracers is required to trace and identify potential water contamination wolkersdorfer et al 2020 data analysis is then used to improve the understanding of the groundwater flows and is essential before any attempt at numerical modeling mengistu et al 2019 3d modeling based on the monitoring and analysis of climatic and hydrogeological data also enables the functioning of groundwater flows at the catchment scale and in particular of the tsf to be better understood numerical models reproducing groundwater and or surface flows on former mining sites have been used under controlled or real conditions aubertin et al 2002 mengistu et al 2015 many studies have used modeling to simulate either the water rebound after mine closure rapantova et al 2007 the dewatering problem gonzález quirós and fernández álvarez 2019 the groundwater flow system in an abandoned mine tomiyama et al 2020 or to estimate groundwater inflow surinaidu et al 2014 more specifically one may cite galván et al 2016 who modeled the iberian pyrite belt affected by amd to optimize remediation efforts in the catchment and work done by herr et al 2007 who developed a catchment scale amd model combining hydrological and geochemical data to simulate the mine impact on ph and metal concentration different reclamation scenarios in particular the use of a cover over the tailings can indeed be tested using a model water cover and or engineered cover are the main systems used to control amd generation and reduce radon emanation iaea and oecd 2002 the choice depends on local conditions such as the water budget climate tailings properties and storage types bussière 2010 aubertin et al 2016 ethier et al 2018 engineered cover systems are used to limit the contact between rainfall water and tailings in cases where the contamination is assumed to be only short term an engineering cover system is not mandatory as long as mining effluents are treated before their release in the environment the re vegetation of the surface is in all cases important to control erosion processes lersow 2010 as well as to increase evapotranspiration and thus limit the infiltration of rainwater amd is a long term process that can occur for more than 100 years and requires sustainable reclamation akcil and koldas 2006 yet climate change is likely to alter rainfalls and temperatures over the next 50 100 years these changes could impact the water table and the surface water discharge at the catchment scale and therefore the geochemical functioning of the tsfs and mining sites didovets et al 2020 henriksen et al 2021 taking into account the impact of climate change on the hydrogeological functioning of these former mining sites will therefore ensure the sustainable management of water and the environment on the one hand current studies focus on climate change impacts regarding dam stabilities in mining operations tailings dam failures are often caused by intense rainfall events as well as inadequate surface water management niekerk and viljoen 2005 hatje et al 2017 on the other hand some authors have worked on site reclamation with respect to the performance of tailings cover under climate change studying its impact on a moisture retaining layer hotton et al 2020 or showing that a well designed monolayer cover with an elevated water table should remain effective lieber et al 2022 but few studies have yet analyzed climate change impacts on water balance and hydrogeological responses in mining areas even though changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events due to climate change labonté raymond et al 2020 could increase amd during these events in this context the bertholène mine represents a model case study in france which has been studied for a long time e g ledoux et al 1993 schmitt et al 2002 triganon 2013 and is still under long term environmental monitoring the bertholène site is a former uranium mine where mine tailings and waste rocks are stored in a natural valley incised in the metamorphic basement of the massif central the tsf is located in the middle of the mainly forested balaures catchment and covers 7 ha out of the 240 ha of the catchment the stored materials waste rocks with significant pyrite contents non neutralized tailings in contact with water and oxygen cause amd where water with low ph ph 3 5 and significant concentrations of sulfate concentrations of sulfate 10 2 mol l and metals al 10 4 mol l fe mn 10 5 mol l u 10 6 mol l are generated and redirected to a water treatment plant before release into the environment at the end of the exploitation in 1995 the site was reclaimed the hydrogeochemical study concluded that the quality of the effluents from leaching of source terms in the tsf should meet environmental standards without treatment after 50 years ledoux et al 1993 the choice was therefore made not to cover the tsf and to treat the effluents for this short term period almost 30 years later even if a significant improvement of the water quality was observed effluent remains an issue due to amd generation within the tsf and with acidic water at the tsf outlet recent geochemical modeling of the storage facility beaucaire 2021 indicates that amd is expected to occur for another 50 100 years this questioned the no cover solution and led the authorities to request additional analyses and the study of alternative solutions from the orano group in charge of the site reclamation in particular they called for clarification of the origin of the water at the tsf outlet and better knowledge of saturation conditions in the tsf as a first step for geochemical modeling the purpose of this paper is to answer these hydrological questions in order to clarify the current and future hydrogeological functioning of the site through data analysis and modeling this article first presents the analysis of data acquired in the site to better understand the dynamics of the hydrosystem after rainfall events and to clarify the interactions between the waste rocks the tsf and the water table cross correlations of groundwater level and observed discharges with daily rainfall recorded at the nearby weather station of rodez were performed a water balance was calculated using thornthwaite s approach and based on site observations rainfall discharges a 3d numerical model of the aquifer system of the balaures catchment was developed based on the recharge calculated from the water balance and the first conclusions of the data analysis it runs in steady sate and saturated conditions representing the average state of the hydrogeological system the popular and common modflow modeling software harbaugh 2005 has been used in its basic configuration coupled with gms visual interface modflow appears as an international standard to simulate or manage groundwater flows validated by the authorities which justifies the choice of this software for the present study the model helps identify the sub catchments and test reclamation scenario with a cover over the tsf the model also allows using particle tracking to identify the preferential flow paths from the potential contamination sources within the catchment since the amd should occur at least during 50 years the site must also be managed with a long term view it is located at the limit between the north and the south of france where the climate change predictions are uncertain regarding the rainfall variation and the modification of extreme events the impact of climate change on the future hydrological functioning of the catchment was then investigated using daily rainfall and temperature data sourced from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 for three climatic scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the evolution of the water balance as well as the frequency and intensity of extreme events over the next 100 years are evaluated with the cmip5 simulated data the study of extreme events observed at the study site complete the analysis to understand the site response to rain events 2 site description 2 1 location geology hydrogeology and climate the bertholène mining site is located in the south west of the massif central near rodez fig 1 it is located in the heart of a 240 ha catchment the site is surrounded by the palanges forest ranging in elevation from 600 m to 900 m above sea level m a s l with some steep slopes the catchment is crossed by the balaures river from south to north a continuous aquifer is present in the fractured gneiss basement separated from the stephanian coal sandstones by the presence of a major ese wnw fault fig 2 further north the palanges fault marks the separation from the jurassic limestone schmitt and tardy 1986 and it delimits the hydrogeological catchment the underground flows are mainly oriented towards the north and are drained by the balaures river successive mine reclamations have significantly modified the downstream part of the catchment where an alluvial water table is found at the bottom of the valley the local climate is temperate with a mountain climate influence a large contrast is observed between winter and summer temperatures the mean daily temperature varies from around 0 c in winter to more than 20 c in summer the mean rainfall in bertholène between november 2006 and october 2021 was 1083 mm per year two periods can be distinguished from december to may winter and spring some large winter rain events may occur but there are few days with snow from june to november the period is drier with possible stormy events 2 2 the bertholène mining site the mining site covers only 42 ha of the 240 ha of the balaures catchment south of the palanges fault fig 2 the site is supervised and monitored by the orano group for its remediation reclamation and water management the bertholène site was modified by the former mining activities the southern part is a tsf located in the balaures valley drawn in orange in fig 1 to avoid contact between the river and the tailings the balaures river was diverted to the west of the tsf in a concrete canal below the storage facility the ancient river bed was replaced by a pebble drain which is laid over a geotextile membrane this drain should collect all water infiltrated through the tsf it also leads this water to a control basin bc where it is collected for treatment the northern part of the mining site was extensively reworked during operations and reclamation originally the mining facilities were built in this area to process the uranium today a treatment station and several collection basins are located in the same area to control and treat water before discharge into the environment the area is mainly composed of alluvial deposits in the alluvial plain the balaures river was also slightly diverted to a higher elevation to the east of the site in order to facilitate the development of the mining facilities leaching stalls treatment basin and release basin in the valley fig 1 a non estimated part of the discharge of the deviated river infiltrates into the reworked area and goes back to its original bed water arriving at the treatment plant is collected from three zones the tailings mining storage the open pit mine and the underground mine working fig 3 the water treatment consists of clarification and lime neutralization through successive basins after the treatment water goes to post treatment basins before a final ph check its environmental release into the balaures river takes place 50 m before the discharge station q venturi itself located 150 m upstream of the outlet of the catchment 2 3 ore mining and tailings storage uranium extraction at bertholène started in 1977 and continued until november 1994 with a total production of 750 tu the ore was extracted by static leaching with sulfuric acid the uranium deposit extended over a height of about 300 m from 490 m to 810 m a s l this deposit was mined with both an open pit mine and an underground mine working the underground mine was stopped in 1991 because the vein was exhausted then the drift horizontal opening was partially backfilled 85 the pumping was stopped and the water level rose back to its natural level the open pit mine extraction was stopped in 1994 1 100 000 m3 of materials had been excavated to create the operating facilities and build the tsf dykes the tsf has a length of 700 m a width around 100 m and it covers 7 ha fig 1 the tsf follows the slope of the natural valley 7 with a depth varying from 10 to 50 m from upstream to downstream fig s1 see supplementary material the stored materials are varied and piled up in alternating layers the tsf is composed of 476 000 tons of 0 8 mm particle size combined with waste rocks this mixture is used as protection from the leaching precipitates approximately 33 000 tons of precipitates from the neutralization with lime of the acid effluents which contain gypsum and metal hydroxides were added to the tsf and intercalated between tailings layers a pebble drain laid over a geotextile membrane is located at the bottom of the valley in order to collect the water infiltrating through the storage facility on top of these layers 30 cm thick blocks of waste rock separate the tailings from the surface fig 7 at the surface of the storage facility water sludge resulting from the water treatment since the site closure is stored in storage tanks the tsf is now covered with a natural and sparse coniferous vegetation such as pines and small bushes it is exposed to rainfall and water percolates through it water reacts with the remaining pyrite in the waste rocks and generates amd water with low ph 3 5 high concentrations of sulfate so4 2 10 2 mol l and metals al 10 4 mol l fe mn 10 5 mol l u 10 6 mol l drains into the bc at the outlet of the tsf 2 4 environmental issues amd is an issue common to many former mine sites in the world whose adequate management and long term remediation initially require a detailed understanding of their hydrological functioning the methodology developed hereafter to address this issue could therefore be usefully transferred to other former mine sites in the bertholène site the main environmental problem comes from the tailings and waste rocks storage facility with amd mainly generated by the waste rocks at the storage outlet it is therefore important in a first stage to quantify the flow conditions within the storage facility for a better understanding of the reaction of the tsf to rainfall likewise the origin of the water arriving at the bc i e at the outlet of the storage sub catchment must be explained these issues must also be viewed through the prism of climate change which could alter the current water balance in a second stage geochemical modelling can be coupled to predict the duration of amd 3 materials and methods 3 1 instrumentation and field measurements the rainfall data from january 2006 to november 2021 was provided by an in situ station these data were originally measured daily and then weekly or monthly since january 2016 to complete the analysis of daily events and catchment reactivity meteorological data provided by the météo france station at rodez have been used to perform daily cross correlations and extreme events analysis it provides daily rainfall and minimum and maximum temperatures for the period 2006 2021 this station is located 25 km away from the bertholène site at an altitude of 579 m a s l while the mining site is at 700 m a s l for the period november 2006 to october 2021 the rainfall recorded by météo france in rodez 837 mm year was 23 lower than that recorded in bertholène 1083 mm year this difference can be explained by the difference in elevation and topography the rodez station being located on a plain while the mining site is in a hilly area records from four discharge stations installed on the catchment are available from january 2006 to november 2021 on a daily then weekly basis fig 3 three of them measure the water discharge coming from each contaminant zone before it reaches the treatment plant the open pit mine q mco tms the tsf at bc q bc and the water originating from the west hillside downstream of the catchment q dsc the last discharge point q venturi measures the sum of the balaures river discharges downstream of the catchment and the total discharge from the treatment plant groundwater levels have been monitored on a monthly basis for 23 years 1999 2021 using 13 piezometers nine of them located inside or around the tsf fig 3 two new piezometers were drilled in october 2018 in the center of the storage facility v1 and v2 most of the piezometers are screened in the most permeable section of the bedrock aquifer gneiss however five of them are screened at the interface between the storage facility and the gneiss be10 be11 be12 v1 and v2 since june 2018 nine piezometers including the two new piezometers starting in october were equipped with solinst levelogger three or ott six sensors for a daily monitoring of groundwater level accuracy for all sensors 0 05 fs 0 10 m for all the piezometers except for p4 0 20 m the electrical conductivity of groundwater has been monitored daily in two piezometers since 2018 v1 in the middle of the tsf and p3 at its eastern edge this continuous monitoring was supplemented by two sampling missions for all piezometers and outlets these sampling missions were an opportunity to measure the electrical conductivity at the bc the high flow sampling mission was in march 2019 at the end of the winter the groundwater level and the discharges were at their highest as was rainfall the low flow sampling mission took place in early october 2019 following a low rainfall summer groundwater levels and discharges were low at this time 3 2 cross correlations correlation analysis is used in various fields of geoscience in particular to understand the hydrological functioning of karst systems fiorillo and doglioni 2010 larocque et al 1998 the use of correlation with temporal data can provide information on the response mechanisms of hydrogeological systems sahu et al 2009 tirogo et al 2016 cross correlation is a comparison between two time series to see if a link exists between the input series x t and the output series y t eq 1 the cross correlation function r xy is defined by eq 2 1 c xy k 1 n t 1 n k x t x y t k y 2 r xy k c xy k σ x σ y where c xy k is the cross correlogram n is the time series length k is the time lag x and y are the means of input and output time series and σ x and σ y are the standard deviations of the input and output time series the time lag corresponding to the maximum value for r xy k is the response time of the system to the input signal the correlation is significant at a 95 confidence level when r xy k is greater than 2 n with n the number of observations cross correlations were calculated on a daily basis for the period january 2006 to november 2021 with a maximum lag of 40 days with rainfall as the input signal and discharges at the four stations q bc q mco tms q dsc and q venturi as the output signal and for the period june 2018 to november 2021 between rainfall and groundwater level recorded daily by nine piezometers ai16 be10 p3 p4 p5 p6 p8 v1 and v2 the daily rainfall comes from the météo france weather station using this analysis the catchment s responses to rainfall events have been studied to understand its reactivity particularly in the area of the tsf where amd is generated 3 3 water balance the annual water balance at the site scale is described by eq 3 expressed in mm year 3 p aet r i aet p eff 4 p eff q r i where p is the rainfall aet the actual evapotranspiration r the runoff and i the infiltration for a well defined hydrological unit the effective rainfall p eff in eq 3 should be equal to the discharge q measured at the catchment outlet eq

the julian day and the latitude γ is the latent heat of water vaporization kj kg ρ is the density of water kg m3 and t is the mean daily temperature c in the bertholène case two different hydrological units were considered the storage facility sub catchment upstream of the bc 34 ha and the sub catchment with q venturi as the outlet 230 ha the discharges for each sub catchment were respectively measured at q bc and q venturi the water balances were estimated from monthly data recorded on site and cumulated by hydrological year for each sub catchment november 2006 to october 2021 3 4 numerical modeling a three dimensional 3d steady state groundwater flow model of the catchment aquifer system has been developed using the finite difference code modflow 2005 via the gms software interface version 10 4 aquaveo 2017 modflow was used with the native packages recharge rch1 well wel1 the solver preconditioned conjugate gradient solver pcgs and the flow package layer property flow lpf those packages can work with few information about materials properties horizontal hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy the saturated flow equation is solved in steady state conditions with the preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg solver with the convergence criteria on head change hclose and residual change rclose of 0 0001 m and 0 0001 m3 s the model is a simplified version of the catchment with only two layers a 60 m thick unconfined layer corresponding to the weathered bedrock and alluvial deposits over a 150 m thick confined layer which represents the less permeable deeper bedrock fig 4 the tsf that overlies gneiss formations over only 3 of the total model surface has been removed from the topography and from the model domain due its unsaturated functioning see section 4 1 the spatial discretization uses a rectangular grid with 206 385 square meshes with a side length of 5 m that allows for good representation of catchment surface details such as the tsf and the reworked area the catchment topography is derived from a combination of the french ign 5 m topographic map bd ortho 5 m and a recent 1 m topographic map for the orano site specifically created by a land surveyor the latter represents less than 20 of the catchment surface for simplicity and numerical stability the model of the main local aquifer does not represent the overlying storage facility and the balaures river only follows its original course in the natural valley within the tsf section the topography has been modified to restore the valley to its original appearance prior to the installation of the storage facility based on the elevation of the old riverbed at the bottom of the valley and by smoothing the sides of the valley no flow boundary conditions were assigned to the lateral boundaries of the domain which are assumed to align with the catchment divides fig 5 a fixed head boundary was set for the balaures river at 0 5 m below the surface in the gneiss 1 m below the alluvial plain in the northern part and at 629 m a s l at the river outlet a value which corresponds to the mean groundwater level measured close to the catchment output piezometers p8 and p9 all the small and intermittent creeks were also represented by a constant head boundary with a hydraulic head 0 25 m lower than the surface elevation the main water input of the model is the recharge the recharge represents the net infiltration estimated with the water balance calculation 506 mm year 0 0369 m3 s see section 4 3 this recharge is applied to the whole top layer of the model a second input has been defined because of a small loss 0 00016 m3 s due to the degradation of the concrete canal representing 1 of the canal total flow and less than 0 5 of the total recharge initial values of hydraulic conductivities table 1 were estimated from slug tests from a previous hydrogeological survey of the site géostock 1993 and are assumed homogeneous within each unit except the weathered gneiss the studied aquifer can be consider a hard rock aquifer known to have an anisotropy of hydraulic conductivities dewandel et al 2006 in such aquifers the horizontal hydraulic conductivity can reach 2 30 times the vertical hydraulic conductivity maréchal et al 2004 a vertical anisotropy of 1 3 is used in the model which is at the lower end of the range the model was calibrated starting from these a priori values table 1 and using the average water level of all piezometers during the period 2006 2021 and the average of the measured discharge at the storage q bc and at the catchment q venturi outlets for the period 2006 2021 all the water levels are measured within the first layer of the model simulations were evaluated in steady state using the coefficient of determination r 2 and the following statistical estimators the mean error me the absolute mean error ame and the root mean square error rmse as described by eqs 7 8 and 9 7 me 1 n i 1 n h o i h s i 8 ame 1 n i 1 n h o i h s i 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n h o i h s i ² 0 5 where h o is the observed water level h s is the simulated water level and n is the number of observation piezometers the estimator values must be as low as possible and close to zero once the model had been calibrated particle tracking the modpath package available for modflow was used to visualize the pathlines according to different starting zones and to delineate the hydrogeological sub catchments only forward tracking was used in this study the use of this package allows us to validate groundwater sources and to visualize groundwater flow pathlines in each sub catchment as well as within the alluvial area 3 5 climate change 3 5 1 climate data to analyze changes in temperature and rainfall until the end of the century six climate projections from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 for three climatic scenarios computed by several european institutes involved in climate modeling were used http www drias climat fr in total 18 simulations were analyzed for the period 2006 2098 from the six regional models table 2 with three rcp representative concentration pathway scenarios as well as 6 simulations for the historical period 1975 2005 those 6 simulations are considered as reference simulations but not as real observations the daily climate data come from regional climate models around europe the data were projected onto an 8 km resolution grid and corrected for skew using the adamont method extended to france and implemented by météo france déqué 2007 verfaillie et al 2017 based on the analysis of observation data the projections from the closest grid point to the site 3 km were analyzed latitude 44 36120º longitude 2 78843º the three following rcps were selected for the study the rcp2 6 in line with the paris agreement the rcp4 5 considered a more probable scenario and the rcp8 5 the worst case scenario for which co2 emissions are the highest ipcc 2014 the new pathways from cmip6 the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps have now integrated socio economic evolution gross domestic product demography governance education and technology and are coupled with climate forcing rcp a match can be made between the ssps cmip6 and the rcps cmip5 scenarios ssp1 2 6 and rcp2 6 ssp2 and rcp4 5 and ssp5 8 5 and rcp8 5 in france the temperature is expected to rise between 2 c and 5 c and the rainfall is also expected to rise by 2 6 according to the rcp scenarios soubeyroux et al 2020 the projected changes in france are different in the northwestern part of france and the southeastern part the south region of france could be drier with longer droughts and a pattern modification of rainfall with more rainfall in winter the location of the site in the south of france and close to the massif central may have an additional local impact table 3 presents the mean overall variation of the 6 models in the study site for rcp2 6 the temperature variation is lower than that of france and for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the variation is the same for the rainfall the overall variation shows a decrease in rainfall for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 that contrasts with the expected variation at the national scale 3 5 2 trends analysis mann kendall and sen s slope the non parametric mann kendall test is commonly used to detect trends in time series of environmental data as trends can be affected by the presence of negative or positive autocorrelations hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 autocorrelation is first performed to check the randomness and the periodicity of the time series data if randomness is found or the periodicity is statistically insignificant the mann kendall test can be performed without altering the data kendall 1975 mann 1945 the non parametric test developed by sen 1968 is used to estimate the slope of the mann kendall s trend analysis it calculates the magnitude of any significant trend detected in the mann kendall test the mann kendall test and sen s slope test were performed on the mean annual rainfall and mean annual temperature data as water balance will be affected by any change in rainfall and temperature tests were also performed on annual actual evapotranspiration aet and annual effective rainfall estimated from a monthly water balance calculation see section 3 3 the water balance calculation was performed with the thornthwaite method to estimate trends on water balance components between 2006 and 2098 independently of the previous results obtained with this method for the historical period the average variation of rainfall temperature and effective rainfall for the six models between the periods 2006 2036 and 2068 2098 has been estimated to assess the impact of climate change on the latter 3 5 3 extreme events frequency and intensity to go beyond the seasonal and annual scales the analysis also focuses on extreme events that are likely to become more intense and more frequent with climate change ipcc 2021 extreme events can impact the groundwater level below the tsf and create more amd groundwater level monitoring shows that the peaks of water level are reached during the winter period and on consecutive rainy days to quantify rainfall intensity our approach consists of analyzing the increase of the amount of rain which falls over three days using return periods the return periods are estimated using the generalized extreme values gev distribution function which combines three asymptotic forms of extreme value distributions gumbel weibull and fréchet in a unique form fisher and tippett 1928 this law is mainly used in hydrology to model extreme events and to estimate their return period from daily rainfalls santos et al 2016 collet et al 2017 gaur et al 2018 on the basis of one maximum occurrence per year the intensity of each return period has been estimated by taking the highest 3 day rainfall event per year for the historical period between 1975 and 2005 and using it as a reference for comparison with climate projections return levels have also been calculated using rainfall from the 18 climate simulations over the period 2006 2036 and at the end of the century period 2068 2098 analysis of the frequency of exceeding a rainfall threshold allows us to see if the events concerned will be more frequent at the end of the century the threshold chosen corresponds to the 10 year return period for the historical period in this case 87 mm the number of occurrences above the threshold is analyzed for different 30 year periods 1975 2005 2006 2036 2037 2067 and 2068 2098 4 results 4 1 spatio temporal variation of electrical conductivity and hydraulic head in the tsf table 4 shows the groundwater electrical conductivity measured in piezometers v1 and p3 and at the bc during the low flow october 2019 and high flow march 2019 sampling campaigns and the mean daily electrical conductivity monitored between june 2018 and november 2021 the electrical conductivity measured at bc in october 2019 is 164 µs cm for a very low flow at the sampling point q bc 0 0016 m3 s in march the flow was higher q bc 0 0032 m3 s and the electrical conductivity was also higher 684 µs cm the highest electrical conductivity is measured in v1 with values above 2000 µs cm it reflects the influence of water infiltrated through the tsf where part of the amd is generated the electrical conductivity measured in p3 is very low with an average value of 30 µs cm representative of the low mineralization of water in gneiss aquifer it demonstrates that the water in p3 is not influenced by the storage facility the variation in electrical conductivity in bc is due to the difference in rainfall between the two campaigns in winter the vertical infiltration through the storage facility is more important bringing more water in bc with a high mineralization fig 6 shows the changes in daily hydraulic heads measured in piezometers inside and around the tsf locations shown in fig 3 from june 2018 to november 2021 two types of variation are observed the hydraulic head in the piezometers v1 and v2 located within the storage area as well as be11 be12 and p6 not shown here shows annual variations with less than 1 m of amplitude whereas outside the storage facility annual variations are greater than 3 m with a strong seasonal pattern be10 p3 p4 and p5 peak levels occur during the winter period december to may and the highest peaks are observed after intense rainfall more than 50 mm for several days the lowest levels are observed at the end of the dry period june to november fig 7 exhibits a transversal cross section of the tsf with the maximum mean and minimum hydraulic heads observed from daily measurements between june 2018 and november 2021 it shows that the maximum water level remains below the tsf red dashes except at the drain level the drain located at the base of the storage facility can be fed by water coming both from the vertical infiltration through the unsaturated tailings and by lateral groundwater flows from the gneiss aquifer 4 2 catchment reactivity the recent daily monitoring data allow for a more accurate estimation of response times of the water level to rainfall cross correlations between rainfall and water levels in the nine piezometers as illustrated in fig 8a show a fast reaction and a pronounced response to rainfall with a time lag of about 5 days for the water level in piezometers be10 v1 and v2 for the other piezometers the reaction is less pronounced with a time lag that varies from 5 to 16 days maximum cross correlation coefficients are reached within a 5 8 days delay between the rainfall and the discharge at each discharge station including at the outlet of the storage catchment q bc where the discharge peak appears 8 days after the rainfall fig 8b 4 3 recharge estimation at the mean annual scale 81 5 of the discharge at the q venturi comes from the balaures river table 5 of the remaining 18 5 which comes from the treatment station 65 is from the storage sub catchment q bc 21 from the open pit mine drainage area q mco tms and 14 from the western hill q dsc q venturi is the outlet from a hydrological sub catchment of 230 ha the zone between the open pit mine and the western part of the historical facilities is drained to this point by a system of canal and drains the average annual discharge at q venturi is 0 0437 m3 s upstream the storage sub catchment drains a surface catchment of 34 ha based on the topography of the area it corresponds to the 7 ha of the tailings storage and an additional surface of 27 ha of forest on the hillsides around the storage facility the control basin q bc that is supposed to drain this sub catchment exhibits an average annual discharge of 0 0053 m3 s fig 9 shows the water balance between november 2006 and october 2021 and the inter annual average estimated with monthly data aggregated to an annual frequency the average rainfall is 1083 mm year the actual evapotranspiration calculated using the thornthwaite method is 584 mm year which represents 54 of rainfall it results in an effective rainfall p eff of 611 mm year with a small difference 2 compared with the mean discharge at the site outlet q venturi but 20 higher than that measured at q bc even when considering that the collected water drained by q bc is a mixture of water coming from the vertical infiltration through the storage 7 ha and lateral flows coming from the gneiss aquifer 27 ha for this catchment which is mainly covered by forest with slopes between 0 and 7 the runoff coefficient can be estimated at a value of 0 17 using the table from the american society of civil engineers 1969 the estimated mean annual runoff is then 104 mm year and the net infiltration of 506 mm year is then applied as recharge in the model 4 4 groundwater modeling the calibration of the model at a steady state condition was performed by varying the hydraulic conductivity of the formations in order to properly reproduce the mean annual piezometric levels in the 13 piezometers of the study area as well as the discharges observed at the control basin q bc and at the site output q venturi the calibrated hydraulic conductivities are presented in table 1 fig 10 shows a good agreement between the observed and the simulated hydraulic heads r2 0 993 to a lesser extent for ai16 which is outside the catchment and be19 which is in the reworked area all simulated levels lie within the 95 confident interval the me ame and rmse for the calibrated model are 0 65 m 3 21 m and 3 78 m respectively the maximum acceptable value of the calibration criterion depends on the water level magnitude over the domain the scaled root mean square error srmse which is rmse divided by the range of observed water levels is 3 3 it must be less than 10 to be considered as an acceptable value barnett et al 2012 mamo et al 2021 the calibration of the model was thus considered of good quality the simulated hydraulic heads satisfactorily reproduce the groundwater flow in the gneiss aquifer below the storage area the groundwater flow in the southern part of the catchment is drained by the balaures river and by small creeks on the steepest hills in the gneiss aquifer p3 p4 and p5 the flow is oriented directly towards the bottom of the valley here the vertical flow across the multiple layers of the tsf corresponds to the prescribed recharge on top of the model at the storage facility itself the water table is drained by the ancient bed of the balaures river be11 b12 v1 v2 and p6 downstream the groundwater flow is also oriented towards the ancient river bed whereas in the western part of the catchment where the slopes are steeper the flow goes straight to the outlet if the model gives satisfactory results for hydraulic heads it does not appear to accurately simulate the observed discharge of the two main sub catchments of the study area as shown in table 5 the simulated discharge at the control basin q bc 0 0065 m3 s is overestimated by 48 while the simulated discharge at the outlet of the site q venturi 0 0282 m3 s is underestimated by 22 compared to observations forward particle tracking was used to identify the pathlines of the groundwater flow inside and in the vicinity of the tsf sub catchment as well as in the alluvial zone downstream of the catchment for the sub catchment fig 11 forward particle tracking particles represented by a red circle was used to delineate the subsurface catchment limits upstream of the control basin the particle pathlines confirm that the control basin is fed laterally by groundwater flows coming from the hillsides and that the original bed of the balaures river drains groundwater from the hillsides to the control basin this subsurface catchment covers a surface area of 40 ha 6 ha more than the surface catchment previously defined from the topography whereas a subsurface catchment of smaller size than the surface catchment had been expected to meet the measured flow fig 12 shows the particle tracking simulation downstream in the alluvial zone the starting particles are located in layer 1 close to the balaures surface catchment limits in order to compare the surface and subsurface catchments and clarify the origin of the difference between the observed and simulated discharges at q venturi it shows that groundwater from the western slopes is not immediately collected by the river but instead flows parallel to the river in the alluvial deposits due to their high hydraulic conductivity and the gentle slopes of the hills today the western part is actually drained by channels and drains and the water flows directly into the balaures river if the exchanges between these two areas 0 0078 m3 s are added to the previously simulated flow at q venturi 0 0282 m3 s a total simulated discharge of 0 036 m3 s is obtained equal to the observed one with a slight difference of 0 7 4 5 climate change 4 5 1 long term climatic trends and impact on water balance in table 6 according to all scenarios the mean annual temperature over the next 100 years could statistically increase by 0 5 5 c at the bertholène site mean sen s slope 0 005 to 0 052 c year for annual rainfall no trend is observed for the rcp2 6 scenario for rcp4 5 only one out of six climate models gives a significant decreasing trend for the worst case scenario rcp8 5 two trends are both significant and decreasing table 6 concerning the water balance terms at the catchment scale table 7 there is no overall trend for aet from the mann kendall test for the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios annual trends are divergent and mostly not significant with only three simulations showing a significant trend for the rcp8 5 scenario four out of six trends are significant half of them showing an increase of aet effective rainfall is influenced both by rainfall and aet changes only two models out of 18 display a significant trend overall the effective rainfall is decreasing for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 by 2 4 and 4 4 5 2 extreme events and their influence on the observed hydraulic head the impact of extreme events on groundwater level was studied from acquired data on piezometers be10 and v1 which are the only two piezometers located in the center of the valley be10 is located upstream of the storage and v1 is located in the middle of the facility downstream the storage and it is screened at the base of 40 m of precipitates and tailings the studied events correspond to the maximum water level recorded during the period june 2018 november 2021 they result from a succession of rainy days between the 19th of january and the 9th of february 2021 for the two piezometers during the wet period fig 13a shows the water level change in be10 the peak is reached with a lag of 4 days after 7 rainy days with a total of 50 mm during the last 3 days this cumulative rainfall over 3 days corresponds to a 2 year return period event the water level increased by 2 m in 4 days after a first peak 27 january the decrease was also rapid right after the rainfall stopped 3 5 m in 5 days this part of the storage facility also exhibits high seasonal piezometric variations 3 4 m as shown previously in fig 6 fig 13b shows the water level in piezometer v1 for the same rain event recorded during winter 2021 the highest water level rise is due to consecutive rainy days and the peak is reached after 3 rainy days with a rise of 40 cm it slowly decreases as the rainfall ceases during this largest event ever observed during the three years of daily monitoring the maximum water level observed remained at about 1 5 m below the tailings the groundwater level also never reached the tailings at the observation piezometers be11 and be12 during the 20 year monthly monitoring the threshold of the 3 day cumulative event corresponding to the decennial return period is 87 mm over the period 1975 2005 the number of events over this threshold per 30 year period in the 21st century is represented in fig 14 for the three periods considered the number of events should increase from four events between 1975 and 2005 to nearly 8 events on average over 30 years extreme events should therefore become more frequent during the next century compared with the historical period while remaining more or less equally frequent over the next 100 years for scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 for the scenario rcp4 5 there should be an increase from 5 8 in 2006 2036 to 8 3 events at the end of the century fig 15 shows the estimated intensity of extreme events for several given return periods for the simulated historical rainfall between 1975 and 2005 and for the three rcp scenarios over the period 2006 2036 and the period 2068 2098 for a given return period the variability of return level is represented according to the six models the return level is expected to increase by 9 21 on average at the end of the century for all three scenarios compared to the historical period for rcp2 6 events should be more intense for the period 2068 2098 than during the period 2006 2036 by an average of 4 1 the same result is observed for rcp4 5 with an average intensity increase of 4 4 while for rcp8 5 the return levels decrease for that same scenario events should be less intense during the period 2068 2098 than during the period 2006 2036 by an average of 4 5 discussion 5 1 hydrogeological functioning of the storage area thanks to the high frequency monitoring and the presence of two new piezometers within the tsf the analysis of groundwater level variations demonstrated that the storage facility is in an unsaturated condition with the groundwater level below the tsf even for extreme rainfall events with a 2 year return period the water level still should not reach the tailings base for the moment this is the most important rainfall event recorded the water collected by the control basin at the storage outlet originates from two sources as illustrated by electrical conductivities ec measured during high and low flow at the drain level in piezometer v1 in the gneiss aquifer in piezometer p3 and at the basin control table 4 at the surface the sub catchment drained by q bc is supplied at 80 from the forest where water feeds the gneiss aquifer and at 20 by the tsf through which water infiltrates vertically during high flow period the combination of 70 of groundwater from the gneiss aquifer and 30 from the tailings zone gives the measured ec value of 684 µs cm at the control basin during low flow period the repartition corresponding to the measured ec value 164 µs cm is very different with only 5 from the tailings zone and 95 from the hillsides water percolation through the tailings is limited during summer by less rainfall and high evapotranspiration while the bedrock aquifer acts as a reservoir storing water in winter and releasing it in summer it is assumed that the drain is continuously fed by vertical infiltration as the electrical conductivity measured in v1 always remains high fig s2 see supplementary material indicating the presence of high mineralized water in this piezometer all year long vertical infiltration occurs through two mechanisms continuous darcy type flow and non continuous rapid preferential flow see section 4 3 the second mechanism could be of real importance with climate change and extreme events kalisman et al 2022 showed that pulsed pressure wave flow which can be likened to sudden water injections or extreme events generated 75 more solute mass compared to continuous darcy type flow the amd generation could then be increased it is also assumed that the old river bed still acts as a drain for the gneiss aquifer as illustrated in the numerical model by the convergence of groundwater flows towards the former river bed here defined as a constant head boundary condition 5 2 catchment scale groundwater flow the annual water balance estimated using the thornthwaite method a pet calculation based on the oudin formula and a ru of 50 mm maximum is well balanced at q venturi with the estimated recharge 506 mm year the measured discharge minus runoff at q venturi is well reproduced by the model taking into account the flow drained by the alluvial part on the left bank there is agreement between the surface and subsurface watersheds at the scale of the balaures catchment with the same calculation the water balance at q bc is overestimated by 20 for a hydrological surface of 34 ha a sub catchment area of only 27 ha would be required to balance the water budget at q bc however the model does not confirm this hypothesis with a subsurface catchment determined using particle tracking reaching as high as 40 ha the increase in hydraulic conductivity of the deep layer within a reasonable range did not allow the creation of deeper circulations bypassing the drain under the tailings the hypothesis of lower effective localized rainfall is also not supported by the presence on the tsf of a sparse vegetation cover and coarse materials on the surface that facilitate infiltration the model was unsuccessful in providing constraints on the value of the recharge as the simulated heads in the storage area were not sensitive to the imposed recharge value which we varied between 5 and 20 of the initial value only the me criterion decreases as recharge increases therefore it is possible that the presence of the geotextile membrane at the base of the drain which is not represented in the model partially limits drainage from the catchment area to the control basin in any case however it facilitates the recovery of any water that has seeped into the tsf and is then stored in the control basin finally we cannot exclude the possibility that the quality of the flow measurement at the control basin is part of the explanation for the water balance discrepancy in addition the potential evapotranspiration calculated for the catchment is 662 mm year which represents 61 of the rainfall the pet p ratio for the bertholène site is the same as for other small catchments in the area when using the same oudin evapotranspiration formula french hydro database brigode et al 2020 in the equivalent catchments 1 2 24 km2 located around the bertholène site o5010535 o5000510 o5445510 and o5055310 this ratio is less than 65 we can therefore assume that the thornthwaite water balance calculation does work at q venturi between november 2006 and october 2021 and can be used to estimate the water balance in the context of climate change considering all other parameters equal including vegetation 5 3 use and limitations of the hydrogeological model in its native version modflow cannot simulate unsaturated flow the uzf package has been developed to meet this need but it is mainly designed to compute the evapotranspiration and the recharge in unsaturated areas despite that modflow has been chosen in this study first the knowledge of the particle size and the parameters to describe the unsaturated medium within the tsf was very imperfect and not sufficient to run adequately the uzf package second the goal was to simulate the average groundwater flow at the catchment scale the tsf that overlies gneiss formations over only 3 of the total model surface was therefore removed from the aquifer system model domain due its unsaturated functioning inferred from the available data see section 4 1 in reality from a hydrogeological point of view the tsf delays the impact of effective rainfall by 5 16 days into the drain located below the tsf due to the infiltration through the tailings storage see section 4 2 as the model runs in steady state conditions and represents an average hydrogeological functioning this delay is not taken into account at the annual scale the use of a variable saturation flow model would certainly have been more appropriate but also much more expensive to implement in 3d and at the catchment scale a transient model would also have been useful to simulate seasonal variations and determine how groundwater levels and discharges would change during future wet and dry periods ethier et al 2018 an et al 2022 simulation of flows taking into account the delay due to the tsf would provide information on flow velocity in summer and winter and on possible preferential flows in the tsf in addition the development of a transient model would allow the simulation of the site s fate for the next 100 years in particular it would allow for the simulation at the site scale of the groundwater level during extreme events today but also in the future these events would not have the same impact on groundwater level in dry periods as in wet periods regarding the initial groundwater level conditions petpongpan et al 2021 the observed extreme events fig 13 occurred during the winter period with a high groundwater level but the reaction of the groundwater level is unknown during the dry period in case of heavy rainfall dry soil and low groundwater level despite all those simplifications and limitations the model was used to study the impact of an engineered system cover over the tsf on the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer system this cover is expected to limit or stop the infiltration through the tsf in order to reduce amd generation to test this scenario the recharge over the tsf surface 7 ha was set at 0 mm year as the main input in the model is the recharge the modification of the recharge impacts directly the groundwater level and discharge mainly at the tsf scale compared to the reference model the average decrease in simulated water level with cover would be about 1 6 m in the tsf area and the decrease of the discharge is 20 at q bc and 3 at q venturi the discharge would still be 0 0052 m3 s at q bc and mainly composed of water from the gneiss aquifer with an average ph of 5 7 above the environmental release limit ph 5 5 the acid mine drainage at the tsf outlet would be slightly reduced because gypsum and pyrite contained in the tailings will be isolated from the rainfall however ferric iron still present in the waste rocks and tailings may maintain amd moses et al 1987 geochemical modelling at the tsf scale is underway and will give more arguments on the added value of an engineering cover over the tsf 5 4 climate change impact although the impact of climate change has not been simulated with the model the water balance forecasts with the cmip5 simulations are reassuring as to the possible evolution of recharge an increase of the frequency and intensity of extreme events is expected for the end of the century analysis of climate variables under three rcp scenarios predicted a temperature rise of 0 5 5 c until 2098 in the study area changes in annual rainfall have no significant pattern for all rcp scenarios regarding seasonal variation summer should be drier with a rise of temperature and a decrease of rainfall as shown by terray and boé 2013 regarding effective rainfall few simulations show a significant trend two out of 18 and for those two simulations it is expected to decrease over the next 100 years the thornthwaite water balance method is not widely used to calculate effective rainfall in the future but it remains the simplest way to determine it aparecido et al 2021 nevertheless this conclusion should be used with caution as evapotranspiration could be impacted by changes in vegetation due to climate change laanaia et al 2016 the major uncertainties in potential evapotranspiration come from the climate models gcm and rcm themselves lemaître basset et al 2021 the potential evapotranspiration formula being co dependent on temperature at the annual scale if the effective rainfall were to decrease the water volume to be treated would be lower and therefore the current environmental management of the site would remain valid in the future extreme events due to climate change both heatwaves and rain events are expected to increase in france ouzeau et al 2016 tramblay and somot 2018 the number of events will rise compared to the historical period 1975 2005 on the one hand the analysis showed that extreme events in this area should be more frequent during the 21st century according to rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios for rcp4 5 the number of events should almost double between 2006 2036 and 2068 2098 a study on six catchments near the cévennes in southern france also showed that the frequency of extreme events could increase by 22 at the end of the century compared to the period 1960 1990 tramblay et al 2012 those results support the prediction that extreme events should be more frequent in the study basin like in southern france on the other hand these extreme events should be more intense during the period 2068 2098 compared to the 2006 2036 period according to the calculation of their return level using a maximum 3 day rainfall event per year except for rcp8 5 this increase has also been predicted with an even greater increase of up to 22 in extreme daily rainfall in the french mediterranean ribes et al 2019 this increase in rainfall during extreme events could impact the groundwater level below the tsf allowing it to reach the tailings based on observation of short period return events the water table should not remain in contact with the tailings for more than five days as seen in section 5 1 extreme events could generate more amd at the tsf outlet due to high pressure gradient in fine textured materials such as the tailings extreme events may also have a different impact on the recharge depending on the season in which they occur manna et al 2022 this impact is not taken into account by the thornthwaite method which is calculated on a monthly basis independently of rainfall intensity the extreme events occurring in summer are mainly due to storms with short and intense rainfall this can lead to rapid flows into the storage which is flat and permeable the low intensity summer rainfall is mainly evapotranspired unlike winter rainfall which produces more infiltration and increases the water content in the unsaturated zone such impacts could not be analyzed with the available data 6 conclusion the reclaimed bertholène mine allows us to study the hydrogeological behavior of an anthropogenic site to determine its potential modifications due to climate change and to provide guidance for sustainable environmental management in the future the analysis developed in this study was supported by long term field data the installation of two new piezometers located in the tailings mining facility tsf and the implementation of a daily monitoring in several piezometers in the area provided new and accurate information at the site scale the groundwater level analysis showed that the facility is in an unsaturated condition throughout the year including during recorded extreme rainfall events correlations between rainfall and discharges confirmed the fast response of the catchment at the tsf outlet the water collected at the control basin consists of at least 70 of water from the gneiss aquifer and up to 30 from vertical seepage through the unsaturated tailings during high flow periods a three dimensional simplified groundwater flow model was developed to understand the steady state functioning of the mining catchment based on the analysis of monitored data and to identify the groundwater flow paths the model s input is the recharge calculated from the water balance at the catchment scale q venturi the model was used to test the impacts of a reclamation scenario a cover over the tsf could lower groundwater levels by 1 m at the site scale and decrease the discharge at the bc by 20 the cover would slightly reduce the amd at the outlet of the tsf with only water coming from the gneiss aquifer reaching the control basin since amd is generated elsewhere in the mine site the treatment station should continue to operate with or without tsf coverage the geochemical model should provide new information on how long amd is expected to last in the near future at the tsf scale this will make an informed decision on the added value of the tsf cover climate change is expected to have little effect on the hydrological functioning of the catchment with only two out of the 18 evaluated models giving a significant trend of decreasing effective rainfall the recharge might slightly decrease at the site leading to lower water levels and discharges compared to the current situation climate change on the other hand will have an impact on extreme events they should be more frequent and more intense than during the historical period in the catchment area at the end of the century and compared to the period 2006 2036 events should not be more frequent except for the rcp4 5 scenario for the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios the intensity of an event for a given return period would increase by 4 compared to a 4 decrease for the rcp8 5 scenario this means that the water table could reach the tailings during some extreme events but only for a few days the impact of such an event in terms of geochemical reaction should be evaluated overall the climate change study shows that the current hydrological functioning of the site remains valid in the future the methodology developed here is not site specific and is applicable to other sites with some adaptations regarding the site s characteristics and modeling expectations daily frequency monitoring appears essential to understand the functioning of the catchment as it gives information regarding the water table reactivity its interaction with the tailings especially during extreme events and the discharge reaction to rainfall the combination of data analysis with groundwater modeling is very useful for testing and in validating different hypotheses about groundwater flow paths and water sources it is also useful for testing reclamation scenario however steady state modelling does not simulate the fate of the site under climate change and extreme events in our case this simple modeling methodology only provides the average state of the hydrogeological system determines the sub catchments and identifies the origin of the water at bc all based on a detailed data analysis the use of climate change projections is necessary to evaluate the impact of future rainfall and temperature variations on the effective rainfall it may be more appropriate to run the model with climate change data as input if changes in recharge were significant which is not the case here similarly for extreme events a transient model would allow to simulate the response of the catchment in wet and dry periods and to see the resulting variations of groundwater levels as well as discharges pending the results of the geochemical study and from a hydrogeological point of view this study validates the current management for this former mine the geochemical study under development will focus on 1d and 2d modeling of the tsf in unsaturated conditions in order to quantify the duration of amd generation beaucaire 2021 worked with a model in saturated conditions and with a lack of data regarding the petro physical and mineralogical properties of the stored materials these two limits justify that the estimate of the end of amd generation already proposed must be taken with caution especially since the amount of pyrite remaining in the storage is not known through the hydrogeological model and data monitoring the flow conditions in the tsf and the origin and discharges evolution at the outlet of the tsf were clarified thus the geochemical model will be better constrained and could be run in transient conditions given the influence of extreme events in the unsaturated zone funding this research was funded by orano group environmental r d france and received no external funding credit authorship

7798,study region bertholène is a former uranium mine in aveyron where tailings and waste rocks are stored in a natural valley this results in acid mine drainage amd at the outlet of the tailings storage facility tsf where there is a dedicated water treatment plant study focus a detailed data analysis was conducted using data from 13 piezometers and from long term monitoring of the local climate a 3d model was developed using modflow to understand groundwater flows at the catchment scale and identify flow paths from the contamination sources within the tsf previous geochemical modeling of tsfs had indicated that amd was expected to occur for 50 100 years therefore the site must be managed with a long term view as climate change may affect not only the recharge but also the frequency and intensity of extreme events its impact on water balance and water levels at the site has to be studied for the next 100 years new hydrological insights for the region data analysis provides information about the unsaturated conditions within the tailings then water balance calculations at the tsf outlet validate the contribution of two different water zones modeling using the recharge estimation supports the current functioning of the catchment the impact study of extreme events shows that the water table should not permanently reach the tailings over the next century

from 1948 2001 france mined uranium within its borders the total production obtained of 76 000 tu over this period represents just a year and half of worldwide production today wma 2020 this activity generated nearly 200 mt of waste rock and 52 mt of mill tailings cartomines and orano mining 2021 french uranium sites were generally small and exploited either by open pit mines and or by underground mine workings the ore process usually starts by crushing and grinding the ore then depending on the carbonate concentration in the ore leaching is undertaken with acidic or alkaline substances two types of leaching are used depending on the ore concentration dynamic for high concentrations and static for low concentrations this process results in a yellow cake from which the uranium is extracted and also the waste known as mill tailings tailings can be stored at ground level or underground or submerged these facilities contain several million tons of dynamic static and combined process tailings brgm 1997 tailings are frequently studied to assist in the prevention of the environmental dispersion of contaminants of concern and to understand the geochemical mechanisms of the mobility of residual uranium or radium 226 in france and abroad déjeant et al 2014 2016 chautard et al 2017 2020 lestini et al 2019 ballini et al 2020 besançon et al 2020 lahrouch et al 2021 seigneur et al 2021 the tailings stored at ground level are usually deposited in piles from 10 m to 150 m high and cover a surface area between one and a dozen hectares these stockpiles have an environmental impact depending on the type of ore mined the chemical treatment and the mineral composition khoeurn et al 2019 in france uranium mill tailings must be stored satisfactorily for the long term to achieve this tailings storage facilities tsf are made of several layers acting as a mechanical and radiological barrier the catchment water is collected and if necessary sent to a treatment plant with a dedicated environmental monitoring of the water soil air food chain when geomaterials enriched in sulfide minerals mainly pyrite are in contact with rainfall and oxygen they react with their environment and can lead to acid mine drainage amd blowes et al 2014 amd is generally characterized by low ph and high concentrations of sulfate heavy metals copper cu lead pb zinc zn and cadmium cd and toxic metalloids arsenic as and selenium se descostes et al 2004 tabelin et al 2018 this is one of the main causes of water contamination worldwide bell et al 2001 in the mining context this reaction occurs when waste rocks are enriched in sulfide minerals but can be also exacerbated when tailings subjected to acidic treatment have not been neutralized the long term management of tailings must therefore take amd into account in order to minimize any damage they may be caused to the environment for this purpose accurate monitoring of the hydrogeochemical variables water level discharges ph electrical conductivity and environmental tracers is required to trace and identify potential water contamination wolkersdorfer et al 2020 data analysis is then used to improve the understanding of the groundwater flows and is essential before any attempt at numerical modeling mengistu et al 2019 3d modeling based on the monitoring and analysis of climatic and hydrogeological data also enables the functioning of groundwater flows at the catchment scale and in particular of the tsf to be better understood numerical models reproducing groundwater and or surface flows on former mining sites have been used under controlled or real conditions aubertin et al 2002 mengistu et al 2015 many studies have used modeling to simulate either the water rebound after mine closure rapantova et al 2007 the dewatering problem gonzález quirós and fernández álvarez 2019 the groundwater flow system in an abandoned mine tomiyama et al 2020 or to estimate groundwater inflow surinaidu et al 2014 more specifically one may cite galván et al 2016 who modeled the iberian pyrite belt affected by amd to optimize remediation efforts in the catchment and work done by herr et al 2007 who developed a catchment scale amd model combining hydrological and geochemical data to simulate the mine impact on ph and metal concentration different reclamation scenarios in particular the use of a cover over the tailings can indeed be tested using a model water cover and or engineered cover are the main systems used to control amd generation and reduce radon emanation iaea and oecd 2002 the choice depends on local conditions such as the water budget climate tailings properties and storage types bussière 2010 aubertin et al 2016 ethier et al 2018 engineered cover systems are used to limit the contact between rainfall water and tailings in cases where the contamination is assumed to be only short term an engineering cover system is not mandatory as long as mining effluents are treated before their release in the environment the re vegetation of the surface is in all cases important to control erosion processes lersow 2010 as well as to increase evapotranspiration and thus limit the infiltration of rainwater amd is a long term process that can occur for more than 100 years and requires sustainable reclamation akcil and koldas 2006 yet climate change is likely to alter rainfalls and temperatures over the next 50 100 years these changes could impact the water table and the surface water discharge at the catchment scale and therefore the geochemical functioning of the tsfs and mining sites didovets et al 2020 henriksen et al 2021 taking into account the impact of climate change on the hydrogeological functioning of these former mining sites will therefore ensure the sustainable management of water and the environment on the one hand current studies focus on climate change impacts regarding dam stabilities in mining operations tailings dam failures are often caused by intense rainfall events as well as inadequate surface water management niekerk and viljoen 2005 hatje et al 2017 on the other hand some authors have worked on site reclamation with respect to the performance of tailings cover under climate change studying its impact on a moisture retaining layer hotton et al 2020 or showing that a well designed monolayer cover with an elevated water table should remain effective lieber et al 2022 but few studies have yet analyzed climate change impacts on water balance and hydrogeological responses in mining areas even though changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events due to climate change labonté raymond et al 2020 could increase amd during these events in this context the bertholène mine represents a model case study in france which has been studied for a long time e g ledoux et al 1993 schmitt et al 2002 triganon 2013 and is still under long term environmental monitoring the bertholène site is a former uranium mine where mine tailings and waste rocks are stored in a natural valley incised in the metamorphic basement of the massif central the tsf is located in the middle of the mainly forested balaures catchment and covers 7 ha out of the 240 ha of the catchment the stored materials waste rocks with significant pyrite contents non neutralized tailings in contact with water and oxygen cause amd where water with low ph ph 3 5 and significant concentrations of sulfate concentrations of sulfate 10 2 mol l and metals al 10 4 mol l fe mn 10 5 mol l u 10 6 mol l are generated and redirected to a water treatment plant before release into the environment at the end of the exploitation in 1995 the site was reclaimed the hydrogeochemical study concluded that the quality of the effluents from leaching of source terms in the tsf should meet environmental standards without treatment after 50 years ledoux et al 1993 the choice was therefore made not to cover the tsf and to treat the effluents for this short term period almost 30 years later even if a significant improvement of the water quality was observed effluent remains an issue due to amd generation within the tsf and with acidic water at the tsf outlet recent geochemical modeling of the storage facility beaucaire 2021 indicates that amd is expected to occur for another 50 100 years this questioned the no cover solution and led the authorities to request additional analyses and the study of alternative solutions from the orano group in charge of the site reclamation in particular they called for clarification of the origin of the water at the tsf outlet and better knowledge of saturation conditions in the tsf as a first step for geochemical modeling the purpose of this paper is to answer these hydrological questions in order to clarify the current and future hydrogeological functioning of the site through data analysis and modeling this article first presents the analysis of data acquired in the site to better understand the dynamics of the hydrosystem after rainfall events and to clarify the interactions between the waste rocks the tsf and the water table cross correlations of groundwater level and observed discharges with daily rainfall recorded at the nearby weather station of rodez were performed a water balance was calculated using thornthwaite s approach and based on site observations rainfall discharges a 3d numerical model of the aquifer system of the balaures catchment was developed based on the recharge calculated from the water balance and the first conclusions of the data analysis it runs in steady sate and saturated conditions representing the average state of the hydrogeological system the popular and common modflow modeling software harbaugh 2005 has been used in its basic configuration coupled with gms visual interface modflow appears as an international standard to simulate or manage groundwater flows validated by the authorities which justifies the choice of this software for the present study the model helps identify the sub catchments and test reclamation scenario with a cover over the tsf the model also allows using particle tracking to identify the preferential flow paths from the potential contamination sources within the catchment since the amd should occur at least during 50 years the site must also be managed with a long term view it is located at the limit between the north and the south of france where the climate change predictions are uncertain regarding the rainfall variation and the modification of extreme events the impact of climate change on the future hydrological functioning of the catchment was then investigated using daily rainfall and temperature data sourced from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 for three climatic scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the evolution of the water balance as well as the frequency and intensity of extreme events over the next 100 years are evaluated with the cmip5 simulated data the study of extreme events observed at the study site complete the analysis to understand the site response to rain events 2 site description 2 1 location geology hydrogeology and climate the bertholène mining site is located in the south west of the massif central near rodez fig 1 it is located in the heart of a 240 ha catchment the site is surrounded by the palanges forest ranging in elevation from 600 m to 900 m above sea level m a s l with some steep slopes the catchment is crossed by the balaures river from south to north a continuous aquifer is present in the fractured gneiss basement separated from the stephanian coal sandstones by the presence of a major ese wnw fault fig 2 further north the palanges fault marks the separation from the jurassic limestone schmitt and tardy 1986 and it delimits the hydrogeological catchment the underground flows are mainly oriented towards the north and are drained by the balaures river successive mine reclamations have significantly modified the downstream part of the catchment where an alluvial water table is found at the bottom of the valley the local climate is temperate with a mountain climate influence a large contrast is observed between winter and summer temperatures the mean daily temperature varies from around 0 c in winter to more than 20 c in summer the mean rainfall in bertholène between november 2006 and october 2021 was 1083 mm per year two periods can be distinguished from december to may winter and spring some large winter rain events may occur but there are few days with snow from june to november the period is drier with possible stormy events 2 2 the bertholène mining site the mining site covers only 42 ha of the 240 ha of the balaures catchment south of the palanges fault fig 2 the site is supervised and monitored by the orano group for its remediation reclamation and water management the bertholène site was modified by the former mining activities the southern part is a tsf located in the balaures valley drawn in orange in fig 1 to avoid contact between the river and the tailings the balaures river was diverted to the west of the tsf in a concrete canal below the storage facility the ancient river bed was replaced by a pebble drain which is laid over a geotextile membrane this drain should collect all water infiltrated through the tsf it also leads this water to a control basin bc where it is collected for treatment the northern part of the mining site was extensively reworked during operations and reclamation originally the mining facilities were built in this area to process the uranium today a treatment station and several collection basins are located in the same area to control and treat water before discharge into the environment the area is mainly composed of alluvial deposits in the alluvial plain the balaures river was also slightly diverted to a higher elevation to the east of the site in order to facilitate the development of the mining facilities leaching stalls treatment basin and release basin in the valley fig 1 a non estimated part of the discharge of the deviated river infiltrates into the reworked area and goes back to its original bed water arriving at the treatment plant is collected from three zones the tailings mining storage the open pit mine and the underground mine working fig 3 the water treatment consists of clarification and lime neutralization through successive basins after the treatment water goes to post treatment basins before a final ph check its environmental release into the balaures river takes place 50 m before the discharge station q venturi itself located 150 m upstream of the outlet of the catchment 2 3 ore mining and tailings storage uranium extraction at bertholène started in 1977 and continued until november 1994 with a total production of 750 tu the ore was extracted by static leaching with sulfuric acid the uranium deposit extended over a height of about 300 m from 490 m to 810 m a s l this deposit was mined with both an open pit mine and an underground mine working the underground mine was stopped in 1991 because the vein was exhausted then the drift horizontal opening was partially backfilled 85 the pumping was stopped and the water level rose back to its natural level the open pit mine extraction was stopped in 1994 1 100 000 m3 of materials had been excavated to create the operating facilities and build the tsf dykes the tsf has a length of 700 m a width around 100 m and it covers 7 ha fig 1 the tsf follows the slope of the natural valley 7 with a depth varying from 10 to 50 m from upstream to downstream fig s1 see supplementary material the stored materials are varied and piled up in alternating layers the tsf is composed of 476 000 tons of 0 8 mm particle size combined with waste rocks this mixture is used as protection from the leaching precipitates approximately 33 000 tons of precipitates from the neutralization with lime of the acid effluents which contain gypsum and metal hydroxides were added to the tsf and intercalated between tailings layers a pebble drain laid over a geotextile membrane is located at the bottom of the valley in order to collect the water infiltrating through the storage facility on top of these layers 30 cm thick blocks of waste rock separate the tailings from the surface fig 7 at the surface of the storage facility water sludge resulting from the water treatment since the site closure is stored in storage tanks the tsf is now covered with a natural and sparse coniferous vegetation such as pines and small bushes it is exposed to rainfall and water percolates through it water reacts with the remaining pyrite in the waste rocks and generates amd water with low ph 3 5 high concentrations of sulfate so4 2 10 2 mol l and metals al 10 4 mol l fe mn 10 5 mol l u 10 6 mol l drains into the bc at the outlet of the tsf 2 4 environmental issues amd is an issue common to many former mine sites in the world whose adequate management and long term remediation initially require a detailed understanding of their hydrological functioning the methodology developed hereafter to address this issue could therefore be usefully transferred to other former mine sites in the bertholène site the main environmental problem comes from the tailings and waste rocks storage facility with amd mainly generated by the waste rocks at the storage outlet it is therefore important in a first stage to quantify the flow conditions within the storage facility for a better understanding of the reaction of the tsf to rainfall likewise the origin of the water arriving at the bc i e at the outlet of the storage sub catchment must be explained these issues must also be viewed through the prism of climate change which could alter the current water balance in a second stage geochemical modelling can be coupled to predict the duration of amd 3 materials and methods 3 1 instrumentation and field measurements the rainfall data from january 2006 to november 2021 was provided by an in situ station these data were originally measured daily and then weekly or monthly since january 2016 to complete the analysis of daily events and catchment reactivity meteorological data provided by the météo france station at rodez have been used to perform daily cross correlations and extreme events analysis it provides daily rainfall and minimum and maximum temperatures for the period 2006 2021 this station is located 25 km away from the bertholène site at an altitude of 579 m a s l while the mining site is at 700 m a s l for the period november 2006 to october 2021 the rainfall recorded by météo france in rodez 837 mm year was 23 lower than that recorded in bertholène 1083 mm year this difference can be explained by the difference in elevation and topography the rodez station being located on a plain while the mining site is in a hilly area records from four discharge stations installed on the catchment are available from january 2006 to november 2021 on a daily then weekly basis fig 3 three of them measure the water discharge coming from each contaminant zone before it reaches the treatment plant the open pit mine q mco tms the tsf at bc q bc and the water originating from the west hillside downstream of the catchment q dsc the last discharge point q venturi measures the sum of the balaures river discharges downstream of the catchment and the total discharge from the treatment plant groundwater levels have been monitored on a monthly basis for 23 years 1999 2021 using 13 piezometers nine of them located inside or around the tsf fig 3 two new piezometers were drilled in october 2018 in the center of the storage facility v1 and v2 most of the piezometers are screened in the most permeable section of the bedrock aquifer gneiss however five of them are screened at the interface between the storage facility and the gneiss be10 be11 be12 v1 and v2 since june 2018 nine piezometers including the two new piezometers starting in october were equipped with solinst levelogger three or ott six sensors for a daily monitoring of groundwater level accuracy for all sensors 0 05 fs 0 10 m for all the piezometers except for p4 0 20 m the electrical conductivity of groundwater has been monitored daily in two piezometers since 2018 v1 in the middle of the tsf and p3 at its eastern edge this continuous monitoring was supplemented by two sampling missions for all piezometers and outlets these sampling missions were an opportunity to measure the electrical conductivity at the bc the high flow sampling mission was in march 2019 at the end of the winter the groundwater level and the discharges were at their highest as was rainfall the low flow sampling mission took place in early october 2019 following a low rainfall summer groundwater levels and discharges were low at this time 3 2 cross correlations correlation analysis is used in various fields of geoscience in particular to understand the hydrological functioning of karst systems fiorillo and doglioni 2010 larocque et al 1998 the use of correlation with temporal data can provide information on the response mechanisms of hydrogeological systems sahu et al 2009 tirogo et al 2016 cross correlation is a comparison between two time series to see if a link exists between the input series x t and the output series y t eq 1 the cross correlation function r xy is defined by eq 2 1 c xy k 1 n t 1 n k x t x y t k y 2 r xy k c xy k σ x σ y where c xy k is the cross correlogram n is the time series length k is the time lag x and y are the means of input and output time series and σ x and σ y are the standard deviations of the input and output time series the time lag corresponding to the maximum value for r xy k is the response time of the system to the input signal the correlation is significant at a 95 confidence level when r xy k is greater than 2 n with n the number of observations cross correlations were calculated on a daily basis for the period january 2006 to november 2021 with a maximum lag of 40 days with rainfall as the input signal and discharges at the four stations q bc q mco tms q dsc and q venturi as the output signal and for the period june 2018 to november 2021 between rainfall and groundwater level recorded daily by nine piezometers ai16 be10 p3 p4 p5 p6 p8 v1 and v2 the daily rainfall comes from the météo france weather station using this analysis the catchment s responses to rainfall events have been studied to understand its reactivity particularly in the area of the tsf where amd is generated 3 3 water balance the annual water balance at the site scale is described by eq 3 expressed in mm year 3 p aet r i aet p eff 4 p eff q r i where p is the rainfall aet the actual evapotranspiration r the runoff and i the infiltration for a well defined hydrological unit the effective rainfall p eff in eq 3 should be equal to the discharge q measured at the catchment outlet eq

the julian day and the latitude γ is the latent heat of water vaporization kj kg ρ is the density of water kg m3 and t is the mean daily temperature c in the bertholène case two different hydrological units were considered the storage facility sub catchment upstream of the bc 34 ha and the sub catchment with q venturi as the outlet 230 ha the discharges for each sub catchment were respectively measured at q bc and q venturi the water balances were estimated from monthly data recorded on site and cumulated by hydrological year for each sub catchment november 2006 to october 2021 3 4 numerical modeling a three dimensional 3d steady state groundwater flow model of the catchment aquifer system has been developed using the finite difference code modflow 2005 via the gms software interface version 10 4 aquaveo 2017 modflow was used with the native packages recharge rch1 well wel1 the solver preconditioned conjugate gradient solver pcgs and the flow package layer property flow lpf those packages can work with few information about materials properties horizontal hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy the saturated flow equation is solved in steady state conditions with the preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg solver with the convergence criteria on head change hclose and residual change rclose of 0 0001 m and 0 0001 m3 s the model is a simplified version of the catchment with only two layers a 60 m thick unconfined layer corresponding to the weathered bedrock and alluvial deposits over a 150 m thick confined layer which represents the less permeable deeper bedrock fig 4 the tsf that overlies gneiss formations over only 3 of the total model surface has been removed from the topography and from the model domain due its unsaturated functioning see section 4 1 the spatial discretization uses a rectangular grid with 206 385 square meshes with a side length of 5 m that allows for good representation of catchment surface details such as the tsf and the reworked area the catchment topography is derived from a combination of the french ign 5 m topographic map bd ortho 5 m and a recent 1 m topographic map for the orano site specifically created by a land surveyor the latter represents less than 20 of the catchment surface for simplicity and numerical stability the model of the main local aquifer does not represent the overlying storage facility and the balaures river only follows its original course in the natural valley within the tsf section the topography has been modified to restore the valley to its original appearance prior to the installation of the storage facility based on the elevation of the old riverbed at the bottom of the valley and by smoothing the sides of the valley no flow boundary conditions were assigned to the lateral boundaries of the domain which are assumed to align with the catchment divides fig 5 a fixed head boundary was set for the balaures river at 0 5 m below the surface in the gneiss 1 m below the alluvial plain in the northern part and at 629 m a s l at the river outlet a value which corresponds to the mean groundwater level measured close to the catchment output piezometers p8 and p9 all the small and intermittent creeks were also represented by a constant head boundary with a hydraulic head 0 25 m lower than the surface elevation the main water input of the model is the recharge the recharge represents the net infiltration estimated with the water balance calculation 506 mm year 0 0369 m3 s see section 4 3 this recharge is applied to the whole top layer of the model a second input has been defined because of a small loss 0 00016 m3 s due to the degradation of the concrete canal representing 1 of the canal total flow and less than 0 5 of the total recharge initial values of hydraulic conductivities table 1 were estimated from slug tests from a previous hydrogeological survey of the site géostock 1993 and are assumed homogeneous within each unit except the weathered gneiss the studied aquifer can be consider a hard rock aquifer known to have an anisotropy of hydraulic conductivities dewandel et al 2006 in such aquifers the horizontal hydraulic conductivity can reach 2 30 times the vertical hydraulic conductivity maréchal et al 2004 a vertical anisotropy of 1 3 is used in the model which is at the lower end of the range the model was calibrated starting from these a priori values table 1 and using the average water level of all piezometers during the period 2006 2021 and the average of the measured discharge at the storage q bc and at the catchment q venturi outlets for the period 2006 2021 all the water levels are measured within the first layer of the model simulations were evaluated in steady state using the coefficient of determination r 2 and the following statistical estimators the mean error me the absolute mean error ame and the root mean square error rmse as described by eqs 7 8 and 9 7 me 1 n i 1 n h o i h s i 8 ame 1 n i 1 n h o i h s i 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n h o i h s i ² 0 5 where h o is the observed water level h s is the simulated water level and n is the number of observation piezometers the estimator values must be as low as possible and close to zero once the model had been calibrated particle tracking the modpath package available for modflow was used to visualize the pathlines according to different starting zones and to delineate the hydrogeological sub catchments only forward tracking was used in this study the use of this package allows us to validate groundwater sources and to visualize groundwater flow pathlines in each sub catchment as well as within the alluvial area 3 5 climate change 3 5 1 climate data to analyze changes in temperature and rainfall until the end of the century six climate projections from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 for three climatic scenarios computed by several european institutes involved in climate modeling were used http www drias climat fr in total 18 simulations were analyzed for the period 2006 2098 from the six regional models table 2 with three rcp representative concentration pathway scenarios as well as 6 simulations for the historical period 1975 2005 those 6 simulations are considered as reference simulations but not as real observations the daily climate data come from regional climate models around europe the data were projected onto an 8 km resolution grid and corrected for skew using the adamont method extended to france and implemented by météo france déqué 2007 verfaillie et al 2017 based on the analysis of observation data the projections from the closest grid point to the site 3 km were analyzed latitude 44 36120º longitude 2 78843º the three following rcps were selected for the study the rcp2 6 in line with the paris agreement the rcp4 5 considered a more probable scenario and the rcp8 5 the worst case scenario for which co2 emissions are the highest ipcc 2014 the new pathways from cmip6 the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps have now integrated socio economic evolution gross domestic product demography governance education and technology and are coupled with climate forcing rcp a match can be made between the ssps cmip6 and the rcps cmip5 scenarios ssp1 2 6 and rcp2 6 ssp2 and rcp4 5 and ssp5 8 5 and rcp8 5 in france the temperature is expected to rise between 2 c and 5 c and the rainfall is also expected to rise by 2 6 according to the rcp scenarios soubeyroux et al 2020 the projected changes in france are different in the northwestern part of france and the southeastern part the south region of france could be drier with longer droughts and a pattern modification of rainfall with more rainfall in winter the location of the site in the south of france and close to the massif central may have an additional local impact table 3 presents the mean overall variation of the 6 models in the study site for rcp2 6 the temperature variation is lower than that of france and for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the variation is the same for the rainfall the overall variation shows a decrease in rainfall for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 that contrasts with the expected variation at the national scale 3 5 2 trends analysis mann kendall and sen s slope the non parametric mann kendall test is commonly used to detect trends in time series of environmental data as trends can be affected by the presence of negative or positive autocorrelations hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 autocorrelation is first performed to check the randomness and the periodicity of the time series data if randomness is found or the periodicity is statistically insignificant the mann kendall test can be performed without altering the data kendall 1975 mann 1945 the non parametric test developed by sen 1968 is used to estimate the slope of the mann kendall s trend analysis it calculates the magnitude of any significant trend detected in the mann kendall test the mann kendall test and sen s slope test were performed on the mean annual rainfall and mean annual temperature data as water balance will be affected by any change in rainfall and temperature tests were also performed on annual actual evapotranspiration aet and annual effective rainfall estimated from a monthly water balance calculation see section 3 3 the water balance calculation was performed with the thornthwaite method to estimate trends on water balance components between 2006 and 2098 independently of the previous results obtained with this method for the historical period the average variation of rainfall temperature and effective rainfall for the six models between the periods 2006 2036 and 2068 2098 has been estimated to assess the impact of climate change on the latter 3 5 3 extreme events frequency and intensity to go beyond the seasonal and annual scales the analysis also focuses on extreme events that are likely to become more intense and more frequent with climate change ipcc 2021 extreme events can impact the groundwater level below the tsf and create more amd groundwater level monitoring shows that the peaks of water level are reached during the winter period and on consecutive rainy days to quantify rainfall intensity our approach consists of analyzing the increase of the amount of rain which falls over three days using return periods the return periods are estimated using the generalized extreme values gev distribution function which combines three asymptotic forms of extreme value distributions gumbel weibull and fréchet in a unique form fisher and tippett 1928 this law is mainly used in hydrology to model extreme events and to estimate their return period from daily rainfalls santos et al 2016 collet et al 2017 gaur et al 2018 on the basis of one maximum occurrence per year the intensity of each return period has been estimated by taking the highest 3 day rainfall event per year for the historical period between 1975 and 2005 and using it as a reference for comparison with climate projections return levels have also been calculated using rainfall from the 18 climate simulations over the period 2006 2036 and at the end of the century period 2068 2098 analysis of the frequency of exceeding a rainfall threshold allows us to see if the events concerned will be more frequent at the end of the century the threshold chosen corresponds to the 10 year return period for the historical period in this case 87 mm the number of occurrences above the threshold is analyzed for different 30 year periods 1975 2005 2006 2036 2037 2067 and 2068 2098 4 results 4 1 spatio temporal variation of electrical conductivity and hydraulic head in the tsf table 4 shows the groundwater electrical conductivity measured in piezometers v1 and p3 and at the bc during the low flow october 2019 and high flow march 2019 sampling campaigns and the mean daily electrical conductivity monitored between june 2018 and november 2021 the electrical conductivity measured at bc in october 2019 is 164 µs cm for a very low flow at the sampling point q bc 0 0016 m3 s in march the flow was higher q bc 0 0032 m3 s and the electrical conductivity was also higher 684 µs cm the highest electrical conductivity is measured in v1 with values above 2000 µs cm it reflects the influence of water infiltrated through the tsf where part of the amd is generated the electrical conductivity measured in p3 is very low with an average value of 30 µs cm representative of the low mineralization of water in gneiss aquifer it demonstrates that the water in p3 is not influenced by the storage facility the variation in electrical conductivity in bc is due to the difference in rainfall between the two campaigns in winter the vertical infiltration through the storage facility is more important bringing more water in bc with a high mineralization fig 6 shows the changes in daily hydraulic heads measured in piezometers inside and around the tsf locations shown in fig 3 from june 2018 to november 2021 two types of variation are observed the hydraulic head in the piezometers v1 and v2 located within the storage area as well as be11 be12 and p6 not shown here shows annual variations with less than 1 m of amplitude whereas outside the storage facility annual variations are greater than 3 m with a strong seasonal pattern be10 p3 p4 and p5 peak levels occur during the winter period december to may and the highest peaks are observed after intense rainfall more than 50 mm for several days the lowest levels are observed at the end of the dry period june to november fig 7 exhibits a transversal cross section of the tsf with the maximum mean and minimum hydraulic heads observed from daily measurements between june 2018 and november 2021 it shows that the maximum water level remains below the tsf red dashes except at the drain level the drain located at the base of the storage facility can be fed by water coming both from the vertical infiltration through the unsaturated tailings and by lateral groundwater flows from the gneiss aquifer 4 2 catchment reactivity the recent daily monitoring data allow for a more accurate estimation of response times of the water level to rainfall cross correlations between rainfall and water levels in the nine piezometers as illustrated in fig 8a show a fast reaction and a pronounced response to rainfall with a time lag of about 5 days for the water level in piezometers be10 v1 and v2 for the other piezometers the reaction is less pronounced with a time lag that varies from 5 to 16 days maximum cross correlation coefficients are reached within a 5 8 days delay between the rainfall and the discharge at each discharge station including at the outlet of the storage catchment q bc where the discharge peak appears 8 days after the rainfall fig 8b 4 3 recharge estimation at the mean annual scale 81 5 of the discharge at the q venturi comes from the balaures river table 5 of the remaining 18 5 which comes from the treatment station 65 is from the storage sub catchment q bc 21 from the open pit mine drainage area q mco tms and 14 from the western hill q dsc q venturi is the outlet from a hydrological sub catchment of 230 ha the zone between the open pit mine and the western part of the historical facilities is drained to this point by a system of canal and drains the average annual discharge at q venturi is 0 0437 m3 s upstream the storage sub catchment drains a surface catchment of 34 ha based on the topography of the area it corresponds to the 7 ha of the tailings storage and an additional surface of 27 ha of forest on the hillsides around the storage facility the control basin q bc that is supposed to drain this sub catchment exhibits an average annual discharge of 0 0053 m3 s fig 9 shows the water balance between november 2006 and october 2021 and the inter annual average estimated with monthly data aggregated to an annual frequency the average rainfall is 1083 mm year the actual evapotranspiration calculated using the thornthwaite method is 584 mm year which represents 54 of rainfall it results in an effective rainfall p eff of 611 mm year with a small difference 2 compared with the mean discharge at the site outlet q venturi but 20 higher than that measured at q bc even when considering that the collected water drained by q bc is a mixture of water coming from the vertical infiltration through the storage 7 ha and lateral flows coming from the gneiss aquifer 27 ha for this catchment which is mainly covered by forest with slopes between 0 and 7 the runoff coefficient can be estimated at a value of 0 17 using the table from the american society of civil engineers 1969 the estimated mean annual runoff is then 104 mm year and the net infiltration of 506 mm year is then applied as recharge in the model 4 4 groundwater modeling the calibration of the model at a steady state condition was performed by varying the hydraulic conductivity of the formations in order to properly reproduce the mean annual piezometric levels in the 13 piezometers of the study area as well as the discharges observed at the control basin q bc and at the site output q venturi the calibrated hydraulic conductivities are presented in table 1 fig 10 shows a good agreement between the observed and the simulated hydraulic heads r2 0 993 to a lesser extent for ai16 which is outside the catchment and be19 which is in the reworked area all simulated levels lie within the 95 confident interval the me ame and rmse for the calibrated model are 0 65 m 3 21 m and 3 78 m respectively the maximum acceptable value of the calibration criterion depends on the water level magnitude over the domain the scaled root mean square error srmse which is rmse divided by the range of observed water levels is 3 3 it must be less than 10 to be considered as an acceptable value barnett et al 2012 mamo et al 2021 the calibration of the model was thus considered of good quality the simulated hydraulic heads satisfactorily reproduce the groundwater flow in the gneiss aquifer below the storage area the groundwater flow in the southern part of the catchment is drained by the balaures river and by small creeks on the steepest hills in the gneiss aquifer p3 p4 and p5 the flow is oriented directly towards the bottom of the valley here the vertical flow across the multiple layers of the tsf corresponds to the prescribed recharge on top of the model at the storage facility itself the water table is drained by the ancient bed of the balaures river be11 b12 v1 v2 and p6 downstream the groundwater flow is also oriented towards the ancient river bed whereas in the western part of the catchment where the slopes are steeper the flow goes straight to the outlet if the model gives satisfactory results for hydraulic heads it does not appear to accurately simulate the observed discharge of the two main sub catchments of the study area as shown in table 5 the simulated discharge at the control basin q bc 0 0065 m3 s is overestimated by 48 while the simulated discharge at the outlet of the site q venturi 0 0282 m3 s is underestimated by 22 compared to observations forward particle tracking was used to identify the pathlines of the groundwater flow inside and in the vicinity of the tsf sub catchment as well as in the alluvial zone downstream of the catchment for the sub catchment fig 11 forward particle tracking particles represented by a red circle was used to delineate the subsurface catchment limits upstream of the control basin the particle pathlines confirm that the control basin is fed laterally by groundwater flows coming from the hillsides and that the original bed of the balaures river drains groundwater from the hillsides to the control basin this subsurface catchment covers a surface area of 40 ha 6 ha more than the surface catchment previously defined from the topography whereas a subsurface catchment of smaller size than the surface catchment had been expected to meet the measured flow fig 12 shows the particle tracking simulation downstream in the alluvial zone the starting particles are located in layer 1 close to the balaures surface catchment limits in order to compare the surface and subsurface catchments and clarify the origin of the difference between the observed and simulated discharges at q venturi it shows that groundwater from the western slopes is not immediately collected by the river but instead flows parallel to the river in the alluvial deposits due to their high hydraulic conductivity and the gentle slopes of the hills today the western part is actually drained by channels and drains and the water flows directly into the balaures river if the exchanges between these two areas 0 0078 m3 s are added to the previously simulated flow at q venturi 0 0282 m3 s a total simulated discharge of 0 036 m3 s is obtained equal to the observed one with a slight difference of 0 7 4 5 climate change 4

bertholène site mean sen s slope 0 005 to 0 052 c year for annual rainfall no trend is observed for the rcp2 6 scenario for rcp4 5 only one out of six climate models gives a significant decreasing trend for the worst case scenario rcp8 5 two trends are both significant and decreasing table 6 concerning the water balance terms at the catchment scale table 7 there is no overall trend for aet from the mann kendall test for the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios annual trends are divergent and mostly not significant with only three simulations showing a significant trend for the rcp8 5 scenario four out of six trends are significant half of them showing an increase of aet effective rainfall is influenced both by rainfall and aet changes only two models out of 18 display a significant trend overall the effective rainfall is decreasing for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 by 2 4 and 4 4 5 2 extreme events and their influence on the observed hydraulic head the impact of extreme events on groundwater level was studied from acquired data on piezometers be10 and v1 which are the only two piezometers located in the center of the valley be10 is located upstream of the storage and v1 is located in the middle of the facility downstream the storage and it is screened at the base of 40 m of precipitates and tailings the studied events correspond to the maximum water level recorded during the period june 2018 november 2021 they result from a succession of rainy days between the 19th of january and the 9th of february 2021 for the two piezometers during the wet period fig 13a shows the water level change in be10 the peak is reached with a lag of 4 days after 7 rainy days with a total of 50 mm during the last 3 days this cumulative rainfall over 3 days corresponds to a 2 year return period event the water level increased by 2 m in 4 days after a first peak 27 january the decrease was also rapid right after the rainfall stopped 3 5 m in 5 days this part of the storage facility also exhibits high seasonal piezometric variations 3 4 m as shown previously in fig 6 fig 13b shows the water level in piezometer v1 for the same rain event recorded during winter 2021 the highest water level rise is due to consecutive rainy days and the peak is reached after 3 rainy days with a rise of 40 cm it slowly decreases as the rainfall ceases during this largest event ever observed during the three years of daily monitoring the maximum water level observed remained at about 1 5 m below the tailings the groundwater level also never reached the tailings at the observation piezometers be11 and be12 during the 20 year monthly monitoring the threshold of the 3 day cumulative event corresponding to the decennial return period is 87 mm over the period 1975 2005 the number of events over this threshold per 30 year period in the 21st century is represented in fig 14 for the three periods considered the number of events should increase from four events between 1975 and 2005 to nearly 8 events on average over 30 years extreme events should therefore become more frequent during the next century compared with the historical period while remaining more or less equally frequent over the next 100 years for scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 for the scenario rcp4 5 there should be an increase from 5 8 in 2006 2036 to 8 3 events at the end of the century fig 15 shows the estimated intensity of extreme events for several given return periods for the simulated historical rainfall between 1975 and 2005 and for the three rcp scenarios over the period 2006 2036 and the period 2068 2098 for a given return period the variability of return level is represented according to the six models the return level is expected to increase by 9 21 on average at the end of the century for all three scenarios compared to the historical period for rcp2 6 events should be more intense for the period 2068 2098 than during the period 2006 2036 by an average of 4 1 the same result is observed for rcp4 5 with an average intensity increase of 4 4 while for rcp8 5 the return levels decrease for that same scenario events should be less intense during the period 2068 2098 than during the period 2006 2036 by an average of 4 5 discussion 5 1 hydrogeological functioning of the storage area thanks to the high frequency monitoring and the presence of two new piezometers within the tsf the analysis of groundwater level variations demonstrated that the storage facility is in an unsaturated condition with the groundwater level below the tsf even for extreme rainfall events with a 2 year return period the water level still should not reach the tailings base for the moment this is the most important rainfall event recorded the water collected by the control basin at the storage outlet originates from two sources as illustrated by electrical conductivities ec measured during high and low flow at the drain level in piezometer v1 in the gneiss aquifer in piezometer p3 and at the basin control table 4 at the surface the sub catchment drained by q bc is supplied at 80 from the forest where water feeds the gneiss aquifer and at 20 by the tsf through which water infiltrates vertically during high flow period the combination of 70 of groundwater from the gneiss aquifer and 30 from the tailings zone gives the measured ec value of 684 µs cm at the control basin during low flow period the repartition corresponding to the measured ec value 164 µs cm is very different with only 5 from the tailings zone and 95 from the hillsides water percolation through the tailings is limited during summer by less rainfall and high evapotranspiration while the bedrock aquifer acts as a reservoir storing water in winter and releasing it in summer it is assumed that the drain is continuously fed by vertical infiltration as the electrical conductivity measured in v1 always remains high fig s2 see supplementary material indicating the presence of high mineralized water in this piezometer all year long vertical infiltration occurs through two mechanisms continuous darcy type flow and non continuous rapid preferential flow see section 4 3 the second mechanism could be of real importance with climate change and extreme events kalisman et al 2022 showed that pulsed pressure wave flow which can be likened to sudden water injections or extreme events generated 75 more solute mass compared to continuous darcy type flow the amd generation could then be increased it is also assumed that the old river bed still acts as a drain for the gneiss aquifer as illustrated in the numerical model by the convergence of groundwater flows towards the former river bed here defined as a constant head boundary condition 5 2 catchment scale groundwater flow the annual water balance estimated using the thornthwaite method a pet calculation based on the oudin formula and a ru of 50 mm maximum is well balanced at q venturi with the estimated recharge 506 mm year the measured discharge minus runoff at q venturi is well reproduced by the model taking into account the flow drained by the alluvial part on the left bank there is agreement between the surface and subsurface watersheds at the scale of the balaures catchment with the same calculation the water balance at q bc is overestimated by 20 for a hydrological surface of 34 ha a sub catchment area of only 27 ha would be required to balance the water budget at q bc however the model does not confirm this hypothesis with a subsurface catchment determined using particle tracking reaching as high as 40 ha the increase in hydraulic conductivity of the deep layer within a reasonable range did not allow the creation of deeper circulations bypassing the drain under the tailings the hypothesis of lower effective localized rainfall is also not supported by the presence on the tsf of a sparse vegetation cover and coarse materials on the surface that facilitate infiltration the model was unsuccessful in providing constraints on the value of the recharge as the simulated heads in the storage area were not sensitive to the imposed recharge value which we varied between 5 and 20 of the initial value only the me criterion decreases as recharge increases therefore it is possible that the presence of the geotextile membrane at the base of the drain which is not represented in the model partially limits drainage from the catchment area to the control basin in any case however it facilitates the recovery of any water that has seeped into the tsf and is then stored in the control basin finally we cannot exclude the possibility that the quality of the flow measurement at the control basin is part of the explanation for the water balance discrepancy in addition the potential evapotranspiration calculated for the catchment is 662 mm year which represents 61 of the rainfall the pet p ratio for the bertholène site is the same as for other small catchments in the area when using the same oudin evapotranspiration formula french hydro database brigode et al 2020 in the equivalent catchments 1 2 24 km2 located around the bertholène site o5010535 o5000510 o5445510 and o5055310 this ratio is less than 65 we can therefore assume that the thornthwaite water balance calculation does work at q venturi between november 2006 and october 2021 and can be used to estimate the water balance in the context of climate change considering all other parameters equal including vegetation 5 3 use and limitations of the hydrogeological model in its native version modflow cannot simulate unsaturated flow the uzf package has been developed to meet this need but it is mainly designed to compute the evapotranspiration and the recharge in unsaturated areas despite that modflow has been chosen in this study first the knowledge of the particle size and the parameters to describe the unsaturated medium within the tsf was very imperfect and not sufficient to run adequately the uzf package second the goal was to simulate the average groundwater flow at the catchment scale the tsf that overlies gneiss formations over only 3 of the total model surface was therefore removed from the aquifer system model domain due its unsaturated functioning inferred from the available data see section 4 1 in reality from a hydrogeological point of view the tsf delays the impact of effective rainfall by 5 16 days into the drain located below the tsf due to the infiltration through the tailings storage see section 4 2 as the model runs in steady state conditions and represents an average hydrogeological functioning this delay is not taken into account at the annual scale the use of a variable saturation flow model would certainly have been more appropriate but also much more expensive to implement in 3d and at the catchment scale a transient model would also have been useful to simulate seasonal variations and determine how groundwater levels and discharges would change during future wet and dry periods ethier et al 2018 an et al 2022 simulation of flows taking into account the delay due to the tsf would provide information on flow velocity in summer and winter and on possible preferential flows in the tsf in addition the development of a transient model would allow the simulation of the site s fate for the next 100 years in particular it would allow for the simulation at the site scale of the groundwater level during extreme events today but also in the future these events would not have the same impact on groundwater level in dry periods as in wet periods regarding the initial groundwater level conditions petpongpan et al 2021 the observed extreme events fig 13 occurred during the winter period with a high groundwater level but the reaction of the groundwater level is unknown during the dry period in case of heavy rainfall dry soil and low groundwater level despite all those simplifications and limitations the model was used to study the impact of an engineered system cover over the tsf on the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer system this cover is expected to limit or stop the infiltration through the tsf in order to reduce amd generation to test this scenario the recharge over the tsf surface 7 ha was set at 0 mm year as the main input in the model is the recharge the modification of the recharge impacts directly the groundwater level and discharge mainly at the tsf scale compared to the reference model the average decrease in simulated water level with cover would be about 1 6 m in the tsf area and the decrease of the discharge is 20 at q bc and 3 at q venturi the discharge would still be 0 0052 m3 s at q bc and mainly composed of water from the gneiss aquifer with an average ph of 5 7 above the environmental release limit ph 5 5 the acid mine drainage at the tsf outlet would be slightly reduced because gypsum and pyrite contained in the tailings will be isolated from the rainfall however ferric iron still present in the waste rocks and tailings may maintain amd moses et al 1987 geochemical modelling at the tsf scale is underway and will give more arguments on the added value of an engineering cover over the tsf 5 4 climate change impact although the impact of climate change has not been simulated with the model the water balance forecasts with the cmip5 simulations are reassuring as to the possible evolution of recharge an increase of the frequency and intensity of extreme events is expected for the end of the century analysis of climate variables under three rcp scenarios predicted a temperature rise of 0 5 5 c until 2098 in the study area changes in annual rainfall have no significant pattern for all rcp scenarios regarding seasonal variation summer should be drier with a rise of temperature and a decrease of rainfall as shown by terray and boé 2013 regarding effective rainfall few simulations show a significant trend two out of 18 and for those two simulations it is expected to decrease over the next 100 years the thornthwaite water balance method is not widely used to calculate effective rainfall in the future but it remains the simplest way to determine it aparecido et al 2021 nevertheless this conclusion should be used with caution as evapotranspiration could be impacted by changes in vegetation due to climate change laanaia et al 2016 the major uncertainties in potential evapotranspiration come from the climate models gcm and rcm themselves lemaître basset et al 2021 the potential evapotranspiration formula being co dependent on temperature at the annual scale if the effective rainfall were to decrease the water volume to be treated would be lower and therefore the current environmental management of the site would remain valid in the future extreme events due to climate change both heatwaves and rain events are expected to increase in france ouzeau et al 2016 tramblay and somot 2018 the number of events will rise compared to the historical period 1975 2005 on the one hand the analysis showed that extreme events in this area should be more frequent during the 21st century according to rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios for rcp4 5 the number of events should almost double between 2006 2036 and 2068 2098 a study on six catchments near the cévennes in southern france also showed that the frequency of extreme events could increase by 22 at the end of the century compared to the period 1960 1990 tramblay et al 2012 those results support the prediction that extreme events should be more frequent in the study basin like in southern france on the other hand these extreme events should be more intense during the period 2068 2098 compared to the 2006 2036 period according to the calculation of their return level using a maximum 3 day rainfall event per year except for rcp8 5 this increase has also been predicted with an even greater increase of up to 22 in extreme daily rainfall in the french mediterranean ribes et al 2019 this increase in rainfall during extreme events could impact the groundwater level below the tsf allowing it to reach the tailings based on observation of short period return events the water table should not remain in contact with the tailings for more than five days as seen in section 5 1 extreme events could generate more amd at the tsf outlet due to high pressure gradient in fine textured materials such as the tailings extreme events may also have a different impact on the recharge depending on the season in which they occur manna et al 2022 this impact is not taken into account by the thornthwaite method which is calculated on a monthly basis independently of rainfall intensity the extreme events occurring in summer are mainly due to storms with short and intense rainfall this can lead to rapid flows into the storage which is flat and permeable the low intensity summer rainfall is mainly evapotranspired unlike winter rainfall which produces more infiltration and increases the water content in the unsaturated zone such impacts could not be analyzed with the available data 6 conclusion the reclaimed bertholène mine allows us to study the hydrogeological behavior of an anthropogenic site to determine its potential modifications due to climate change and to provide guidance for sustainable environmental management in the future the analysis developed in this study was supported by long term field data the installation of two new piezometers located in the tailings mining facility tsf and the implementation of a daily monitoring in several piezometers in the area provided new and accurate information at the site scale the groundwater level analysis showed that the facility is in an unsaturated condition throughout the year including during recorded extreme rainfall events correlations between rainfall and discharges confirmed the fast response of the catchment at the tsf outlet the water collected at the control basin consists of at least 70 of water from the gneiss aquifer and up to 30 from vertical seepage through the unsaturated tailings during high flow periods a three dimensional simplified groundwater flow model was developed to understand the steady state functioning of the mining catchment based on the analysis of monitored data and to identify the groundwater flow paths the model s input is the recharge calculated from the water balance at the catchment scale q venturi the model was used to test the impacts of a reclamation scenario a cover over the tsf could lower groundwater levels by 1 m at the site scale and decrease the discharge at the bc by 20 the cover would slightly reduce the amd at the outlet of the tsf with only water coming from the gneiss aquifer reaching the control basin since amd is generated elsewhere in the mine site the treatment station should continue to operate with or without tsf coverage the geochemical model should provide new information on how long amd is expected to last in the near future at the tsf scale this will make an informed decision on the added value of the tsf cover climate change is expected to have little effect on the hydrological functioning of the catchment with only two out of the 18 evaluated models giving a significant trend of decreasing effective rainfall the recharge might slightly decrease at the site leading to lower water levels and discharges compared to the current situation climate change on the other hand will have an impact on extreme events they should be more frequent and more intense than during the historical period in the catchment area at the end of the century and compared to the period 2006 2036 events should not be more frequent except for the rcp4 5 scenario for the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios the intensity of an event for a given return period would increase by 4 compared to a 4 decrease for the rcp8 5 scenario this means that the water table could reach the tailings during some extreme events but only for a few days the impact of such an event in terms of geochemical reaction should be evaluated overall the climate change study shows that the current hydrological functioning of the site remains valid in the future the methodology developed here is not site specific and is applicable to other sites with some adaptations regarding the site s characteristics and modeling expectations daily frequency monitoring appears essential to understand the functioning of the catchment as it gives information regarding the water table reactivity its interaction with the tailings especially during extreme events and the discharge reaction to rainfall the combination of data analysis with groundwater modeling is very useful for testing and in validating different hypotheses about groundwater flow paths and water sources it is also useful for testing reclamation scenario however steady state modelling does not simulate the fate of the site under climate change and extreme events in our case this simple modeling methodology only provides the average state of the hydrogeological system determines the sub catchments and identifies the origin of the water at bc all based on a detailed data analysis the use of climate change projections is necessary to evaluate the impact of future rainfall and temperature variations on the effective rainfall it may be more appropriate to run the model with climate change data as input if changes in recharge were significant which is not the case here similarly for extreme events a transient model would allow to simulate the response of the catchment in wet and dry periods and to see the resulting variations of groundwater levels as well as discharges pending the results of the geochemical study and from a hydrogeological point of view this study validates the current management for this former mine the geochemical study under development will focus on 1d and 2d modeling of the tsf in unsaturated conditions in order to quantify the duration of amd generation beaucaire 2021 worked with a model in saturated conditions and with a lack of data regarding the petro physical and mineralogical properties of the stored materials these two limits justify that the estimate of the end of amd generation already proposed must be taken with caution especially since the amount of pyrite remaining in the storage is not known through the hydrogeological model and data monitoring the flow conditions in the tsf and the origin and discharges evolution at the outlet of the tsf were clarified thus the geochemical model will be better constrained and could be run in transient conditions given the influence of extreme events in the unsaturated zone funding this research was funded by orano group environmental r d france and received no external funding credit authorship

reservoirs is 98 on an annual scale climate change is the dominant factor in river warming on the seasonal and monthly scales reservoirs are used as heat sources in autumn and winter and as cold

chemical and biological properties of rivers it is an important health evaluation index for aquatic ecosystems and it is also one of the most important abiotic factors to ensure the normal survival and reproduction of aquatic organisms and maintain the normal ecological service function of rivers lowney 2000 caissie et al 2007 woodward et al 2016 river temperature is closely related to climate change and human activities cai et al 2018 climate change mainly changes river temperature in the form of solar radiation and heat flux exchange while human activities are the storage operation of reservoirs webb et al 2008 the reservoir impoundment leads to the stratification of water temperature in the reservoir areas considering the difference between deep and surface temperatures if the water temperature downstream of the reservoir has different thermodynamic properties from the water temperature upstream the discharge from the reservoir will change the water temperature downstream to some extent mayer 2012 rice and jastram 2015 affected by global warming and hydropower development river temperature presents complex changes which has attracted the attention of many scholars preece and jones 2002 wang et al 2012 li et al 2016 hardenbicker et al 2017 azadi et al 2021 many hydrological and data driven models have been developed by scholars to study and predict river temperature mohseni et al 1998 wehrly et al 2009 cole et al 2014 graf et al 2019 caissie et al 2007 constructed a deterministic water temperature model to simulate stream temperature by calculating the heat flux of river surface through meteorological data and then verified the reliability of the model on two rivers with different characteristics toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 developed a model air2stream for predicting water temperature using daily temperature and flow and found that the downstream flow series affected by reservoir operation had a higher correlation with water temperature series than natural conditions piotrowski et al 2015 compared and analyzed the performance of data driven models such as multilayer perceptron and wavelet neural networks in the field of water temperature prediction taking the data of extreme weather and different terrain and properties as variables and the results proved the reliability of neural networks in the field of river water temperature prediction in recent years deep learning neural networks have been widely used in the field of hydrology because of their excellent learning ability and versatility afzaal et al 2020 pan et al 2020 le et al 2021 however the use of deep learning models to predict and analyze water temperature regimes under the influence of cascade reservoir operation is still rare the yangtze river with its unique ecosystem is one of the most important rivers in the world and is also one of the most seriously affected by hydropower development a large number of studies have been carried out on the hydrological conditions of the yangtze river basin under the influence of reservoirs li et al 2013 shao et al 2017 liu et al 2018 xiong et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 observed the water temperature data of the entire yangtze river basin since 1950 and used the correlation to point out that the temporal and spatial changes in seasonal temperature conditions are significantly related to the upstream storage capacity liu et al 2019 studied the influence of the reservoirs in the yalong river basin on the downstream runoff process and found that the influence of the reservoirs on the change of the annual runoff process was enhanced with the increase of the storage capacity yan et al 2021 systematically analyzed the variation of runoff and sediment transport in the uryr and proposed a double mass curve analysis method utilizing it to point out the influence of the upstream cascade reservoirs on the sediment transport in the three gorges reservoir area however previous studies on reservoirs impact on water thermal mainly focus on qualitative evaluation steel and lange 2007 casado et al 2013 chen et al 2016 long et al 2019 quantifying the impacts of reservoir impoundment on water temperature on a monthly scale is a critical study which is crucial for formulating cascade reservoir scheduling strategies and reducing the adverse effects of hydropower development on fish reproduction moreover some studies attribute the change of water temperature before and after the dam construction to the operation of the reservoir without taking into account the potential impact of climate change on the water temperature before and after the construction of the dam preece and jones 2002 chandesris et al 2019 wang et al 2020 this study constructs a detached framework to study the uryr basins with high levels of hydropower development the main objectives are 1 to identify abrupt changes in water temperature by the tfpw mk method and construct hydrothermal indicators to clarify the characteristics of thermal regimes in the uryr over the past 57 years 2 to reconstruct natural water temperature without reservoir influence based on the lstm model and to quantify the effects of climate change and cascade reservoirs on river thermal regime at multiple scales with the help of a contribution calculation method that considers residuals 3 to assess the potential ecological impact of cascade reservoirs on fish reproduction in the uryr basin by setting four water temperature scenarios the research results inform a scientific basis for the management of the reservoirs to reduce the stress on the river ecosystem 2 material and methodology 2 1 the generalization of the study area the yangtze river is 6380 kilometers long making it the longest river in asia and the third longest in the world tao et al 2020 the uryr starts from the source of the yangtze river and goes eastward to yichang hubei the basin area is 1 056 million square kilometers accounting for about 58 9 of the entire yangtze river basin flood season generally occurs in may august each year and july august is the main flood season a large number of reservoirs have been developed and built due to abundant water resources in the uryr fig 1 cuntan hydrological station is located 7 5 km downstream of the confluence of the yangtze river and the jialing river which controls the water regime of the minjiang river the tuojiang river the jialing river and the chishui river after the confluence into the yangtze river the catchment area is 8 67 106 square kilometers it is not only the outlet control station of the national nature reserve of rare and endemic fishes in the uryr 27 29 29 4 n 104 9 106 30 e but also an important water regime control station in the uryr fig 1 the representative fishes in the nature reserve are coreius guichenoti and myxocyprinus asiaticus which are famous species in the uryr the reproduction period of the coreius guichenoti is from april to july and the suitable spawning water temperature is above 18 c for myxocyprinus asiaticus spawning activity occurs from march to april with water temperatures between 15 and 18 c this study takes the cuntan station as the research object and considers the influence of the operation of the cascade reservoirs in the uryr above the cuntan station on the stream temperature and fish reproduction 2 2 data collection water temperature data daily mean water temperature at cuntan station from 1961 to 2017 was used the data were provided by the changjiang water resources commission meteorological data the daily data of jiangjin changshou and qijiang meteorological stations around cuntan station from 1961 to 2017 were collected and the meteorological water temperature mwt model was constructed based on the lstm

temperature model can be used to reconstructed water temperature and the deep learning method with higher accuracy can also be used for water temperature prediction according to the diagnostic results of water temperature variation see section 3 1 the whole period is divided into the base period with less reservoirs interference and the variation period with strong reservoirs interference long short term memory model is used to reconstruct the water temperature series in the base period of the uryr keep the parameters of the baseline model unchanged and use the meteorological data of the variation period as the input of the model to reconstruct the water temperature series only affected by climate change step 3 quantitative assessment of the driving factors of hydrothermal changes ye

and kim 2022 the principle of the model has been described in detail by ma et al 2015 and will not be repeated in this study fig 3 shows the neural unit structure of the lstm network in this study the natural water temperature of rivers is reconstructed using the measured daily meteorological data from jiangjin changshou and qijiang stations as the driver to speed up the convergence of the model

the hydrothermal regime during the year the skewness coefficient s c kurtosis coefficient k c concentration degree c d and non uniformity coefficient c n of the daily water temperature series were

randomness and uncertainty wang et al 2020 the change process of water thermal during the year is very important and irregular temperature fluctuations will destroy the life process of aquatic organisms sommer et al 2018 large entropy corresponds to high complexity sample entropy theory is for finite time series consisting of n data points a set of m dimensional vector sequences is formed

be estimated as 19 s a m p e n n m r ln b m 1 r b m r 2 inter annual hydrothermal alteration in order to quantify the change of river temperature pre and post mutation year the rva is used to calculate the change of monthly mean water temperature rva is a set of methods based on the iha indicator system proposed by richter which aims to assess the degree of change in hydrological indicators after being affected duan et al 2016 although previous studies often used rva method to analyze the change of runoff some scholars have confirmed that rva method is also feasible to quantify the change in some water temperature indexes because among the hydrological indicators selected by iha there are related monthly averages magnitude cai et al 2017 guo et al 2021 the change degree of hydrothermal indicator can be calculated as 20 d i n o i n e n e 100 n e r n t 21 d o 1 n i 1 n d i 2 0 5 where d i represent the degree of change of the ith index d o represent the change in the overall index n oi represents the number of years that the ith disturbed indicator falls within the rva threshold the rva threshold adopts the value corresponding to the probability of each indicator exceeding 25 75 n e is the expected number of years that the water temperature indicator is expected to fall within the rva threshold after disturbance r represents the proportion of the observed years of the index before interference falling into the rva threshold n t and n are the total number of years and the number of indicators recorded in the time series of water temperature after disturbance respectively the scale of change is specified 0 33 is low change l 33 67 is moderate change m 67 100 is high change h 2 4 impacts on fishes in this study coreius guichenoti and myxocyprinus asiaticus were used as representative species to analyze the effects of river thermal conditions on fish spawning the breeding period of coreius guichenoti is from april to july each year and the suitable spawning water temperature is above 18 c the breeding period of myxocyprinus asiaticus is from march to april each year and the suitable spawning water temperature is 15 18 c li et al 2012 the measured water temperature during the fish spawning period march 1 to june 30 at cuntan station in 1988 was used as the baseline water temperature that was not affected by the reservoirs the water temperature process during the fish spawning season in 2012 is taken as the study target daily meteorological data and water temperature for 1961 1987 and 1989 2001 were trained in the mwt model and then driven by the meteorological data of 1988 and 2012 the water temperature process under the four scenarios was obtained table 1 the reliability of the reconstructed natural water temperature was verified by comparing four scenarios of water temperature and quantifying the effect of the reservoir on the thermal condition of fish reproduction by the comparative separation method comparing scenario 1 and scenario 2 the reliability of the lstm model for simulating water temperature during the spawning season of fish using meteorological data was evaluated comparing scenario 1 and scenario 3 the impact of the observed water temperature process in 2012 on fish reproduction in protected areas in the uryr under the combined effect of climate change and cascade reservoirs was assessed comparing scenario 3 and scenario 4 assess the influence of cascade reservoirs on fish reproduction in 2012 3 results 3 1 basic trends of water and air temperature changes 3 1 1 temporal characteristics of water and air temperature fig 4 shows the interannual warming trend of annual average water and air temperature at cuntan station in the uryr from 1961 to 2017 the water temperature and air temperature have the characteristics of synchronous change but the water temperature rises faster according to the tfpw mk test results fig 5 the mutation years of water temperature and air temperature were 2001 and 2003 respectively and then showed a significant upward trend after 2003 and 2014 the warming trend of water temperature is more obvious than that of air temperature the mean of the water temperature statistic 3 04 the mean of the air temperature statistic 2 18 the change in water temperature may be affected by the increase in total storage capacity in the uryr 3 1 2 change of response relationship between water temperature and air temperature the response relationship between water temperature and air temperature changed significantly around 2001 and the correlation coefficient decreased from 0 95 before 2001 0 91 after 2001 fig 6 the warming period of the water temperature in the uryr is from february to august and the cooling period is from september to january during the warming period as the air temperature rises the river temperature should have continued to warm up compared with the situation before the mutation year but there is still a small decline the average daily water temperature which should essentially begin to fall below the average daily air temperature in mid april is advanced to mid march from september to december the water temperature lags behind the drop in air temperature and there is a significant temperature difference between the river and the atmosphere at this time compared to 1961 2001 affected by the high temperature water discharged from the upstream reservoir the cooling trend of water temperature at cuntan station became slow this remarkable water temperature change will further affect the life process of aquatic organisms 3 2 performance of lstm model in simulating water temperature in order to determine the hyperparameters suitable for the meteorological water temperature model and make the water temperature simulation results based on meteorological factors closer to the natural water temperature process without the influence of the reservoir the meteorological and water temperature data from the cuntan station in the base period 1961 2001 were taken for model rate determination with 1961 1990 as the calibration set and 1991 2001 as the verification set ye et al 2013 fan et al 2017 the important hyperparameters of lstm networks are epoch hidden neurons and batch size etc guo and lai 2020 we first set a large epoch and then found that the best fit occurred around the 60th time so we decided to take the epoch to 60 according to the convergence curve the epoch of model was set to 60 the number of hidden neurons in the lstm network layer is used to retain the learned data features which is one of the important parameters affecting the accuracy of the model a small number will result in an under fitted model and poor training accuracy while a large number will have essentially no effect on model accuracy and will also result in a longer training time our determination process is based on lu et al 2019 and guo and lai 2020 so the results are more credible in addition the role of batch size is to identify the internal features of the batch data taking too large or too small values will lead to poor model performance and the appropriate batch size can be further optimized for model accuracy fan et al 2021 therefore we have determined 7 groups of hidden neurons and batch sizes separately and trained each group of hyperparameters 10 times with nse rmse and r2 as evaluation indicators the overall performance of the model in the benchmark period is shown in fig 7 it can be found that the model accuracy steadily improves with the increase of the number of hidden neurons and approaches convergence at 100 therefore under the consideration of computational efficiency and reconstruction effect we set the number of hidden neurons to 150 based on the number of hidden neurons we also observed the mean of training results for each group of batch sizes at the same time and found that the model accuracy improved overall at the beginning of the increase and reached the optimum at 40d however when the batch size exceeds 40d nse and r2 decrease and rmse increases which may mean that the model is overfitting therefore it is reasonable to use a batch size of 40d in the mwt model of the uryr other relatively good hyperparameters for the mwt model were also selected table 2 all water temperature simulation results below follow these parameters according to the results of the reconstruction of water temperature in the base period fig 8 the model using meteorological data to reconstruct natural water temperature performs better overall when the number of reservoirs is small and the variation of river water temperature is mainly governed by climatic factors r2 0 9753 during the calibration 1961 1990 and verification 1991 2001 the model accuracy was shown as rmse 0 8081 c and 0 8749 c nse 0 9767 and 0 9713 r2 0 9775 and 0 9724 the nse values of the water temperature reconstruction results in the two stages were all higher than 0 75 and the results of each evaluation index had little difference the model performance could be evaluated as good moriasi et al 2007 this indicates that the long short term memory model can effectively capture the temporal variation of water temperature and can be used to reconstruct the water temperature in uryr then this study successfully reconstructed the river water temperature process at cuntan station only under the influence of climate change during the variation period 2002 2017 using the lstm model driven by meteorological data and the results are shown in fig 9 based on the reconstruction results after 2001 there are obvious differences between the simulated and observed values of the annual mean water temperature especially in the non flood season compared with the situation pre 2001 this is not the deviation caused by the mwt model and it can be regarded that the operation of the reservoirs is the main factor leading to this situation 3 3 climate change and reservoirs effects on intra annual river thermal regime fig 10 shows monthly variations in the daily temperature distribution pre and post 2001 during the warming period the frequency of high order water temperature decreased and the magnitude of the highest water temperature decreased significantly during the cooling period the frequency of high order water temperature increased significantly and the magnitude of the highest and lowest water temperatures increased significantly according to the calculation results of five intra annual alteration indicators of the uryr river thermal regime except that the daily sampen indicator increased significantly 0 083 the other indicators decreased to varying degrees after the mutation table 3 the kurtosis coefficient k c concentration degree c d and non uniformity coefficient c n decreased by 0 01 0 017 and 2 48 respectively and the skewness coefficient s c decreased by 0 01 these changes reflect that the annual thermal regime of the river is more uniform after 2001 but the irregular variation of water temperature increased and the frequency of higher water temperature increased on the other hand only the skewness coefficient has reached a moderate change with the alteration degree of 42 36 and the alteration degree of concentration coefficient is the lowest only 6 82 cascade reservoirs play an essential role in the change of intra annual thermal regime in addition to the skewness coefficient the relative contribution of reservoirs exceeds 50 for the change of sampen the impact of reservoirs reached 97 91 leading to irregular changes in the river thermal conditions which may pose a threat to the number and structure of aquatic organisms 3 4 climate change and reservoirs effects on inter annual hydrothermal regime the impact of reservoirs on water temperature fluctuation may be reflected in different time scales steel and lange 2007 webb et al 2008 this study quantitatively analyzes the influence of climate change and the operation of reservoirs on changes in the water temperature regime in the uryr at the annual and monthly scales the results of the degree of alteration show that the water temperature in the uryr changes obviously under the combined action of climate and cascade reservoirs the change in overall water temperature in 12 months is 45 14 which is a moderate change among them the alteration of water temperature in summer is lower than that in the other three seasons and it is only a low change the most significant change in water temperature is in autumn exceeding the rva target by 67 and reaching a high change fig 11 at the same time the change degree of monthly mean water temperature in non flood season months is more obvious than that in flood season months the overall water temperature change degree in non flood season is 52 62 which is higher than 31 83 in flood season the reason for the change in water temperature during the non flood season is directly related to the joint operation of upstream cascade reservoirs in the cuntan station the stratification of water temperature caused by reservoir impoundment leads to the difference in water temperature between the discharge water and the downstream natural water temperature which makes the downstream water temperature change to a certain extent especially in november and march in march the low temperature water released by the reservoirs caused a significant cooling phenomenon in the water temperature of cuntan station with an average cooling of about 0 4 and the degree of change in water temperature was 64 71 reaching a moderate change in november the high temperature water released by the reservoir group caused a significant increase in water temperature with an average temperature increase of about 1 4 and a change in water temperature of 80 reaching a high degree of variation table 4 this degree of water temperature change is likely to have important effects on fish that are in this period of the spawning season in the flood season the inflow volume of the upstream reservoir is equal to the outflow volume and the water temperature stratification is weakened during this period climate change is the main factor affecting water temperature therefore the variation range of the downstream water temperature in the flood season is smaller than that in the non flood season this situation also concerns summer which is mainly associated with the flood season on the annual scale the impact of climate change on the water temperature of the river in the uryr was dominant showing a heating contribution of 0 43 c with a relative contribution of 71 53 the impact of cascade reservoirs on water temperature is relatively small which shows the heating contribution of 0 17 c and the relative contribution is 28 47 fig 12 on the monthly scale climate change leads to varying degrees of increase in river water temperature in different months but in summer the impact on water temperature is relatively small 0 25 c meanwhile the impact of climate change on water temperature in flood season 0 22 c is smaller than that in non flood season 0 54 c and the warming effect in october is the most significant 1 17 c there are apparent differences in the impact of reservoir operation on water temperature during the year mainly in the following aspects the impact is little in the flood season and the impact in the non flood season is large the cooling effect from march to august resulted in an average drop of 0 31 c in river temperature and the impact from may to august is little resulting in an average drop in water temperature of 0 13 c this situation is consistent with the release of the reservoirs and is consistent with the previous qualitative findings because of the thermal inertia of the water in the reservoirs the temperature of the discharge is generally lower than that of the natural water temperature under the influence of meteorological factors in the flood season the discharge of the reservoirs is basically equal to the inflow and the stratification effect of the reservoirs water temperature is weakened therefore the operation of the cascade reservoirs has little influence on the downstream water temperature tao et al 2020 similarly in january february and september december the water temperature is affected by the warming and the stream temperature increased by 0 67 c on average reflecting that the reservoirs discharge temperature is higher than the stream temperature controlled only by meteorological factors cai et al 2018 the cooling effect of the reservoirs on the river is the most significant in march 0 72 c and the warming effect of the cascade reservoir is most remarkable in december 1 17 c exceeding the warming effect of climate change 0 17 c with a relative contribution of 87 31 which led to the fact that the observed stream temperature during this period is higher than the modeled value 3 5 changes in reproductive behavior of different fishes based on the cumulative results of daily water temperature during the fish breeding period fig 13a we found that scenario 1 and scenario 2 had essentially the same pattern of water temperature changes during the natural period 1988 indicating that the reconstruction results of natural water temperature are more reliable in contrast during the variation period 2012 the water temperature patterns of scenarios 3 and 4 were significantly different implying that the cascade reservoirs had a significant impact on the thermal regimes during the fish breeding period from fig 13b it can be seen that the water temperature frequency curves of scenarios 1 3 and 4 have different distribution characteristics while climate change and cascade reservoirs have a stronger perturbation effect on the hydrothermal regime when the water temperature is less than 22 c in addition the water temperature frequencies in these three scenarios were 43 38 and 21 for 18 c and 26 16 and 13 for 15 c respectively the target water temperature frequencies for scenarios 3 and 4 were much lower than the results in the natural period scenario 1 these analyses suggest that reservoir storage in the uryr significantly alters downstream thermal conditions during the spawning season of fish and that climate change resists to some extent the strong perturbing effect of reservoirs on water temperature comparing scenario 1 and scenario 2 the simulated values of water temperature fit well with the measured values in 1988 when the influence of the reservoir is small and it can be concluded that the water temperature during the fish spawning period was reconstructed based on meteorological data is close to the natural water temperature process without the influence of the reservoir however because of the impact of reservoir construction and climate change on the river thermal regime there are significant differences in the water temperature process curves for scenarios 1 3 and 4 before mid may fig 14 water temperature measured in 1988 scenario 1 water temperature rose to 15 c at the end of march and began to meet the water temperature requirements for reproduction of myxocyprinus asiaticus and water temperature reached 18 c on april 22 and began to meet the water temperature requirements for reproduction of coreius guichenoti water temperature measured in 2012 scenario 3 due to the reservoir construction and climate change the water temperature rose to 15 c around march 20 and did not start to rise above 18 c until mid april compared with the water temperature of scenario 1 where there was no reservoir influence the breeding suitable water temperature of myxocyprinus asiaticus appeared 10 days earlier and the duration of appearance increased by 6 days while the breeding suitable water temperature of coreius guichenoti appeared 4 days earlier and the water temperature situation in 2012 was more favorable for the breeding activities of both species water temperature reconstructed in 2012 scenario 4 at this time the low temperature water is discharged from the upstream reservoirs compared with scenario 3 it is assumed that there is no reservoir operation and the natural water temperature should reach 15 c in mid march and 18 c in late march as a result the construction of the reservoirs delayed the appearance of the optimum water temperature for the reproduction of myxocyprinus asiaticus by 4 days and increase the duration by 19 days and the reproduction of coreius guichenoti is delayed by 23 days this hysteresis phenomenon could be understood as the result of the operation of the upstream cascade reservoirs after the middle of may the uryr ushered in the flood season and the delay effect of reservoir groups on river water temperature gradually weakened from may 15 to june 30 the simulated and observed water temperature duration curves in 1988 and 2012 are highly fitted fig 14 overall compared with the baseline year 1998 the observed water temperature process in 2012 is more beneficial to the spawning of the two fish species it is worth mentioning that compared with the natural water temperature in 2012 the process under the influence of the operation of the cascade reservoirs is not conducive to the reproduction of the coreius guichenoti but is beneficial to the myxocyprinus asiaticus based on the results it can be concluded that the decrease in the decrease of myxocyprinus asiaticus is mainly related to river truncation and overfishing while the decrease in the population of coreius guichenoti has a high correlation with the change of water temperature caused by the operation of the reservoirs 4 discussion to determine the influence of changes in natural climatic factors and the operation of cascade reservoirs on water temperature regimes and fish reproduction a systematic analytical framework was constructed and implemented in this paper the baseline and variation periods are divided according to the mutation year and then the range of changes in the dependent variable caused by the independent variable is identified with the help of a lstm model to distinguish the influencing factors of river thermal regimes we described the hydrothermal regimes of rivers at inter and intra annual scales using water temperature indicators and quantified the direction of action of the drivers of the hydrothermal regime by calculating the contribution considering residuals four water temperature scenarios were then set to quantitatively assess the effects of reservoir construction and climate change on changes in fish reproductive behavior the results show that the construction of cascade reservoirs has a very significant impact on the water temperature change and fish reproduction in the uryr in december the influence of reservoirs exceeds the meteorological factors from march to april the low temperature water released by cascade reservoirs caused the hysteresis of some fish reproduction periods many previous studies have shown that dams can significantly alter water temperature in downstream rivers casado et al 2013 chandesris et al 2019 xiong et al 2020 this study confirms that at the monthly scale the operation of the cascade reservoirs significant independent effects on hydrothermal regime downstream of the reservoirs essentially exhibiting cooling effects in spring and summer and increasing water temperature in autumn and winter which further supports the findings of tao et al 2020 and the effect is smaller in july and august when the incoming water is abundant in addition we quantified the potential impact of reservoir construction and climate change on the intra annual hydrothermal regime the results show that the reservoir not only significantly reduces the river water temperature in march 0 72 c which tends to disperse the hydrothermal distribution during the year but also the increase in the thermal homogeneity and sample entropy values are mainly influenced by reservoirs on the other hand climate change resists the effect of reservoirs on the skewness and kurtosis of the thermal distribution but exacerbates the reduction of thermal state concentration and inhomogeneity while the increase in annual mean water temperature and october water temperature is also mainly related to climate change water temperature is a key abiotic factor in river ecosystems zhang et al 2019 changes in water temperature potential within the year can disturb biological actions and significant changes in river water temperature can pose an ecological threat to the species in the river sommer et al 2018 wang et al 2020 previous studies on the effects of changes in the hydrothermal regimes of rivers caused by hydropower development on fish reproduction have mostly been evaluated on the basis of measured hydrothermal conditions before and after the occurrence of disturbances while the important role of climate change has not been adequately studied based on a natural thermal reconstruction model without reservoir effects this study analyzed the effects of cascade reservoirs and climate change on the water temperature of downstream rivers and found that the impoundment of reservoirs disturbed the thermal spawning cues of downstream fish during the warming period of the river the low temperature water discharged from the reservoir delayed the temperature rise process resulting in a delay of 4 days and 23 days for the daily water temperature of 15 0 c and 18 0 c respectively changes in the date of occurrence of suitable spawning water temperatures will lead to erratic changes in the spawning behavior of some fish a phenomenon that is likely to threaten the stability of native fish populations olden and naiman 2010 it is feasible to adjust the discharge flow by managing the operation mode of the reservoir so that the water temperature of the downstream river can be restored to close to the natural water temperature gu 1999 richter and thomas 2007 therefore it is necessary to analyze the evolution characteristics of water temperature and quantify the impact of climate change and hydropower development on water thermal in order to promote the recovery of river temperature based on the combined dispatching of cascade reservoirs zhang et al 2016 unlike many process based models such as swat vic data driven models are less demanding and more flexible van et al 2020 wang et al 2020 during this study the contribution of meteorological factors and reservoir construction to river temperature change was evaluated by deep learning neural network at the same time the mwt model was used to set different reconstruction scenarios to distinguish the impacts of climate and reservoir groups on fish spawning this approach bypasses strict data limitations and is reliable however it should be noted that the data driven model is a mapping of independent to dependent variables and does not explicitly consider hydrological processes water temperature in the yangtze river basin has been demonstrated to be strongly correlated with temperature suggesting that a data driven meteorological flow model would be useful in this basin cai et al 2018 liu et al 2018 some limitations still exist in this study when calculating the contribution the residual ε can be understood as a set of other factors such as industrial pollution and land use change in this study the influence of these factors is considered as constancy this will affect the accuracy of the results to a certain extent however because the demand for hydropower in the uryr is stronger than that for nuclear power and thermal power the water temperature variation caused by residuals is little which can be mainly attributed to the operation of cascade reservoirs cai et al 2018 this can be supported by the correlation between the change of monthly mean water temperature and the absolute contribution 5 conclusion this study constructs an assessment framework based on a long and short term memory model entropy theory and a contribution calculation method considering residuals which aims to evaluate the drivers of the multi scale evolution of the thermal situation in regulated rivers and its possible ecological impacts the results show that the water temperature in the uryr continues to warm up after the mutation year the rva value of inter annual thermal regimes of the river was 68 5 which reached a high degree of alteration and the variation of monthly mean water temperature in the non flood period was more obvious than that in the flood period with rva values of 52 6 and 31 8 respectively on the other hand the level of complexity and homogeneity of intra annual thermal regimes increased while the frequency of high magnitude water temperatures increased we further quantified the impact of climate change and cascade reservoirs on the evolution of water temperature and hydrothermal regimes in the uryr the reservoir was found to show cooling effects in spring and summer and warming effects in autumn and winter moreover the reservoir also changed the variation pattern of river water temperature significantly increasing the intra annual thermal homogeneity and complexity levels with contributions of 60 2 and 97 9 respectively on the other hand climate change resisted the effect of reservoirs on the skewness and kurtosis of the water temperature distribution reducing the thermal concentration and heterogeneity and also acted as the main driver to increase the annual mean water temperature 71 5 during the warming period the reservoir discharge of low temperature water significantly changed the thermal situation of coreius guichenoti and myxocyprinus asiaticus during the breeding period in the uryr and this hysteresis effect may delay the spawning date of coreius guichenoti by 3 4 weeks and may also increase the duration of the emergence of suitable spawning water temperature for myxocyprinus asiaticus by 2 3 weeks credit authorship contribution statement wenxian guo funding acquisition project administration resources investigation

7799,study region the upper reach of the yangtze river uryr basin china study focus there are few studies on the factors driving the change in hydrothermal regime and its ecological response this study proposes a framework to quantify the impact of climate change and reservoirs on hydrothermal and fish reproduction the framework identifies mutation years of water temperature by the tfpw mk method and characterizes hydrothermal variability on multiple time scales using hydrologically meaningful indicators sample entropy and range of variability approach the differences in hydrothermal driving forces are then clarified utilizing the long short term memory model and contribution calculation method in addition we established water temperature scenarios to assess the ecological effects of hydrothermal alteration new hydrological insights for the region after mutation uryr hydrothermal tends to be uniform with the increase in hydrothermal complexity the relative contribution of reservoirs is 98 on an annual scale climate change is the dominant factor in river warming on the seasonal and monthly scales reservoirs are used as heat sources in autumn and winter and as cold sources in other seasons moreover the reservoirs have a significant impact on hydrothermal in the non flood season especially in march and december which are 0 72 c 48 and 1 17 c 87 respectively the reservoirs delayed the spawning time for coreius guichenoti and myxocyprinus asiaticus but increased the duration of myxocyprinus asiaticus 19 days graphical abstract ga1 keywords hydrothermal alteration climate change reservoirs ecological response yangtze river data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction water temperature directly affects the physical chemical and biological properties of rivers it is an important health evaluation index for aquatic ecosystems and it is also one of the most important abiotic factors to ensure the normal survival and reproduction of aquatic organisms and maintain the normal ecological service function of rivers lowney 2000 caissie et al 2007 woodward et al 2016 river temperature is closely related to climate change and human activities cai et al 2018 climate change mainly changes river temperature in the form of solar radiation and heat flux exchange while human activities are the storage operation of reservoirs webb et al 2008 the reservoir impoundment leads to the stratification of water temperature in the reservoir areas considering the difference between deep and surface temperatures if the water temperature downstream of the reservoir has different thermodynamic properties from the water temperature upstream the discharge from the reservoir will change the water temperature downstream to some extent mayer 2012 rice and jastram 2015 affected by global warming and hydropower development river temperature presents complex changes which has attracted the attention of many scholars

air2stream for predicting water temperature using daily temperature and flow and found that the downstream flow series affected by reservoir operation had a higher correlation with water temperature series than natural conditions piotrowski et al 2015 compared and analyzed the performance of data driven models such as multilayer perceptron and wavelet neural networks in the field of water temperature prediction taking the data of extreme weather and different terrain and properties as variables and the results proved the reliability of neural networks in the field of river water temperature prediction in recent years deep learning neural networks have been widely used in the field of hydrology because of their excellent learning ability and versatility afzaal et al 2020 pan et al 2020 le et al 2021 however the use of deep learning models to predict and analyze water temperature regimes under the influence of cascade reservoir operation is still rare the yangtze river with its unique ecosystem is one of the most important rivers in the world and is also one of the most seriously affected by hydropower development a large number of studies have been carried out on the hydrological conditions of the yangtze river basin under the influence of reservoirs li et al 2013 shao et al 2017 liu et al 2018 xiong et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 observed the water temperature data of the entire yangtze river basin since 1950 and used the correlation to point out that the temporal and spatial changes in seasonal temperature conditions are significantly related to the upstream storage capacity liu et al 2019 studied the influence of the reservoirs in the yalong river basin on the downstream runoff process and found that the influence of the reservoirs on the change of the annual runoff process was enhanced with the increase of the storage capacity yan et al 2021 systematically analyzed the variation of runoff and sediment transport in the uryr and proposed a double mass curve analysis method utilizing it to point out the influence of the upstream cascade reservoirs on the sediment transport in the three gorges reservoir area however previous studies on reservoirs impact on water thermal mainly focus on qualitative evaluation steel and lange 2007 casado et al 2013 chen et al 2016 long et al 2019 quantifying the impacts of reservoir impoundment on water temperature on a monthly scale is a critical study which is crucial for formulating cascade reservoir scheduling strategies and reducing the adverse effects of hydropower development on fish reproduction moreover some studies attribute the change of water temperature before and after the dam construction to the operation of the reservoir without taking into account the potential impact of climate change on the water temperature before and after the construction of the dam preece and jones 2002 chandesris et al 2019 wang et al 2020 this study constructs a detached framework to study the uryr basins with high levels of hydropower development the main objectives are 1 to identify abrupt changes in water temperature by the tfpw mk method and construct hydrothermal indicators to clarify the characteristics of thermal regimes in the uryr over the past 57 years 2 to reconstruct natural water temperature without reservoir influence based on the lstm model and to quantify the effects of climate change and cascade reservoirs on river thermal regime at multiple scales with the help of a contribution calculation method that considers residuals 3 to assess the potential ecological impact of cascade reservoirs on fish reproduction in the uryr basin by setting four water temperature scenarios the research results inform a scientific basis for the management of the reservoirs to reduce the stress on the river ecosystem 2 material and methodology 2 1 the generalization of the study area the yangtze river is 6380 kilometers long making it the longest river in asia and the third longest in the world tao et al 2020 the uryr starts from the source of the yangtze river and goes eastward to yichang hubei the basin area is 1 056 million square kilometers accounting for about 58 9 of the entire yangtze river basin flood season generally occurs in may august each year and july august is the main flood season a large number of reservoirs have been developed and built due to abundant water resources in the uryr fig 1 cuntan hydrological station is located 7 5 km downstream of the confluence of the yangtze river and the jialing river which controls the water regime of the minjiang river the tuojiang river the jialing river and the chishui river after the confluence into the yangtze river the catchment area is 8 67 106 square kilometers it is not only the outlet control station of the national nature reserve of rare and endemic fishes in the uryr 27 29 29 4 n 104 9 106 30 e but also an important water regime control station in the uryr fig 1 the representative fishes in the nature reserve are coreius guichenoti and myxocyprinus asiaticus which are famous species in the uryr the reproduction period of the coreius guichenoti is from april to july and the suitable spawning water temperature is above 18 c for myxocyprinus asiaticus spawning activity occurs from march to april with water temperatures between 15 and 18 c this study takes the cuntan station as the research object and considers the influence of the operation of the cascade reservoirs in the uryr above the cuntan station on the stream temperature and fish reproduction 2 2 data collection water temperature data daily mean water temperature at cuntan station from 1961 to 2017 was used the data were provided by the changjiang water resources commission meteorological data the daily data of jiangjin changshou and qijiang meteorological stations around cuntan station from 1961 to 2017 were collected and the meteorological water temperature mwt model was constructed based on the lstm network to reconstruct the natural water temperature process without the influence of the cascade reservoirs meteorological data include daily average temperature precipitation relative humidity daily average wind speed sunshine duration and evaporation data source national meteorological information center http data cma cn 2 3 framework for assessing climate change and reservoirs impact on water thermal regime in this study we proposed a framework to assess the changes in river thermal regime caused by climate change and cascade reservoirs involving several steps fig 2 step 1 get daily water temperature observation data air temperature is the main driving force of river water temperature change in many meteorological factors morrill et al 2005 trend free pre whitening mann kendall test

temperature model can be used to reconstructed water temperature and the deep learning method with higher accuracy can also be used for water temperature prediction according to the diagnostic results of water temperature variation see section 3 1 the whole period is divided into the base period with less reservoirs interference and the variation period with strong reservoirs interference long short term memory model is used to reconstruct the water temperature series in the base period of the uryr keep the parameters of the baseline model unchanged and use the meteorological data of the variation period as the input of the model to reconstruct the water temperature series only affected by climate change step 3 quantitative assessment of the driving factors of hydrothermal changes ye et al 2013 proposed a dimensionless method to quantify the drivers of runoff variability which was also extended to study the factors affecting water temperature but lacked sufficient consideration of

lstm model is a feedback recurrent neural network with good robustness and memory learning ability it has good reliability in the field of hydrological forecasting hochreiter 1988 gao et al 2020 cho and kim 2022 the principle of the model has been described in detail by ma et al 2015 and will not be repeated in this study fig 3 shows the neural unit structure of the lstm network in this study the natural water temperature of rivers is reconstructed using the measured daily meteorological data from jiangjin changshou and qijiang stations as the driver to speed up the convergence of the model the original multidimensional vectors are normalized rmse nse and r2 were used as the performance evaluation indexes of mwt model 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i t i 2 n s e 1 i 1 n t i p i 2 i 1 n t i t 2 10

the hydrothermal regime during the year the skewness coefficient s c kurtosis coefficient k c concentration degree c d and non uniformity coefficient c n of the daily water temperature series were

randomness and uncertainty wang et al 2020 the change process of water thermal during the year is very important and irregular temperature fluctuations will destroy the life process of aquatic organisms sommer et al 2018 large entropy corresponds to high complexity sample entropy theory is for finite time series consisting of n data points a set of m dimensional vector sequences is formed

be estimated as 19 s a m p e n n m r ln b m 1 r b m r 2 inter annual hydrothermal alteration in order to quantify the change of river temperature pre and post mutation year the rva is used to calculate the change of monthly mean water temperature rva is a set of methods based on the iha indicator system proposed by richter which aims to assess the degree of change in hydrological indicators after being affected duan et al 2016 although previous studies often used rva method to analyze the change of runoff some scholars have confirmed that rva method is also feasible to quantify the change in some water temperature indexes because among the hydrological indicators selected by iha there are related monthly averages magnitude cai et al 2017 guo et al 2021 the change degree of hydrothermal indicator can be calculated as 20 d i n o i n e n e 100 n e r n t 21 d o 1 n i 1 n d i 2 0 5 where d i represent the degree of change of the ith index d o represent the change

myxocyprinus asiaticus were used as representative species to analyze the effects of river thermal conditions on fish spawning the breeding period of coreius guichenoti is from april to july each year and the suitable spawning water temperature is above 18 c the breeding period of myxocyprinus asiaticus is from march to april each year and the suitable spawning water temperature is 15 18 c li et al 2012 the measured water temperature during the fish spawning period march 1 to june 30 at cuntan station in 1988 was used as the baseline water temperature that was not affected by the reservoirs the water temperature process during the fish spawning season in 2012 is taken as the study target daily meteorological data and water temperature for 1961 1987 and 1989 2001 were trained in the mwt model and then driven by the meteorological data of 1988 and 2012 the water temperature process under the four scenarios was obtained table 1 the reliability of the reconstructed natural water temperature was verified by comparing four scenarios of water temperature and quantifying the effect of the reservoir on the thermal condition of fish reproduction by the comparative separation method comparing scenario 1 and scenario 2 the reliability of the lstm model for simulating water temperature during the spawning season of fish using meteorological data was evaluated comparing scenario 1 and scenario 3 the impact of the observed water temperature process in 2012 on fish reproduction in protected areas in the uryr under the combined effect of climate change and cascade reservoirs was assessed comparing scenario 3 and scenario 4 assess the influence of cascade reservoirs on fish reproduction in 2012 3 results 3 1 basic trends of water and air temperature changes 3 1 1 temporal characteristics of water and air temperature fig 4 shows the interannual warming trend of annual average water and air temperature at cuntan station in the uryr from 1961 to 2017 the water temperature and air temperature have the characteristics of synchronous change but the water temperature rises faster according to the tfpw mk test results fig 5 the mutation years of water temperature and air temperature were 2001 and 2003 respectively and then showed a significant upward trend after 2003 and 2014 the warming trend of water temperature is more obvious than that of air temperature the mean of the water temperature statistic 3 04 the mean of the air temperature statistic 2 18 the change in water temperature may be affected by the increase in total storage capacity in the uryr 3 1 2 change of response relationship between water temperature and air temperature the response relationship between water temperature and air temperature changed significantly around 2001 and the correlation coefficient decreased from 0 95 before 2001 0 91 after 2001 fig 6 the warming period of the water temperature in the uryr is from february to august and the cooling period is from september to january during the warming period as the air temperature rises the river temperature should have continued to warm up compared with the situation before the mutation year but there is still a small decline the average daily water temperature which should essentially begin to fall below the average daily air temperature in mid april is advanced to mid march from september to december the water temperature lags behind the drop in air temperature and there is a significant temperature difference between the river and the atmosphere at this time compared to 1961 2001 affected by the high temperature water discharged from the upstream reservoir the cooling trend of water temperature at cuntan station became slow this remarkable water temperature change will further affect the life process of aquatic organisms 3 2 performance of lstm model in simulating water temperature in order to determine the hyperparameters suitable for the meteorological water temperature model and make the water temperature simulation results based on meteorological factors closer to the natural water temperature process without the influence of the reservoir the meteorological and water temperature data from the cuntan station in the base period 1961 2001 were taken for model rate determination with 1961 1990 as the calibration set and 1991 2001 as the verification set ye et al 2013 fan et al 2017 the important hyperparameters of lstm networks are epoch hidden neurons and batch size etc guo and lai 2020 we first set a large epoch and then found that the best fit occurred around the 60th time so we decided to take the epoch to 60 according to the convergence curve the epoch of model was set to 60 the number of hidden neurons in the lstm network layer is used to retain the learned data features which is one of the important parameters affecting the accuracy of the model a small number will result in an under fitted model and poor training accuracy while a large number will have essentially no effect on model accuracy and will also result in a longer training time our determination process is based on lu et al 2019 and guo and lai 2020 so the results are more credible in addition the role of batch size is to identify the internal features of the batch data taking too large or too small values will lead to poor model performance and the appropriate batch size can be further optimized for model accuracy fan et al 2021 therefore we have determined 7 groups of hidden neurons and batch sizes separately and trained each group of hyperparameters 10 times with nse rmse and r2 as evaluation indicators the overall performance of the model in the benchmark period is shown in fig 7 it can be found that the model accuracy steadily improves with the increase of the number of hidden neurons and approaches convergence at 100 therefore under the consideration of computational efficiency and reconstruction effect we set the number of hidden neurons to 150 based on the number of hidden neurons we also observed the mean of training results for each group of batch sizes at the same time and found that the model accuracy improved overall at the beginning of the increase and reached the optimum at 40d however when the batch size exceeds 40d nse and r2 decrease and rmse increases which may mean that the model is overfitting therefore it is reasonable to use a batch size of 40d in the mwt model of the uryr other relatively good hyperparameters for the mwt model were also selected table 2 all water temperature simulation results below follow these parameters according to the results of the reconstruction of water temperature in the base period fig 8 the model using meteorological data to reconstruct natural water temperature performs better overall when the number of reservoirs is small and the variation of river water temperature is mainly governed by climatic factors r2 0 9753 during the calibration 1961 1990 and verification 1991 2001 the model accuracy was shown as rmse 0 8081 c and 0 8749 c nse 0 9767 and 0 9713 r2 0 9775 and 0 9724 the nse values of the water temperature reconstruction results in the two stages were all higher than 0 75 and the results of each evaluation index had little difference the model performance could be evaluated as good moriasi et al 2007 this indicates that the long short term memory model can effectively capture the temporal variation of water temperature and can be used to reconstruct the water temperature in uryr then this study successfully reconstructed the river water temperature process at cuntan station only under the influence of climate change during the variation period 2002 2017 using the lstm model driven by meteorological data and the results are shown in fig 9 based on the reconstruction results after 2001 there are obvious differences between the simulated and observed values of the annual mean water temperature especially in the non flood season compared with the situation pre 2001 this is not the deviation caused by the mwt model and it can be regarded that the operation of the reservoirs is the main factor leading to this situation 3 3 climate change and reservoirs effects on intra annual river thermal regime fig 10 shows monthly variations in the daily temperature distribution pre and post 2001 during the warming period the frequency of high order water temperature decreased and the magnitude of the highest water temperature decreased significantly during the cooling period the frequency of high order water temperature increased significantly and the magnitude of the highest and lowest water temperatures increased significantly according to the calculation results of five intra annual alteration indicators of the uryr river thermal regime except that the daily sampen indicator increased significantly 0 083 the other indicators decreased to varying degrees after the mutation table 3 the kurtosis coefficient k c concentration degree c d and non uniformity coefficient c n decreased by 0 01 0 017 and 2 48 respectively and the skewness coefficient s c decreased by 0 01 these changes reflect that the annual thermal regime of the river is more uniform after 2001 but the irregular variation of water temperature increased and the frequency of higher water temperature increased on the other hand only the skewness coefficient has reached a moderate change with the alteration degree of 42 36 and the alteration degree of concentration coefficient is the lowest only 6 82 cascade reservoirs play an essential role in the change of intra annual thermal regime in addition to the skewness coefficient the relative contribution of reservoirs exceeds 50 for the change of sampen the impact of reservoirs reached 97 91 leading to irregular changes in the river thermal conditions which may pose a threat to the number and structure of aquatic organisms 3 4 climate change and reservoirs effects on inter annual hydrothermal regime the impact of reservoirs on water temperature fluctuation may be reflected in different time scales steel and lange 2007 webb et al 2008 this study quantitatively analyzes the influence of climate change and the operation of reservoirs on changes in the water temperature regime in the uryr at the annual and monthly scales the results of the degree of alteration show that the water temperature in the uryr changes obviously under the combined action of climate and cascade reservoirs the change in overall water temperature in 12 months is 45 14 which is a moderate change among them the alteration of water temperature in summer is lower than that in the other three seasons and it is only a low change the most significant change in water temperature is in autumn exceeding the rva target by 67 and reaching a high change fig 11 at the same time the change degree of monthly mean water temperature in non flood season months is more obvious than that in flood season months the overall water temperature change degree in non flood season is 52 62 which is higher than 31 83 in flood season the reason for the change in water temperature during the non flood season is directly related to the joint operation of upstream cascade reservoirs in the cuntan station the stratification of water temperature caused by reservoir impoundment leads to the difference in water temperature between the discharge water and the downstream natural water temperature which makes the downstream water temperature change to a certain extent especially in november and march in march the low temperature water released by the reservoirs caused a significant cooling phenomenon in the water temperature of cuntan station with an average cooling of about 0 4 and the degree of change in water temperature was 64 71 reaching a moderate change in november the high temperature water released by the reservoir group caused a significant increase in water temperature with an average temperature increase of about 1 4 and a change in water temperature of 80 reaching a high degree of variation table 4 this degree of water temperature change is likely to have important effects on fish that are in this period of the spawning season in the flood season the inflow volume of the upstream reservoir is equal to the outflow volume and the water temperature stratification is weakened during this period climate change is the main factor affecting water temperature therefore the variation range of the downstream water temperature in the flood season is smaller than that in the non flood season this situation also concerns summer which is mainly associated with the flood season on the annual scale the impact of climate change on the water temperature of the river in the uryr was dominant showing a heating contribution of 0 43 c with a relative contribution of 71 53 the impact of cascade reservoirs on water temperature is relatively small which shows the heating contribution of 0 17 c and the relative contribution is 28 47 fig 12 on the monthly scale climate change leads to varying degrees of increase in river water temperature in different months but in summer the impact on water temperature is relatively small 0 25 c meanwhile the impact of climate change on water temperature in flood season 0 22 c is smaller than that in non flood season 0 54 c and the warming effect in october is the most significant 1 17 c there are apparent differences in the impact of reservoir operation on water temperature during the year mainly in the following aspects the impact is little in the flood season and the impact in the non flood season is large the cooling effect from march to august resulted in an average drop of 0 31 c in river temperature and the impact from may to august is little resulting in an average drop in water temperature of 0 13 c this situation is consistent with the release of the reservoirs and is consistent with the previous qualitative findings because of the thermal inertia of the water in the reservoirs the temperature of the discharge is generally lower than that of the natural water temperature under the influence of meteorological factors in the flood season the discharge of the reservoirs is basically equal to the inflow and the stratification effect of the reservoirs water temperature is weakened therefore the operation of the cascade reservoirs has little influence on the downstream water temperature tao et al 2020 similarly in january february and september december the water temperature is affected by the warming and the stream temperature increased by 0 67 c on average reflecting that the reservoirs discharge temperature is higher than the stream temperature controlled only by meteorological factors cai et al 2018 the cooling effect of the reservoirs on the river is the most significant in march 0 72 c and the warming effect of the cascade reservoir is most remarkable in december 1 17 c exceeding the warming effect of climate change 0 17 c with a relative contribution of 87 31 which led to the fact that the observed stream temperature during this period is higher than the modeled value 3 5 changes in reproductive behavior of different fishes based on the cumulative results of daily water temperature during the fish breeding period fig 13a we found that scenario 1 and scenario 2 had essentially the same pattern of water temperature changes during the natural period 1988 indicating that the reconstruction results of natural water temperature are more reliable in contrast during the variation period 2012 the water temperature patterns of scenarios 3 and 4 were significantly different implying that the cascade reservoirs had a significant impact on the thermal regimes during the fish breeding period from fig 13b it can be seen that the water temperature frequency curves of scenarios 1 3 and 4 have different distribution characteristics while climate change and cascade reservoirs have a stronger perturbation effect on the hydrothermal regime when the water temperature is less than 22 c in addition the water temperature frequencies in these three scenarios were 43 38 and 21 for 18 c and 26 16 and 13 for 15 c respectively the target water temperature frequencies for scenarios 3 and 4 were much lower than the results in the natural period scenario 1 these analyses suggest that reservoir storage in the uryr significantly alters downstream thermal conditions during the spawning season of fish and that climate change resists to some extent the strong perturbing effect of reservoirs on water temperature comparing scenario 1 and scenario 2 the simulated values of water temperature fit well with the measured values in 1988 when the influence of the reservoir is small and it can be concluded that the water temperature during the fish spawning period was reconstructed based on meteorological data is close to the natural water temperature process without the influence of the reservoir however because of the impact of reservoir construction and climate change on the river thermal regime there are significant differences in the water temperature process curves for scenarios 1 3 and 4 before mid may fig 14 water temperature measured in 1988 scenario 1 water temperature rose to 15 c at the end of march and began to meet the water temperature requirements for reproduction of myxocyprinus asiaticus and water temperature reached 18 c on april 22 and began to meet the water temperature requirements for reproduction of coreius guichenoti water temperature measured in 2012 scenario 3 due to the reservoir construction and climate change the water temperature rose to 15 c around march 20 and did not start to rise above 18 c until mid april compared with the water temperature of scenario 1 where there was no reservoir influence the breeding suitable water temperature of myxocyprinus asiaticus appeared 10 days earlier and the duration of appearance increased by 6 days while the breeding suitable water temperature of coreius guichenoti appeared 4 days earlier and the water temperature situation in 2012 was more favorable for the breeding activities of both species water temperature reconstructed in 2012 scenario 4 at this time the low temperature water is discharged from the upstream reservoirs compared with scenario 3 it is assumed that there is no reservoir operation and the natural water temperature should reach 15 c in mid march and 18 c in late march as a result the construction of the reservoirs delayed the appearance of the optimum water temperature for the reproduction of myxocyprinus asiaticus by 4 days and increase the duration by 19 days and the reproduction of coreius guichenoti is delayed by 23 days this hysteresis phenomenon could be understood as the result of the operation of the upstream cascade reservoirs after the middle of may the uryr ushered in the flood season and the delay effect of reservoir groups on river water temperature gradually weakened from may 15 to june 30 the simulated and observed water temperature duration curves in 1988 and 2012 are highly fitted fig 14 overall compared with the baseline year 1998 the observed water temperature process in 2012 is more beneficial to the spawning of the two fish species it is worth mentioning that compared with the natural water temperature in 2012 the process under the influence of the operation of the cascade reservoirs is not conducive to the reproduction of the coreius guichenoti but is beneficial to the myxocyprinus asiaticus based on the results it can be concluded that the decrease in the decrease of myxocyprinus asiaticus is mainly related to river truncation and overfishing while the decrease in the population of coreius guichenoti has a high correlation with the change of water temperature caused by the operation of the reservoirs 4 discussion to determine the influence of changes in natural climatic factors and the operation of cascade reservoirs on water temperature regimes and fish reproduction a systematic analytical framework was constructed and implemented in this paper the baseline and variation periods are divided according to the mutation year and then the range of changes in the dependent variable caused by the independent variable is identified with the help of a lstm model to distinguish the influencing factors of river thermal regimes we described the hydrothermal regimes of rivers at inter and intra annual scales using water temperature indicators and quantified the direction of action of the drivers of the hydrothermal regime by calculating the contribution considering residuals four water temperature scenarios were then set to quantitatively assess the effects of reservoir construction and climate change on changes in fish reproductive behavior the results show that the construction of cascade reservoirs has a very significant impact on the water temperature change and fish reproduction in the uryr in december the influence of reservoirs exceeds the meteorological factors from march to april the low temperature water released by cascade reservoirs caused the hysteresis of some fish reproduction periods many previous studies have shown that dams can significantly alter water temperature in downstream rivers casado et al 2013 chandesris et al 2019 xiong et al 2020 this study confirms that at the monthly scale the operation of the cascade reservoirs significant independent effects on hydrothermal regime downstream of the reservoirs essentially exhibiting cooling effects in spring and summer and increasing water temperature in autumn and winter which further supports the findings of tao et al 2020 and the effect is smaller in july and august when the incoming water is abundant in addition we quantified the potential impact of reservoir construction and climate change on the intra annual hydrothermal regime the results show that the reservoir not only significantly reduces the river water temperature in march 0 72 c which tends to disperse the hydrothermal distribution during the year but also the increase in the thermal homogeneity and sample entropy values are mainly influenced by reservoirs on the other hand climate change resists the effect of reservoirs on the skewness and kurtosis of the thermal distribution but exacerbates the reduction of thermal state concentration and inhomogeneity while the increase in annual mean water temperature and october water temperature is also mainly related to climate change water temperature is a key abiotic factor in river ecosystems zhang et al 2019 changes in water temperature potential within the year can disturb biological actions and significant changes in river water temperature can pose an ecological threat to the species in the river sommer et al 2018 wang et al 2020 previous studies on the effects of changes in the hydrothermal regimes of rivers caused by hydropower development on fish reproduction have mostly been evaluated on the basis of measured hydrothermal conditions before and after the occurrence of disturbances while the important role of climate change has not been adequately studied based on a natural thermal reconstruction model without reservoir effects this study analyzed the effects of cascade reservoirs and climate change on the water temperature of downstream rivers and found that the impoundment of reservoirs disturbed the thermal spawning cues of downstream fish during the warming period of the river the low temperature water discharged from the reservoir delayed the temperature rise process resulting in a delay of 4 days and 23 days for the daily water temperature of 15 0 c and 18 0 c respectively changes in the date of occurrence of suitable spawning water temperatures will lead to erratic changes in the spawning behavior of some fish a phenomenon that is likely to threaten the stability of native fish populations olden and naiman 2010 it is feasible to adjust the discharge flow by managing the operation mode of the reservoir so that the water temperature of the downstream river can be restored to close to the natural water temperature gu 1999 richter and thomas 2007 therefore it is necessary to analyze the evolution characteristics of water temperature and quantify the impact of climate change and hydropower development on water thermal in order to promote the recovery of river temperature based on the combined dispatching of cascade reservoirs zhang et al 2016 unlike many process based models such as swat vic data driven models are less demanding and more flexible van et al 2020 wang et al 2020 during this study the contribution of meteorological factors and reservoir construction to river temperature change was evaluated by deep learning neural network at the same time the mwt model was used to set different reconstruction scenarios to distinguish the impacts of climate and reservoir groups on fish spawning this approach bypasses strict data limitations and is reliable however it should be noted that the data driven model is a mapping of independent to dependent variables and does not explicitly consider hydrological processes water temperature in the yangtze river basin has been demonstrated to be strongly correlated with temperature suggesting that a data driven meteorological flow model would be useful in this basin cai et al 2018 liu et al 2018 some limitations still exist in this study when calculating the contribution the residual ε can be understood as a set of other factors such as industrial pollution and land use change in this study the influence of these factors is considered as constancy this will affect the accuracy of the results to a certain extent however because the demand for hydropower in the uryr is stronger than that for nuclear power and thermal power the water temperature variation caused by residuals is little which can be mainly attributed to the operation of cascade reservoirs cai et al 2018 this can be supported by the correlation between the change of monthly mean water temperature and the absolute contribution 5 conclusion this study constructs an assessment framework based on a long and short term memory model entropy theory and a contribution calculation method considering residuals which aims to evaluate the drivers of the multi scale evolution of the thermal situation in regulated rivers and its possible ecological impacts the results show that the water temperature in the uryr continues to warm up after the mutation year the rva value of inter annual thermal regimes of the river was 68 5 which reached a high degree of alteration and the variation of monthly mean water temperature in the non flood period was more obvious than that in the flood period with rva values of 52 6 and 31 8 respectively on the other hand the level of complexity and homogeneity of intra annual thermal regimes increased while the frequency of high magnitude water temperatures increased we further quantified the impact of climate change and cascade reservoirs on the evolution of water temperature and hydrothermal regimes in the uryr the reservoir was found to show cooling effects in spring and summer and warming effects in autumn and winter moreover the reservoir also changed the variation pattern of river water temperature significantly increasing the intra annual thermal homogeneity and complexity levels with contributions of 60 2 and 97 9 respectively on the other hand climate change resisted the effect of reservoirs on the skewness and kurtosis of the water temperature distribution reducing the thermal concentration and heterogeneity and also acted as the main driver to increase the annual mean water temperature 71 5 during the warming period the reservoir discharge of low temperature water significantly changed the thermal situation of coreius guichenoti and myxocyprinus asiaticus during the breeding period in the uryr and this hysteresis effect may delay the spawning date of coreius guichenoti by 3 4 weeks and may also increase the duration of the emergence of suitable spawning water temperature for myxocyprinus asiaticus by 2 3 weeks credit authorship contribution statement wenxian guo funding acquisition project administration resources investigation
