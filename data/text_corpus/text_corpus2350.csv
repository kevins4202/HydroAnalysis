11750,seawater ingress is a widespread environmental issue posing threat to the fresh groundwater reserves of the coastal aquifers of andaman and nicobar islands ani particularly after the great indian ocean tsunami 2004 and the comprehensive investigations of seawater ingress in this region are relatively uncommon in this context the spatial distribution and vertical movement of seawater ingress in the coastal and catchment areas were mapped using geo spatial techniques and the extensive geoelectrical resistivity surveys 96 vertical electric soundings ves and profiling along and across the identified and affected coastlines the geoelectrical surveys unravels very low resistivity formations 10 ω m at varying depths interpreted as the lateral and vertical intrusion of seawater the hydro chemical and other physical analyses of groundwater samples reveal critical concentrations of the different major elements and other physical parameters like tds ph as well the ec above its permissible limit for drinking water standards the integrated approach allows to delineate the site specific hydrogeological setting including the saline fresh aquifer geometry transition zone and stratigraphic geomorphological reconstruction of coastal aquifers further various assessment parameters including very low formation resistivity surface manifestation of salt tolerant plants high chloride concentration low formation factor and high ionic strength were employed to infer the various levels of contamination the present study show that impact of seawater intrusion is intense in sedimentary formations than ophiolite suite and needs site specific mitigation measure to prevent further deterioration of aquifer health graphical abstract image 1 keywords south andaman fresh and saline aquifers seawater intrusion groundwater chemistry resistivity survey 1 introduction the contamination of the groundwater resources due to seawater intrusion is an important environmental problem in the coastal environments werner and gallagher 2006 seawater intrusion generally takes place when fresh water is displaced or replaced by saline water in an aquifer system todd and mays 2005 this phenomena has manifold causes both natural and anthropogenic like excessive withdrawal of groundwater tidal and estuarine activity gentle coastal hydraulic gradients long term sea level fluctuations tsunami and local geomorphological settings etc choudhury et al 2001 however seawater intrusion induced by catastrophic natural events like storm surges and tsunamis not only contaminate the fresh groundwater reserves in the coastal areas but also sculptures the coastal morphodynamics like permanent land level changes the sunda andaman earthquake of 2004 9 1 mw related to devastating tsunami pummeled the coastal zones of the se asia and caused significant ground deformation in coastal regions of andaman and nicobar islands ani malik et al 2007 2015 subarya et al 2006 bhat et al 2018 the coastal subsidence and permanent land deformation associated with the 2004 earthquake invariably contaminated the freshwater reserves and severely affected the groundwater regimes in the south andaman island the south andaman islands are the southernmost islands of andaman group of islands located in the northern segment of the sunda andaman subduction zone the western coastline is marked by rocky cliffs whereas the eastern coastline has a gentle slope malik et al 2007 the majority of the population in ani depends solely on groundwater resource for domestic industrial and agricultural use and in near future threats to the intensive exploitation to meet the demand deficit can greatly impact the availability and quality of groundwater in this region therefore characterizing and assessing the groundwater quality on temporal trends influenced by escalating groundwater extraction holds paramount significance towards sustainable managing of groundwater reserves bhagat et al 2021 qian et al 2020 chen et al 2016 a and b the effective frugality and management of this precious resource is relevant and crucial for public health and environmental concerns chen et al 2016a b zhang et al 2019 2020a 2020b therefore it is imperative for groundwater monitoring and its quality to conduct systematic and scientific investigations for current and future management of this tedious groundwater issue geoelectrical resistivity techniques have been meticulously used over the past several decades in coastal settings to locate the fresh salt water interface groundwater potential zones and lithostatigraphy influenced by seawater ingress manivannan and lakshman 2019 goebel et al 2017 maury and balaji 2015 bahuriddin et al 2011 son 2011 barker and worthington 1980 resistivity surveys in fact have also been extensively used in varied coastal environments and hydrogeological regimes due to notable disparity between fresh and saline water formations frohlich 1974 nowroozistephen and henderson 1999 maury and balaji 2014 therefore in the present study an integrated technique consisting of resistivity profiling and resistivity sounding combined with hydro chemical analysis of groundwater samples were employed for precise interpretation of seawater ingress and to ascertain the efficiency in groundwater and saline contaminations studies to determine the contrasting hydro geological settings of ani region fig 1 the present study substantiates the synergistic approach towards application of integrated techniques for the sustainable development and management of groundwater resources of these islands 2 geomorphology geology and hydrogeology 2 1 geomorphology south andaman island has a diverse and complex physiography comprising of intermontanne narrow linear valleys bounded by thrust faults gradually sloping to stiff coastal tracts pediments swamps n s compressional mounds and fault slices etc with landforms largely trending in n s direction bhat et al 2019 the eastern segment of south andaman is expressed by linear and sub parallel fold surfaces terrace surfaces creeks older thrust displacement and is more elevated with older lithologies fig 1 b the central and western part of south andaman is dominated by emergent thrust systems in a step like topography with parallel scarps linear ridges and young fold surfaces bounded by narrow and linear thrust basins and structurally forming a duplex structure bhat et al 2020 structurally controlled geomorphology drainage pattern and aquifer system along major concomitant faults resulted in the evolution distribution and occurrence of groundwater of the island bhat 2016 major dynamic and associated interlinked fractures strike nne ssw to n s directions correspond to the strike trend of concomitant faults such as carbyn thrust in the east and jarawa thrust in the west bhat et al 2018 2020 2 1 1 geology andaman and nicobar islands ani represent northern part of arcuate mélange of subduction accretion complexes of the sunda andaman subduction zone geologically ani consists of the major three main rock types 1 ophiolite suite cretaceous age andaman flysch oligocene and mithakhari group eocene fig 2 pal et al 2003 the ophiolite group encompasses tholeitic basalt as pillowed lavas felsic rocks mainly plagiogranites layered ultramafic and mafic cumulates serpentinites tectonites etc allen et al 2007 pal et al 2003 the eastern and central segment of south andaman island constitute the ophiolite group rocks and forms the eastern coastline 40 km in length from carbyn cove to rutland island bhat et al 2019 the andaman flysch group consists thick sedimentary pile 3 km thick inter bedded sequence of sandstone and shale rocks representing silicilastic turbidites pal et al 2003 karunakaran et al 1968 deposited on a submarine fan with pene contemporaneous deformation structures of oligocene to late eocene age the western coastline of south andaman is entirely taken up by andaman flysch group from south to north of andaman islands whereas the mithakhari group consists of sandstone shale and conglomerate and represents pelagic trench sediments and are of early to middle eocene age having a thickness approximately 1 4 km ray 1982 mithakhari group represents the western coastline of south andaman from upper and northern part of the carbyn creek while as southern part of the creek is dominated by ophiolite suite that marks the thrust fault contact between the ophiolite suite and mithakhari group bhat et al 2019 2020 2 2 hydro geological setup several hydro geological investigations were carried out in the south andaman islands in reception to the land level changes and related changes in hydrological settings associated with catastrophic sunda andaman earthquake mw 9 1 2004 e g cgwb 2010a kumar and riyazuddin 2008 singh et al 2005 generally two types of aquifer settings exist in the south andaman island namely crystalline aquifers ophiolite suite and stratified aquifers andaman flysch and mithakhari group maury and balaji 2015 from the tectonic and structural perspective ophiolite rocks are highly deformed fractured faulted and folded due to plate boundary setting and presence of several active faults thrusts in the south andaman like bathubasti fault bhat et al 2020 carbyn thrust bhat et al 2019 joggers park fault bhat et al 2018 and jarawa thrust fault bhat et al 2020 tectono geomorphically these rocks are manifested as linear structural hills dismembered compressional ridges separated by linear fault bound basins thrust basins that are spasmodically in filled with sediments up to 60 meter depth deposited from uplands and form the crystalline aquifer setting the andaman flysch and mithakhari group forms sedimentary aquifer formations with varying depth of 10 70 m below ground level bgl actually complex and occurs in narrow basins and at topographic breaks adjacent to structural hills the productive groundwater zones in ophiolite and sedimentary formations are strongly influenced by fracture density secondary porosity and permeability hydraulic property and overburden thickness the sedimentary aquifers are constrained within 60 m below ground level bgl in sandstone and shale formations compared to the crystalline aquifers in the ophiolite suite that are delimited within 53 m bgl cgwb 2010a the inter bedded sequence of sandstone and shale formations of andaman flysch and sandstone conglomerate and shale formations of mithakhari group have been classified as moderate to good aquifers but at depth the sedimentary aquifers are adversely affected by the problem of seawater intrusion in many areas balakrishna et al 2014 cgwb 2010a the productive aquifers in the entire ani occur within 60 m bgl in fractured volcanic and 30 m bgl in valley fill deposits with discharge varying from 10 to 45 m3 hr the igneous rocks yield moderate to good and up to 60 m depth potential fractures were noticed the yield range of the boreholes in these formations were found to vary from 10 000 to 25 000 litres h cgwb 2013 the transmissivity t and storage co efficient s of borewells drilled in fractured volcanics at calicut and beadnabad of south andaman are 112 3 m2 day and 211 1 m2 day respectively and 9 65 10 4 and 6 19 10 4 respectively the igneous rocks yield moderate to good up to 60 m depth potential fractures were noticed the yield range of the boreholes in these formations were found to vary from 10 000 to 25 000 litres h the water table depth in south andaman measured in hydrograph stations gradually varies seasonally from 2 to 3 m mbgl and varies with the topography cgwb 2013 kar 2019 seasonal fluctuation of water level in intermontanne valleys before rainy season varies from 0 6 3 66 mbgl and post rainy season 0 47 2 69 mbgl kar 2019 however fluctuation is much higher in higher topography and hill slopes that varies from 3 1 7 5 before monsoon and 0 9 5 9 mbgl post monsoon season kar 2019 the sedimentary aquifers along the west coast occurs 3 70 m mbgl has a discharge rate of 10 45 m3 h whereas ophiolite aquifers are more productive with a discharge rate of 45 72 m3 h cgwb 2013 the beach sand 3 9 m thick coral debris and alluvium in the piedmonts basins and foothills represent the porous formations and the moderately filled slope colluvium deposits in the constrict basins that forms the water table aquifers in ophiolite formations along the east coast auto flowing artesian conditions exists which was affected by the 2004 earthquake cgwb 2013 the water table aquifer in sedimentary formations also experienced significant changes post 2004 earthquake however at lower topography the aquifers have shown rise and not strained through pumping cgwb 2013 the rainfall is received through southwest sw and northeast ne monsoons spans for the period from may to december average annual rainfall in these islands is about 3000 mm while the normal annual rainfall at port blair is 3180 mm the islands in south andaman district enjoy tropical humid climate because of their location in the equatorial zone surrounded by the andaman sea the islands have only two seasons viz rainy season and summer season winter is virtually absent the mean relative humidity is 79 the mean maximum temperature is 30 2 c and means minimum temperature is 23 8 c the relative humidity varies from 79 to 89 and wind speed varies from 7 km h to 10 km h the maximum and minimum temperatures in the islands fluctuate between 27 to 330 c and 21 to 250 c daily evaporation rate in the island is fairly high which cumulatively ranges from 1500 to 1800 mm per annum cgwb 2013 3 methodology 3 1 hydro geochemistry in order to exactitude interpretation of geoelectrical data and to further deduce the local hydrogeological setting along with the temporal and spatial salinization processes a hydro chemical analysis of water samples collected in 2018 from 50 sites of bore wells tube wells and dug wells 8 10 m deep during summer season in some bore wells samples were collected at deeper level 10 m groundwater samples were taken in close vicinity of ves stations for multi parameter probe for concentrations of major element of ca2 k mg2 na hco 3 cl no3 so4 2 and in situ parameters of tds ec and ph the hydro chemical results were depicted through trilinear diagram generated using rockwork tool version 17 portable gps garmin was used to note the geographic coordinates of sample locations supplementary table 1 1 polyethylene bottles of 1 l capacity were used to collect water sample by running them running full to avoid presence of air as a precautionary measure two samples for each location were collected all samples were carried in cartons to avoid sunlight contact hno3 was added to the samples to preserve any precipitation of heavy metals the physico chemical characteristics of water were determined in accordance with the standards methods of apha 1995 and quality determined in reference to the guidelines of who 2006 2011 and bis 2012 the ph was measured using ph meter tds mg l calculated using digital conductivity meter lt 51 and ec measured as μs cm using conductivity meter to determine the concentration of ca and mg edta titrimetric analysis was used likewise chloride was estimated by standard agno3 titration method na and k were estimated using flame photometry sulphate was analyzed by colorimetric turbid metric method using uv vis spectrophotometer bicarbonate ion concentration was determined using acid titration method the groundwater was classed based classifications given by davis et al 1966 based on tds and stuyfzand 1989 based on chloride indicate groundwater suitability for drinking purpose table 2 3 2 geophysical methods in order to map the lateral and vertical intrusion of seawater into the freshwater formations ninety six vertical electrical sounding ves surveys were carried out in a systematic way at 20 identified locations spread along and across the east and west coastlines using the aquameter crm 500 instrument pune make the site selection was given discretion taking several factors into consideration such as accessibility space available topography dryness highly vegetated and were preliminary mapped on google earth imagery and satellite data consequently several places were therefore targeted like tidal creeks recent tsunami plains that were earlier agricultural fields adjacent plains close to shorelines tidal influence and near the vicinity of residential areas covering all the affected areas the areas where surficial expression of seawater intrusion were not visible such as terrace surfaces abandoned abrasion ramps paddy fields coconut and beetle nut orchards etc were also accounted for the survey figs 1 and 2 subsequently a structured ves profiling 32 was performed across the identified coasts of south andaman the ves profiling across the west coast consists of 39 ves soundings whereas ves profiling across the east coast encompasses 57 ves soundings respectively supplementary table 2 1 to outstretch the maximum depth for deeper investigations we used 5 electrode schlumberger electrode configuration sec that was placed laterally with different electrode separations ab ranging from 100 to 300 m and the potential electrode separation mn of 1 4 m then the measured apparent resistivity pa was plotted in the ordinate axis y and half current electrode separations ab 2 in the abscissa x axis in double log graph that resulted in resistivity curves the resistivity curves were subsequently interpreted by using the master and auxiliary curve and pcm technique of orellana and mooney 1967 further the measured apparent resistivity was fed into the ip2win resistivity software for computer interpretation of resistivity curves the resistivity curves were interpreted by both the methods in order to integrate the results and arrive at an accurate figure which reduces the error and increases the accuracy of interpretation inim et al 2020 goebel et al 2017 to characterize the subsurface depth and resistivity contrast horizontally and vertically pseudo sections were generated by combining multiple ves and consequently from the pseudo sections low resistivity and high resistivity zones were mapped 4 results and interpretation 4 1 general hydrochemistry in order to evaluate groundwater quality and assess the seawater intrusion various physico chemical indices of the groundwater samples of south andaman island have been studied table 1 depicts the results with fig 3 depicting their spatial distribution the results were examined for rating groundwater chemical characteristics in accordance with the who 2006 2011as well the bis 2012 guidelines results reveal that tds ranges between 121 6 and 23027 2 mg l with average concentration of 2138 84 mg l that stands very high in respect of its permissible limit of 1000 mg l table 2 the permissible value of tds is 1000 mg l but should be below 500 mg l above which it may cause gastrointestinal irritation cgwb 2010b moreover the high content of dissolved solids reduces its use for different purposes maiti 2004 nearly 52 samples show tds concentration above its permissible limit 1000 mg l whereas four locations shows tds concentrations in the range of 4000 23000 at ograbaraj 6 port mout 1 mithakhari 6 and ograbaraj 3 therefore the groundwater is contaminated and unfit for drinking and irrigation use in these as areas as per the classification davis et al 1966 based on tds the results further show that ec values ranged between 190 and 35 980 μs cm with an average of 3341 93 μs cm which is above its permissible limit of 1500 μs cm table 3 the ec of groundwater depicts dissolved salts prasanth et al 2012 and is related to purity of water murugesan et al 2006 the ph values of the samples collected from different localities varied between 5 83 and 8 73 around seventy eight percent samples reveal ph in the range of 6 5 7 5 as per the bis 2012 the ph must not exceed 6 5 to 8 5 and exceeding this range will cause water to affect the mucous membrane and or water supply system cgwb 2010b as per the 2012 guidelines of bureau of indian standards bis from drinking water quality point of view 200 mg l and 400 mg l respectively are the standard and permissible limits of sulphate the presence of sulphate above the permissible limit leads to gastro intestinal discomfort if sodium or magnesium are present cgwb 2010b the sulphate concentration in the groundwater samples of the study area varies from 6 mg l to 2825 mg l as for chloride concentration is concerned its standard value is 250 mg l and permissible limit is 1000 mg l table 4 concentration above the permissible limit does affect the taste corrosion and palatability cgwb 2010b who 2011 it also serves as an indicator of pollution by sewage saxena and sharma 2017 the study shows cl content in ninety eight percent samples exceeds the standard limit 64 samples exceed the 1000 mg l concentrations chloride concentration above 300 mg l are good indicators of seawater ingress as per the stufyzand chloride classification of 1989 the groundwater of the south andaman is brackish salt type 62 of the samples brackish 24 of the samples and to fresh brackish type 14 samples table 3 as per bis 2012 the standard value for bicarbonate is 300 mg l and permissible value is 350 mg l the results reveal that bicarbonate ranges between 95 and 1870 mg l with an average value of value of 329 7 and 36 percent samples show hco3 concentration above the permissible limit as per the who guideline 2011 the standard value of no3 in drinking water is 50 mg l around 86 percent samples detected the concentration within the standard limit the concentration of calcium in different localities of study area shows the range between 8 mg l to 915 mg l a total of 24 samples show ca2 above the permissible limit the standard value for ca is 75 mg l and permissible limit is 200 mg l its presence leads to the encrustations in water supply structure cgwb 2010b calcium in groundwater is mainly due to carbonate minerals the magnesium level ranges between 7 mg l to 550 mg l the standard limit for magnesium in drinking water is 30 mg l and permissible limit is 50 mg l the average magnesium concentration of 102 73 mg l is well above the standard limit of 30 mg l locations showing concentration above permissible limit make the 58 of the samples magnesium presence can be reasonably toxic and is also responsible for hardness sodium concentrations show range between 111 mg l to 416 77 mg l however it typically is found less than 20 mg l who 2011 the average sodium concentrations detected is 243 47 mg l although not of the immediate health concern but the presence above 200 mg l does give an unpalatable taste who 2011 the study shows that the lowest concentration of 95mgl l is detected and that 86 samples show concentration above 200 mg l similarly the potassium ranges between 4 5 mg l to 560 mg potassium is found typically less than 10 mg l in groundwater even though in susceptible individuals its presence at times causes health effects makes indispensable element in humans its less intake can also lead to adverse health effects who 2011 ninety four percent samples show potassium concentration above 10 mg l the distribution of hydro hydro chemical facies of the groundwater samples are graphically represented through piper trilinear diagram fig 3 the piper trilinear diagram has been used by several researchers to understand the chemical composition of groundwater in various hydrogeological settings e g senthilkumar et al 2017 najib et al 2017 in the piper diagram multivariate values of cations mg2 ca2 na k anions so4 2 cl and alkali hco 3 are plotted in aggregation the results reveal that na cl type is the most predominant type of hydro chemical facies followed by mg2 ca2 type and whereas so4 2 cl is the least dominant type the general trend of water facies from the piper diagram provides the clear evidence of saltwater intrusion in the groundwater of the coastal areas of south andaman island 4 2 apparent resistivity at the south andaman island along east and west coast a total of 96 ves soundings was obtained at 2 m spacing ab 2 to map the spatial variations of apparent resistivity of different layers based on subsurface lithology and physical characteristics the true resistivity of the subterranean stratigraphy supplementary table 1 1 obtained from ves data was systematically corroborated and correlated with available borehole data of the area fig 6 for e g maury and balaji 2014 which helped in a precise interpretation of the subsurface formations the eastern coast of south andaman is dominated by h type curves p1 p2 p3 whereas the west coast of south andaman exhibits qh type p1 p2 p3 p4 fig 4 however the east coast shows significant variations in apparent resistivity with depth that ranges from 383 76 ω m to very low 2 035 ω m figs 1 and 4 comparatively at carbyn cove along the east coast the average apparent resistivity at 60 70 m depth varies around 208 90 ω m at mithakhari the apparent resistivity rises 383 76 ω m at 40 50 m depth and at ograbraj apparent resistivity varies 187 996 ω m at 30 40 m depth and can plausibly be attributed to massive sandstone formation bed rock similarly at sippyghat the apparent resistivity varies 174 145 at 60 70 m depth is attributed to fine and interbedded sandstone of andaman flysch group respectively supplementary table 1 1 the moderate values of apparent resistivity at sippyghat 26 138 ω m at 50 m depth and at carbyns cove 30 242 ω m at 20 m depth is attributed to presence of very fine and dry clayey zones maury and balaji 2014 a very low apparent resistivity at places like chouldari 2 035 ω m at 40 m depth garacharma 7 828 ω m at 34 m depth ograbraj 4 098 ω m at 68 m depth and at mithakhari 4 974 ω m at 70 m depth is interpreted and corresponds to saline water intrusion on freshwater formations in low lying coastal areas see fig 7 the west coast of south andaman presents more complex picture of apparent resistivity with depth that varies from 320 123 ω m observed at manjery at 40 50 m depth linedera 116 98 ω m at 30 40 m depth new wandoor 89 10 ω m at 30 40 m depth and at badmash pahad 74 847 ω m at 40 50 m depth shows existence of bedrock formations at various depths the moderate values of apparent resistivity observed at colinpur 33 39 ω m at 30 m depth temple moyo 44 54 ω m at 47 m depth loha barack 23 04 ω m at 50 60 m depth conforms to stiff clay zones maury and balaji 2014 and fractured bedrock formations a very low resistivity value observed at badabalu 3 42 ω m at 6 10 m depth tirur 5 24 ω m at 27 m depth north wandoor 4 395 ω m at 17 m depth and at bimlatan 7 198 ω m at 20 m depth is attributed to clay with fine sand bearing brackish saline water intrusion 4 3 analysis of ves curves the apparent resistivity curves prepared from the resistivity data showed two major types of curves as h type and hq type along the eastern and western coasts of south andaman respectively the h type curve with the layer resistivity relationship of p1 p2 p3 is observed from north to southern segment of the eastern coast especially at chouldari saithankhari mithakhari sippyghat ograbraj and at carbyns cove fig 4 a the resistivity of the top layer generally ranges from 1 31 to 55 7 ω m and is lower in clay formations and high in sandy silt to sandy formations with 1 3 03 m depth the second layer resistivity ranges from 1 to 34 ω m with varying thickness of 1 4 86 m the high resistivity of second layer suggests of thick sheets of sand and tsunami deposits and related sedimentation in coastal areas whereas the low resistivity layers corresponds to peat and silty clay formation below the tsunami deposit the third layer resistivity values ranges from 0 38 194 ω m with varying thickness of 1 38 13 6 m the low resistivity values are attributed to thick clay formation in topographic depressions and high values suggests weathered formations the fourth layer has resistivity that ranges from 0 104 474 ω m with varying thickness of 1 24 16 5 m the low resistivity at this depth is attributed to saline water intrusion whereas the higher resistivity likely corresponds to shale and fractured sandstone formations the fifth layer and sixth layer resistivity ranges from 0 058 999 ω m to 0 0052 1192 ω m with varying thickness of 2 59 55 m the low resistivity is attributed to seawater intrusion at depth and high resistivity values corresponds to massive sandstone formation the apparent resistivity curves from the west coast shows mostly h and q h type with the layer resistivity relationship of p1 p2 p3 p4 the northern part of the west coast generally shows q type tirur north wandoor and colinpur and k type at the badabalu central segment and h type badmash pahad and manjery in the southern part of the south andaman fig 4 b the top layer resistivity values ranges from 1 14 124 58 ω m with depth of 1 3 03 m that is lower in bioturbated soil and high in dry top soil formations the second layer resistivity values ranges from 0 234 39 9 ω m with thickness of 1 4 86 is actually the soil profile zone and resistivity contrast is attributed to very fine silty clay and coarse grained sandy clay formations the resistivity values of the third layer varies from 0 38 194 ω m with thickness of 0 87 13 6 m the low and high resistivity corresponds to clay formation and sandy clay with coarse rock fragments the resistivity of the fourth layer ranges from 0 215 474 ω m and thickness of 1 24 16 5 m the low resistivity indicates the salinity impact whereas the high resistivity corresponds to presence of corals and fractured bedrock the resistivity of the fifth and sixth layer ranges from 0 058 999 ω m to 0 0052 1192 ω m with thickness of 0 714 55 3 m the low resistivity at this depth is attributed to saline water intrusion and high resistivity suggests to bedrock formation 4 4 ves profiling and resistivity pseudo section across the east and west coasts of south andaman ves profiling was performed by multiple ves sounding profiling supplementary table 2 1 the ves profile data was systematically processed in ip2win software to generate the resistivity pseudo sections using linear krigging fig 5 a b the resistivity pseudo section or contours explicitly illustrates the hydrogeological settings fresh saline water interface saline aquifers and bedrock depth four profiles have been selected after analysis with interpreted lithology with two on each east and west coast as shown in fig 5 a b 4 5 profile h hʹ chouldari profile h hʹ strikes n sand consists results of three ves soundings 4 5 and 6 supplementary table 1 1 in

p6 0 42 ω m with a layer thickness of h1 2 12 m h2 0 473 m h3 3 46 m h4 9 76 m h5 24 7 m table 1 the resistivity pseudo section reveals that entire geological succession is affected by the saltwater intrusion from top to bottom which is substantiated by very low resistivity of less than 10 ω m the chouldari area where resistivity profiling has been performed was agricultural paddy field before 2004 great earthquake and tsunami and experienced a coseismic subsidence of 1 m malik et al 2007 which resulted contamination of the aquifer system by direct infiltration of ponded seawater due to breaching of natural barrier by tsunami waves and accumulation of seawater and sediments on the field has affected the hydrogeological settings to a paramount extent the tsunami wave trains and related sedimentation of very fine sand affected the paddy field and hence a thin 10 cm peat layer and salt tolerant plants have colonized the agricultural area the accumulation of ponded seawater salts led to the conversion of acidic soils to saline acidic soil velmurugan et al 2006 4 6 profile k kʹ tirur profile k kʹ is a ne sw trending profile based on the results of ves 10 11 and 12 in the

top layer corresponds to silty clay tsunami deposit and second layer consists of freshwater lense resting on affected saline brackish water below while third layer shows saturated saline water intrusion owing to very low resistivity of less than 10 ω m 4 7 profile a aʹ sippyghat profile a aʹ is ne sw trending profile consists of data of three ves soundings ves 70 71 and 72 in the andaman

thickness of h1 1 5 m h2 2 m h3 6 13 m h4 50 8 m the sippyghat area was highly inundated and affected during 2004 earthquake and tsunami and some parts of the area got permanently inundated by direct infiltration increased seawater intrusion by landward shift of the coastline due to breaching of natural barrier by seawater ingress the resistivity of the top layer is attributed to silty sand and tsunami sand which were observed during profiling where resistivity of the second layer corresponds to peat and clay formation below the tsunami sand the resistivity of the third layer is very low 10 ω m and is interpreted as seawater intrusion into freshwater formation at this depth and the fourth corresponds to massive sandstone of andaman flysch group as a bed rock 4 8 profile q qʹ north

corresponds to silty clay and peat layer below the sand the third layer resistivity is interpreted as affected saline water intrusion in weathered and bedrock formation owing to low resistivity and shallow bedrock in the area maury and balaji 2014 the fourth layer is interpreted as saline ingress towards freshwater formation owing very low resistivity of 2 38 ω m at this depth 5 discussion the integrated geospatial geoelectrical and hydro chemical analyses were used to assess the status of saltwater intrusion in the study area the physico chemical study of groundwater samples reveals the higher concentration of all parameters particularly cl so4 hco 3 tds and ec with reference to their standard values table 4 the na cl mg2 ca2 hco 3 co3 2 groundwaterfacies was observed the analysis of trilinear piper diagram corroborates the resistivity analysis shows most of the well sites in the upper corner of the diamond indicating the seawater intrusion of the groundwater samples qualitatively the groundwater of the study area varies from neutral to alkaline type the thickness of weathered formation in the study area varies in depth from 3 to 6 mbgl cgwb 2013 and the eastern coastline is occupied by ophiolite suite by shallow weathering consists of mafic and ultramafic rocks the ophiolite formations are characterize up to a depth of 1 12 m cgwb 2013 as substantiated by very low resistivity of 10 ω m in and around the sites of garacharma sippyghat ograbraj mithakhari north wandoor chouldari tirur and bimlatan the ves profiling data reveals lateral intrusion have impacted to the maximum extent from the coast in these areas the resistivity pseudo sections derived from ves profiling further illustrates the seawater intrusion from 5 m to 45 m depth along the east and west coast fresh saline water interface geometry saline aquifers and bedrock depth the seawater ingress at shallow depths at various examined sites are greatly influenced by 2004 coseismic subsidence and perpetually impacted the groundwater regimes by persistent tidal activity and breaching the natural barriers that facilitated by numerous interlinked extension and shear fractures singh et al 2005 malik et al 2007 in addition to the geomorphic changes of low lying coastal areas the catastrophic tsunami caused extensive contamination and salinization of coastal aquifers in various ways like direct infiltration and inundation of land surface seawater filled dug wells and ponds increased seawater intrusion due to landward shift of the coastline and coastal land subsidence disturbance of the fresh water lens due to a pressure wave and salinization viza viz flooding of creeks and fractures ramanamurthy et al 2012 cgwb 2010a cho et al 2008 velmurugan et al 2006 the tidal creeks accentuated the seawater intrusion by acting the pathway for intrusion and fresh creeks were formed by either diversion of older creeks inland or pristine creeks formed in the areas of coseismic subsidence malik et al 2007 the freshly formed deep seated fractures and crustal deformation actually submerged the shallow freshwater aquifers and dropped the groundwater levels in these islands which spasmodically caused freshwater cessation tsunami wave trains and related sedimentation on agricultural fields or in the vicinity of coasts in shallow depressions behind beach ridges swales seaward of the coastal lagoons beaches and low lying depositional sites badly contaminated the coastal aquifers of south andaman for prolonged period rajendran et al 2008 earnest et al 2005 as a result marshy or salt tolerant plants has mantled and colonized the land surface or earlier agricultural fields and has developed 10 cm of peat layer 18 years after sedimentation the tsunami run up level at different places in south andaman and maximum distance of inundation inland is shown in table 5 post tsunami impacts on hydrogeological and morphodynamic changes such as the tilting of these islands and increased seawater intrusion by landward shift of the coastline disturbance of the fresh water lens due to a pressure waves still trigger risks to the island environment due to ingression of seawater and change of land use pattern the eastern coastline of the south andaman comprises of rocky cliffs ophiolite suite and gently sloping western consists of stratified andaman flysch group pal et al 2003 allen et al 2007 malik et al 2007 therefore hydrogeological framework of coastal aquifers are greatly influenced by the geological setting physiography complex topography sea level fluctuation aquifer types and their hydraulic condition 6 conclusion in the present study an integrated geospatial geophysical and hydro chemical approach reveals the seawater ingress problem at several places viz chouldari sippyghat garacharma ograbraj mithakhari north wandoor tirur etc the present study using integrated techniques provided information on the horizontal and vertical variability of various lithological formations and their spatial susceptibility to salt water intrusion the accuracy and precision of geophysical results were validated with hydrochemical results for confirming the sea water intrusion the coastal aquifers of south andaman island witness s high risk of contamination owing to land level changes and raking lulc changes post 2004 earthquake the integrated geophysical and hydrochemical sampling results have indicated that the sedimentary formation of andaman flysch and mithakhari group are more susceptible to seawater influence and related problems than ophiolite formation the future prospect of ground water is crucial for the andaman islands since the island has very limited options for the development of the water resource and it encompasses the vulnerability of ground water systems over 90 population of these islands depend on the groundwater which is the only source of freshwater available for use in these islands the seawater ingress was not a major problem until 2004 earthquake in these islands and currently is a serious concern the coastal aquifers are under high risk of rapid contamination owing to demand deficit for growing population and multi source contamination can escalate the vulnerability to the intensive exploitation with the lack of rational management therefore a comprehensive coastal aquifer management regimen with short term to long term latent intuitive analytical attune regimen is warranted to rehabilitate the coastal aquifers of south andaman island from seawater ingress

11750,seawater ingress is a widespread environmental issue posing threat to the fresh groundwater reserves of the coastal aquifers of andaman and nicobar islands ani particularly after the great indian ocean tsunami 2004 and the comprehensive investigations of seawater ingress in this region are relatively uncommon in this context the spatial distribution and vertical movement of seawater ingress in the coastal and catchment areas were mapped using geo spatial techniques and the extensive geoelectrical resistivity surveys 96 vertical electric soundings ves and profiling along and across the identified and affected coastlines the geoelectrical surveys unravels very low resistivity formations 10 ω m at varying depths interpreted as the lateral and vertical intrusion of seawater the hydro chemical and other physical analyses of groundwater samples reveal critical concentrations of the different major elements and other physical parameters like tds ph as well the ec above its permissible limit for drinking water standards the integrated approach allows to delineate the site specific hydrogeological setting including the saline fresh aquifer geometry transition zone and stratigraphic geomorphological reconstruction of coastal aquifers further various assessment parameters including very low formation resistivity surface manifestation of salt tolerant plants high chloride concentration low formation factor and high ionic strength were employed to infer the various levels of contamination the present study show that impact of seawater intrusion is intense in sedimentary formations than ophiolite suite and needs site specific mitigation measure to prevent further deterioration of aquifer health graphical abstract image 1 keywords south andaman fresh and saline aquifers seawater intrusion groundwater chemistry resistivity survey 1 introduction the contamination of the groundwater resources due to seawater intrusion is an important environmental problem in the coastal environments werner and gallagher 2006 seawater intrusion generally takes place when fresh water is displaced or replaced by saline water in an aquifer system todd and mays 2005 this phenomena has manifold causes both natural and anthropogenic like excessive withdrawal of groundwater tidal and estuarine activity gentle coastal hydraulic gradients long term sea level fluctuations tsunami and local geomorphological settings etc choudhury et al 2001 however seawater intrusion induced by catastrophic natural events like storm surges and tsunamis not only contaminate the fresh groundwater reserves in the coastal areas but also sculptures the coastal morphodynamics like permanent land level changes the sunda andaman earthquake of 2004 9 1 mw related to devastating tsunami pummeled the coastal zones of the se asia and caused significant ground deformation in coastal regions of andaman and nicobar islands ani malik et al 2007 2015 subarya et al 2006 bhat et al 2018 the coastal subsidence and permanent land deformation associated with the 2004 earthquake invariably contaminated the freshwater reserves and severely affected the groundwater regimes in the south andaman island the south andaman islands are the southernmost islands of andaman group of islands located in the northern segment of the sunda andaman subduction zone the western coastline is marked by rocky cliffs whereas the eastern coastline has a gentle slope malik et al 2007 the majority of the population in ani depends solely on groundwater resource for domestic industrial and agricultural use and in near future threats to the intensive exploitation to meet the demand deficit can greatly impact the availability and quality of groundwater in this region therefore characterizing and assessing the groundwater quality on temporal trends influenced by escalating groundwater extraction holds paramount significance towards sustainable managing of groundwater reserves bhagat et al 2021 qian et al 2020 chen et al 2016 a and b the effective frugality and management of this precious resource is relevant and crucial for public health and environmental concerns chen et al 2016a b zhang et al 2019 2020a 2020b therefore it is imperative for groundwater monitoring and its quality to conduct systematic and scientific investigations for current and future management of this tedious groundwater issue geoelectrical resistivity techniques have been meticulously used over the past several decades in coastal settings to locate the fresh salt water interface groundwater potential zones and lithostatigraphy influenced by seawater ingress manivannan and lakshman 2019 goebel et al 2017 maury and balaji 2015 bahuriddin et al 2011 son 2011 barker and worthington 1980 resistivity surveys in fact have also been extensively used in varied coastal environments and hydrogeological regimes due to notable disparity between fresh and saline water formations frohlich 1974 nowroozistephen and henderson 1999 maury and balaji 2014 therefore in the present study an integrated technique consisting of resistivity profiling and resistivity sounding combined with hydro chemical analysis of groundwater samples were employed for precise interpretation of seawater ingress and to ascertain the efficiency in groundwater and saline contaminations studies to determine the contrasting hydro geological settings of ani region fig 1 the present study substantiates the synergistic approach towards application of integrated techniques for the sustainable development and management of groundwater resources of these islands 2 geomorphology geology and hydrogeology 2 1 geomorphology south andaman island has a diverse and complex physiography comprising of intermontanne narrow linear valleys bounded by thrust faults gradually sloping to stiff coastal tracts pediments swamps n s compressional mounds and fault slices etc with landforms largely trending in n s direction bhat et al 2019 the eastern segment of south andaman is expressed by linear and sub parallel fold surfaces terrace surfaces creeks older thrust displacement and is more elevated with older lithologies fig 1 b the central and western part of south andaman is dominated by emergent thrust systems in a step like topography with parallel scarps linear ridges and young fold surfaces bounded by narrow and linear thrust basins and structurally forming a duplex structure bhat et al 2020 structurally controlled geomorphology drainage pattern and aquifer system along major concomitant faults resulted in the evolution distribution and occurrence of groundwater of the island bhat 2016 major dynamic and associated interlinked fractures strike nne ssw to n s directions correspond to the strike trend of concomitant faults such as carbyn thrust in the east and jarawa thrust in the west bhat et al 2018 2020 2 1 1 geology andaman and nicobar islands ani represent northern part of arcuate mélange of subduction accretion complexes of the sunda andaman subduction zone geologically ani consists of the major three main rock types 1 ophiolite suite cretaceous age andaman flysch oligocene and mithakhari group eocene fig 2 pal et al 2003 the ophiolite group encompasses tholeitic basalt as pillowed lavas felsic rocks mainly plagiogranites layered ultramafic and mafic cumulates serpentinites tectonites etc allen et al 2007 pal et al 2003 the eastern and central segment of south andaman island constitute the ophiolite group rocks and forms the eastern coastline 40 km in length from carbyn cove to rutland island bhat et al 2019 the andaman flysch group consists thick sedimentary pile 3 km thick inter bedded sequence of sandstone and shale rocks representing silicilastic turbidites pal et al 2003 karunakaran et al 1968 deposited on a submarine fan with pene contemporaneous deformation structures of oligocene to late eocene age the western coastline of south andaman is entirely taken up by andaman flysch group from south to north of andaman islands whereas the mithakhari group consists of sandstone shale and conglomerate and represents pelagic trench sediments and are of early to middle eocene age having a thickness approximately 1 4 km ray 1982 mithakhari group represents the western coastline of south andaman from upper and northern part of the carbyn creek while as southern part of the creek is dominated by ophiolite suite that marks the thrust fault contact between the ophiolite suite and mithakhari group bhat et al 2019 2020 2 2 hydro geological setup several hydro geological investigations were carried out in the south andaman islands in reception to the land level changes and related changes in hydrological settings associated with catastrophic sunda andaman earthquake mw 9 1 2004 e g cgwb 2010a kumar and riyazuddin 2008 singh et al 2005 generally two types of aquifer settings exist in the south andaman island namely crystalline aquifers ophiolite suite and stratified aquifers andaman flysch and mithakhari group maury and balaji 2015 from the tectonic and structural perspective ophiolite rocks are highly deformed fractured faulted and folded due to plate boundary setting and presence of several active faults thrusts in the south andaman like bathubasti fault bhat et al 2020 carbyn thrust bhat et al 2019 joggers park fault bhat et al 2018 and jarawa thrust fault bhat et al 2020 tectono geomorphically these rocks are manifested as linear structural hills dismembered compressional ridges separated by linear fault bound basins thrust basins that are spasmodically in filled with sediments up to 60 meter depth deposited from uplands and form the crystalline aquifer setting the andaman flysch and mithakhari group forms sedimentary aquifer formations with varying depth of 10 70 m below ground level bgl actually complex and occurs in narrow basins and at topographic breaks adjacent to structural hills the productive groundwater zones in ophiolite and sedimentary formations are strongly influenced by fracture density secondary porosity and permeability hydraulic property and overburden thickness the sedimentary aquifers are constrained within 60 m below ground level bgl in sandstone and shale formations compared to the crystalline aquifers in the ophiolite suite that are delimited within 53 m bgl cgwb 2010a the inter bedded sequence of sandstone and shale formations of andaman flysch and sandstone conglomerate and shale formations of mithakhari group have been classified as moderate to good aquifers but at depth the sedimentary aquifers are adversely affected by the problem of seawater intrusion in many areas balakrishna et al 2014 cgwb 2010a the productive aquifers in the entire ani occur within 60 m bgl in fractured volcanic and 30 m bgl in valley fill deposits with discharge varying from 10 to 45 m3 hr the igneous rocks yield moderate to good and up to 60 m depth potential fractures were noticed the yield range of the boreholes in these formations were found to vary from 10 000 to 25 000 litres h cgwb 2013 the transmissivity t and storage co efficient s of borewells drilled in fractured volcanics at calicut and beadnabad of south andaman are 112 3 m2 day and 211 1 m2 day respectively and 9 65 10 4 and 6 19 10 4 respectively the igneous rocks yield moderate to good up to 60 m depth potential fractures were noticed the yield range of the boreholes in these formations were found to vary from 10 000 to 25 000 litres h the water table depth in south andaman measured in hydrograph stations gradually varies seasonally from 2 to 3 m mbgl and varies with the topography cgwb 2013 kar 2019 seasonal fluctuation of water level in intermontanne valleys before rainy season varies from 0 6 3 66 mbgl and post rainy season 0 47 2 69 mbgl kar 2019 however fluctuation is much higher in higher topography and hill slopes that varies from 3 1 7 5 before monsoon and 0 9 5 9 mbgl post monsoon season kar 2019 the sedimentary aquifers along the west coast occurs 3 70 m mbgl has a discharge rate of 10 45 m3 h whereas ophiolite aquifers are more productive with a discharge rate of 45 72 m3 h cgwb 2013 the beach sand 3 9 m thick coral debris and alluvium in the piedmonts basins and foothills represent the porous formations and the moderately filled slope colluvium deposits in the constrict basins that forms the water table aquifers in ophiolite formations along the east coast auto flowing artesian conditions exists which was affected by the 2004 earthquake cgwb 2013 the water table aquifer in sedimentary formations also experienced significant changes post 2004 earthquake however at lower topography the aquifers have shown rise and not strained through pumping cgwb 2013 the rainfall is received through southwest sw and northeast ne monsoons spans for the period from may to december average annual rainfall in these islands is about 3000 mm while the normal annual rainfall at port blair is 3180 mm the islands in south andaman district enjoy tropical humid climate because of their location in the equatorial zone surrounded by the andaman sea the islands have only two seasons viz rainy season and summer season winter is virtually absent the mean relative humidity is 79 the mean maximum temperature is 30 2 c and means minimum temperature is 23 8 c the relative humidity varies from 79 to 89 and wind speed varies from 7 km h to 10 km h the maximum and minimum temperatures in the islands fluctuate between 27 to 330 c and 21 to 250 c daily evaporation rate in the island is fairly high which cumulatively ranges from 1500 to 1800 mm per annum cgwb 2013 3 methodology 3 1 hydro geochemistry in order to exactitude interpretation of geoelectrical data and to further deduce the local hydrogeological setting along with the temporal and spatial salinization processes a hydro chemical analysis of water samples collected in 2018 from 50 sites of bore wells tube wells and dug wells 8 10 m deep during summer season in some bore wells samples were collected at deeper level 10 m groundwater samples were taken in close vicinity of ves stations for multi parameter probe for concentrations of major element of ca2 k mg2 na hco 3 cl no3 so4 2 and in situ parameters of tds ec and ph the hydro chemical results were depicted through trilinear diagram generated using rockwork tool version 17 portable gps garmin was used to note the geographic coordinates of sample locations supplementary table 1 1 polyethylene bottles of 1 l capacity were used to collect water sample by running them running full to avoid presence of air as a precautionary measure two samples for each location were collected all samples were carried in cartons to avoid sunlight contact hno3 was added to the samples to preserve any precipitation of heavy metals the physico chemical characteristics of water were determined in accordance with the standards methods of apha 1995 and quality determined in reference to the guidelines of who 2006 2011 and bis 2012 the ph was measured using ph meter tds mg l calculated using digital conductivity meter lt 51 and ec measured as μs cm using conductivity meter to determine the concentration of ca and mg edta titrimetric analysis was used likewise chloride was estimated by standard agno3 titration method na and k were estimated using flame photometry sulphate was analyzed by colorimetric turbid metric method using uv vis spectrophotometer bicarbonate ion concentration was determined using acid titration method the groundwater was classed based classifications given by davis et al 1966 based on tds and stuyfzand 1989 based on chloride indicate groundwater suitability for drinking purpose table 2 3 2 geophysical methods in order to map the lateral and vertical intrusion of seawater into the freshwater formations ninety six vertical electrical sounding ves surveys were carried out in a systematic way at 20 identified locations spread along and across the east and west coastlines using the aquameter crm 500 instrument pune make the site selection was given discretion taking several factors into consideration such as accessibility space available topography dryness highly vegetated and were preliminary mapped on google earth imagery and satellite data consequently several places were therefore targeted like tidal creeks recent tsunami plains that were earlier agricultural fields adjacent plains close to shorelines tidal influence and near the vicinity of residential areas covering all the affected areas the areas where surficial expression of seawater intrusion were not visible such as terrace surfaces abandoned abrasion ramps paddy fields coconut and beetle nut orchards etc were also accounted for the survey figs 1 and 2 subsequently a structured ves profiling 32 was performed across the identified coasts of south andaman the ves profiling across the west coast consists of 39 ves soundings whereas ves profiling across the east coast encompasses 57 ves soundings respectively supplementary table 2 1 to outstretch the maximum depth for deeper investigations we used 5 electrode schlumberger electrode configuration sec that was placed laterally with different electrode separations ab ranging from 100 to 300 m and the potential electrode separation mn of 1 4 m then the measured apparent resistivity pa was plotted in the ordinate axis y and half current electrode separations ab 2 in the abscissa x axis in double log graph that resulted in resistivity curves the resistivity curves were subsequently interpreted by using the master and auxiliary curve and pcm technique of orellana and mooney 1967 further the measured apparent resistivity was fed into the ip2win resistivity software for computer interpretation of resistivity curves the resistivity curves were interpreted by both the methods in order to integrate the results and arrive at an accurate figure which reduces the error and increases the accuracy of interpretation inim et al 2020 goebel et al 2017 to characterize the subsurface depth and resistivity contrast horizontally and vertically pseudo sections were generated by combining multiple ves and consequently from the pseudo sections low resistivity and high resistivity zones were mapped 4 results and interpretation 4 1 general hydrochemistry in order to evaluate groundwater quality and assess the seawater intrusion various physico chemical indices of the groundwater samples of south andaman island have been studied table 1 depicts the results with fig 3 depicting their spatial distribution the results were examined for rating groundwater chemical characteristics in accordance with the who 2006 2011as well the bis 2012 guidelines results reveal that tds ranges between 121 6 and 23027 2 mg l with average concentration of 2138 84 mg l that stands very high in respect of its permissible limit of 1000 mg l table 2 the permissible value of tds is 1000 mg l but should be below 500 mg l above which it may cause gastrointestinal irritation cgwb 2010b moreover the high content of dissolved solids reduces its use for different purposes maiti 2004 nearly 52 samples show tds concentration above its permissible limit 1000 mg l whereas four locations shows tds concentrations in the range of 4000 23000 at ograbaraj 6 port mout 1 mithakhari 6 and ograbaraj 3 therefore the groundwater is contaminated and unfit for drinking and irrigation use in these as areas as per the classification davis et al 1966 based on tds the results further show that ec values ranged between 190 and 35 980 μs cm with an average of 3341 93 μs cm which is above its permissible limit of 1500 μs cm table 3 the ec of groundwater depicts dissolved salts prasanth et al 2012 and is related to purity of water murugesan et al 2006 the ph values of the samples collected from different localities varied between 5 83 and 8 73 around seventy eight percent samples reveal ph in the range of 6 5 7 5 as per the bis 2012 the ph must not exceed 6 5 to 8 5 and exceeding this range will cause water to affect the mucous membrane and or water supply system cgwb 2010b as per the 2012 guidelines of bureau of indian standards bis from drinking water quality point of view 200 mg l and 400 mg l respectively are the standard and permissible limits of sulphate the presence of sulphate above the permissible limit leads to gastro intestinal discomfort if sodium or magnesium are present cgwb 2010b the sulphate concentration in the groundwater samples of the study area varies from 6 mg l to 2825 mg l as for chloride concentration is concerned its standard value is 250 mg l and permissible limit is 1000 mg l table 4 concentration above the permissible limit does affect the taste corrosion and palatability cgwb 2010b who 2011 it also serves as an indicator of pollution by sewage saxena and sharma 2017 the study shows cl content in ninety eight percent samples exceeds the standard limit 64 samples exceed the 1000 mg l concentrations chloride concentration above 300 mg l are good indicators of seawater ingress as per the stufyzand chloride classification of 1989 the groundwater of the south andaman is brackish salt type 62 of the samples brackish 24 of the samples and to fresh brackish type 14 samples table 3 as per bis 2012 the standard value for bicarbonate is 300 mg l and permissible value is 350 mg l the results reveal that bicarbonate ranges between 95 and 1870 mg l with an average value of value of 329 7 and 36 percent samples show hco3 concentration above the permissible limit as per the who guideline 2011 the standard value of no3 in drinking water is 50 mg l around 86 percent samples detected the concentration within the standard limit the concentration of calcium in different localities of study area shows the range between 8 mg l to 915 mg l a total of 24 samples show ca2 above the permissible limit the standard value for ca is 75 mg l and permissible limit is 200 mg l its presence leads to the encrustations in water supply structure cgwb 2010b calcium in groundwater is mainly due to carbonate minerals the magnesium level ranges between 7 mg l to 550 mg l the standard limit for magnesium in drinking water is 30 mg l and permissible limit is 50 mg l the average magnesium concentration of 102 73 mg l is well above the standard limit of 30 mg l locations showing concentration above permissible limit make the 58 of the samples magnesium presence can be reasonably toxic and is also responsible for hardness sodium concentrations show range between 111 mg l to 416 77 mg l however it typically is found less than 20 mg l who 2011 the average sodium concentrations detected is 243 47 mg l although not of the immediate health concern but the presence above 200 mg l does give an unpalatable taste who 2011 the study shows that the lowest concentration of 95mgl l is detected and that 86 samples show concentration above 200 mg l similarly the potassium ranges between 4 5 mg l to 560 mg potassium is found typically less than 10 mg l in groundwater even though in susceptible individuals its presence at times causes health effects makes indispensable element in humans its less intake can also lead to adverse health effects who 2011 ninety four percent samples show potassium concentration above 10 mg l the distribution of hydro hydro chemical facies of the groundwater samples are graphically represented through piper trilinear diagram fig 3 the piper trilinear diagram has been used by several researchers to understand the chemical composition of groundwater in various hydrogeological settings e g senthilkumar et al 2017 najib et al 2017 in the piper diagram multivariate values of cations mg2 ca2 na k anions so4 2 cl and alkali hco 3 are plotted in aggregation the results reveal that na cl type is the most predominant type of hydro chemical facies followed by mg2 ca2 type and whereas so4 2 cl is the least dominant type the general trend of water facies from the piper diagram provides the clear evidence of saltwater intrusion in the groundwater of the coastal areas of south andaman island 4 2 apparent resistivity at the south andaman island along east and west coast a total of 96 ves soundings was obtained at 2 m spacing ab 2 to map the spatial variations of apparent resistivity of different layers based on subsurface lithology and physical characteristics the true resistivity of the subterranean stratigraphy supplementary table 1 1 obtained from ves data was systematically corroborated and correlated with available borehole data of the area fig 6 for e g maury and balaji 2014 which helped in a precise interpretation of the subsurface formations the eastern coast of south andaman is dominated by h type curves p1 p2 p3 whereas the west coast of south andaman exhibits qh type p1 p2 p3 p4 fig 4 however the east coast shows significant variations in apparent resistivity with depth that ranges from 383 76 ω m to very low 2 035 ω m figs 1 and 4 comparatively at carbyn cove along the east coast the average apparent resistivity at 60 70 m depth varies around 208 90 ω m at mithakhari the apparent resistivity rises 383 76 ω m at 40 50 m depth and at ograbraj apparent resistivity varies 187 996 ω m at 30 40 m depth and can plausibly be attributed to massive sandstone formation bed rock similarly at sippyghat the apparent resistivity varies 174 145 at 60 70 m depth is attributed to fine and interbedded sandstone of andaman flysch group respectively supplementary table 1 1 the moderate values of apparent resistivity at sippyghat 26 138 ω m at 50 m depth and at carbyns cove 30 242 ω m at 20 m depth is attributed to presence of very fine and dry clayey zones maury and balaji 2014 a very low apparent resistivity at places like chouldari 2 035 ω m at 40 m depth garacharma 7 828 ω m at 34 m depth ograbraj 4 098 ω m at 68 m depth and at mithakhari 4 974 ω m at 70 m depth is interpreted and corresponds to saline water intrusion on freshwater formations in low lying coastal areas see fig 7 the west coast of south andaman presents more complex picture of apparent resistivity with depth that varies from 320 123 ω m observed at manjery at 40 50 m depth linedera 116 98 ω m at 30 40 m depth new wandoor 89 10 ω m at 30 40 m depth and at badmash pahad 74 847 ω m at 40 50 m depth shows existence of bedrock formations at various depths the moderate values of apparent resistivity observed at colinpur 33 39 ω m at 30 m depth temple moyo 44 54 ω m at 47 m depth loha barack 23 04 ω m at 50 60 m depth conforms to stiff clay zones maury and balaji 2014 and fractured bedrock formations a very low resistivity value observed at badabalu 3 42 ω m at 6 10 m depth tirur 5 24 ω m at 27 m depth north wandoor 4 395 ω m at 17 m depth and at bimlatan 7 198 ω m at 20 m depth is attributed to clay with fine sand bearing brackish saline water intrusion 4 3 analysis of ves curves the apparent resistivity curves prepared from the resistivity data showed two major types of curves as h type and hq type along the eastern and western coasts of south andaman respectively the h type curve with the layer resistivity relationship of p1 p2 p3 is observed from north to southern segment of the eastern coast especially at chouldari saithankhari mithakhari sippyghat ograbraj and at carbyns cove fig 4 a the resistivity of the top layer generally ranges from 1 31 to 55 7 ω m and is lower in clay formations and high in sandy silt to sandy formations with 1 3 03 m depth the second layer resistivity ranges from 1 to 34 ω m with varying thickness of 1 4 86 m the high resistivity of second layer suggests of thick sheets of sand and tsunami deposits and related sedimentation in coastal areas whereas the low resistivity layers corresponds to peat and silty clay formation below the tsunami deposit the third layer resistivity values ranges from 0 38 194 ω m with varying thickness of 1 38 13 6 m the low resistivity values are attributed to thick clay formation in topographic depressions and high values suggests weathered formations the fourth layer has resistivity that ranges from 0 104 474 ω m with varying thickness of 1 24 16 5 m the low resistivity at this depth is attributed to saline water intrusion whereas the higher resistivity likely corresponds to shale and fractured sandstone formations the fifth layer and sixth layer resistivity ranges from 0 058 999 ω m to 0 0052 1192 ω m with varying thickness of 2 59 55 m the low resistivity is attributed to seawater intrusion at depth and high resistivity values corresponds to massive sandstone

from 0 38 194 ω m with thickness of 0 87 13 6 m the low and high resistivity corresponds to clay formation and sandy clay with coarse rock fragments the resistivity of the fourth layer ranges from 0 215 474 ω m and thickness of 1 24 16 5 m the low resistivity indicates the salinity impact whereas the high resistivity corresponds to presence of corals and fractured bedrock the resistivity of the fifth and sixth layer ranges from 0 058 999 ω m to 0 0052 1192 ω m with thickness of 0 714 55 3 m the low resistivity at this depth is attributed to saline water intrusion and high resistivity suggests to bedrock formation 4 4 ves profiling and resistivity pseudo section across the east and west coasts of south andaman ves profiling was performed by multiple ves sounding profiling

intrusion from top to bottom which is substantiated by very low resistivity of less than 10 ω m the chouldari area where resistivity profiling has been performed was agricultural paddy field before 2004 great earthquake and tsunami and experienced a coseismic subsidence of 1 m malik et al 2007 which resulted contamination of the aquifer system by direct infiltration of ponded seawater due to breaching of natural barrier by tsunami waves and accumulation of seawater and sediments on the field has affected the hydrogeological settings to a paramount extent the tsunami wave trains and related sedimentation of very fine sand affected the paddy field and hence a thin 10 cm peat layer and salt tolerant plants have colonized the agricultural area the accumulation of ponded seawater salts led to the conversion of acidic soils to saline acidic soil velmurugan et al 2006 4 6 profile k kʹ tirur profile k kʹ is a ne sw trending profile based on the results of ves 10 11 and 12 in the

infiltration increased seawater intrusion by landward shift of the coastline due to breaching of natural barrier by seawater ingress the resistivity of the top layer is attributed to silty sand and tsunami sand which were observed during profiling where resistivity of the second layer corresponds to peat and clay formation below the tsunami sand the resistivity of the third layer is very low 10

shallow bedrock in the area maury and balaji 2014 the fourth layer is interpreted as saline ingress towards freshwater formation owing very low resistivity of 2 38 ω m at this depth 5 discussion the integrated geospatial geoelectrical and hydro chemical analyses were used to assess the status of saltwater intrusion in the study area the physico chemical study of groundwater samples reveals the higher concentration of all parameters particularly cl so4 hco 3 tds and ec with reference to their standard values table 4 the na cl mg2 ca2 hco 3 co3 2 groundwaterfacies was observed the analysis of trilinear piper diagram corroborates the resistivity analysis shows most of the well sites in the upper corner of the diamond indicating the seawater intrusion of the groundwater samples qualitatively the groundwater of the study area varies from neutral to alkaline type the thickness of weathered formation in the study area varies in depth from 3 to 6 mbgl cgwb 2013 and the eastern coastline is occupied by ophiolite suite by shallow weathering consists of mafic and ultramafic rocks the ophiolite formations are characterize up to a depth of 1 12 m cgwb 2013 as substantiated by very low resistivity of 10 ω m in and around the sites of garacharma sippyghat ograbraj mithakhari north wandoor chouldari tirur and bimlatan the ves profiling data reveals lateral intrusion have impacted to the maximum extent from the coast in these areas the resistivity pseudo sections derived from ves profiling further illustrates the seawater intrusion from 5 m to 45 m depth along the east and west coast fresh saline water interface geometry saline aquifers and bedrock depth the seawater ingress at shallow depths at various examined sites are greatly influenced by 2004 coseismic subsidence and perpetually impacted the groundwater regimes by persistent tidal activity and breaching the natural barriers that facilitated by numerous interlinked extension and shear fractures singh et al 2005 malik et al 2007 in addition to the geomorphic changes of low lying coastal areas the catastrophic tsunami caused extensive contamination and salinization of coastal aquifers in various ways like direct infiltration and inundation of land surface seawater filled dug wells and ponds increased seawater intrusion due to landward shift of the coastline and coastal land subsidence disturbance of the fresh water lens due to a pressure wave and salinization viza viz flooding of creeks and fractures ramanamurthy et al 2012 cgwb 2010a cho et al 2008 velmurugan et al 2006 the tidal creeks accentuated the seawater intrusion by acting the pathway for intrusion and fresh creeks were formed by either diversion of older creeks inland or pristine creeks formed in the areas of coseismic subsidence malik et al 2007 the freshly formed deep seated fractures and crustal deformation actually submerged the shallow freshwater aquifers and dropped the groundwater levels in these islands which spasmodically caused freshwater cessation tsunami wave trains and related sedimentation on agricultural fields or in the vicinity of coasts in shallow depressions behind beach ridges swales seaward of the coastal lagoons beaches and low lying depositional sites badly contaminated the coastal aquifers of south andaman for prolonged period rajendran et al 2008 earnest et al 2005 as a result marshy or salt tolerant plants has mantled and colonized the land surface or earlier agricultural fields and has developed 10 cm of peat layer 18 years after sedimentation the tsunami run up level at different places in south andaman and maximum distance of inundation inland is shown in table 5 post tsunami impacts on hydrogeological and morphodynamic changes such as the tilting of these islands and increased seawater intrusion by landward shift of the coastline disturbance of the fresh water lens due to a pressure waves still trigger risks to the island environment due to ingression of seawater and change of land use pattern the eastern coastline of the south andaman comprises of rocky cliffs ophiolite suite and gently sloping western consists of stratified andaman flysch group pal et al 2003 allen et al 2007 malik et al 2007 therefore hydrogeological framework of coastal aquifers are greatly influenced by the geological setting physiography complex topography sea level fluctuation aquifer types and their hydraulic condition 6 conclusion in the present study an integrated geospatial geophysical and hydro chemical approach reveals the seawater ingress problem at several places viz chouldari sippyghat garacharma ograbraj mithakhari north wandoor tirur etc the present study using integrated techniques provided information on the horizontal and vertical variability of various lithological formations and their spatial susceptibility to salt water intrusion the accuracy and precision of geophysical results were validated with hydrochemical results for confirming the sea water intrusion the coastal aquifers of south andaman island witness s high risk of contamination owing to land level changes and raking lulc changes post 2004 earthquake the integrated geophysical and hydrochemical sampling results have indicated that the sedimentary formation of andaman flysch and mithakhari group are more susceptible to seawater influence and related problems than ophiolite formation the future prospect of ground water is crucial for the andaman islands since the island has very limited options for the development of the water resource and it encompasses the vulnerability of ground water systems over 90 population of these islands depend on the groundwater which is the only source of freshwater available for use in these islands the seawater ingress was not a major problem until 2004 earthquake in these islands and currently is a serious concern the coastal aquifers are under high risk of rapid contamination owing to demand deficit for growing population and multi source contamination can escalate the vulnerability to the intensive exploitation with the lack of rational management therefore a comprehensive coastal aquifer management regimen with short term to long term latent intuitive analytical attune regimen is warranted to rehabilitate the coastal aquifers of south andaman island from seawater ingress

11751,the zenaga inlier located in an arid area in southeastern morocco is mostly characterized by igneous and metamorphic fractured rocks the surface water is quasi absent and local populations 95 rural are entirely dependent on groundwater resources for drinking and irrigation purposes to evaluate the main factors controlling the origin and salinization of groundwater resources we have investigated the chemical and stable isotope compositions of 23 groundwater samples in addition water quality assessment parameters including sodium absorption ratio sar and water quality index wqi were also calculated the results show that the majority of wells and boreholes are characterized calcium bicarbonate water type 78 of samples with the following ionic sequence ca2 na mg2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 for cations and anions respectively a significant enrichment on major ions is steadily rising with depth as the water type changes toward calcium chloride the interpretation of hydrochemical data suggests that the silicate weathering cation exchange and evaporites dissolution are responsible for the groundwater chemistry the majority of water samples are good to permissible for irrigation and poor to good for drinking purposes the mineral salts found at greater depths degrade groundwater quality in some areas nitrate contents imply anthropogenic contamination derived especially from traditional septic tanks stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h reveal a distinction between the shallow aquifer and deep circulations the uncommon depleted isotope signature found in deep circulations was associated with cold altitudes recharge whereas the heaviest groundwater observed in shallow aquifer was interpreted as the contribution of surface water from taghdout dam the anti atlas mountains and siroua massif s high altitude served as a source of recharge the mixing at considerable depths and along the groundwater path appears to decrease the isotopic variability in the shallow and deep groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogeochemistry zenaga inlier arid environment water quality assessment stable isotopes 1 introduction the importance of groundwater increases mainly in arid and semi arid areas where surface water resources are often scarce limited or even absent hssaisoune et al 2020 in morocco the government considers groundwater as a strategic water resource for the socio economic development for many rural areas taheripour et al 2020 the exploitable groundwater represents only one third of the renewable water resources and only 10 of shallow groundwater is classed in good quality range fao 2009 additionally the succession of dry seasons and the increasing demand for water have severely diminished the groundwater level for many aquifers about 2 m per year bouchaou et al 2011 meddi and eslamian 2021 this is expected to enter the country in a situation of extreme water stress in the future decades world bank 2021 in such conditions the groundwater governance will be the only fundamental way to better regulate competitive water uses between sectors the drâa river basin drb is one of the largest basins of morocco which extends from the central high atlas mountains to the southward low pre saharan desert in the south western of the country given the aridity of the climate and its hydrogeological consequences this large area is considered as one of the ten driest watersheds in the world and contains only 7 of the groundwater resources of the country agoussine et al 2004 revenga et al 1998 moreover the succession of dry periods the overexploitation of groundwater and the salinization problem have a major impact on the quality and quantity of groundwater bouchaou et al 2008 heidecke and kuhn 2007 hssaisoune et al 2020 klose 2008 the zenaga plain being part of the upstream drb is one of the aspects of this surface water scarcity ait jeddi et al 2021 consequently population activity of this region such as tourism agriculture and especially saffron agriculture cooperatives depend mainly on groundwater availability to ensure economic prosperity the hard rocks aquifer systems in the upper drb is not well known rarely described and almost not monitored cappy 2006 the position of the zenaga plain in the center of the anti atlas mountains reveal that the majority of the study area is occupied by hard metamorphic igneous and calcareous rocks heiβ et al 2018 moreover field observations have shown that the groundwater of these hard rocks aquifers are limited in terms of productivity and show a moderate potential compared to other aquifers maaziz et al 2020 the groundwater in zenaga plain is used through traditional methods such as khettaras system underground tunnels that allow groundwater to flow by gravity or by an increasing number of pumping wells and boreholes often located in alluvium areas and near the valley ait jeddi et al 2021 however in spite of the intermittent regime of the tributaries and their low flow rate they contribute to the recharge of the aquifers especially during flood periods besides a considerable amount of snow and rain from the anti atlas mountains is evident in the recharge process all over the basin area cappy 2006 warner et al 2013 in such a context where the water chemistry and quality as well as the origins of recharge are not properly assessed this study aims to i provide a basic knowledge of the geogenic sources of the chemical composition of the groundwater ii highlight the process responsible for the mineralization of the underlying aquifer system iii assess groundwater quality regarding drinking and irrigation purposes iv identifying the possible groundwater origin and altitude of recharge all by using a hydrochemical and isotopic database and incorporating the particular aspect of the study area 2 study area 2 1 geographical setting located in the southwest of the upstream drb the zenaga plain corresponds to a large plateau of 40 km from the north to the south and 20 25 km from the east to the west where the average altitude is around 1500 m with a surface area of 809 km2 and a flat bottom the study area occupies the central belt of the anti atlas chain trends ne sw behind the high atlas chain 30 30 40 n and 7 10 to 7 30 w fig 1 the dominating climate in the plain is semi arid with a hot summer and cold winter the precipitation is highly variable in terms of frequency duration intensity and is associated with orography a wet season between september and april with rainfall peaks in september and october was recorded however the number of rainy days per year monitored at the assaka station does not exceed a few days where the average annual rain is about 118 mm year fig 2 locally the rivers are called wadi they have an intermittent flow regime and are often flooded during local storms mainly in the late summer and early fall this hydrographic regime is limited to the plain and each river originates at the foot of the cliff the azegumerzi wadi is the main river that drains this part of the anti atlas domain it originates from the southern end of the plain and runs along its eastern edge in a north south direction on the other hand the amagha wadi which drains the western flank of the siroua chain is one of its main tributaries on the contrary it has a west east direction downstream of the taghdout dam these wadis set meet downstream to give rise to the ait douchen wadi however the annual discharges are only 9 million m3 and the specific flow is equal to 6000 m3 km2 year at the assaka station abhsmd 2010 2 2 geological and hydrogeological context the study area is part of precambrian inliers known as the siroua window including the northern edge of the paleoproterozoic west african craton wac known as the zenaga complex or inlier ennih and liégeois 2001 thomas et al 2002 fig 3 a the study area is mostly made up by an older sequence of supracrustal rocks of paleoproterozoic age pi with amphibolite facies schists and migmatites gasquet et al 2008 this assembly is limited to the north by low metamorphic formations of neoproterozoic age pii formed by quartzites and conglomerates named by taghdout subgroup choubert 1963 moreover the mesoproterozoic age represented by quartzite and limestone has been recently identified overlying the taghdout subgroup materials ikenne et al 2017 note finally that the schistose bedrock is crossed by four major igneous plutonic units where the azguemerzi granodiorites occupy 20 of the exposed area thomas et al 2002 fig 3b the evaluation of the structure of aquifer complexes in the drâa basin as in the study area is adjusted on the same and similar geological units klose et al 2008 the continuous alluvial aquifer is mainly stored in quaternary formation presented essentially by alluvium sand and gravels located mainly in the west of the plain and along the main tributaries overlying the precambrian bedrock fig 3c in such a context that accurately replicates the characteristics of an inlier more than a depression with sedimentary filling the thickness of this porous deposits does not exceed a few meters abhsmd 2010 however this shallow aquifer provides enough water for the population through traditional shallow wells digged manually as well as an old technique of mobilization of water named khettara ait jeddi et al 2021 progressively changes in irrigation strategies replace these old techniques giving farmers access to the groundwater resources more easely hydrodynamically field observations have shown a variable permeability and occasionally high but generally the productivity is usually low and does not exceed 6 l s abhsmd 2010 busche 2008 on the other hand the covering weathered mantle derived from the prolonged decomposition of the proterozoic igneous bedrock is widespread in contrast to the first set the groundwater here flows in hard igneous formations with low permeability and hydraulic conductivity klose et al 2008 moreover the presence of fractures in the schistose base can generate deep flows rarely captured by traditional wells known as the deep circulations 3 material and method 3 1 water sampling a groundwater sampling campaign was carried out at 23 sites spread over the study area during the month of may 2020 with respect to the standard sampling procedures iso 1993 these sites include 6 boreholes and 17 wells catching different types of aquifers and areas dedicated mainly to meeting the population s drinking water needs and for irrigation each sample was collected after pumping often for 20 min in such a way the groundwater shows a stabilized temperature additionally three rain samples are added to the isotopic database electrical conductivity accuracy of 0 5 ph accuracy of 0 1 temperature accuracy of 0 2 c and dissolved oxygen of the groundwater samples were measured in the field immediately using a portable multi meter wtw multi 3420 analysis of the water samples was carried out in the applied geology and geo environment laboratory ibn zohr university agadir morocco following the standard methods for the examination of water apha 1989 sulfate and nitrate concentrations were measured using spectrophotometry hco3 mg cl ca parameters by titration na and k concentrations by flame spectrophotometer the uv visible absorption spectrophotometer and the ionic balance was found to be within 10 the total dissolved salts tds were calculated indirectly through electrical conductivity using the relationship given by shainberg and levy 2005 the isotope measurements of δ18o and δ2h were performed by cavity ringdown spectrometer using a picarro l2120 and the analytical uncertainty for δ18o and δ2h are in the order of 0 10 and 1 50 respectively the values are expressed as relative differences d values from vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow in per mill 3 2 methods identifying the geochemical characterization of groundwater was made by

analyses were achieved using the programming language for statistical computing and graphics r with the factominer package and its graphical interface factoshiny the stable isotope composition of the groundwater samples from the zenaga aquifer was plotted in the binary diagram of δ2h δ18o the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl cappy 2006 in thermodynamic equilibrium conditions slope of 8 are plotted on the same diagram these lines are calculated following equation 8 and equation 9 respectively 8 gmwl δd 8 δ 18 o 10 9 lmwl δd 8 δ 18 o 10 60 4 result 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics the hydrogeochemical characteristics of all samples collected in the zenaga plain are summarized in table 1 water temperature and ph fall within the range of 18 23 c and 5 7 to 7 9 respectively ph is close to neutral for the majority of the samples and the lowest values are recorded at deep aquifer levels with a high bicarbonate concentration the specific electric conductivity ec considered as a measure for the total mineralization shows that groundwater of the shallow aquifer systems wells 25 m depth ranges from the low mineralized at elain t23 sample with 448 μs cm to high mineralized at assersa t6 sample with 2370 μs cm with the exception of kourkouda t9 and tiouine t19 groundwater mineralization progressively rises with depth making deep waters readily identifiable by their high salinity however the highest values do not reflect a single aquifer type the statistical analysis of the major ions in the shallow aquifer shows an abundance of ca2 na mg2 k for cations and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 for anions fig 4 this trend slightly changes for the deep circulations with an enrichment in chloride sulfates and magnesium especially for angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 from the data of alkalis na and k and alkaline earths ca2 and mg2 the concentrations of sodium calcium and magnesium ranged from 10 10 to 301 08 mg l 6 46 425 73 mg l and 16 19 266 83 mg l respectively potassium is generally the least abundant major which varies between 1 36 and 13 77 mg l bicarbonate is the most dominant anion for the majority of the samples their values vary between 178 14 and 629 62 mg l chloride and sulfate concentrations ranged from 11 54 to 967 38 mg l and 13 22 706 86 mg l respectively samples with extreme values for both elements are frequently observed in deep samples nitrate concentrations vary between 5 13 and 51 94 mg l except angarf sample t15 from deep circulations all samples don t exceed the maximum admissible in drinking water for nitrate 50 mg l 4 2 groundwater type the examination of the piper diagram shows that the bicarbonate is the most frequent anion always present and predominant for the majority of samples on the other hand a high diversity for calcium sodium and magnesium is observed on the cation diagram as shown in the diamond diagram fig 5 the ca hco3 is the most dominant facies 18 samples where the carbonate hardness exceeds 50 and the alkaline earths exceed alkalis fresh recharge water only angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 from deep circulations show a tendency to ca cl water type the groundwaters undergo a gradual change in chemistry from ca hco3 to ca cl with increasing salinity 4 3 processes of mineralization according to gibbs 1970 three domains affecting groundwater chemistry can be distinguished namely precipitation dominance rock weathering and evaporation dominance as shown in fig 6 the samples span nearly the entire range of na na ca values i e from 0 18 to 0 98 at mid range tds level the same case is not really observed in the cl cl hco3 diagram since the majority of samples having an abundance of bicarbonates globally the majority of water samples are laid in the water rock interaction area with a remarkable tendency towards the evaporation this trend is clearly observed in deep circulations samples with a little change in salinity 4 4 multivariate statistical analysis 4 4 1 principal components analysis pca the extracted factor for the pca was based on the eigenvalue 1 kaiser 1958 which contributes to 77 47 of total variance adopting the classification of liu et al 2003 the terms strong moderate and weak as assigned to factor loadings corresponds to absolute loading values of 0 75 0 75 0 50 and 0 50 0 30 respectively f1 explains 61 65 of the total variance table 2 it shows a strong positive loading on ec mg so4 na ca and cl while k no3 and hco3 have a moderate loading fig 7 a the second component f2 with an eigenvalue of 1 56 and accounting for 15 62 of the cumulative variance shows a weak loading in all variables except so4 and no3 moderate loading the projection of groundwater samples on the factorial plan f1 f2 fig 7b allows to separate the samples according to their degree of mineralization this separation seems to be clear on the f1 axis allowing the differentiation between two large groups groupe a samples from this group are less mineralized with a high ph value and the lowest concentration of hco3 and k nonetheless this group do not reflect a single aquifer type groupe b this group is composed mainly by samples from shallow aquifers collected along the azguemerzi and amagha wadis with a medium mineralization compared to the previous group the second trend observed is on the positive side of the same f1 axis reflects samples with high salinity moreover angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 samples have a tendency to cl ca mg water type 4 4 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hca the dendrogram of individuals clearly separates samples according to their hydrochemical similarity fig 8 the first and second groups are the same distinguished on the factorial plan a and b respectively azguemerzi t15 and angarf t21 samples are classified in a single group as samples reflecting the particularity of deep circulations moreover ouisseslsat t4 and assersa t6 samples are organized in one group although they do not reflect a single aquifer type 4 5 water quality index wqi the wqi values for all groundwater samples were classified according to the five water quality classes sahu and sikdar 2008 the terms excellent good poor very poor and unsuitable for drinking correspond to wqi 50 50 wqi 100 100 wqi 200 200 wqi 300 and wqi 300 respectively incorporating the weight of each chemical parameter table 3 the results show that 47 of the groundwater samples come under the category good among which the majority belongs to shallow aquifers 43 of the samples are poor whereas the assersa t6 sample from the shallow aquifer angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 samples from deep circulations have been registered under the unsuitable for drinking category 4 6 assessment of irrigation water quality the sar values for groundwater samples ranged from 0 32 to 3 23 according to fao 1992 waters with sar values below 10 are considered suitable for irrigation however based on sar classification richards 1954 ouisselsat t4 angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 samples from deep circulations and assersa t6 from shallow aquifer reflect a high salinity trend with appreciable sodium hazard fig 9 a in the ec versus na diagram fig 9b the majority of groundwater samples belong to the water classes of good to permissible range the same samples that were unsuitable for drinking are also of unsuitable quality for irrigation 4 7 stable isotopes stable isotopes values of water molecules show that the δ18o and δ2h in groundwater samples from the zenaga plain ranged from 9 66 to 3 42 and 63 72 to 29 16 respectively table 1 the mean values were 7 79 and 51 69 for δ18o and δ2h respectively fig 10 shows that the samples positions in regard to the gmwl and the lmwl do not represent a single type of aquifer the first distinguishing group is located slightly below gmwl including t1 t3 t7 t6 t9 t14 t21 and t22 samples this group corresponds to groundwater samples collected mainly near the tributaries where taghdout t9 samples is considered as the heaviest sample the remaining samples can be divided into two groups samples aligned or slightly above the gmwl where all are from the shallow aquifer t2 t5 t17 t18 t20 the second group including t4 t8 t16 t19 t10 t12 t23 is plotted above the gmwl and lmwl with a significantly depleted signature more than the previous groups nevertheless a clear difference still exists in the isotopic composition between these samples and local precipitation t25 t26 and t27 on the other hand ouisselsat t4 sample on the extreme left side reflects the most depleted sample with high salinity 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater mineralization the relationship between conductivity and the na cl ratio is inversely proportional i e an increase in ec implies a decrease in the na cl ratio fig 11 a this is confirmed by the gibbs diagram which illustrates the non dominance of the evaporation effect as the main mineralization process for the majority of samples mrazovac et al 2012 and may reflect ion exchange reactions as the dominant process over the evaporation al yacoubi et al 2017 in the same way this chemical evolution can also provide information on other sodium sources such as silicates weathering srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 on the other hand the rising na cl ratio while the ec remains constant for fresh water samples located in the left side suggests that the conductivity mainly depends on other ions such as magnesium and sulfates in the na versus cl diagram the majority of samples follow the halite dissolution line and show a high correlation between na and cl r 0 74 fig 11b the high na cl ratio at low salinities for some of these samples do not support the contribution of meteoric nacl as the only source of sodium sami 1992 in the same way the sodium excess for these samples indicates that halite dissolution in the bedrock or precipitation process are not responsible for sodium leaching with regard to the predominance of bicarbonates in these samples this result seems to be significantly explained by the contribution of silicates weathering which is determined by reaction 10 sarin et al 1989 10 na k mg ca silicate co 2 h 2 o h 4 s i o 4 h c o 3 n a k c o 2 h 2 o m g 2 c a 2 s o l i d p r o d u c t on the other hand the abundance of chloride relative to other ions in angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 samples from deep circulations is likely related to more complex processes besides ions exchanges however the silicate weathering cannot be ruled out because of the high concentration of bicarbonate ions in all samples the relationship between ca2 mg2 and hco 3 so2 4 is used to understand the contribution of carbonates and silicates as shown in fig 11c most samples are located near the 1 1 line suggesting the contribution of carbonates and silicates weathering cerling et al 1989 lakshmanan et al 2003 as a result evaporites dissolution calcite and dolomite dissolution can be a probable source for ca2 and mg2 depending on the terrains crossed by water on the other hand the calcium and magnesium excess in both samples angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 support other processes besides carbonate weathering in the ca2 versus so4 2 diagram the majority of samples do not evolve along the gypsum or anhydrite line fig 11d the groundwater seems to have been first enriched with ca2 from different sources then they undergo an enrichment of so4 2 along the flow path moreover the position of ouisselsat t4 and tilnif aep t22 samples from deep circulations with respect to the 1 2 line supports the contribution of sulfuric acid as the weathering agent das and kaur 2001 the reaction of carbonate with sulfuric acid as a proton source led to a drop in ph and dissolved oxygen observed in these waters which is given by reaction 11 11 caco 3 h 2 so 4 ca 2 2 so 4 2 h 2 co 3 the ca mg ratio can be used to clarify the origin of calcium and magnesium in groundwater katz et al 1998 mayo and loucks 1995 as shown in fig 11f the majority of samples are below or slightly close to the ca mg 1 line reflecting dolomite dissolution whereas samples with ratio between 1 and 2 indicate calcite dissolution on the other hand tizi aep t3 and azguemerzi t21 samples with high ratio greater than 2 support a clear effect of silicate minerals on the groundwater chemistry nitrate is present in small quantities in major igneous rocks therefore no3 concentrations greater than 10 mg l generally reflect the anthropogenic contributions heaton 1986 in no3 versus cl diagram fig 11e two groups are identified samples with high no3 cl values against low cl 60 of samples supporting the contribution of chemical and manure fertilizers used for agriculture activities buvaneshwari et al 2017 some pumping return of groundwater is expected considering the dominance of gravity fed irrigation in this region on the other hand mcquillan 2004 reported that samples with high cl and low no3 cl is mainly related to effluents contribution from septic tanks which is the most frequent mode in this rural area in addition the nitrate and chloride enrichment in angarf t15 sample is related to its proximity to a traditional manure field heap as result the positive loadings of no3 in f2 can be associated with the nitrate contamination however the chloride enrichment process seems to be more complicated for azguemerzi sample t21 from deep circulations the flow of these deep waters through a network of fractures often mineralized supports greater weathering of the mineralization and schists in the aquifer matrix 5 2 cation exchange the position of samples on the ca mg versus so4 hco3 diagram with regard to the 1 1 line fig 11c and the relationship between conductivity and the na cl ratio fig 11a reflect that ions exchange occurring rajmohan and elango 2004 al yacoubi et al 2017 the bei results shows that 52 of samples have a negative base exchange index supporting that the groundwater effectively exchanges ca2 and mg2 ions for the na which can be written using reaction 12 12 2na x ca2 or mg2 2na ca or mg x2 where x reflect the exchanging solid surface martínez and bocanegra 2002 the same result explains the great variation observed mainly in samples located outside the boomerang shape of the gibbs cationic diagram fig 6 the evolution of groundwater chemistry from ca hco3 to na hco3 for ouisselsat t4 timjicht t11 and tilnif aep t22 samples located in the right side of the diagram fig 6 indicates cation exchanges bei 0 this assumption is supported for t22 and t4 samples with low ph and excess in hco3 confirming that waters are slightly acidic on the other hand azguemerzi t21 and angarf t15 located on the right side anion diagram indicate reverse cation exchanges bei 0 these deep circulations samples seem to have a similar geochemical trend plotted on the ca cl water type fig 5 5 3 saturation index si as shown in fig 12 all samples are undersaturated with respect to halite gypsum and anhydrite minerals suggesting that evaporite dissolution is continuously carried out without precipitation across the water flow path on the other hand bousalem t12 sample is the only sample undersaturated regarding aragonite although oversaturation state was observed in a few samples saturation state dominated aragonite for the majority of samples otherwise the thermodynamic potential for dissolution regarding carbonate minerals is observed for deep circulations samples t4 t16 t21 t22 angarf t15 and kourkouda t8 present an exception with si 0 regarding calcite dolomite and aragonite revealing the possibility of precipitation 5 4 deep circulations enrichment a particular confusion is observed on the gibbs diagram fig 6 by assessing the importance of water rock interaction and or evaporation process it means that evaporation or rock weathering process alone is insufficient for explaining the chemical characteristics of groundwater supporting a complex mode of mineralization the same concern has been observed in several studies marandi and shand 2018 and references therein considering that deep weathering involves the chemical alteration of rocks and minerals to depths of tens or even hundreds of meters ollier 1988 the high mineralization is not evident in all deep samples kourkouda t8 and tiouine t19 constitute a perfect example where mineralization is low even compared to the shallow samples this may reflect immobility conditions of deep water known usually as stagnate zones where the weathering process is very slow what does not mean that it ceases entirely moreover the influence of karstic circulations in the kroukouda travertine area fig 3b might explain the low salinity found especially for the kourkouda t8 sample on the one hand the long flow path and the residence time of groundwater can influence the mineralization process this can be clarified by assessing the abundance order of bicarbonates sulfates and chloride hagmaier 1971 anions in groundwater undergo the following sequence of hydrochemical changes from the shallow aquifer to deep circulations samples with high mineralization this chemical evolution can be expressed as below 13 13 hco 3 hco 3 so 4 2 cl so 4 2 cl as a result the majority of samples reflect the contribution of local flow system whereas angarf t15 ouisselsat t4 and azguemerzi t21 samples from deep circulations support an older water under a regional flow system on the other hand a modification in the hydrodynamic processes of the underlying aquifer is expected under an overexploitation context of deep groundwater this can lead to leakage from shallow to deep groundwater circulations increasing major ions wu et al 2015 5 5 origin of recharge 5 5 1 recharge conditions the isotopic content of precipitation represents the current input function of aquifers as shown in the regression line fig 10 the lower slope and deuterium intercept values are 5 6 and 9 2 respectively lower than the ones from the gmwl 8 and 10 respectively provide information on the evaporation effect on rainwater before the infiltration ayadi et al 2018 this isotopic enrichment is well observed in samples located below the gmwl and especially in the taghdout t9 sample the remarkable isotopic enrichment in this sample is probably related to the high evaporation rate of surface water mass from the taghdout dam located upstream from the sampled well this surface water exposed to the open air and under the aridity of the climate creates convenient conditions for the isotopic fractionation of water in the same way the isotopic enrichment in the assersa t6 sample is related to its location near a non waterproof irrigation water storage basin in contrast the isotopic enrichment observed in taourirt t10 and taloust t13 samples simultaneously with low tds may reflect the contribution of rapid infiltration from meteoric water taking into account the small thickness of the unsaturated zone accepting that samples enriched in stable isotopes with respect to the gmwl reflects a clear effect of evaporation of water before infiltration the contribution of irrigation return water with limited water rocks interaction can create the same isotopic contrast with low salinity 5 5 2 recharge process in order to clarify the origin of the humid air masses generating the precipitation in the study area the deuterium excess d value was calculated for each groundwater sample using equation 13 provided by dansgaard 1964 14 d δd 8 δ 18o the variable d has a value of 10 on a global basis however this value can vary locally and regionally due to different dynamic processes clark and fritz 1997 the calculated d values in the study area vary within a range of 1 79 to 13 87 table 4 in the atlas mountains context this significant variability is interpreted as a result of an increased recycling of moisture under the effect of the climate aridity ait brahim et al 2016 this assumption is well supported by d values above 10 for several samples for which the highest value is observed in the ouisselsat t4 sample this observation supports recharge by snow at high altitude jouzel and merlivat 1984 moreover the contribution of local humid air masses under low humid conditions clark and fritz 1997 and the mediterranean humid air masses maliki et al 2000 can lead to the same result on the other hand the d values for the majority of water samples are close to the atlantic deuterium excess of 10 o this can reflect the contribution of oceanic air masses the same assumption is supported also by the position of the samples near to the gmwl and lmwl where a temperature gradient exists a gradient in δ18o and δ2h should be observed clark and fritz 1997 therefore the high altitude recharge would be associated with a relative depletion in δ18o and δ2h stichler and schotterer 2000 the altitude gradient δ18o calculated for the upper and middle drâa catchment is obtained by starting from rain gauges datasets fig 13 according to cappy 2006 the resulting altitude gradient is 0 2 per 100 m 15 δ 18 o 0 002 h 3 50 m where h is the altitude considering that the ouisselsat t4 sample from the deep circulations is the least enriched sample the recharge altitude would be about 3300 m reflecting colder climatic conditions essentially from the anti atlas mountains peaks moreover the association of a faults network oriented essentially nnw sse supports that the recharge process is under the influence of the siroua massif where the altitude exceeds 3000 m the contribution of high altitude in recharge processes is widely observed in several parts of the upstream drâa basin ait brahim et al 2015 warner et al 2013 the high precipitation in these areas mainly as snow is able to generate a year round groundwater flow on the other hand the estimated recharge altitude for taghdout t9 sample does not reflect the real recharge altitude due to the high evaporation rate of surface water of the taghdout dam table 4 5 6 groundwater ﬂow scheme in the taznakhte aquifer system based on our measurements and observations the geological map and what is currently known about the zenaga aquifer we can reveal that salinity sources and movement of groundwater are based essentially on the geological setting of the study area the high complexity of the zenaga inlier which is composed of fractured igneous and sedimentary rocks forming the underlying aquifer is the framework in which the groundwater follows to elucidate the fundamental groundwater flow processes a groundwater ﬂow scheme was created as a simple and visual representation of how water moves over and through the aquifer fig 14 as water makes its journey the deep groundwater is stored mostly within fractures and cracks among which some allow precipitation to recharge the aquifer system from high altitudes this was clearly observed in the ouisselsat t4 sample however fully understanding these complex fracture networks seem to be difficult at the local scale and need more observations on the type of fractures joints or cracks and the existence of seals by mineral precipitates schists and dyke weathering regardless most water extracted by pumping wells comes from the limited surface runoff generated during precipitation events as a local direct recharge as a result the groundwater level in these wells is reacting to the seasonal rainfall in contrast to deep boreholes which can provide water needs to the population even in dry periods implying a regional recharge system 6 conclusion the hydrochemical and isotopic behavior of groundwater in the zenaga plain is clearly reflecting the complexity of the underlying aquifer the dominance of hard fractured rocks has given a heterogeneous and discontinuous character where two neighboring samples are likely to exhibit contrasting quantitative and qualitative behaviors the result showed that salinity is highly variable and generally increases with depth however the most mineralized waters do not reflect a unique type of aquifer the majority of samples fall in fresh recharge water revealing mixed water without any dominant cation two groundwater groups can be distinguished 1 the groundwater of calcium bicarbonate or calcium magnesium and bicarbonate type include the majority of wells and boreholes and 2 the groundwater of chloride sulfate and calcium magnesium type of angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 samples from deep circulations with high salinity this evolution in the hydrochemical facies from hco3 ca mg to so4 cl ca mg is probably related the geological formations crossed by groundwater and due to the long flow path the composition of groundwater is mainly influenced by rock interactions and the solubilization of evaporite minerals characterizes all groundwater samples the scholler index values reflect that cation and reverse cation exchanges are occurring which is supported by high low na na ca ratio observed in the gibbs diagram a moderate contamination of shallow waters by nitrates from septic tanks and manure fertilizer is observed in several samples however the majority of samples indicates groundwater is suitable to meet the population needs for drinking water and for irrigation purposes except for angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 samples with high salinity stable isotope ratios reveal that groundwater recharge is derived mainly from the oceanic vapor masses at high altitudes the low values of δ18o and δ2h support a deep recharge process from the anti atlas mountains and more precisely from the siroua massif where the altitude exceeds 3000 m the presence of the lateral groundwater flows from the anti atlas towards the plain prove that at these boreholes the groundwater storage and recharge are important to face lack of precipitation in the arid zenaga plain these results of this study will be helpful for the decision and policy makers to better conduct sustainable and

11751,the zenaga inlier located in an arid area in southeastern morocco is mostly characterized by igneous and metamorphic fractured rocks the surface water is quasi absent and local populations 95 rural are entirely dependent on groundwater resources for drinking and irrigation purposes to evaluate the main factors controlling the origin and salinization of groundwater resources we have investigated the chemical and stable isotope compositions of 23 groundwater samples in addition water quality assessment parameters including sodium absorption ratio sar and water quality index wqi were also calculated the results show that the majority of wells and boreholes are characterized calcium bicarbonate water type 78 of samples with the following ionic sequence ca2 na mg2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 for cations and anions respectively a significant enrichment on major ions is steadily rising with depth as the water type changes toward calcium chloride the interpretation of hydrochemical data suggests that the silicate weathering cation exchange and evaporites dissolution are responsible for the groundwater chemistry the majority of water samples are good to permissible for irrigation and poor to good for drinking purposes the mineral salts found at greater depths degrade groundwater quality in some areas nitrate contents imply anthropogenic contamination derived especially from traditional septic tanks stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h reveal a distinction between the shallow aquifer and deep circulations the uncommon depleted isotope signature found in deep circulations was associated with cold altitudes recharge whereas the heaviest groundwater observed in shallow aquifer was interpreted as the contribution of surface water from taghdout dam the anti atlas mountains and siroua massif s high altitude served as a source of recharge the mixing at considerable depths and along the groundwater path appears to decrease the isotopic variability in the shallow and deep groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogeochemistry zenaga inlier arid environment water quality assessment stable isotopes 1 introduction the importance of groundwater increases mainly in arid and semi arid areas where surface water resources are often scarce limited or even absent hssaisoune et al 2020 in morocco the government considers groundwater as a strategic water resource for the socio economic development for many rural areas taheripour et al 2020 the exploitable groundwater represents only one third of the renewable water resources and only 10 of shallow groundwater is classed in good quality range fao 2009 additionally the succession of dry seasons and the increasing demand for water have severely diminished the groundwater level for many aquifers about 2 m per year bouchaou et al 2011 meddi and eslamian 2021 this is expected to enter the country in a situation of extreme water stress in the future decades world bank 2021 in such conditions the groundwater governance will be the only fundamental way to better regulate competitive water uses between sectors the drâa river basin drb is one of the largest basins of morocco which extends from the central high atlas mountains to the southward low pre saharan desert in the south western of the country given the aridity of the climate and its hydrogeological consequences this large area is considered as one of the ten driest watersheds in the world and contains only 7 of the groundwater resources of the country agoussine et al 2004 revenga et al 1998 moreover the succession of dry periods the overexploitation of groundwater and the salinization problem have a major impact on the quality and quantity of groundwater bouchaou et al 2008 heidecke and kuhn 2007 hssaisoune et al 2020 klose 2008 the zenaga plain being part of the upstream drb is one of the aspects of this surface water scarcity ait jeddi et al 2021 consequently population activity of this region such as tourism agriculture and especially saffron agriculture cooperatives depend mainly on groundwater availability to ensure economic prosperity the hard rocks aquifer systems in the upper drb is not well known rarely described and almost not monitored cappy 2006 the position of the zenaga plain in the center of the anti atlas mountains reveal that the majority of the study area is occupied by hard metamorphic igneous and calcareous rocks heiβ et al 2018 moreover field observations have shown that the groundwater of these hard rocks aquifers are limited in terms of productivity and show a moderate potential compared to other aquifers maaziz et al 2020 the groundwater in zenaga plain is used through traditional methods such as khettaras system underground tunnels that allow groundwater to flow by gravity or by an increasing number of pumping wells and boreholes often located in alluvium areas and near the valley ait jeddi et al 2021 however in spite of the intermittent regime of the tributaries and their low flow rate they contribute to the recharge of the aquifers especially during flood periods besides a considerable amount of snow and rain from the anti atlas mountains is evident in the recharge process all over the basin area cappy 2006 warner et al 2013 in such a context where the water chemistry and quality as well as the origins of recharge are not properly assessed this study aims to i provide a basic knowledge of the geogenic sources of the chemical composition of the groundwater ii highlight the process responsible for the mineralization of the underlying aquifer system iii assess groundwater quality regarding drinking and irrigation purposes iv identifying the possible groundwater origin and altitude of recharge all by using a hydrochemical and isotopic database and incorporating the particular aspect of the study area 2 study area 2 1 geographical setting located in the southwest of the upstream drb the zenaga plain corresponds to a large plateau of 40 km from the north to the south and 20 25 km from the east to the west where the average altitude is around 1500 m with a surface area of 809 km2 and a flat bottom the study area occupies the central belt of the anti atlas chain trends ne sw behind the high atlas chain 30 30 40 n and 7 10 to 7 30 w fig 1 the dominating climate in the plain is semi arid with a hot summer and cold winter the precipitation is highly variable in terms of frequency duration intensity and is associated with orography a wet season between september and april with rainfall peaks in september and october was recorded however the number of rainy days per year monitored at the assaka station does not exceed a few days where the average annual rain is about 118 mm year fig 2 locally the rivers are called wadi they have an intermittent flow regime and are often flooded during local storms mainly in the late summer and early fall this hydrographic regime is limited to the plain and each river originates at the foot of the cliff the azegumerzi wadi is the main river that drains this part of the anti atlas domain it originates from the southern end of the plain and runs along its eastern edge in a north south direction on the other hand the amagha wadi which drains the western flank of the siroua chain is one of its main tributaries on the contrary it has a west east direction downstream of the taghdout dam these wadis set meet downstream to give rise to the ait douchen wadi however the annual discharges are only 9 million m3 and the specific flow is equal to 6000 m3 km2 year at the assaka station abhsmd 2010 2 2 geological and hydrogeological context the study area is part of precambrian inliers known as the siroua window including the northern edge of the paleoproterozoic west african craton wac known as the zenaga complex or inlier ennih and liégeois 2001 thomas et al 2002 fig 3 a the study area is mostly made up by an older sequence of supracrustal rocks of paleoproterozoic age pi with amphibolite facies schists and migmatites gasquet et al 2008 this assembly is limited to the north by low metamorphic formations of neoproterozoic age pii formed by quartzites and conglomerates named by taghdout subgroup choubert 1963 moreover the mesoproterozoic age represented by quartzite and limestone has been recently identified overlying the taghdout subgroup materials ikenne et al 2017 note finally that the schistose bedrock is crossed by four major igneous plutonic units where the azguemerzi granodiorites occupy 20 of the exposed area thomas et al 2002 fig 3b the evaluation of the structure of aquifer complexes in the drâa basin as in the study area is adjusted on the same and similar geological units klose et al 2008 the continuous alluvial aquifer is mainly stored in quaternary formation presented essentially by alluvium sand and gravels located mainly in the west of the plain and along the main tributaries overlying the precambrian bedrock fig 3c in such a context that accurately replicates the characteristics of an inlier more than a depression with sedimentary filling the thickness of this porous deposits does not exceed a few meters abhsmd 2010 however this shallow aquifer provides enough water for the population through traditional shallow wells digged manually as well as an old technique of mobilization of water named khettara ait jeddi et al 2021 progressively changes in irrigation strategies replace these old techniques giving farmers access to the groundwater resources more easely hydrodynamically field observations have shown a variable permeability and occasionally high but generally the productivity is usually low and does not exceed 6 l s abhsmd 2010 busche 2008 on the other hand the covering weathered mantle derived from the prolonged decomposition of the proterozoic igneous bedrock is widespread in contrast to the first set the groundwater here flows in hard igneous formations with low permeability and hydraulic conductivity klose et al 2008 moreover the presence of fractures in the schistose base can generate deep flows rarely captured by traditional wells known as the deep circulations 3 material and method 3 1 water sampling a groundwater sampling campaign was carried out at 23 sites spread over the study area during the month of may 2020 with respect to the standard sampling procedures iso 1993 these sites include 6 boreholes and 17 wells catching different types of aquifers and areas dedicated mainly to meeting the population s drinking water needs and for irrigation each sample was collected after pumping often for 20 min in such a way the groundwater shows a stabilized temperature additionally three rain samples are added to the isotopic database electrical conductivity accuracy of 0 5 ph accuracy of 0 1 temperature accuracy of 0 2 c and dissolved oxygen of the groundwater samples were measured in the field immediately using a portable multi meter wtw multi 3420 analysis of the water samples was carried out in the applied geology and geo environment laboratory ibn zohr university agadir morocco following the standard methods for the examination of water apha 1989 sulfate and nitrate concentrations were measured using spectrophotometry hco3 mg cl ca parameters by titration na and k concentrations by flame spectrophotometer the uv visible absorption spectrophotometer and the ionic balance was found to be within 10 the total dissolved salts tds were calculated indirectly through electrical conductivity using the relationship given by shainberg and levy 2005 the isotope measurements of δ18o and δ2h were performed by cavity ringdown spectrometer using a picarro l2120 and the analytical uncertainty for δ18o and δ2h are in the order of 0 10 and 1 50 respectively the values are expressed as relative differences d values from vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow in per mill 3 2 methods identifying the geochemical characterization of groundwater was made by

analyses were achieved using the programming language for statistical computing and graphics r with the factominer package and its graphical interface factoshiny the stable isotope composition of the groundwater samples from the zenaga aquifer was plotted in the binary diagram of δ2h δ18o the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl cappy 2006 in thermodynamic equilibrium conditions slope of 8 are plotted on the same diagram these lines are calculated following equation 8 and equation 9 respectively 8 gmwl δd 8 δ 18 o 10 9 lmwl δd 8 δ 18 o 10 60 4 result 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics the hydrogeochemical characteristics of all samples collected in the zenaga plain are summarized in table 1 water temperature and ph fall within the range of 18 23 c and 5 7 to 7 9 respectively ph is close to neutral for the majority of the samples and the lowest values are recorded at deep aquifer levels with a high bicarbonate concentration the specific electric conductivity ec considered as a measure for the total mineralization shows that groundwater of the shallow aquifer systems wells 25 m depth ranges from the low mineralized at elain t23 sample with 448 μs cm to high mineralized at assersa t6 sample with 2370 μs cm with the exception of kourkouda t9 and tiouine t19 groundwater mineralization progressively rises with depth making deep waters readily identifiable by their high salinity however the highest values do not reflect a single aquifer type the statistical analysis of the major ions in the shallow aquifer shows an abundance of ca2 na mg2 k for cations and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 for anions fig 4 this trend slightly changes for the deep circulations with an enrichment in chloride sulfates and magnesium especially for angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 from the data of alkalis na and k and alkaline earths ca2 and mg2 the concentrations of sodium calcium and magnesium ranged from 10 10 to 301 08 mg l 6 46 425 73 mg l and 16 19 266 83 mg l respectively potassium is generally the least abundant major which varies between 1 36 and 13 77 mg l bicarbonate is the most dominant anion for the majority of the samples their values vary between 178 14 and 629 62 mg l chloride and sulfate concentrations ranged from 11 54 to 967 38 mg l and 13 22 706 86 mg l respectively samples with extreme values for both elements are frequently observed in deep samples nitrate concentrations vary between 5 13 and 51 94 mg l except angarf sample t15 from deep circulations all samples don t exceed the maximum admissible in drinking water for nitrate 50 mg l 4 2 groundwater type the examination of the piper diagram shows that the bicarbonate is the most frequent anion always present and predominant for the majority of samples on the other hand a high diversity for calcium sodium and magnesium is observed on the cation diagram as shown in the diamond diagram fig 5 the ca hco3 is the most dominant facies 18 samples where the carbonate hardness exceeds 50 and the alkaline earths exceed alkalis fresh recharge water only angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 from deep circulations show a tendency to ca cl water type the groundwaters undergo a gradual change in chemistry from ca hco3 to ca cl with increasing salinity 4 3 processes of mineralization according to gibbs 1970 three domains affecting groundwater chemistry can be distinguished namely precipitation dominance rock weathering and evaporation dominance as shown in fig 6 the samples span nearly the entire range of na na ca values i e from 0 18 to 0 98 at mid range tds level the same case is not really observed in the cl cl hco3 diagram since the majority of samples having an abundance of bicarbonates globally the majority of water samples are laid in the water rock interaction area with a remarkable tendency towards the evaporation this trend is clearly observed in deep circulations samples with a little change in salinity 4 4 multivariate statistical analysis 4 4 1 principal components analysis pca the extracted factor for the pca was based on the eigenvalue 1 kaiser 1958 which contributes to 77 47 of total variance adopting the classification of liu et al 2003 the terms strong moderate and weak as assigned to factor loadings corresponds to absolute loading values of 0 75 0 75 0 50 and 0 50 0 30 respectively f1 explains 61 65 of the total variance table 2 it shows a strong positive loading on ec mg so4 na ca and cl while k no3 and hco3 have a moderate loading fig 7 a the second component f2 with an eigenvalue of 1 56 and accounting for 15 62 of the cumulative variance shows a weak loading in all variables except so4 and no3 moderate loading the projection of groundwater samples on the factorial plan f1 f2 fig 7b allows to separate the samples according to their degree of mineralization this separation seems to be clear on the f1 axis allowing the differentiation between two large groups groupe a samples from this group are less mineralized with a high ph value and the lowest concentration of hco3 and k nonetheless this group do not reflect a single aquifer type groupe b this group is composed mainly by samples from shallow aquifers collected along the azguemerzi and amagha wadis with a medium mineralization compared to the previous group the second trend observed is on the positive side of the same f1 axis reflects samples with high salinity moreover angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 samples have a tendency to cl ca mg water type 4 4 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hca the dendrogram of individuals clearly separates samples according to their hydrochemical similarity fig 8 the first and second groups are the same distinguished on the factorial plan a and b respectively azguemerzi t15 and angarf t21 samples are classified in a single group as samples reflecting the particularity of deep circulations moreover ouisseslsat t4 and assersa t6 samples are organized in one group although they do not reflect a single aquifer type 4 5 water quality index wqi the wqi values for all groundwater samples were classified according to the five water quality classes sahu and sikdar 2008 the terms excellent good poor very poor and unsuitable for drinking correspond to wqi 50 50 wqi 100 100 wqi 200 200 wqi 300 and wqi 300 respectively incorporating the weight of each chemical parameter table 3 the results show that 47 of the groundwater samples come under the category good among which the majority belongs to shallow aquifers 43 of the samples are poor whereas the assersa t6 sample from the shallow aquifer angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 samples from deep circulations have been registered under the unsuitable for drinking category 4 6 assessment of irrigation water quality the sar values for groundwater samples ranged from 0 32 to 3 23 according to fao 1992 waters with sar values below 10 are considered suitable for irrigation however based on sar classification richards 1954 ouisselsat t4 angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 samples from deep circulations and assersa t6 from shallow aquifer reflect a high salinity trend with appreciable sodium hazard fig 9 a in the ec versus na diagram fig 9b the majority of groundwater samples belong to the water classes of good to permissible range the same samples that were unsuitable for drinking are also of unsuitable quality for irrigation 4 7 stable isotopes stable isotopes values of water molecules show that the δ18o and δ2h in groundwater samples from the zenaga plain ranged from 9 66 to 3 42 and 63 72 to 29 16 respectively table 1 the mean values were 7 79 and 51 69 for δ18o and δ2h respectively fig 10 shows that the samples positions in regard to the gmwl and the lmwl do not represent a single type of aquifer the first distinguishing group is located slightly below gmwl including t1 t3 t7 t6 t9 t14 t21 and t22 samples this group corresponds to groundwater samples collected mainly near the tributaries where taghdout t9 samples is considered as the heaviest sample the remaining samples can be divided into two groups samples aligned or slightly above the gmwl where all are from the shallow aquifer t2 t5 t17 t18 t20 the second group including t4 t8 t16 t19 t10 t12 t23 is plotted above the gmwl and lmwl with a significantly depleted signature more than the previous groups nevertheless a clear difference still exists in the isotopic composition between these samples and local precipitation t25 t26 and t27 on the other hand ouisselsat t4 sample on the extreme left side reflects the most depleted sample with high salinity 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater mineralization the relationship between conductivity and the na cl ratio is inversely proportional i e an increase in ec implies a decrease in the na cl ratio fig 11 a this is confirmed by the gibbs diagram which illustrates the non dominance of the evaporation effect as the main mineralization process for the majority of samples mrazovac et al 2012 and may reflect ion exchange reactions as the dominant process over the evaporation al yacoubi et al 2017 in the same way this chemical evolution can also provide information on other sodium sources such as silicates weathering srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 on the other hand the rising na cl ratio while the ec remains constant for fresh water samples located in the left side suggests that the conductivity mainly depends on other ions such as magnesium and sulfates in the na versus cl diagram the majority of samples follow the halite dissolution line and show a high correlation between na and cl r 0 74 fig 11b the high na cl ratio at low salinities for some of these samples do not support the contribution of meteoric nacl as the only source of sodium sami 1992 in the same way the sodium excess for these samples indicates that halite dissolution in the bedrock or precipitation process are not responsible for sodium leaching with regard to the predominance of bicarbonates in these samples this result seems to be significantly explained by the contribution of silicates weathering which is determined by reaction 10 sarin et al 1989 10 na k mg ca silicate co 2 h 2 o h 4 s i o 4 h c o 3 n a k c o 2 h 2 o m g 2 c a 2 s o l i d p r o d u c t on the other hand the abundance of chloride relative to other ions in angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 samples from deep circulations is likely related to more complex processes besides ions exchanges however the silicate weathering cannot be ruled out because of the high concentration of bicarbonate ions in all samples the relationship between ca2 mg2 and hco 3 so2 4 is used to understand the contribution of carbonates and silicates as shown in fig 11c most samples are located near the 1 1 line suggesting the contribution of carbonates and silicates weathering cerling et al 1989 lakshmanan et al 2003 as a result evaporites dissolution calcite and dolomite dissolution can be a probable source for ca2 and mg2 depending on the terrains crossed by water on the other hand the calcium and magnesium excess in both samples angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 support other processes besides carbonate weathering in the ca2 versus so4 2 diagram the majority of samples do not evolve along the gypsum or anhydrite line fig 11d the groundwater seems to have been first enriched with ca2 from different sources then they undergo an enrichment of so4 2 along the flow path moreover the position of ouisselsat t4 and tilnif aep t22 samples from deep circulations with respect to the 1 2 line supports the contribution of sulfuric acid as the weathering agent das and kaur 2001 the reaction of carbonate with sulfuric acid as a proton source led to a drop in ph and dissolved oxygen observed in these waters which is given by reaction 11 11 caco 3 h 2 so 4 ca 2 2 so 4 2 h 2 co 3 the ca mg ratio can be used to clarify the origin of calcium and magnesium in groundwater katz et al 1998 mayo and loucks 1995 as shown in fig 11f the majority of samples are below or slightly close to the ca mg 1 line reflecting dolomite dissolution whereas samples with ratio between 1 and 2 indicate calcite dissolution on the other hand tizi aep t3 and azguemerzi t21 samples with high ratio greater than 2 support a clear effect of silicate minerals on the groundwater chemistry nitrate is present in small quantities in major igneous rocks therefore no3 concentrations greater than 10 mg l generally reflect the anthropogenic contributions heaton 1986 in no3 versus cl diagram fig 11e two groups are identified samples with high no3 cl values against low cl 60 of samples supporting the contribution of chemical and manure fertilizers used for agriculture activities buvaneshwari et al 2017 some pumping return of groundwater is expected considering the dominance of gravity fed irrigation in this region on the other hand mcquillan 2004 reported that samples with high cl and low no3 cl is mainly related to effluents contribution from septic tanks which is the most frequent mode in this rural area in addition the nitrate and chloride enrichment in angarf t15 sample is related to its proximity to a traditional manure field heap as result the positive loadings of no3 in f2 can be associated with the nitrate contamination however the chloride enrichment process seems to be more complicated for azguemerzi sample t21 from deep circulations the flow of these deep waters through a network of fractures often mineralized supports greater weathering of the mineralization and schists in the aquifer matrix 5 2 cation exchange the position of samples on the ca mg versus so4 hco3 diagram with regard to the 1 1 line fig 11c and the relationship between conductivity and the na cl ratio fig 11a reflect that ions exchange occurring rajmohan and elango 2004 al yacoubi et al 2017 the bei results shows that 52 of samples have a negative base exchange index supporting that the groundwater effectively exchanges ca2 and mg2 ions for the na which can be written using reaction 12 12 2na x ca2 or mg2 2na ca or mg x2 where x reflect the exchanging solid surface martínez and bocanegra 2002 the same result explains the great variation observed mainly in samples located outside the boomerang shape of the gibbs cationic diagram fig 6 the evolution of groundwater chemistry from ca hco3 to na hco3 for ouisselsat t4 timjicht t11 and tilnif aep t22 samples located in the right side of the diagram fig 6 indicates cation exchanges bei 0 this assumption is supported for t22 and t4 samples with low ph and excess in hco3 confirming that waters are slightly acidic on the other hand azguemerzi t21 and angarf t15 located on the right side anion diagram indicate reverse cation exchanges bei 0 these deep circulations samples seem to have a similar geochemical trend plotted on the ca cl water type fig 5 5 3 saturation index si as shown in fig 12 all samples are undersaturated with respect to halite gypsum and anhydrite minerals suggesting that evaporite dissolution is continuously carried out without precipitation across the water flow path on the other hand bousalem t12 sample is the only sample undersaturated regarding aragonite although oversaturation state was observed in a few samples saturation state dominated aragonite for the majority of samples otherwise the thermodynamic potential for dissolution regarding carbonate minerals is observed for deep circulations samples t4 t16 t21 t22 angarf t15 and kourkouda t8 present an exception with si 0 regarding calcite dolomite and aragonite revealing the possibility of precipitation 5 4 deep circulations enrichment a particular confusion is observed on the gibbs diagram fig 6 by assessing the importance of water rock interaction and or evaporation process it means that evaporation or rock weathering process alone is insufficient for explaining the chemical characteristics of groundwater supporting a complex mode of mineralization the same concern has been observed in several studies marandi and shand 2018 and references therein considering that deep weathering involves the chemical alteration of rocks and minerals to depths of tens or even hundreds of meters ollier 1988 the high mineralization is not evident in all deep samples kourkouda t8 and tiouine t19 constitute a perfect example where mineralization is low even compared to the shallow samples this may reflect immobility conditions of deep water known usually as stagnate zones where the weathering process is very slow what does not mean that it ceases entirely moreover the influence of karstic circulations in the kroukouda travertine area fig 3b might explain the low salinity found especially for the kourkouda t8 sample on the one hand the long flow path and the residence time of groundwater can influence the mineralization process this can be clarified by assessing the abundance order of bicarbonates sulfates and chloride hagmaier 1971 anions in groundwater undergo the following sequence of hydrochemical changes from the shallow aquifer to deep circulations samples with high mineralization this chemical evolution can be expressed as below 13 13 hco 3 hco 3 so 4 2 cl so 4 2 cl as a result the majority of samples reflect the contribution of local flow system whereas angarf t15 ouisselsat t4 and azguemerzi t21 samples from deep circulations support an older water under a regional flow system on the other hand a modification in the hydrodynamic processes of the underlying aquifer is expected under an overexploitation context of deep groundwater this can lead to leakage from shallow to deep groundwater circulations increasing major ions wu et al 2015 5 5 origin of recharge 5 5 1 recharge conditions the isotopic content of precipitation represents the current input function of aquifers as shown in the regression line fig 10 the lower slope and deuterium intercept values are 5 6 and 9 2 respectively lower than the ones from the gmwl 8 and 10 respectively provide information on the evaporation effect on rainwater before the infiltration ayadi et al 2018 this isotopic enrichment is well observed in samples located below the gmwl and especially in the taghdout t9 sample the remarkable isotopic enrichment in this sample is probably related to the high evaporation rate of surface water mass from the taghdout dam located upstream from the sampled well this surface water exposed to the open air and under the aridity of the climate creates convenient conditions for the isotopic fractionation of water in the same way the isotopic enrichment in the assersa t6 sample is related to its location near a non waterproof irrigation water storage basin in contrast the isotopic enrichment observed in taourirt t10 and taloust t13 samples simultaneously with low tds may reflect the contribution of rapid infiltration from meteoric water taking into account the small thickness of the unsaturated zone accepting that samples enriched in stable isotopes with respect to the gmwl reflects a clear effect of evaporation of water before infiltration the contribution of irrigation return water with limited water rocks interaction can create the same isotopic contrast with low salinity 5 5 2 recharge process in order to clarify the origin of the humid air masses generating the precipitation in the study area the deuterium excess d value was calculated for each groundwater sample using equation 13 provided by dansgaard 1964 14 d δd 8 δ 18o the variable d has a value of 10 on a global basis however this value can vary locally and regionally due to different dynamic processes clark and fritz 1997 the calculated d values in the study area vary within a range of 1 79 to 13 87 table 4 in the atlas mountains context this significant variability is interpreted as a result of an increased recycling of moisture under the effect of the climate aridity ait brahim et al 2016 this assumption is well supported by d values above 10 for several samples for which the highest value is observed in the ouisselsat t4 sample this observation supports recharge by snow at high altitude jouzel and merlivat 1984 moreover the contribution of local humid air masses under low humid conditions clark and fritz 1997 and the mediterranean humid air masses maliki et al 2000 can lead to the same result on the other hand the d values for the majority of water samples are close to the atlantic deuterium excess of 10 o this can reflect the contribution of oceanic air masses the same assumption is supported also by the position of the samples near to the gmwl and lmwl where a temperature gradient exists a gradient in δ18o and δ2h should be observed clark and fritz 1997 therefore the high altitude recharge would be associated with a relative depletion in δ18o and δ2h stichler and schotterer 2000 the altitude gradient δ18o calculated for the upper and middle drâa catchment is obtained by starting from rain gauges datasets fig 13 according to cappy 2006 the resulting altitude gradient is 0 2 per 100 m 15 δ 18 o 0 002 h 3 50 m where h is the altitude considering that the ouisselsat t4 sample from the deep circulations is the least enriched sample the recharge altitude would be about 3300 m reflecting colder climatic conditions essentially from the anti atlas mountains peaks moreover the association of a faults network oriented essentially nnw sse supports that the recharge process is under the influence of the siroua massif where the altitude exceeds 3000 m the contribution of high altitude in recharge processes is widely observed in several parts of the upstream drâa basin ait brahim et al 2015 warner et al 2013 the high precipitation in these areas mainly as snow is able to generate a year round groundwater flow on the other hand the estimated recharge altitude for taghdout t9 sample does not reflect the real recharge altitude due to the high evaporation rate of surface water of the taghdout dam table 4 5 6 groundwater ﬂow scheme in the taznakhte aquifer system based on our measurements and observations the geological map and what is currently known about the zenaga aquifer we can reveal that salinity sources and movement of groundwater are based essentially on the geological setting of the study area the high complexity of the zenaga inlier which is composed of fractured igneous and sedimentary rocks forming the underlying aquifer is the framework in which the groundwater follows to elucidate the fundamental groundwater flow processes a groundwater ﬂow scheme was created as a simple and visual representation of how water moves over and through the aquifer fig 14 as water makes its journey the deep groundwater is stored mostly within fractures and cracks among which some allow precipitation to recharge the aquifer system from high altitudes this was clearly observed in the ouisselsat t4 sample however fully understanding these complex fracture networks seem to be difficult at the local scale and need more observations on the type of fractures joints or cracks and the existence of seals by mineral precipitates schists and dyke weathering regardless most water extracted by pumping wells comes from the limited surface runoff generated during precipitation events as a local direct recharge as a result the groundwater level in these wells is reacting to the seasonal rainfall in contrast to deep boreholes which can provide water needs to the population even in dry periods implying a regional recharge system 6 conclusion the hydrochemical and isotopic behavior of groundwater in the zenaga plain is clearly reflecting the complexity of the underlying aquifer the dominance of hard fractured rocks has given a heterogeneous and discontinuous character where two neighboring samples are likely to exhibit contrasting quantitative and qualitative behaviors the result showed that salinity is highly variable and generally increases with depth however the most mineralized waters do not reflect a unique type of aquifer the majority of samples fall in fresh recharge water revealing mixed water without any dominant cation two groundwater groups can be distinguished 1 the groundwater of calcium bicarbonate or calcium magnesium and bicarbonate type include the majority of wells and boreholes and 2 the groundwater of chloride sulfate and calcium magnesium type of angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 samples from deep circulations with high salinity this evolution in the hydrochemical facies from hco3 ca mg to so4 cl ca mg is probably related the geological formations crossed by groundwater and due to the long flow path the composition of groundwater is mainly influenced by rock interactions and the solubilization of evaporite minerals characterizes all groundwater samples the scholler index values reflect that cation and reverse cation exchanges are occurring which is supported by high low na na ca ratio observed in the gibbs diagram a moderate contamination of shallow waters by nitrates from septic tanks and manure fertilizer is observed in several samples however the majority of samples indicates groundwater is suitable to meet the population needs for drinking water and for irrigation purposes except for angarf t15 and azguemerzi t21 samples with high salinity stable isotope ratios reveal that groundwater recharge is derived mainly from the oceanic vapor masses at high altitudes the low values of δ18o and δ2h support a deep recharge process from the anti atlas mountains and more precisely from the siroua massif where the altitude exceeds 3000 m the presence of the lateral groundwater flows from the anti atlas towards the plain prove that at these boreholes the groundwater storage and recharge are important to face lack of precipitation in the arid zenaga plain these results of this study will be helpful for the decision and policy makers to better conduct sustainable and

11752,groundwater is one of the most important freshwater resources particularly in dry and semi arid regions with low annual precipitation and frequent droughts for the planning and the management of water resources this is very essential to generate a soft computing method that can predict or forecast groundwater table gwt the different machine and deep learning algorithms are evaluated in this research work to predict the groundwater table using season monthly rainfall and evapotranspiration rate which are further compared the performance evaluation of the different algorithms was done

score of 0 82 0 88 graphical abstract image 1 keywords evapotranspiration machine deep learning nash sutcliffe efficiency r2 score 1 introduction injudicious use and long term mismanagement of freshwater and rapid urban development due to ever increasing anthropogenic activities have had a significant impact on the water cycle resulting in water scarcity increased pollution of rivers and streams and degraded ecosystems around the world furthermore the effects of global warming and climate change on the hydrosphere and biosphere are already being observed threatening the sustainability of water systems and ecosystems groundwater is one of the most important sources of drinking and domestic use groundwater is also essential for rapid agricultural growth and industrial developments it is the only reliable source of supply in some areas while in some other regions it is chosen because of its easy availability more than 90 of groundwater in india is used for irrigated agriculture and 85 for drinking purposes roughly 80 of india s residents depend on groundwater for drinking and irrigation one of the most challenging tasks of the twenty first century is ensuring sustainable water supplies for the home and agricultural sectors in the face of climate change effective water resource planning and management employing modern scientific methods and procedures is necessary to solve this concern groundwater modelling has developed as a viable scientific technique to help decision makers establish sustainable management plans for the optimal exploitation and conservation of this critical resource the relationships between hydro meteorological variables such as rainfall temperature river stage pumping evapotranspiration and so on and groundwater levels are highly complex and non linear furthermore groundwater processes display a significant degree of geographical and temporal variability within and between basins making groundwater modelling difficult for academics and water managers models provide an efficient tool for modelling complex natural systems however the amount of data and information required to develop process based groundwater flow transport models are enormous many of these data and information are typically expensive and or difficult to obtain particularly in developing countries in such cases data driven empirical models which require less data and effort are appealing options for modelling natural systems as a result machine learning ml techniques such as the artificial neural network ann and its various variants have been widely applied in hydrological sciences including groundwater hydrology one of the most significant issues in most developing countries is the scarcity of groundwater level data at appropriate geographical and temporal dimensions and data discontinuity including india as a result large scale groundwater modelling including data driven modelling is complex in many world regions particularly in developing countries considering existing limits and a review of the literature the primary purpose of this research is to provide a realistic scientific framework for forecasting seasonal groundwater oscillations at a small scale the data driven modelling approach created in this study will be beneficial for predicting groundwater levels at bigger scales in data limited environments 2 literature study adamowski and chan studied a wavelet based neural network for prediction of ground water table using average monthly precipitation temperature and ground water level data the proposed methodology was superior to

modelling of groundwater level variations emamgholizadeh et al 2014 examined the capability of two artificial intelligence models namely artificial neural network ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis in the prediction of the groundwater level of bastam plain in iran djurovic et al 2015 examined that water table prediction played a crucial role in managing groundwater resources in agricultural zones where there were drainage systems in river valleys this study utilized two soft computing techniques an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and an artificial neural network ann model for one month water table estimates at various wells located near the river yicheng gong et al 2016 when considering the interaction between surface water and groundwater researchers looked at three nonlinear time series intelligence models artificial neural networks ann support vector machines svm and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis zhang et al 2017 studied that the ability of the grey self memory model gsm the radial basis function network rbf and the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis to estimate groundwater depths over an unconfined

decomposition eemd and data driven models the estimation capability of eemd ann eemd svm and eemd anfis hybrid models was examined utilizing a monthly groundwater level time series accumulated from two inspection wells near lake okeechobee in florida moghaddam et al 2019 studied the conceptual model modflow the bayesian network bn and the artificial neural network ann models to forecast monthly groundwater level in birjand aquifer south khorasan iran dhaigude and ajmera 2020 studied the artificial neural network model for forecasting groundwater level in ujjain district of madhya pradesh india affandi and watanabe 2007 karimi rizvandi et al 2021 used a self learning bayesian network model to compare metaheuristic algorithms for groundwater potential mapping shiri et al 2021 developed the artificial intelligence models for well groundwater quality simulation and hai tao et al 2022 presented a literature study of machine learning models for groundwater level prediction in this study machine learning algorithms are adopted to predict the water table depth of groundwater table for the vidisha district madhya pradesh india 3 study area data processing this study is based on open wells located in the vidisha district of madhya pradesh as shown in fig 1 the area of the district is 7371 square kilometers it is geographically lies in between 22020 to 24 22 north latitude 77 16 to 78 18 east longitude and 424 m above msl the most part of this district more than 80 lies in betwa river basin the average rainfall of this district is 113 55 cm which mostly comes from southwest monsoon may is the hottest for the community at a temperature of 41 7 c and december is the coldest at 8 9 c in this study the whole district is divided into four regions based on the location of the rain gauge stations the raw data was recorded manually based on the daily rainfall the dataset consists of daily rainfall data obtained from january 1995 to december 2019 from the hydrometeorology department wrd bhopal m p the seasonal groundwater table data has been collected from the superintending geohydrologist ground water circle wrd bhopal m p which is further pre processed by selecting the 10 most staggering wells in each region averaging is being done the reference evapotranspiration data has been collected from the website www mpwrd gov in initially the reliability of the dataset is checked by applying some statistical methods i e outlier detection and probability distribution plots the missing values are handled by using the sci kit learn library and pandas mckinney and others 2010 pedregosa 2011 the daily rainfall data is converted into seasonal rainfall data employing summing up the daily rainfall data table 1 presents the processed dataset used for the study correlation analysis is performed to check the dependency of the input and output parameters the results of the correlation analysis are presented in table 2 it is clear that the evapotranspiration rate is highly correlated with the actual groundwater level the correlation coefficient between the chosen input variables is very low which reduces the chances of over fitting as high correlation between input variables leads to overfitting 4 methodology machine learning ml is a sub field of artificial intelligence ai that enables computer to learn the mathematical relationship between inputs and output based on the training data ml is broadly divided into three groups i e supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning the association is identified and modelled in this work using supervised learning by fitting a linear or non linear model to the training data multivariate polynomial regression mpr model decision tree regression dtr model multivariate linear regression mlr model random forest regression rfr model support vector regression svr model and artificial neural network ann model and anfis model are some of the machine learning algorithms used in this study in this study supervised learning is used to identify and model the relationship by fitting a linear or non linear model to the training data various ml algorithms used in this study are multivariate linear regression mlr model multivariate polynomial regression mpr model support vector regression svr model decision tree regression dtr model random forest regression rfr model and two deep learning algorithms used for the study are artificial neural network ann model and anfis fig 2 4 1 machine learning algorithms 4 1 1 linear model in this model a linear relationship is established between the inputs and output variables while minimizing the mean squared error mse and the equation obtained can be written as a multivariate linear regression mlr model 1 y c i 1 n w i x i b multivariate polynomial regression mpr model 2 y c i 1 a 1 i n a m w i x i a where y is predicted output c is bias or regression constant wi is regression coefficient xi is input variable n is number of inputs and m is exponential during training of the model eqs 1 and 2 are trained using cost function eq 3 which is guided by stochastic gradient descent technique to minimize the error associated with the training data 3 c o s t f u n c t i o n m s e j 1 m y a c t u a l y p r e d i c t e d 2 m where mse is mean squared error m is number of training data yactual is actual output and ypredicted is predicted output 4 1 2 non linear model in this type of ml a non linear relationship is established between input variables and output variable such that the error is minimized a support vector regression svr model in this type of regression model despite of reducing the error svr permits the flexibility to define the permissible error and specify an approximate plane hyper plane to fit the training data the objective of svr is to optimize the coefficient of weight such that the error is within the permissible limit svr is further discussed in awad and khanna 2015 smola and schölkopf 2004 suthaharan 2016 b decision tree regression dtr model in this type of ml model the regression model is built in the tree structure it breaks the data into smaller subsets to reduce standard deviation while simultaneously a decision tree is incrementally developed the final results are a tree with a decision node dtr is briefly discussed in suthaharan 2016 c random forest regression rfr model the prediction is based on the average of the outputs produced from each decision tree in random forest regression rfr which comprises of numerous decision trees it is part of a family of ensemble machine learning algorithms that create several decision trees dts and aggregate their findings to predict a response given a collection of predictors matrix of training data a unique bootstrap sample of the training data is used to create each tree in the forest rfr takes the best split from a randomly selected subset of predictors in contrast other machine learning methods e g bagging and boot strapping utilise the best split among all predictors for node splitting by adding randomization to the equation the correlation between trees in the forest is reduced which improves accuracy furthermore unlike linear regression rfr does not require the target predictors probability distribution to be assumed and it is resistant to nonlinearity and overfitting however when noisy data is being simulated over fitting might arise 4 2 deep learning 4 2 1 artificial neural network ann model artificial neural networks anns the mathematical link between input and output variables may be obtained using biological neural networks as inspiration the input hidden and output layers are the three layers of an ann model each layer has a set of nodes linked by synaptic weights that vary during the model s training phase each node is assigned an activation function a weighted sum is calculated at each node and this weighted sum is passed through the activation function associated with the node and output known as forward propagation in backward propagation error is minimized using optimizers training of the ann model takes place in two phases as described below forward phase in forward phase random input data is used to obtain the values of outputs of every hidden layer neuron grounded on the present value of weight and nature of activation function it is named forward phase because all computations inherently occur in forward direction across the layers this phase aims to obtain all the synaptic weight of hidden layer neuron and output for a given input finally the error at each output node is calculated and the cost function is computed when the calculation is completed 4 e r r o r e y a c t u a l y p r e d i c t 5 c o s t f u n c t i o n l 1 n e r r o r 2 backward phase in this phase we are concerned with calculating the derivative of cost function concerning various synaptic weights first we are interested in computing the derivative of the cost function over the output so the gradient computation s initialization started subsequently the derivative is fed backward using the multivariable chain rule of partial differentiation the weights are adjusted to minimize cost function so the stochastic gradient descent technique is used ann is briefly explained in hanna 2004 4 2 2 artificial neuro fuzzy inference system anfis one of the prominent neuro fuzzy systems is an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis proposed by jang in 1993 is a hybrid model composed of a fuzzy inference system and artificial neural network nodes in the different layers of a feed forward network that handles fuzzy parameters anfis can take crisp input represent membership functions and fuzzy rules and generate crisp output out of fuzzy rules for reasoning purposes anfis is becoming popular because it requires a smaller number of input and gives a more accurate result than other models therefore the anfis model with a gaussian membership function has been used to forecast the groundwater table level in the present study anfis is based on a first order takagi sugeno inference system where the input output relationship is linear in this study the anfis training algorithm is a hybrid algorithm see fig 3 5 results discussion various machine intelligence ml dl models are evaluated based on the following statistical parameters dadhich et

ypredict is predicted output yactual actual output ymean mean from actual prediction and n total number of the dataset either the parameters mentioned above are enough to evaluate the performance of any regression model still for enhancing the evaluation process of the models one more statistical parameter called nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is added at each phase of the model the nse is calculated using the following formula 11 n s e 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i x i 2 5 1 results of machine learning algorithms 5 1 1 linear model a multivariate linear regression mlr model the results of the mlr model against the actual gwt is shown in fig 4 from fig 4 it is clear that the predicted gwt has a moderate deviation from the actual gwt which is also justified from the high r2 score in the training and the testing phases of the mlr model see tables 3 and 4 b multivariate polynomial regression mpr model the results of the mpr moderate drawn against the actual gwt as shown in fig 5 which established that the predicted gwt mildly deviates from the actual gwt it confirms the better performance of the mpr model over the mlr model the mpr model can be utilized to predict the location of gwt 5 1 2 non linear model a support vector regression svr model the prediction of the svr rbf model enormously deviates from the actual gwt the nse is negative which confirms that the prediction model is very poor and less accurate overall it is concluded that the svr rbf model is not suitable for the prediction of the gwt see table 5 and 6 the prediction of the svr linear model is less deviated than the svr rbf model it confirms the poor accuracy of the svr rbf model for the prediction of the ground water table figs 6 and 7 b decision tree regression dtr model from table 7 it is clear that the performance of the dtr model in the training phase is exceptionally high with an overall r2 score of 0 98 the results show the deviation from the 1 1 line in the testing phase which indicates that the dtr model is over fitting the data which is also justified from fig 8 c random forest regression rfr model table 8 shows the results of the rfr model in the training and the testing phase the performance of the rfr model is consistent in both phases with low mae which justifies the use of the rfr model for the prediction of the gwt see fig 9 5 2 results of deep learning models 5 2 1 artificial neural network the performance of the ann model depends on its architecture which consists of various hyper parameters i e number of hidden layers nodes at each hidden layer activation function optimizer etc to obtain the best architecture hyper parameter tuning is performed using the grid search command from the sci kit learn library the architecture of the ann model used is shown in table 9 the performance of the ann model in the training and the testing phase is shown in table 10 either it is observed that the model s performance is quite good in terms of mae and r2 score still it is observed that instead of generalization the ann model is memorizing the dataset which is visible in the 1 1 plot drawn between actual gwt x axis and predicted gwt y axis in fig 10 5 2 2 artificial neuro fuzzy system the results of the anfis model in the training and the testing phase are shown in the following table 11 the results of the anfis model are drawn in fig 11 against the actual ground water table x axis the predicted gwt is highly deviated from the actual gwt for r2 and r3 which is also cleared from the negative nse and high mae whereas the performance of anfis model is considerably better with less mae in the r1 and r4 regions but this model cannot be used for the prediction of the gwt 5 3 comparison between machine deep learning models different machine intelligence models are trained and tested to predict the groundwater table three statistical parameters are selected randomly for comparison among the models i e mae r2 score and nse presented in table 12 the svr rbf model is the least suitable or unsuitable for the prediction of the groundwater table as the mae is relatively high mae 1 m and negative nse the performance of the mpr model is the best among all the machine intelligent models with average minimum mae of 0 705 m and average maximum r2 score of 0 8625 for region r1 to r4 6 conclusions in this study machine learning and deep learning models are analysed to predict the ground water table of an arid area declared by the government of india based on the study following conclusions are drawn from the correlation matrix it is concluded that the ground water table is highly correlated with the evapotranspiration out of the various machine and deep learning models the multivariate polynomial regression mpr model is best suited for predicting ground water table with minimum mae the mpr model can predict gwt during the design of the canal systems for irrigation author s contribution rajib kumar bhattacharjya conceived

11752,groundwater is one of the most important freshwater resources particularly in dry and semi arid regions with low annual precipitation and frequent droughts for the planning and the management of water resources this is very essential to generate a soft computing method that can predict or forecast groundwater table gwt the different machine and deep learning algorithms are evaluated in this

score of 0 82 0 88 graphical abstract image 1 keywords evapotranspiration machine deep learning nash sutcliffe efficiency r2 score 1 introduction injudicious use and long term mismanagement of freshwater and rapid urban development due to ever increasing anthropogenic activities have had a significant impact on the water cycle resulting in water scarcity increased pollution of rivers and streams and degraded ecosystems around the world furthermore the effects of global warming and climate change on the hydrosphere and biosphere are already being observed threatening the sustainability of water systems and ecosystems groundwater is one of the most important sources of drinking and domestic use groundwater is also essential for rapid agricultural growth and industrial developments it is the only reliable source of supply in some areas while in some other regions it is chosen because of its easy availability more than 90 of groundwater in india is used for irrigated agriculture and 85 for drinking purposes roughly 80 of india s residents depend on groundwater for drinking and irrigation one of the most challenging tasks of the twenty first century is ensuring sustainable water supplies for the home and agricultural sectors in the face of climate change effective water resource planning and management employing modern scientific methods and procedures is necessary to solve this concern groundwater modelling has developed as a viable scientific technique to help decision makers establish sustainable management plans for the optimal exploitation and conservation of this critical resource the relationships between hydro meteorological variables such as rainfall temperature river stage pumping evapotranspiration and so on and groundwater levels are highly complex and non linear furthermore groundwater processes display a significant degree of geographical and temporal variability within and between basins making groundwater modelling difficult for academics and water managers models provide an efficient tool for modelling complex natural systems however the amount of data and information required to develop process based groundwater flow transport models are enormous many of these data and information are typically expensive and or difficult to obtain particularly in developing countries in such cases data driven empirical models which require less data and effort are appealing options for modelling natural systems as a result machine learning ml techniques such as the artificial neural network ann and its various variants have been widely applied in hydrological sciences including groundwater hydrology one of the most significant issues in most developing countries is the scarcity of groundwater level data at appropriate geographical and temporal dimensions and data discontinuity including india as a result large scale groundwater modelling including data driven modelling is complex in many world regions particularly in developing countries considering existing limits and a review of the literature the primary purpose of this research is to provide a realistic scientific framework for forecasting seasonal groundwater oscillations at a small scale the data driven modelling approach created in this study will be beneficial for predicting groundwater levels at bigger scales in data limited environments 2 literature study adamowski and chan studied a wavelet based neural network for prediction of ground water table using average monthly precipitation temperature and ground water level data the proposed methodology was superior to

resources in agricultural zones where there were drainage systems in river valleys this study utilized two soft computing techniques an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and an artificial

two inspection wells near lake okeechobee in florida moghaddam et al 2019 studied the conceptual model modflow the bayesian network bn and the artificial neural network ann models to forecast monthly groundwater level in birjand aquifer south khorasan iran dhaigude and ajmera 2020 studied the artificial neural network model for forecasting groundwater level in ujjain district of madhya pradesh india affandi and watanabe 2007 karimi rizvandi et al 2021 used a self learning bayesian network model to compare metaheuristic algorithms for groundwater potential mapping shiri et al 2021 developed the artificial intelligence models for well groundwater quality simulation and hai tao et al 2022 presented a literature study of machine learning models for groundwater level prediction in this study machine learning algorithms are adopted to predict the water table depth of groundwater table for the vidisha district madhya pradesh india 3 study area data processing this study is based on open wells located in the vidisha district of madhya pradesh as shown in fig 1 the area of the district is 7371 square kilometers it is geographically lies in between 22020 to 24 22 north latitude 77 16 to 78 18 east longitude and 424 m above msl the most part of this district more than 80 lies in betwa river basin the average rainfall of this district is 113 55 cm which mostly comes from southwest monsoon may is the hottest for the community at a temperature of 41 7 c and december is the coldest at 8 9 c in this study the whole district is divided into four regions based on the location of the rain gauge stations the raw data was recorded manually based on the daily rainfall the dataset consists of daily rainfall data obtained from january 1995 to december 2019 from the hydrometeorology department wrd bhopal m p the seasonal groundwater table data has been collected from the superintending geohydrologist ground water circle wrd bhopal m p which is further pre processed by selecting the 10 most staggering wells in each region averaging is being done the reference evapotranspiration data has been collected from the website www mpwrd gov in initially the reliability of the dataset is checked by applying some statistical methods i e outlier detection and probability distribution plots the missing values are handled by using the sci kit learn library and pandas mckinney and others 2010 pedregosa 2011 the daily rainfall data is converted into seasonal rainfall data employing summing up the daily rainfall data table 1 presents the processed dataset used for the study correlation analysis is performed to check the dependency of the input and output parameters the results of the correlation analysis are presented in table 2 it is clear that the evapotranspiration rate is highly correlated with the actual groundwater level the correlation coefficient between the chosen input variables is very low which reduces the chances of over fitting as high correlation between input variables leads to overfitting 4 methodology machine learning ml is a sub field of artificial intelligence ai that enables computer to learn the mathematical relationship between inputs and output based on the training data ml is broadly divided into three groups i e supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning the association is identified and modelled in this work using supervised learning by fitting a linear or non linear model to the training data multivariate polynomial regression mpr model decision tree regression dtr model multivariate linear regression mlr model random forest regression rfr model support vector regression svr model and artificial neural network ann model and anfis model are some of the machine learning algorithms used in this study in this study supervised learning is used to identify and model the relationship by fitting a linear or non linear model to the training data various ml algorithms used in this study are multivariate linear regression mlr model multivariate polynomial regression mpr model support vector regression svr model decision tree regression dtr model random forest regression rfr model and two deep learning algorithms used for the study are artificial neural network ann model and anfis fig 2 4 1 machine learning algorithms 4 1 1 linear model in this model a linear relationship is established between the inputs and output variables while minimizing the mean squared error mse and the equation obtained can be written as a multivariate linear regression mlr model 1 y c i 1 n w i x i b multivariate polynomial regression mpr model 2 y c i 1 a 1 i n a m w i x i a where y is predicted output c is bias or regression constant wi is regression coefficient xi is input variable n is number of inputs and m is exponential during training of the model eqs 1 and 2 are trained using cost function eq 3 which is guided by stochastic gradient descent technique to minimize the error associated with the training data 3 c o s t f u n c t i o n m s e j 1 m y a c t u a l y p r e d i c t e d 2 m where mse is mean squared error m is number of training data yactual is actual output and ypredicted is predicted output 4 1 2 non linear model in this type of ml a non linear relationship is established between input variables and output variable such that the error is minimized a support vector regression svr model in this type of regression model despite of reducing the error svr permits the flexibility to define the permissible error and specify an approximate plane hyper plane to fit the training data the objective of svr is to optimize the coefficient of weight such that the error is within the permissible limit svr is further discussed in awad and khanna 2015 smola and schölkopf 2004 suthaharan 2016 b decision tree regression dtr model in this type of ml model the regression model is built in the tree structure it breaks the data into smaller subsets to reduce standard deviation while simultaneously a decision tree is incrementally developed the final results are a tree with a decision node dtr is briefly discussed in suthaharan 2016 c random forest regression rfr model the prediction is based on the average of the outputs produced from each decision tree in random forest regression rfr which comprises of numerous decision trees it is part of a family of ensemble machine learning algorithms that create several decision trees dts and aggregate their findings to predict a response given a collection of predictors matrix of training data a unique bootstrap sample of the training data is used to create each tree in the forest rfr takes the best split from a randomly selected subset of predictors in contrast other machine learning methods e g bagging and boot strapping utilise the best split among all predictors for node splitting by adding randomization to the equation the correlation between trees in the forest is reduced which improves accuracy furthermore unlike linear regression rfr does not require the target predictors probability distribution to be assumed and it is resistant to nonlinearity and overfitting however when noisy data is being simulated over fitting might arise 4 2 deep learning 4 2 1 artificial neural network ann model artificial neural networks anns the mathematical link between input and output variables may be obtained using biological neural networks as inspiration the input hidden and output layers are the three layers of an ann model each layer has a set of nodes linked by synaptic weights that vary during the model s training phase each node is assigned an activation function a weighted sum is calculated at each node and this weighted sum is passed through the activation function associated with the node and output known as forward propagation in backward propagation error is minimized using optimizers training of the ann model takes place in two phases as described below forward phase in forward phase random input data is used to obtain the values of outputs of every hidden layer neuron grounded on the present value of weight and nature of activation function it is named forward phase because all computations inherently occur in forward direction across the layers this phase aims to obtain all the synaptic weight of hidden layer neuron and output for a given input finally the error at each output node is calculated and the cost function is computed when the calculation is completed 4 e r r o r e y a c t u a l y p r e d i c t 5 c o s t f u n c t i o n l 1

the cost function over the output so the gradient computation s initialization started subsequently the derivative is fed backward using the multivariable chain rule of partial differentiation the weights are adjusted to minimize cost function so the stochastic gradient descent technique is used ann is briefly explained in hanna 2004 4 2 2 artificial neuro fuzzy inference system anfis one of

in the different layers of a feed forward network that handles fuzzy parameters anfis can take crisp input represent membership functions and fuzzy rules and generate crisp output out of fuzzy rules for reasoning purposes anfis is becoming popular because it requires a smaller number of input and gives a more accurate result than other models therefore the anfis model with a gaussian membership function has been used to forecast the groundwater table level in the present study anfis is based on a first order takagi sugeno inference system where the input output relationship is linear in this study the anfis training algorithm is a hybrid algorithm see fig 3 5 results discussion various machine intelligence ml dl models are evaluated based on the following statistical parameters dadhich et

calculated using the following formula 11 n s e 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i x i 2 5 1 results of machine learning algorithms 5 1 1 linear model a multivariate linear regression mlr model the results of the mlr model against the actual gwt is shown in fig 4 from fig 4 it is clear that the predicted gwt has a moderate deviation from the actual gwt which is also justified from the high r2 score in the training and the testing phases of the mlr model see tables 3 and 4 b multivariate polynomial regression mpr model the results of the mpr moderate drawn against the actual gwt as shown in fig 5 which established that the predicted gwt mildly deviates from the actual gwt it confirms the better performance of the mpr model over the mlr model the mpr model can be utilized to predict the location of gwt 5 1 2 non linear model a support vector regression svr model the prediction of the svr rbf model enormously deviates from the actual gwt the nse is negative which confirms that the prediction model is very poor and less accurate overall it is concluded that the svr rbf model is not suitable for the prediction of the gwt see table 5 and 6 the prediction of the svr linear model is less deviated than the svr rbf model it confirms the poor accuracy of the svr rbf model for the prediction of the ground water table figs 6 and 7 b decision tree regression dtr model from table 7 it is clear that the performance of the dtr model in the training phase is exceptionally high with an overall r2 score of 0 98 the results show the deviation from the 1 1 line in the testing phase which indicates that the dtr model is over fitting the data which is also justified from fig 8 c random forest regression rfr model table 8 shows the results of the rfr model in the training and the testing phase the performance of the rfr model is consistent in both phases with low mae which justifies the use of the rfr model for the prediction of the gwt see fig 9 5 2 results of deep learning models 5 2 1 artificial neural network the performance of the ann model depends on its architecture which consists of various hyper parameters i e number of hidden layers nodes at each hidden layer activation function optimizer etc to obtain the best architecture hyper parameter tuning is performed using the grid search command from the sci kit learn library the architecture of the ann model used is shown in table 9 the performance of the ann model in the training and the testing phase is shown in table 10 either it is observed that the model s performance is quite good in terms of mae and r2 score still it is observed that instead of generalization the ann model is memorizing the dataset which is visible in the 1 1 plot drawn between actual gwt x axis and predicted gwt y axis in fig 10 5 2 2 artificial neuro fuzzy system the results of the anfis model in the training and the testing phase are shown in the following table 11 the results of the anfis model are drawn in fig 11 against the actual ground water table x axis the predicted gwt is highly deviated from the actual gwt for r2 and r3 which is also cleared from the negative nse and high mae whereas the performance of anfis model is considerably better with less mae in the r1 and r4 regions but this model cannot be used for the prediction of the gwt 5 3 comparison between machine deep learning models different machine intelligence models are trained and tested to predict the groundwater table three statistical parameters are selected randomly for comparison among the models i e mae r2 score and nse presented in table 12 the svr rbf model is the least suitable or unsuitable for the prediction of the groundwater table as the mae is relatively high mae 1 m and negative nse the performance of the mpr model is the best among all the machine intelligent models with average minimum mae of 0 705 m and average maximum r2 score of 0 8625 for region r1 to r4 6 conclusions in this study machine learning and deep

11753,seawater intrusion is one of the most severe problems confronting coastal aquifers these aquifers are often considered significant freshwater sources particularly in arid regions the water resources mobilized at the al hoceima northeastern morocco come from the ghiss nekkor aquifer and the abdelkarim el khattabi dam the degradation of groundwater quality of the aquifer and the probability of marine intrusion has become a severe concern for the communities the current study provides multidisciplinary research using hydrogeochemical and statistical approaches to evaluate groundwater quality and determine the origin of salinity in this aquifer depending on the direction of the water flow he results indicate that most wells have a total salinity exceeding 2 g l the dominant chemical facies encountered are na cl na so4 resulting from rock water interaction meaning that the breakdown of halite was the predominant source of groundwater mineralization however septic waste water irrigation inflows and locally seawater intrusion seem to substantially influence groundwater quality in this area graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogeochemistry statistical analysis groundwater quality seawater intrusion ghiss nekkor aquifer 1 introduction groundwater is adopted as a strategic source of drinking water in semi arid and arid climates at least half of the world s population uses groundwater for drinking connor 2015 about one third of the world s population relies on groundwater to satisfy its daily requirements bieranye et al 2016 unesco 2012 and it is suspected that this is attributable to a decrease in the quality and availability of surface water resources beyene et al 2019 globally approximately 2 1 billion people currently lack access to safe drinking water who 2017 when aquifers hydraulically connected to the sea are subjected to excessive pumping disequilibrium occurs and the hydraulic gradient reverses this causes seawater to move inland producing what is known as seawater intrusion dunlop et al 2019 sato and iwasa 2011 the consequence is salinization of groundwater and deterioration of aquifer quality gaaloul and cheng 2003 seawater intrusion is the most severe environmental threat to morocco s coastal aquifers benabdelouahab et al 2018 elmeknassi et al 2021 the impacts of recent climate change on precipitation and temperature and vertical groundwater movements affected by natural and anthropogenic processes are leading the freshwater seawater interface to advance and retreat kazakis et al 2016 the groundwater recharge and discharge balance determine the extent to which saltwater infiltrates the piezometric level of the aquifer the distance from the aquifer to the saltwater sources and its geological structure kumar 2015 salinization of coastal aquifers may be attributed to direct saltwater intrusion or to a variety of complicated geochemical processes that affect water quality in a variety of ways including water rock interactions brine mobilization and anthropogenic pollution mondal et al 2010 in this context it is critical to understand the chemical mechanisms behind the salinization of coastal aquifers to manage these vulnerable water resources in the future morocco s groundwater salinization has been intensively investigated in the last years elgettafi et al 2013 elmeknassi et al 2021 himi et al 2017 understanding the source of groundwater salinity is critical for effective aquifer management kamal et al 2021 rochdane et al 2022 groundwater s chemical composition is strongly altered by the liquid phase and the solid matrix interactions mahlknecht et al 2017 chemical interactions have been studied using hydrogeochemistry approaches such as minor major and trace elements ionic ratios ionic deltas mixing calculations and geochemical modelling liu et al 2017 geochemical analyses of groundwater can provide valuable information and explain possible areas of salinization their source and related geochemical processes in the saltwater freshwater transition zone panteleit et al 2001 the hfe graphic developed by giménez forcada 2010 is a diagram that explains the hydrochemistry of intrusion and recovery of marine intrusion related processes in an aquifer system however it may be substituted by other hydrochemical diagrams such as the piper diagram multivariate data analysis is used to categorize variables and observable units and define their relationship the procedures for classification are non hierarchical and hierarchical clusters analysis and discriminant analysis several techniques quantify those statistical parameters that distinguish groups from previous data integrated research of hydrogeochemical and statistical analytic methodologies was carried out to understand the source of groundwater salinity and the causes of pollution in the ghiss nekkor aquifer it is common practice to utilize chemical elements and statistical analysis to determine the complex contribution of many different sources to a simple combination of them the relationships between major ions and cl br ratio are very dependable and widely used methodologies for assessing the source of salinity and contaminants 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the ghiss nekkor aquifer is located in al hoceima province northeast of morocco it is a coastal plain covering an area of 100 km2 drained and crossed by two rivers nekkor river in the centre of the site from south to north and ghiss river in the ouest part fig 1 from a geological perspective the study area is a plio quaternary alluvial deposit with a predominance of detrital sediments mainly gravel sand silt and clay resting on a bedrock formed by blue shales marls and primary quartzites and silts of middle and ancient quaternary age in the east and southwest we find a series of grey or black sericite schists with quartzite banks of the albo aptian and the simultaneous presence of dolomites in addition volcanic formations are arranged in an andesitic flow to the north of the plain we find successively in the west flysch a series of marl sandstone and microbrecciated limestone banks of eocene of the nappe of ajdir to have a better understanding of the lithological complexity of the aquifer we represent the lithological logs of some boreholes 36 5 50 5 252 5 1685 5 and 268 which shows a variety of facies fig 2 towards the centre we find a more critical dominance of sands silts silty clays gravels and marls marly sands along the ghiss river as well as to the west we note the

highly mineralized between 1000 and 5035 mg l the spatial distribution fig 4 a of tds shows the increase of the saline load towards the outlets sea ghiss and nekkor rivers with concentrations above 2500 mg l the highest tds values were recorded mainly in the north ait youssef ou ali and ahdid electrical conductivity ec is a good indicator for determining the degree of overall mineralization of water electrical conductivity obtained from this analysis are included between 2280 μs cm and 10 070 μs cm with an average of 4433 μs cm 0 4 μs cm fig 4b thus its values indicate a significant variation in the chemical components of the water the lowest value corresponds to well n 9 2280 while the highest value has been recorded in the well n 16 10 070 according to the standards recommended by the who 2011 for the assessment of overall groundwater quality where the electrical conductivity of groundwater should not exceed 2700 μs cm generally the electrical conductivity is beyond the threshold of the standards defined by who only about 8 22 of the samples meet these standards the remaining 91 78 have conductivity between 2747 and 10 070 μs cm indicating mineralized waters and are unfit for human consumption the hydrogen potential ph and temperature values of the studied well water are in the normal range of the world health organization who 2011 guidelines more than 79 of the water in the ghiss nekkor aquifer has a ph above 7 they vary between 6 6 and 8 0 for ph and 18 1 c and 25 4 c for temperature therefore the proof is made that these waters studied come from shallower

in geochemical characteristics yang et al 2016 the hydrochemical facies of the ghiss nekkor aquifer is given in fig 6 for this investigation a modified piper diagram kelly 2005 was used from the analysis of this diagram we observe two types of chemical facies chloride and sulfate calcic and magnesic and chloride sodium or sulfate sodium with a tendency to the chloride and sulfate poles for the anions subtriangle and a tendency towards the calcium and magnesium poles for the cations subtriangle the waters of some local wells tend different facies chloride calcic for the waters of azrar and beni bouayach however the sulfated calcic facies exist and is observed in the water points of ait youssef ou ali the values generated from the analysis of groundwater samples from the ghiss nekkor aquifer and plotted on piper s diagram reveal that the loss of sodium could be accounted by the cation exchange process and by carbonates equilibrium as are the elevated ca2 concentrations and decrease in na levels explained by the retention of na by exchange with ca2 and mg2 see table 1 4 3 statistical analysis 4 3 1 correlation analysis since the correlation factor is applied as a preliminary assessment of the hydrochemical source of the facies and to make suggestions of possible geochemical processes that may be controlling the origin of water chemistry establishing the significant source of salinity based on tds and ec a bivariate correlation technique is initially applied assuming that a correlation factor r2 0 5 implies a statistically significant degree of correlation ec and tds show a good correlation with cl na and mg2 table 2 suggesting that these elements are the principal sources of mineralization there was also a good and positive correlation between cl and na and cl and mg2 demonstrating that these elements could be originated from seawater and weathering of chloride minerals nacl mgcl so4 2 is significantly correlated with ca2 and mg2 r2 0 78 and 0 56 respectively suggesting that they probably have an evaporite origin camgso4 in addition no3 shows a strong correlation with k r2 0 82 suggesting an anthropogenic source of these ions no relationship was found between ca2 mg2 and hco3 indicating that carbonate alteration did not significantly regulate the origin of sulfate in the groundwater under investigation 4 3 2 principal component analysis pca to determine the most significant elements affecting groundwater chemistry a principal component analysis pca was done eleven hydrochemical variables were considered ec tds mg2 ca2 k na so4 br cl hco3 and no3 two factors f1 and f2 allowed us to reinforce the perceived tendencies and to classify the variables into four distinct groups fig 7 a na cl mg2 ec and total dissolved solids tds comprise the first correlation group no3 and k the second group and ca2 and so4 2 make up the third group hco3 make alone the fourth group the horizontal axis is used to plot pc 1 and the vertical axis is used to plot pc 2 fig 7b this proportion is modest implying that the variance is only somewhat structured this is because the chemistry of water is influenced by various variables trabelsi et al 2012 the ﬁrst component pc1 entered at 38 51 of the variance is highly related to the ec tds mg2 cl and na which explains the dissolution of sedimentary and evaporate rocks that are present in the ghiss nekkor aquifer benyoussef et al 2021 or seawater intrusion as a reason this component represents the signature indication of the water rock interaction process the second component pc2 which contains in majority so4 2 and ca2 explains 12 75 of the variation and indicates gypsum dissolution anthropogenic activities and their effects on the ghiss nekkor aquifer is mainly related to the no3 and k chemical fertilizers 4 4 groundwater salinization processes 4 4 1 gibbs diagram gibbs r j 1970 describes five mechanisms precipitation dominance evaporation rock dominance precipitation and mixing that control the overall groundwater chemistry fig 8 the majority of the groundwater samples are near seawater and are plotted graphically in the upper right corner of the gibbs diagram indicating that groundwater of ghiss nekkor is mainly influenced by evaporation processes and mixing with seawater to highlight and define the processes involved in groundwater salinization various chemical correlations were established fig 9 illustrate a correlation between cl br and cl chloride and bromide ions are assumed to be conservative groundwater components since they do not interact in ion exchange or redox reactions and do not produce an insoluble precipitate daniele et al 2011 davis et al 1998 chloride shows high concentrations in the wells 35 13 and 16 is generally near the coastal fringe the salinity of these samples is probably attributed to seawater intrusion this growth is associated with the dissolution of marine aerosols rich in chloride aquifer saltwater intrusion may be caused by deep faults cutting through impermeable layers of clays and silts or by lateral facies alteration in shallow deposits which might explain the occurrence of saltwater a high cl br ratio is almost always considered a good predictor of domestic water impact vengosh and pankratov 1998 the existence of polluted discharges without prior treatment agricultural products and wastewater can also explain the high chloride concentration in areas far from the threat of maritime intrusion the samples collected in the ghiss nekkor plain indicate cl br variations in the range of 73 4 710 with an average value of 273 1 most samples are distributed between agricultural pollution and septic waste with a tendency to leach evaporate rocks fig 9 cl br ratios enabled the identification of two major sources of human induced pollution i septic effluents particularly in urban zones where houses lack proper sanitation systems and ii synthetic fertilizers used in agriculture similar behaviour is shown in the neogene basin of the coastal aquifer of bou areg re et al 2013 4 4 2 ionic deviation versus conservative freshwater fw seawater mixture swmix to

tellam 1995 thus these measurements get it because of its high solubility cl is seldom eliminated from the system appelo and postma 1993 to investigate potential mixing with seawater fig 10 correlates major elements with cl ions which can identify the source of salinity and function as a tracer for mixing ako et al 2011 re et al 2013 xing et al 2013 the excess of ca for all samples is also clearly observed fig 10 therefore 76 71 of the sampling points show ca2 values above the maximum permissible limit according to who 200 mg l this excess of ca content has also been observed by other authors chafouq et al 2018 and implicated in various processes including gypsum and calcite dissolution noting also that dissolution of gypsum and evaporation of accumulated water from the abdelkarim el khattabi dam before infiltration plays a significant role in increasing ca2 in the groundwater of the plain the ionic relationship between cl and mg2 fig 10 shows a moderate correlation in general higher ca2 and mg2 with increasing cl values may be attributed to reverse ion exchange jankowski et al 1998 or salt minerals weathering the dissolution of sedimentary and evaporate rocks that dominate the aquifer of ghiss nekkor is most likely to blame for the high sulfate concentration several coastal wells are on the na cl correlation line and are located ne of the plain this suggests the presence of a freshwater saltwater mixing mechanism that is not accompanied by ionic exchange processes since cl is significantly correlated to na for most groundwater samples collected in the ghiss nekkor aquifer they likely come from the dissociation of halite or seawater intrusion we also note an excess of na 13 16 and 22 somewhat related to the dissolution of sodium aluminosilicates than halite which releases one cl for one na 4 4 3 hydrochemical facies evolution diagram as per appelo willemsen 1987 the penetration of seawater in a freshwater aquifer triggers the inverse base exchange phenomenon by releasing ca2 and the fixation of na by the aquifer matrix in contrast na release and ca2 fixation direct base exchange phenomenon proceed during the refreshing above 71 of the samples are situated in the mix na cl intrusion zone fig 11 in comparison more points are localized in the freshening area and achieve the mixna hco3 and na hco3 facies this indicates that the aquifer is ruled by the intrusion phase caused by an inadequacy of the recharge since the substage has evolved from 5 to 34 the reversed bases exchange phenomena can describe the formation of the facies mix ca cl fig 11 induced by seawater intrusion and results in the aquifer matrix fixing na and liberating ca2 this suggestion is corroborated by the existence of the i3 sub stage 39 and sw 5 conclusions the present research based on hydrogeochemical parameters combined with statistical analysis showed that local sea intrusion evaporite dissolution and anthropogenic processes drive groundwater mineralization comparing the data to who drinking water standards show that water quality deteriorates water sampled in wells 10 35 and 36 located in the ajdir west area wells 13 16 and 58 located in the northeast area ahdid well 65 located near trougout east area and well 22 situated between beni bouayach and imzouren have concentrations above the drinking water law limitations and should thus be treated before to human use the findings of this research along with other data on water quality should be taken into account when formulating plans to ensure that people have safe drinking water moreover the geographical distribution of mineralization revealed that the degradation in groundwater quality was concentrated in the downstream area geospatial analysis indicated significant spatial variation and heterogeneity in water quality measurements in the study area seawater intrusion is caused by normal faults along the plain to the west and east through which marine waters flow funding

11753,seawater intrusion is one of the most severe problems confronting coastal aquifers these aquifers are often considered significant freshwater sources particularly in arid regions the water resources mobilized at the al hoceima northeastern morocco come from the ghiss nekkor aquifer and the abdelkarim el khattabi dam the degradation of groundwater quality of the aquifer and the probability of marine intrusion has become a severe concern for the communities the current study provides multidisciplinary research using hydrogeochemical and statistical approaches to evaluate groundwater quality and determine the origin of salinity in this aquifer depending on the direction of the water flow he results indicate that most wells have a total salinity exceeding 2 g l the dominant chemical facies encountered are na cl na so4 resulting from rock water interaction meaning that the breakdown of halite was the predominant source of groundwater mineralization however septic waste water irrigation inflows and locally seawater intrusion seem to substantially influence groundwater quality in this area graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogeochemistry statistical analysis groundwater quality seawater intrusion ghiss nekkor aquifer 1 introduction groundwater is adopted as a strategic source of drinking water in semi arid and arid climates at least half of the world s population uses groundwater for drinking connor 2015 about one third of the world s population relies on groundwater to satisfy its daily requirements bieranye et al 2016 unesco 2012 and it is suspected that this is attributable to a decrease in the quality and availability of surface water resources beyene et al 2019 globally approximately 2 1 billion people currently lack access to safe drinking water who 2017 when aquifers hydraulically connected to the sea are subjected to excessive pumping disequilibrium occurs and the hydraulic gradient reverses this causes seawater to move inland producing what is known as seawater intrusion dunlop et al 2019 sato and iwasa 2011 the consequence is salinization of groundwater and deterioration of aquifer quality gaaloul and cheng 2003 seawater intrusion is the most severe environmental threat to morocco s coastal aquifers benabdelouahab et al 2018 elmeknassi et al 2021 the impacts of recent climate change on precipitation and temperature and vertical groundwater movements affected by natural and anthropogenic processes are leading the freshwater seawater interface to advance and retreat kazakis et al 2016 the groundwater recharge and discharge balance determine the extent to which saltwater infiltrates the piezometric level of the aquifer the distance from the aquifer to the saltwater sources and its geological structure kumar 2015 salinization of coastal aquifers may be attributed to direct saltwater intrusion or to a variety of complicated geochemical processes that affect water quality in a variety of ways including water rock interactions brine mobilization and anthropogenic pollution mondal et al 2010 in this context it is critical to understand the chemical mechanisms behind the salinization of coastal aquifers to manage these vulnerable water resources in the future morocco s groundwater salinization has been intensively investigated in the last years elgettafi et al 2013 elmeknassi et al

their source and related geochemical processes in the saltwater freshwater transition zone panteleit et al 2001 the hfe graphic developed by giménez forcada 2010 is a diagram that explains the hydrochemistry of intrusion and recovery of marine intrusion related processes in an aquifer system however it may be substituted by other hydrochemical diagrams such as the piper diagram multivariate data analysis is used to categorize variables and observable units and define their relationship the procedures for classification are non hierarchical and hierarchical clusters analysis and discriminant analysis several techniques quantify those statistical parameters that distinguish groups from previous data integrated research of hydrogeochemical and statistical analytic methodologies was carried out to understand the source of groundwater salinity and the causes of pollution in the ghiss nekkor aquifer it is common practice to utilize chemical elements and statistical analysis to determine the complex contribution of many different sources to a simple combination of them the relationships between major ions and cl br ratio are very dependable and widely used methodologies for assessing the source of salinity and contaminants 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the ghiss nekkor aquifer is located in al hoceima province northeast of morocco it is a coastal plain covering an area of 100 km2 drained and crossed by two rivers nekkor river in the centre of the site from south to north and ghiss river in the ouest part fig 1 from a geological perspective the study area is a plio quaternary alluvial deposit with a predominance of detrital sediments mainly gravel sand silt and clay resting on a bedrock formed by blue shales marls and primary quartzites and silts of middle and ancient quaternary age in the east and southwest we find a series of grey or black sericite schists with quartzite banks of the albo aptian and the simultaneous presence of dolomites in addition volcanic formations are arranged in an andesitic flow to the north of the plain we find successively in the west flysch a series of marl sandstone and microbrecciated limestone banks of eocene of the nappe of ajdir to have a better understanding of the lithological complexity of the aquifer we represent the lithological logs of some boreholes 36 5 50 5 252 5 1685 5 and 268 which

preliminary assessment of the hydrochemical source of the facies and to make suggestions of possible geochemical processes that may be controlling the origin of water chemistry establishing the significant source of salinity based on tds and ec a bivariate correlation technique is initially applied assuming that a correlation factor r2 0 5 implies a statistically significant degree of correlation ec and tds show a good correlation with cl na and mg2 table 2 suggesting that these elements are the principal sources of mineralization there was also a good and positive correlation between cl and na and cl and mg2 demonstrating that these elements could be originated from seawater and weathering of chloride minerals nacl mgcl so4 2 is significantly correlated with ca2 and mg2 r2 0 78 and 0 56 respectively suggesting that they probably have an evaporite origin camgso4 in addition no3 shows a strong correlation with k r2 0 82 suggesting an anthropogenic source of these ions no relationship was found between ca2 mg2 and hco3 indicating that carbonate alteration did not significantly regulate the origin of sulfate in the groundwater under investigation 4 3 2 principal component analysis pca to determine the most significant elements affecting groundwater chemistry a principal component analysis pca was done eleven hydrochemical variables were considered ec tds mg2 ca2 k na so4 br cl hco3 and no3 two factors f1 and f2 allowed us to reinforce the perceived tendencies and to classify the variables into four distinct groups fig 7 a na cl mg2 ec and total dissolved solids tds comprise the first correlation group no3 and k the second group and ca2 and so4 2 make up the third group hco3 make alone the fourth group the horizontal axis is used to plot pc 1 and the vertical axis is used to plot pc 2 fig 7b this proportion is modest implying that the variance is only somewhat structured this is because the chemistry of water is influenced by various variables trabelsi et al 2012 the ﬁrst component pc1 entered at 38 51 of the variance is highly related to the ec tds mg2 cl and na which explains the dissolution of sedimentary and evaporate rocks that are present in the ghiss nekkor aquifer benyoussef et al 2021 or seawater intrusion as a reason this component represents the signature indication of the water rock interaction process the second component pc2 which contains in majority so4 2 and ca2 explains 12 75 of the variation and indicates gypsum dissolution anthropogenic activities and their effects on the ghiss nekkor aquifer is mainly related to the no3 and k chemical fertilizers 4 4 groundwater salinization processes 4 4 1 gibbs diagram gibbs r j 1970 describes five mechanisms precipitation dominance evaporation rock dominance precipitation and mixing that control the overall groundwater chemistry fig 8 the majority of the groundwater samples are near seawater and are plotted graphically in the upper right corner of the gibbs diagram indicating that groundwater of ghiss nekkor is mainly influenced by evaporation processes and mixing with seawater to highlight and define the processes involved in groundwater salinization various chemical correlations were established fig 9 illustrate a correlation between cl br and cl chloride and bromide ions are assumed to be conservative groundwater components since they do not interact in ion exchange or redox reactions and do not produce an insoluble precipitate daniele et al 2011 davis et al 1998 chloride shows high concentrations in the wells 35 13 and 16 is generally near the coastal fringe the salinity of these samples is probably attributed to seawater intrusion this growth is associated with the dissolution of marine aerosols rich in chloride aquifer saltwater intrusion may be caused by deep faults cutting through impermeable layers of clays and silts or by lateral facies alteration in shallow deposits which might explain the occurrence of saltwater a high cl br ratio is almost always considered a good predictor of domestic water impact vengosh and pankratov 1998 the existence of polluted discharges without prior treatment agricultural products and wastewater can also explain the high chloride concentration in areas far from the threat of maritime intrusion the samples collected in the ghiss nekkor plain indicate cl br variations in the range of 73 4 710 with an average value of 273 1 most samples are distributed between agricultural pollution and septic waste with a tendency to leach evaporate rocks fig 9 cl br ratios enabled the identification of two major sources of human induced pollution i septic effluents particularly in urban zones where houses lack proper sanitation systems and ii synthetic fertilizers used in agriculture similar behaviour is shown in the neogene basin of the coastal aquifer of bou areg re et al 2013 4 4 2 ionic deviation versus conservative freshwater fw seawater mixture swmix to

tellam 1995 thus these measurements get it because of its high solubility cl is seldom eliminated from the system appelo and postma 1993 to investigate potential mixing with seawater fig 10 correlates major elements with cl ions which can identify the source of salinity and function as a tracer for mixing ako et al 2011 re et al 2013 xing et al 2013 the excess of ca for all samples is also clearly observed fig 10 therefore 76 71 of the sampling points show ca2 values above the maximum permissible limit according to who 200 mg l this excess of ca content has also been observed by other authors chafouq et al 2018 and implicated in various processes including gypsum and calcite dissolution noting also that dissolution of gypsum and evaporation of accumulated water from the abdelkarim el khattabi dam before infiltration plays a significant role in increasing ca2 in the groundwater of the plain the ionic relationship between cl and mg2 fig 10 shows a moderate correlation in general higher ca2 and mg2 with increasing cl values may be attributed to reverse ion exchange jankowski et al 1998 or salt minerals weathering the dissolution of sedimentary and evaporate rocks that dominate the aquifer of ghiss nekkor is most likely to blame for the high sulfate concentration several coastal wells are on the na cl correlation line and are located ne of the plain this suggests the presence of a freshwater saltwater mixing mechanism that is not accompanied by ionic exchange processes since cl is significantly correlated to na for most groundwater samples collected in the ghiss nekkor aquifer they likely come from the dissociation of halite or seawater intrusion we also note an excess of na 13 16 and 22 somewhat related to the dissolution of sodium aluminosilicates than halite which releases one cl for one na 4 4 3 hydrochemical facies evolution diagram as per appelo willemsen 1987 the penetration of seawater in a freshwater aquifer triggers the inverse base exchange phenomenon by releasing ca2 and the fixation of na by the aquifer matrix in contrast na release and ca2 fixation direct base exchange phenomenon proceed during the refreshing above 71 of the samples are situated in the mix na cl intrusion zone fig 11 in comparison more points are localized in the freshening area and achieve the mixna hco3 and na hco3 facies this indicates that the aquifer is ruled by the intrusion phase caused by an inadequacy of the recharge since the substage has evolved from 5 to 34 the reversed bases exchange phenomena can describe the formation of the facies mix ca cl fig 11 induced by seawater intrusion and results in the aquifer matrix fixing na and liberating ca2 this suggestion is corroborated by the existence of the i3 sub stage 39 and sw 5 conclusions the present research based on hydrogeochemical parameters combined with statistical analysis showed that local sea intrusion evaporite dissolution and anthropogenic processes drive groundwater mineralization comparing the data to who drinking water standards show that water quality deteriorates water sampled in wells 10 35 and 36 located in the ajdir west area wells 13 16 and 58 located in the northeast area ahdid well 65 located near trougout east area and well 22 situated between beni bouayach and imzouren have concentrations above the drinking water law limitations and should thus be treated before to human use the findings of this research along with other data on water quality should be taken into account when formulating plans to ensure that people have safe drinking water moreover the geographical distribution of mineralization revealed that the degradation in groundwater quality was concentrated in the downstream area geospatial analysis indicated significant spatial variation and heterogeneity in water quality measurements in the study area seawater intrusion is caused by normal faults along the plain to the west and east through which marine waters flow funding

11754,in order to increase the sustainability and conservation of water resources a joint approach of isotopic and hydrochemical techniques was attempted to identify and quantify water sources and favourable recharge areas that would explain the integral functioning of a typically plain catchment chloride and δ18o and δ2h were measured in rain groundwater and pond samples chloride mass balance approach was applied to calculate the recharge and mixed water calculation was carried out using conservative tracers also the local meteoric water line was calculated depleted isotopic and slightly progressive chloride contents are observed and they are grouped around to the local meteoric water line in the upper part and in the west of the lower catchment in the east lower area 20 of recharge is calculated isotopes are more enriched and lower concentration of chloride are observed depleted isotopic fingerprint and low salinity concentration for ballenera pond were identified in a well close to it this work demonstrates that in very flat zones small changes in the hydrologic fluxes can impact on the water table of surface waters and groundwaters leading to establish very local recharge zones that hardly can be recognized in large scale or esatfrequency of measurement but can quiet easily be identified when chemical conservative tracers and water stable isotopes are used also isotopic data demonstrate the importance of shallow wetlands as certain recharge areas to the regional aquifer becoming areas of high groundwater vulnerability graphical abstract image 1 keywords

meteorological phenomena responsible for the transport of water in the different phases of the hydrological cycle produce an isotopic fractionation that can be used to obtain conclusions about its origin and behaviour in particular the isotopic composition of water contains information on seasonality modification due to evaporation processes mixtures etc gat y tzur 1967 gat 1992 1998 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 araguas araguas et al 2000 the knowledge of recharge areas and its behavior in a basin is an essential tool for the sustainable management of groundwater as much it defines the water renewability rates the main water input zones in order to establish protection areas and the main path for solute transport to the aquifer which includes also the contaminant inputs to the aquifer lerner et al 1990 the estimation methods can be classified into four large groups scanlon et al 2002 methods of hydrometeorological balance methods based on studies of surface waters methods of unsaturated zone and methods of saturated zone zs the apparent advantage of the diversity of methods frequently crashes with the observation that they give large different values comparing ones to others risser et al 2005 coes et al 2007 delin et al 2007 huet et al 2016a 2016b walker et al 2019 mohamed et al 2021 in humid plain catchments recharge is often due to infiltration of rainwater and generally favoured by the prevalence of vertical movements associated to the low slopes however the identification of recharge zones usually is not an easy task due to the smooth topography and quite homogenous thickness of unsaturated zone this kind of landscapes are dominating in the pampa plain of argentina a wide region over 1 000 000 km2 where several examples indicate the wide variability of recharge rates obtained from different methods quiroz londoño et al 2012 varni 2013 varni et al 2013a b the differences in the calculated recharge rates by applying different methods in plain humid areas are due to the large uncertainties in the involved parameters estimated values of specific yield assuming that chloride is no existing into the unsaturated zone common discrepancies between the representative period of the considered variables etc in that sense the use of water stable isotopes minimizes several of the mentioned issues because they are part of the water molecule giving the capability of recognize physical processes during recharge however it is generally difficult to quantify recharge rates by using water stable isotopes gaye and edmunds 1996 scanlon et al 2002 then combining different techniques can provide a proxy to determinate preferential recharge areas also providing a quantification of the process in previous studies the recharge of the pampean phreatic aquifer has been determined from several approaches in another regions giving variable results as 50 or 200 mm year venecio and varni 2003 ruiz de galarreta et al 2007 bocanegra et al 2005 ferreira et al 2009 varni y weinzetel 2009 quiroz londoño et al 2012 among others in this sense ferreira et al 2009 have calculated a minimum value of 8 7 of precipitation for the area of rafaela and oliveros in santa fé province and varni y weinzetel 2009 a maximum value of 54 for the area of azul in buenos aires province the main objective of this research is to identify preferential recharge zones by applying isotopes and hydrogeochemical techniques a basin in the pampa plain of argentina on the atlantic coast was selected as the study area this assessment can be extrapolated to other plain catchments being useful for adjusting conceptual models through corrections in their piezometric systems and improving the knowledge of the hydrological system and the management of water resources 2 study area 2 1 location and physiographical features la ballenera creek catchment is placed in the southeast of buenos aires province argentina it is part of the geographical region named interserrana plain where a small streams flow from the tandilia range to the atlantic ocean in an extension of several tens of km fig 1 the area shows a feature system of narrow drainage floodplains with orientation north south perpendicular to the shoreline la ballenera creek follows this general behaviour flowing 30 km from the sources at tandilia slopes towards the discharge into the atlantic it doesn t receive any affluent in its path and to the distal zone it divides into to two branches before it discharges to the ocean fig 1 also the creek feed la ballenera pond near to the mouth stream the gaining behaviour of this creek is reflected in the isopieces maps fig 1 made for the basin calvi et al 2016b 2 2 hydrogeology geomorphology and hydrogeochemical features the hydrogeological basement is the buenos aires complex precambrian formed by migmatites and gneiss and balcarce formation palaeozoic formed by quartzite calvi et al 2020 this basement is covered by the cenozoic sediments known as pampeano sediments fidalgo et al 1975 1991 zárate 2005 zárate and folguera 2009 which constitute a multi layered phreatic semiconfined aquifer sequence these sediments of pliocene pleistocene age are composed of loess like sediments formed by silt and silty sand with variable amounts of calcareous nodules or continuous layered intercalations locally named tosca the thickness of the loess deposits varies between 30 and 100 m with typical hydraulic conductivity 10 m d sala 1975 zárate 2005 porosity of 15 and transmissivity around 800 1000 m2 d the hydrogeological basement is covered by sandy silty sandy silt and silty clayey sediments with different degrees of cementation nodules intercalations of calcareous material fig 2 in the header part of the basin quartzite rock outcrops while towards the middle part of the basin there are thick banks of calcrete that decrease towards the distal part finally near to the coast dunes are the typical morphology and dominating grain size deposits la ballenera is divided in two geomorphological sections figs 1 and 2 upper and lower basin calvi et al 2016a the first one is formed by the morphodynamical units called hill system and the upper part of the morphodynamical unit named plain system the lower basin is formed by the end part of the plain system calvi et al 2016a the hills system fig 2 has slopes from 1 71 to 15 8 with a vadose zone averaging a thickness of 12 m calvi et al 2018 the plain system has slopes lower than 1 7 and a band of dunes along the west coast of the creek which do not continue to the east of the stream fig 2 in this area the vadose zone is very shallow fig 1 calvi et al 2018 small depressions or hollows are more commonly observed towards lower east sector of la ballenera creek these are originated by deflation processes occurred during the arid period of the upper pleistocene holocene del rio et al 2004 climate is humid wet with little or no water deficit and mesothermal type and in summer exists thermal efficiency concentration thornthwaite 1948 the annual average rainfall is 900 mm for the period 1944 2013 and 13 5 c is the annual average temperature chem 2016 the conceptual model proposed for the pampean aquifer in the basin of la ballenera settles that the recharge is due exclusively to the infiltration of precipitation calvi et al 2016a b 2018 2020 and is favoured by the low slope kruse and zimmermann 2002 hydrological balance showed that during autumn winter the precipitation broadly exceeds the evapotranspiration generating an excess which mainly corresponds to infiltration calvi et al 2018 using the hydrometeorological balance method of thornthwaite and matter 1955 calvi et al 2020 have calculated that considering the total precipitation 933 5 mm year a 77 2 evaporates 720 4 mm year and 22 8 infiltrates constituting the recharge 212 9 mm year to the pampeano aquifer it is necessary to clarify that under normal conditions runoff in plain catchments is very small with respect to evaporation and infiltration iriondo 1986 durán 2002 massone 2003 calculated surface runoff values around 4 of total rainfall for areas like la ballenera regarding the distribution of rainfall and water surpluses in the sampled periods calvi et al 2018 determined deficits during the 2013 census although excesses are observed in most of that year while in the 2014 sampling and almost during all the year there are significant excesses of water fig 3 a b respect to the soils type fig 4 at the head of the la ballenera basin the dominant soils are argiudolls a while in the middle part of the basin argiacuolls al soils is observed in the lower section al a have a greater extension in the western area than in the eastern area where as consequence of the hydromorphic features with imperfect drainage in the area al is dominant calvi et al 2020 inta 2011 the chemical composition of groundwater in the upper and in the lower basin is sodium bicarbonate type with a ph slightly alkaline around 7 3 calvi et al 2016b a slightly progressive increase in the mineralization of the water from the north hills sector to the south ocean is observed fig 1 among the major dissolved ions in water chloride is considered a conservative tracer and in fact one of the methods for recharge estimation in based on chloride balance ting et al 1998 custodio 2010 marei et al 2010 gebru and tesfahunegn 2019 in summary there are certain lithological and geomorphological contrast allowing an east west differentiation with respect to the stream in the lower basin identified that to the west of the stream there are some sand accumulations dunes while towards the east there are many small local depressions and a higher content of silt clayey sediments and a low content of sand very fine soils easily flooded figs 2 4 calvi et al 2016a 2020 3 methods groundwater samples were taken on 73 wells with depths around 50 m in october 2013 and july 2014 also monthly rain samples were taken at lmi gauge station situated in the chacra experimental miramar chem latitude 38 10 s longitude 58 0 w from september 2013 to june 2019 isotopes 18o and 2h on

analysed on 8 precipitation samples at the same laboratory results were represented in cl mg l vs δ18o diagram for analysis relation between both conservatives parameters the calculation of mixed water has been carried out using the chloride ion and δ18o custodio and llamas 1983 both chloride ion and δ18o was used in this study due to their conservative nature and the non existence of external

recharge pond water chloride mass balance cmb approach was applied to calculated recharge and the results were compared with values obtained with the water mass balance the cmb method was described by schicht and walton 1961 it considers the relationship between the chloride ion content in rainwater and in groundwater and is calculated the cmb considers that of the total precipitation a part is lost by evapotranspiration and consequently the concentration of chloride in precipitation is increased proportionally to the proportion of water the cmb method assumed that the only source of chloride input is from the rainwater and contribution from other sources such as human activities and weathering are neglected dettinger 1989 wood and sanford 1995 gaye and edmunds 1996 zagana et al 2007 due to the low slope zone and the nature of the system runoff is negligible massone 2003 quiróz et al 2012 recharge can be estimated using equation 3 3 r p cl p cl gw where r is recharge mm year

station local meteoric water line lmwl was defined as δ2h 8 01 δ18o 12 23 and is represented in fig 5 4 2 la ballenera pond july samples in la ballenera pond correspond to the most depleted with

d 8 sample g59 is aligned in a mixing line between the average groundwater with an isotopic composition more depleted and the pond average with an isotopic composition mor enriched fig 5 considering the following data table 1 the mixture percentage of the g59 sample is calculated the estimation of the mixing percentage using chloride and oxygen isotopes calculated in sample well g59 indicated a contribution of 63 53 of water pond and 37 47 of groundwater 4 3 isotopic composition of groundwater groundwater samples were analysed in three separated groups following two main criteria a the first differentiation is done considering the geomorphology and the clear slope differences among upper and lower basin b a secondary differentiation is done at the lower basin because of differences lithology soil types at both sides of the creek and higher frequencies of circular depressions in the east side respect to the west of la ballenera creek table 2 shows the isotopic values plotted in a conventional diagram δ2h vs δ18o isotopic content of groundwaters together with lmwl fig 4 in the upper part and in the west of the lower basin depleted isotopic contents of the same order are observed in both areas groundwater isotopic samples are grouped around to the lmwl fig 5 meanwhile wells located near to the east area have a relatively more enriched isotopic composition some of these samples show evaporation and they are aligned in an evaporation line δ2h 6 5 δ18o 3 2 fig 5 particularly wells g56 and g57 placed next to la ballenera pond shows the highest evaporation figs 5 6 4 4 analysis δ18o vs cl the relation between cl mg l and δ18o in the upper basin and the western sector of the lower basin green and pink groups show relatively constant values of δ18o most of samples are between 6 and 5 fig 7 however in these zones a progressive increase in chloride concentration from 50 mg l to 300 mg l is noted wells sampled in the dune zone have intermediate concentrations of chloride and depleted isotopic contents as shown in fig 7 on the other hand the eastern sector of the lower basin shows values from slightly depleted to more enriched varying from 5 2 to 2 figs 5 7 but less concentration of chloride i e 130 and 180 mg l violet group fig 7 4 5 chloride balance method cmb the parameters applied to calculate recharge using cmb are p mean annual rainfall period 1971

recharge calculate with eq 1 is 212 9 mm year that is an average recharge of 22 8 of the precipitation the recharge cmb value versus δ18o of each well sampled in both censuses is considered in fig 8 in general it follows that the highest recharge of the basin according to cmb is on average about 33 and occurs in the upper part of the basin where the isotopic content is more depleted respect to the lower catchment towards the west these depleted values are maintained as previously indicated but the recharge is reduced by half 17 somewhat higher recharges are observed in the east sector compared to the opposite side around 20 but as mentioned above the isotopic compositions are more enriched 5 discussion monthly rainfall sampling from september 2013 to june 2019 allows to define the local meteoric water line lmwl as δ2h 8 01 δ18o 12 23 which results similar to the lmwl of mar del plata station δ2h 7 9 δ18o 12 87 martínez et al 2020 located 100 km north and to others rainfall isotopic long record stations in pampean region such as ciudad universitaria autonomous city of buenos aires azul and pergamino cities that allow to fix a meteoric water line δ2h 8 25 δ18o 13 44 dapeña and panarello 2004 2007 dapeña 2008 dapeña et al 2010 2013 dapeña personal communication as well as in the southern sector of tandil martínez et al 2017 arithmetic average of δ18o in rains is around 4 7 which is enriched with respect to the regional average value that is around 5 5 dapeña 2008 dapeña et al 2010 martínez et al 2017 the short record of chem measurement compared to the long data from neighboring basins could explain this difference the isotopic range values of monthly precipitation show great variability with extreme values around 8 7 to 0 1 for δ18o in neighboring precipitation stations dapeña et al 2010 and martínez et al 2011 2020 explained these variations through the seasonal convergence of air masses from the tropical atlantic area or polar air masses as well as the predominance of drier winds from the southwest the influenced of el niño southern oscillation phenomenon the intertropical convergence zone itcz and the low level jet occurrence llj also high deuterium excess values observed are typical of rainfall caused by recycled vapour registered for the entire pampean region dapeña and panarello 2004 dapeña et al 2010 2013 dapeña 2008 gonzález et al 2009 martínez et al 2011 2020 additionally d 10 recorded in the chaco pampean plain rainfall by the same authors responds to some of the same phenomena it is important to note that usually shallow groundwater δ18o and δ2h values reflect the local average precipitation composition but are modified to some extent by selective recharge and fractionation processes that may alter the isotopic composition of the precipitation before the water reaches the saturated zone gat and tzur 1967 rainwater in coastal areas can be influenced in its composition by sea spray and the concentration of elements such as chloride and sodium are generally higher than in continental interior areas cruz 2008 cabrera et al 2013 campo et al 2017 vengoechea et al 2018 the basin s proximity to the sea makes it possible to consider the influence of salts from the sea spray generated in the area the small droplets of seawater that are generated in the surf zone basically contributes chloride and sodium to the groundwater through two mechanisms 1 wetting of the ground surface and infiltration of the droplets until they reach the local groundwater level in stormy seasons and 2 evaporation of droplets deposition on the ground of sea salts and redissolution and infiltration of the same with rainwater manzano 1999 barlow 2003 in the δ18o relationship as a function of the cl concentration it is observed that the samples located from the n sector to the sw sector of groundwater exhibit a tendency to increase concentration of chloride without isotopic enrichment which could express dissolution processes of halite fig 7 halite dissolution is a process that can probably occur during the infiltration of rainwater associated with precipitation events that occur after dry periods melo and carol 2019 the sea spray is probably influencing the chemical composition of rainwater by incorporating small amounts of salts although nacl accumulations are not observed in the area neither in the mineralogical composition of the aquifer teruggi 1957 quiroz londoño et al 2012 and there are no dry periods as in arid regions on the other hand the higher concentration of chlorides in the water of the la ballenera pond can be explained from the hydrogeology hydrochemical point of view because the waters of the wetlands located in the discharge zone of the aquifer are somewhat more mineralized than those of the recharge zone because they receive groundwater that has had a longer contact time with the ground minerals manzano 1999 it is also necessary to consider that it is probably also affected by sea spray due to its proximity to the sea manzano 1999 cruz 2008 cabrera et al 2013 previous works in neighboring basins such as el durazno vivoratá and las brusquitas streams determined that the increase in chloride in the direction of groundwater runoff is due to the longer contact time of water with sediments kruse 1986 that situation was also detected by quiroz londoño et al 2008 and glok galli et al 2013 in the southeast of buenos aires province sea spray accumulation can be local sources of increased groundwater salinity in low lying coastal areas it has not been measured and would affect the recharge value by chloride method however its influence would be low because the average value of recharge obtained by the chloride method around 22 8 matches well with the value calculated before in the basin according to water balance calvi et al 2020 two general behaviour patterns through the analysis of conservative chemical chloride and isotopic δ18o parameters are observed fig 7 the first pattern corresponds to the upper basin and the western sector of the lower basin with a relative increase in salinity explained above and a constant relatively depleted δ 18o values around 5 5 that value represents a well approximation of the main composition of the local precipitation indicating that there is no significant fractionation during the recharge process gat y tzur 1967 fontes 1980 and that it is a well mixed system preferably recharged by rainwater nevertheless something different can be observed in the eastern sector in the lower basin fig 7 wells placed near to the coast of la ballenera pond have enriched isotopic composition and higher chloride concentration figs 5 7 they aligned in an evaporation water line which has its origin in the mean groundwater composition fig 5 these samples with d 10 indicate local processes of evaporation prior to infiltration explained because of the low slope and lower permeability the low slope and clayey silt sediment help the rainwater accumulation that is exposed to evaporation processes prior to infiltration modifying its isotopic fingerprint however samples with isotopic enrichment but low chloride concentration are also observed figs 6 7 these samples are located near wetlands either large like la ballenera pond or smaller like local circular depressions formed by deflation processes del rio et al 2004 which are flooded in some periods these circular depressions present a lower salinity with low cl values being mainly recharged by direct rainwater local runoff or receiving discharge from local flow systems this is supported by the fact that the sampled years 2013 and 2014 recorded abundant rainfall and floods in the basin fig 3 and significant water excesses were calculated calvi et al 2018 in the δ18o vs δ2h diagram fig 5 it is observed that g59 has an isotopic resulting from a mixture between the average isotopic composition of the la ballenera pond and the average of groundwater quantification of the interaction between different water sources martínez et al 2007 wang et al 2006 is done the results of the mixing using cl and δ18o indicated that well g59 would be influenced in a percentage slightly higher than 50 by the pond and the rest by groundwater this confirms a contribution from pond to the influence area of this borehole i e influent or losing behavior however samples g58 60 and 120 have an isotopic composition like la ballenera pond but they are placed further north of it although always close to local depressions this could be because the shallow local depressions constitute wetlands that would determine the presence of local recharge to the aquifer the local recharge from wetlands that could be recognized thanks to the chloride and isotope data should produce an upward of the phreatic level determining a different piezometry for the zone and consequently on the hydrogeological conceptual model fig 1 a comparison of water isotopic composition of precipitation and groundwater provides an excellent tool for evaluating the recharge mechanism yeh et al 2014 uugulu and wanke 2020 this type of analysis can be used to understand groundwater recharge processes rather than quantifying groundwater recharge and therefore needs to be used hand in hand with other groundwater recharge estimation methods such as cmb water balance etc gayé and edmunds 1996 scanlon et al 2002 using the cmb method regional and local recharges would be identified throughout the entire basin regional flow lines coming from the upper basin 33 would be added to local recharges in the lower basin probably the somewhat higher recharge values towards the east 20 compared to the west 17 could be explained by the influence of the wetlands to the aquifer 6 conclusions isotopic hydrogeochemical and hydrodynamic interpretation allowed to understand redefining and adjusting the conceptual model it was possible identify preferential recharge areas flow path and changes in the relationship between groundwater and surface water also water balance for the aquifer was taken isotopic analyzes allowed to determine the interactions between meteoric water groundwater and surface water while the identification of the preferential recharge areas and the identification of the main recharge sources was used by analysis of the chloride content the isotopic information and the chloride concentration made it possible to determine the role of wetlands whatever their size and of groundwater identifying a great influence of wetlands on the system it was shown that the wells sampled in the eastern sector have an isotopic fingerprint similar to these wetlands enriched but low chloride concentration compared to the west indicating a strong influence of these shallow wetlands on groundwater recharge piezometric maps in very flat zones can incorporate a large uncertainty as consequence of the extremely low gradients that rarely can be precisely determined using field topography measurements or digital elevation models frequently an error of few centimetres can result in significant changes in the flow system or seasonal changes can mask dominant processes in that sense this work demonstrates that in those areas the isotopic and recharge calculation methods based in chemical tracers can be used to validate the resulting calculated curves and be an indication when more observations are necessaries small changes in the hydrologic fluxes can impact on the water table of surface waters and groundwaters leading to establish very local recharge zones that hardly can be recognized in large scale or frequency of measurement but can quiet easily be identified when chemical conservative tracers chloride and water stable isotopes are used the importance of wetlands is deduced from this work and mainly in this type of agricultural basins where the excessive use of fertilizer and its possible accumulation on the surface in these wetlands could be causing the high values of nitrate found in the free aquifer which would degrade the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11754,in order to increase the sustainability and conservation of water resources a joint approach of isotopic and hydrochemical techniques was attempted to identify and quantify water sources and favourable recharge areas that would explain the integral functioning of a typically plain catchment chloride and δ18o and δ2h were measured in rain groundwater and pond samples chloride mass balance approach was applied to calculate the recharge and mixed water calculation was carried out using conservative tracers also the local meteoric water line was calculated depleted isotopic and slightly progressive chloride contents are observed and they are grouped around to the local meteoric water line in the upper part and in the west of the lower catchment in the east lower area 20 of recharge is calculated isotopes are more enriched and lower concentration of chloride are observed depleted isotopic fingerprint and low salinity concentration for ballenera pond were identified in a well close to it this work demonstrates that in very flat zones small changes in the hydrologic fluxes can impact on the water table of surface waters and groundwaters leading to establish very local recharge zones that hardly can be recognized in large scale or esatfrequency of measurement but can quiet easily be identified when chemical conservative tracers and water stable isotopes are used also isotopic data demonstrate the importance of shallow wetlands as certain recharge areas to the regional aquifer becoming areas of high groundwater vulnerability graphical abstract image 1 keywords

meteorological phenomena responsible for the transport of water in the different phases of the hydrological cycle produce an isotopic fractionation that can be used to obtain conclusions about its

water renewability rates the main water input zones in order to establish protection areas and the main path for solute transport to the aquifer which includes also the contaminant inputs to the aquifer lerner et al 1990 the estimation methods can be classified into four large groups scanlon et al 2002 methods of hydrometeorological balance methods based on studies of surface waters methods of unsaturated zone and methods of saturated zone zs the apparent advantage of the diversity of methods frequently crashes with the observation that they give large different values comparing ones to others risser et al 2005 coes et al 2007 delin et al 2007 huet et al 2016a 2016b walker et al 2019 mohamed et al 2021 in humid plain catchments recharge is often due to infiltration of rainwater and generally favoured by the prevalence of vertical movements associated to the low slopes however the identification of recharge zones usually is not an easy task due to the smooth topography and quite homogenous thickness of unsaturated zone this kind of landscapes are dominating in the pampa plain of argentina a wide region over 1 000 000 km2 where several examples indicate the wide variability of recharge rates obtained from different methods quiroz londoño et al 2012 varni 2013 varni et al 2013a b the differences in the calculated recharge rates by applying different methods in plain humid areas are due to the large uncertainties in the involved parameters estimated values of specific yield assuming that chloride is no existing into the unsaturated zone common discrepancies between the representative period of the considered variables etc in that sense the use of water stable isotopes minimizes several of the mentioned issues because they are part of the water molecule giving the capability of recognize physical processes during recharge however it is generally difficult to quantify recharge rates by using water stable isotopes gaye and edmunds 1996 scanlon et al 2002 then combining different techniques can provide a proxy to determinate preferential recharge areas also providing a quantification of the process in previous studies the recharge of the pampean phreatic aquifer has been determined from several approaches in another regions giving variable results as 50 or 200 mm year venecio and varni 2003 ruiz de galarreta et al 2007 bocanegra et al 2005 ferreira et al 2009 varni y weinzetel 2009 quiroz londoño et al 2012 among others in this sense ferreira et al 2009 have calculated a minimum value of 8 7 of precipitation for the area of rafaela and oliveros in santa fé province and varni y weinzetel 2009 a maximum value of 54 for the area of azul in buenos aires province the main objective of this research is to identify preferential recharge zones by applying isotopes and hydrogeochemical techniques a basin in the pampa plain of argentina on the atlantic coast was selected as the study area this assessment can be extrapolated to other plain catchments being useful for adjusting conceptual models through corrections in their piezometric systems and improving the knowledge of the hydrological system and the management of water resources 2 study area 2 1 location and physiographical features la ballenera creek catchment is placed in the southeast of buenos aires province argentina it is part of the geographical region named interserrana plain where a small streams flow from the tandilia range to the atlantic ocean in an extension of several tens of km fig 1 the area shows a feature system of narrow drainage floodplains with orientation north south perpendicular to the shoreline la ballenera creek follows this general behaviour flowing 30 km from the sources at tandilia slopes towards the discharge into the atlantic it doesn t receive any affluent in its path and to the distal zone it divides into to two branches before it discharges to the ocean fig 1 also the creek feed la ballenera pond near to the mouth stream the gaining behaviour of this creek is reflected in the isopieces maps fig 1 made for the basin calvi et al 2016b 2 2 hydrogeology geomorphology and hydrogeochemical features the hydrogeological basement is the buenos aires complex precambrian formed by migmatites and gneiss and balcarce formation palaeozoic formed by quartzite calvi et al 2020 this basement is covered by the cenozoic sediments known as pampeano sediments fidalgo et al 1975 1991 zárate 2005 zárate and folguera 2009 which constitute a multi layered phreatic semiconfined aquifer sequence these sediments of pliocene pleistocene age are composed of loess like sediments formed by silt and silty sand with variable amounts of calcareous nodules or continuous layered intercalations locally named tosca the thickness of the loess deposits varies between 30 and 100 m with typical hydraulic conductivity 10 m d sala 1975 zárate 2005 porosity of 15 and transmissivity around 800 1000 m2 d the hydrogeological basement is covered by sandy silty sandy silt and silty clayey sediments with different degrees of cementation nodules intercalations of calcareous material fig 2 in the header part of the basin quartzite rock outcrops while towards the middle part of the basin there are thick banks of calcrete that decrease towards the distal part finally near to the coast dunes are the typical morphology and dominating grain size deposits la ballenera is divided in two geomorphological sections figs 1 and 2 upper and lower basin calvi et al 2016a the first one is formed by the morphodynamical units called hill system and the upper part of the morphodynamical unit named plain system the lower basin is formed by the end part of the plain system calvi et al 2016a the hills system fig 2 has slopes from 1 71 to 15 8 with a vadose zone averaging a thickness of 12 m calvi et al 2018 the plain system has slopes lower than 1 7 and a band of dunes along the west coast of the creek which do not continue to the east of the stream fig 2 in this area the vadose zone is very shallow fig 1 calvi et al 2018 small depressions or hollows are more commonly observed towards lower east sector of la ballenera creek these are originated by deflation processes occurred during the arid period of the upper pleistocene holocene del rio et al 2004 climate is humid wet with little or no water deficit and mesothermal type and in summer exists thermal efficiency concentration thornthwaite 1948 the annual average rainfall is 900 mm for the period 1944 2013 and 13 5 c is the annual average temperature chem 2016 the conceptual model proposed for the pampean aquifer in the basin of la ballenera settles that the recharge is due exclusively to the infiltration of precipitation calvi et al 2016a b 2018 2020 and is favoured by the low slope kruse and zimmermann 2002 hydrological balance showed that during autumn winter the precipitation broadly exceeds the evapotranspiration generating an excess which mainly corresponds to infiltration calvi et al 2018 using the hydrometeorological balance method of thornthwaite and matter 1955 calvi et al 2020 have calculated that considering the total precipitation 933 5 mm year a 77 2 evaporates 720 4 mm year and 22 8 infiltrates constituting the recharge 212 9 mm year to the pampeano aquifer it is necessary to clarify that under normal conditions runoff in plain catchments is very small with respect to evaporation and infiltration iriondo 1986 durán 2002 massone 2003 calculated surface runoff values around 4 of total rainfall for areas like la ballenera regarding the distribution of rainfall and water surpluses in the sampled periods calvi et al 2018 determined deficits during the 2013 census although excesses are observed in most of that year while in the 2014 sampling and almost during all the year there are significant excesses of water fig 3 a b respect to the soils type fig 4 at the head of the la ballenera basin the dominant soils are argiudolls a while in the middle part of the basin argiacuolls al soils is observed in the lower section al a have a greater extension in the western area than in the eastern area where as consequence of the hydromorphic features with imperfect drainage in the area al is dominant calvi et al 2020 inta 2011 the chemical composition of groundwater in the upper and in the lower basin is sodium bicarbonate type with a ph slightly alkaline around 7 3 calvi et al 2016b a slightly progressive increase in the mineralization of the water from the north hills sector to the south ocean is observed fig 1 among the major dissolved ions in water chloride is considered a conservative tracer and in fact one of the methods for recharge estimation in based on chloride balance ting et al 1998 custodio 2010 marei et al 2010 gebru and tesfahunegn 2019 in summary there are certain lithological and geomorphological contrast allowing an east west differentiation with respect to the stream in the lower basin identified that to the west of the stream there are some sand accumulations dunes while towards the east there are many small local depressions and a higher content of silt clayey sediments and a low content of sand very fine soils easily flooded figs 2 4 calvi et al 2016a 2020 3 methods groundwater samples were taken on 73 wells with depths around 50 m in october 2013 and july 2014 also monthly rain samples were taken at lmi gauge station situated in the chacra experimental miramar chem latitude 38 10 s longitude 58 0 w from september 2013 to june 2019 isotopes 18o and 2h on

analysed on 8 precipitation samples at the same laboratory results were represented in cl mg l vs δ18o diagram for analysis relation between both conservatives parameters the calculation of mixed water has been carried out using the chloride ion and δ18o custodio and llamas 1983 both chloride ion and δ18o was used in this study due to their conservative nature and the non existence of external

recharge pond water chloride mass balance cmb approach was applied to calculated recharge and the results were compared with values obtained with the water mass balance the cmb method was described by schicht and walton 1961 it considers the relationship between the chloride ion content in rainwater and in groundwater and is calculated the cmb considers that of the total precipitation a part is lost by evapotranspiration and consequently the concentration of chloride in precipitation is increased proportionally to the proportion of water the cmb method assumed that the only source of chloride input is from the rainwater and contribution from other sources such as human activities and weathering are neglected dettinger 1989 wood and sanford 1995 gaye and edmunds 1996 zagana et al 2007 due to the low slope zone and the nature of the system runoff is negligible massone 2003 quiróz et al 2012 recharge can be estimated using equation 3 3 r p cl p cl gw where r is recharge mm year

station local meteoric water line lmwl was defined as δ2h 8 01 δ18o 12 23 and is represented in fig 5 4 2 la ballenera pond july samples in la ballenera pond correspond to the most depleted with

the following data table 1 the mixture percentage of the g59 sample is calculated the estimation of the mixing percentage using chloride and oxygen isotopes calculated in sample well g59 indicated a contribution of 63 53 of water pond and 37 47 of groundwater 4 3 isotopic composition of groundwater groundwater samples were analysed in three separated groups following two main criteria a the first differentiation is done considering the geomorphology and the clear slope differences among upper and lower basin b a secondary differentiation is done at the lower basin because of differences lithology soil types at both sides of the creek and higher frequencies of circular depressions in the east side respect to the west of la ballenera creek table 2 shows the isotopic values plotted in a conventional diagram δ2h vs δ18o isotopic content of groundwaters together with lmwl fig 4 in the upper part and in the west of the lower basin depleted isotopic contents of the same order are observed in both areas groundwater isotopic samples are grouped around to the lmwl fig 5 meanwhile wells located near to the east area have a relatively more enriched isotopic composition some of these samples show evaporation and they are aligned in an evaporation line δ2h 6 5 δ18o 3 2 fig 5 particularly wells g56 and g57 placed next to la ballenera pond shows the highest evaporation figs 5 6 4 4 analysis δ18o vs cl the relation between cl mg l and δ18o in the upper basin and the western sector of the lower basin green and pink groups show relatively constant values of δ18o most of samples are between 6 and 5 fig 7 however in these zones a progressive increase in chloride concentration from 50 mg l to 300 mg l is noted wells sampled in the dune zone have intermediate concentrations of chloride and depleted isotopic contents as shown in fig 7 on the other hand the eastern sector of the lower basin shows values from slightly depleted to more enriched varying from 5 2 to 2 figs 5 7 but less concentration of chloride i e 130 and 180 mg l violet group fig 7 4 5 chloride balance method cmb the parameters applied to calculate recharge using cmb are p mean annual rainfall period 1971

recharge calculate with eq 1 is 212 9 mm year that is an average recharge of 22 8 of the precipitation the recharge cmb value versus δ18o of each well sampled in both censuses is considered in fig 8 in general it follows that the highest recharge of the basin according to cmb is on average about 33 and occurs in the upper part of the basin where the isotopic content is more depleted respect to the lower catchment towards the west these depleted values are maintained as previously indicated but the recharge is reduced by half 17 somewhat higher recharges are observed in the east sector compared to the opposite side around 20 but as mentioned above the isotopic compositions are more enriched 5 discussion monthly rainfall sampling from september 2013 to june 2019 allows to define the local meteoric water line lmwl as δ2h 8 01 δ18o 12 23 which results similar to the lmwl of mar del plata station δ2h 7 9 δ18o 12 87 martínez et al 2020 located 100 km north and to others rainfall isotopic long record stations in pampean region such as ciudad universitaria autonomous city of buenos aires azul and pergamino cities that allow to fix a meteoric water line δ2h 8 25 δ18o 13 44 dapeña and panarello 2004 2007 dapeña 2008 dapeña et al 2010 2013 dapeña personal communication as well as in the southern sector of tandil martínez et al 2017 arithmetic average of δ18o in rains is around 4 7 which is enriched with respect to the regional average value that is around 5 5 dapeña 2008 dapeña et al 2010 martínez et al 2017 the short record of chem measurement compared to the long data from neighboring basins could explain this difference the isotopic range values of monthly precipitation show great variability with extreme values around 8 7 to 0 1 for δ18o in neighboring precipitation stations dapeña et al 2010 and martínez et al 2011 2020 explained these variations through the seasonal convergence of air masses from the tropical atlantic area or polar air masses as well as the predominance of drier winds from the southwest the influenced of el niño southern oscillation phenomenon the intertropical convergence zone itcz and the low level jet occurrence llj also high deuterium excess values observed are typical of rainfall caused by recycled vapour registered for the entire pampean region dapeña and panarello 2004 dapeña et al 2010 2013 dapeña 2008 gonzález et al 2009 martínez et al 2011 2020 additionally d 10 recorded in the chaco pampean plain rainfall by the same authors responds to some of the same phenomena it is important to note that usually shallow groundwater δ18o and δ2h values reflect the local average precipitation composition but are modified to some extent by selective recharge and fractionation processes that may alter the isotopic composition of the precipitation before the water reaches the saturated zone gat and tzur 1967 rainwater in coastal areas can be influenced in its composition by sea spray and the concentration of elements such as chloride and sodium are generally higher than in continental interior areas cruz 2008 cabrera et al 2013 campo et al 2017 vengoechea et al 2018 the basin s proximity to the sea makes it possible to consider the influence of salts from the sea spray generated in the area the small droplets of seawater that are generated in the surf zone basically contributes chloride and sodium to the groundwater through two mechanisms 1 wetting of the ground surface and infiltration of the droplets until they reach the local groundwater level in stormy seasons and 2 evaporation of droplets deposition on the ground of sea salts and redissolution and infiltration of the same with rainwater manzano 1999 barlow 2003 in the δ18o relationship as a function of the cl concentration it is observed that the samples located from the n sector to the sw sector of groundwater exhibit a tendency to increase concentration of chloride without isotopic enrichment which could express dissolution processes of halite fig 7 halite dissolution is a process that can probably occur during the infiltration of rainwater associated with precipitation events that occur after dry periods melo and carol 2019 the sea spray is probably influencing the chemical composition of rainwater by incorporating small amounts of salts although nacl accumulations are not observed in the area neither in the mineralogical composition of the aquifer teruggi 1957 quiroz londoño et al 2012 and there are no dry periods as in arid regions on the other hand the higher concentration of chlorides in the water of the la ballenera pond can be explained from the hydrogeology hydrochemical point of view because the waters of the wetlands located in the discharge zone of the aquifer are somewhat more mineralized than those of the recharge zone because they receive groundwater that has had a longer contact time with the ground minerals manzano 1999 it is also necessary to consider that it is probably also affected by sea spray due to its proximity to the sea manzano 1999 cruz 2008 cabrera et al 2013 previous works in neighboring basins such as el durazno vivoratá and las brusquitas streams determined that the increase in chloride in the direction of groundwater runoff is due to the longer contact time of water with sediments kruse 1986 that situation was also detected by quiroz londoño et al 2008 and glok galli et al 2013 in the southeast of buenos aires province sea spray accumulation can be local sources of increased groundwater salinity in low lying coastal areas it has not been measured and would affect the recharge value by chloride method however its influence would be low because the average value of recharge obtained by the chloride method around 22 8 matches well with the value calculated before in the basin according to water balance calvi et al 2020 two general behaviour patterns through the analysis of conservative chemical chloride and isotopic δ18o parameters are observed fig 7 the first pattern corresponds to the upper basin and the western sector of the lower basin with a relative increase in salinity explained above and a constant relatively depleted δ 18o values around 5 5 that value represents a well approximation of the main composition of the local precipitation indicating that there is no significant fractionation during the recharge process gat y tzur 1967 fontes 1980 and that it is a well mixed system preferably recharged by rainwater nevertheless something different can be observed in the eastern sector in the lower basin fig 7 wells placed near to the coast of la ballenera pond have enriched isotopic composition and higher chloride concentration figs 5 7 they aligned in an evaporation water line which has its origin in the mean groundwater composition fig 5 these samples with d 10 indicate local processes of evaporation prior to infiltration explained because of the low slope and lower permeability the low slope and clayey silt sediment help the rainwater accumulation that is exposed to evaporation processes prior to infiltration modifying its isotopic fingerprint however samples with isotopic enrichment but low chloride concentration are also observed figs 6 7 these samples are located near wetlands either large like la ballenera pond or smaller like local circular depressions formed by deflation processes del rio et al 2004 which are flooded in some periods these circular depressions present a lower salinity with low cl values being mainly recharged by direct rainwater local runoff or receiving discharge from local flow systems this is supported by the fact that the sampled years 2013 and 2014 recorded abundant rainfall and floods in the basin fig 3 and significant water excesses were calculated calvi et al 2018 in the δ18o vs δ2h diagram fig 5 it is observed that g59 has an isotopic resulting from a mixture between the average isotopic composition of the la ballenera pond and the average of groundwater quantification of the interaction between different water sources martínez et al 2007 wang et al 2006 is done the results of the mixing using cl and δ18o indicated that well g59 would be influenced in a percentage slightly higher than 50 by the pond and the rest by groundwater this confirms a contribution from pond to the influence area of this borehole i e influent or losing behavior however samples g58 60 and 120 have an isotopic composition like la ballenera pond but they are placed further north of it although always close to local depressions this could be because the shallow local depressions constitute wetlands that would determine the presence of local recharge to the aquifer the local recharge from wetlands that could be recognized thanks to the chloride and isotope data should produce an upward of the phreatic level determining a different piezometry for the zone and consequently on the hydrogeological conceptual model fig 1 a comparison of water isotopic composition of precipitation and groundwater provides an excellent tool for evaluating the recharge mechanism yeh et al 2014 uugulu and wanke 2020 this type of analysis can be used to understand groundwater recharge processes rather than quantifying groundwater recharge and therefore needs to be used hand in hand with other groundwater recharge estimation methods such as cmb water balance etc gayé and edmunds 1996 scanlon et al 2002 using the cmb method regional and local recharges would be identified throughout the entire basin regional flow lines coming from the upper basin 33 would be added to local recharges in the lower basin probably the somewhat higher recharge values towards the east 20 compared to the west 17 could be explained by the influence of the wetlands to the aquifer 6 conclusions isotopic hydrogeochemical and hydrodynamic interpretation allowed to understand redefining and adjusting the conceptual model it was possible identify preferential recharge areas flow path and changes in the relationship between groundwater and surface water also water balance for the aquifer was taken isotopic analyzes allowed to determine the interactions between meteoric water groundwater and surface water while the identification of the preferential recharge areas and the identification of the main recharge sources was used by analysis of the chloride content the isotopic information and the chloride concentration made it possible to determine the role of wetlands whatever their size and of groundwater identifying a great influence of wetlands on the system it was shown that the wells sampled in the eastern sector have an isotopic fingerprint similar to these wetlands enriched but low chloride concentration compared to the west indicating a strong influence of these shallow wetlands on groundwater recharge piezometric maps in very flat zones can incorporate a large uncertainty as consequence of the extremely low gradients that rarely can be precisely determined using field topography measurements or digital elevation models frequently an error of few centimetres can result in significant changes in the flow system or seasonal changes can mask dominant processes in that sense this work demonstrates that in those areas the isotopic and recharge calculation methods based in chemical tracers can be used to validate the resulting calculated curves and be an indication when more observations are necessaries small changes in the hydrologic fluxes can impact on the water table of surface waters and groundwaters leading to establish very local recharge zones that hardly can be recognized in large scale or frequency of measurement but can quiet easily be identified when chemical conservative tracers chloride and water stable isotopes are used the importance of wetlands is deduced from this work and mainly in this type of agricultural basins where the excessive use of fertilizer and its possible accumulation on the surface in these wetlands could be causing the high values of nitrate found in the free aquifer which would degrade the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
