7360,best management practices bmps are popular approaches used to improve hydrology and water quality uncertainties in bmp effectiveness over time may result in overestimating long term efficiency in watershed planning strategies to represent varying long term bmp effectiveness in hydrologic water quality models a high level and forward looking modeling framework was developed the components in the framework consist of establishment period efficiency starting efficiency efficiency for each storm event efficiency between maintenance and efficiency over the life cycle combined they represent long term efficiency for a specific type of practice and specific environmental concern runoff pollutant an approach for possible implementation of the framework was discussed the long term impacts of grass buffer strips agricultural bmp and bioretention systems urban bmp in reducing total phosphorus were simulated to demonstrate the framework data gaps were captured in estimating the long term performance of the bmps a bayesian method was used to match the simulated distribution of long term bmp efficiencies with the observed distribution with the assumption that the observed data represented long term bmp efficiencies the simulated distribution matched the observed distribution well with only small total predictive uncertainties with additional data the same method can be used to further improve the simulation results the modeling framework and results of this study which can be adopted in hydrologic water quality models to better represent long term bmp effectiveness can help improve decision support systems for creating long term stormwater management strategies for watershed management projects keywords low impact development practice efficiency over time life cycle bayesian method uncertainty 1 introduction best management practices bmps such as constructed wetlands ponds grass buffer strips and bioretention systems are popular approaches used to manage stormwater in agricultural and urban areas ahiablame and shakya 2016 alighalehbabakhani et al 2017 dietz 2007 edwards et al 2016 leit√£o et al 2018 liu et al 2016b c marques et al 2017 seo et al 2017a b usepa 2008 however addressing water quantity and nonpoint source pollution issues lacks anticipated progress despite large numbers of bmps implemented jokela et al 2004 lim and lu 2016 liu et al 2015a b meals 1996 meals et al 2010 wang et al 2014 failure of these efforts to reach water quantity and quality goals are likely due to many reasons including lack of landowner participation improper design poor choice of bmps failure to address pollution sources inadequate numbers and areas of bmps implemented lag time between the implementation of bmps and the improvement of downstream water quality significant variation in performance due to weather and overly high anticipation of long term bmp performance liu et al 2017b meals and dressing 2015 meals et al 2010 among these factors the inaccurate prediction of bmp performance as the practices age may be among the most important reasons bmp efficiencies effectiveness or performance in this study were defined as percent changes of flow pollutants compared to original conditions due to the implementation of bmps many studies have explored the immediate or short term water quantity and quality impacts of individual bmps e g emerson and traver 2008 emerson et al 2010 hunt et al 2006 thompson et al 2016 for example to determine seasonal variation of infiltration emerson and traver 2008 monitored two bmps that can reduce stormwater runoff through infiltration for a two year period and results showed significant seasonal changes but no general decrease in bmp effectiveness during the study period hunt et al 2006 studied the runoff and nutrient reduction of bioretention systems at three locations in north carolina for one year and found statistically significant differences in bmp efficiencies comparing warm seasons to winter few experimental studies have reported long term bmp performance as the effectiveness of the practice changes this is largely due to limited data that document the long term performance of bmps as they age dietz 2007 jeon et al 2014a b koch et al 2014 liu et al 2017b in fact those studies that have collected water quality and quantity data as bmps age have found variable short term results related to bmp type and pollutant of interest but no noticeable degradation of overall long term bmp performance within the study periods for example bates 2014 studied the impacts of a bio infiltration rain garden on metal removals from 2001 to 2013 and found large variation of pollutant concentrations but no obvious trends for dissolved and suspended metal concentrations over time komlos and traver 2012 examined the nine year performance of a bio infiltration rain garden in removing orthophosphate using field data but variation of pollutant concentrations was large with no consistent reduction in removal performance other studies found degradation of practice performance over long time periods e g bracmort et al 2006 2004 haile et al 2016 for example haile et al 2016 studied the long term efficiencies of infiltration systems using experimental methods and found degraded performance in saturated hydraulic conductivity and reduced metal removal bracmort et al 2004 assessed the long term 20 years after installation effectiveness of bmps by evaluating the condition of bmps using a three point scale rating system a score of three meant fully functional and a score of one indicated no longer performing as designed according to visual inspection as compared to selected original design dimensions and found that one third of the bmps no longer existed with the conditions of remaining bmps being fair computer models are commonly used to simulate performance of bmps to assist stakeholders planning strategies due to the high cost of data collection and numerous possible implementation scenarios brunetti et al 2016 chen et al 2017b fox et al 2018 gatel et al 2016 gitau et al 2016 liu et al 2016a c turco et al 2017 wang and kalin 2017 wright et al 2016 zhang and zhang 2011 bracmort et al 2006 studied the long term impacts of bmps on sediment and phosphorus reductions with the soil and water assessment tool swat model and represented bmps using different parameters when they were completely functional and when their condition deteriorated and found that deteriorated bmps were less effective than those in good condition however most simulation studies do not account for the possible degradation of bmp effectiveness or assume maintenance strategies sustaining long term pollutant removal efficiency of bmps and therefore assume no degradation of bmp effectiveness liu et al 2015b studied the performance of bmps in reducing runoff volume and pollutant loads using the long term hydrologic impact assessment low impact development 2 1 model they estimated the cost of bmps considering construction ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs and assumed that the performance of each bmp was constant through its life due to maintenance the performance of bmps likely varies over their life irrespective of regular maintenance for various reasons such as clogging vegetation growth and sedimentation e g bracmort et al 2006 chen et al 2016 2017a kang et al 2008 koch et al 2014 liu et al 2017a b wang and kalin 2011 bracmort et al 2006 indicated that although a design life of a bmp had been established the ability and duration of a bmp to perform effectively during its design life was uncertain and a bmp was expected to function fully for a short period after installation beyond which the decrease of bmp performance would likely occur kang et al 2008 pointed out that to minimize overall maintenance costs without losing the anticipated bmp performance an optimal maintenance interval was needed so problems were solved before the degradation of bmp effectiveness to undesirable levels based on the review of previous studies the following issues regarding performance of bmps as they age have not been fully addressed 1 each type of bmp is expected to have a range of starting efficiencies in reducing runoff volume and pollutant concentrations due to installation and local condition differences 2 for a given type of practice performance variability is expected due to storm event characteristics time of year watershed conditions and bmp condition at that particular time etc 3 bmp efficiencies will likely decrease over time due to degradation of engineered capabilities of practices such as clogging issues for infiltration bmps sediment accumulation for sedimentation bmps and degradation of bmp structure condition 4 maintenance will likely enhance degraded bmp efficiency 5 bmp efficiencies are expected to decrease with increased inflow volume treated 6 bmp efficiencies are expected to decrease with increased pollutant loads treated and 7 a lag time in the water quality response likely occurs after bmp implementation and the factors of lag time include the period required for a bmp to show impact period required for the influence to reach a water body period required for a water body to react to the impact and the effectiveness of monitoring the impact on a water body among the above issues not fully addressed the following questions arise regarding long term performance of bmps as they age 1 what are the distributions type and values of bmp starting efficiencies 2 what are the distributions type and values of performance for each storm event 3 how do bmp efficiencies degrade as they age 4 how much would maintenance enhance the performance of bmps these issues may be part of the reason why large expenditures in watershed projects to implement bmps failed to adequately resolve water quantity and quality problems a method to reliably incorporate the substantial uncertainties in the bmp performance over time needs to be studied hence we need to develop techniques to address these issues and incorporate these in models to better simulate long term performance of bmps as they age the objectives of this study were to 1 develop a modeling framework to represent the long term effectiveness of bmps as they age that could be adopted in hydrologic water quality models to better represent the performance of bmps 2 demonstrate and evaluate the modeling framework by simulating the long term impacts of two commonly used bmps grass buffer strip agricultural bmp and bioretention system urban bmp in reducing total phosphorus tp using default parameters and 3 demonstrate the application of the modeling framework by exploring simulation results using a bayesian method scope of the paper the scope of this paper is to develop a high level and forward looking modeling framework of representing long term effectiveness of bmps and provide a detailed demonstration of applying the modeling framework using a bayesian method as shown in the review paper written by liu et al 2017b more detailed data need to be collected to better describe the relationships in this paper we use the best dataset available international stormwater bmp database www bmpdatabase org scientific literature and best assumptions from experts to demonstrate the creation of the relationships for each of the components in the modeling framework some representations of relationships are initially only assumptions that can be improved in the future ultimately more detailed equations can replace simple assumptions and the representation of long term bmp efficiencies can be further improved as more data become available 2 modeling framework for simulating long term impacts of bmps 2 1 development of modeling framework to simulate long term impacts of bmps a conceptual high level and forward looking modeling framework was developed to represent long term performance of bmps as they age with five components including establishment period efficiency starting efficiency efficiency for each storm event efficiency changes between maintenance and efficiency over the life cycle life cycle of a practice is from the installation of a bmp to the failure point that would require replacement of the practice the distributions for bmp efficiencies collected in current bmp databases such as the international stormwater bmp database www bmpdatabase org which are empirical results represent the results for combining all of these components in order to represent long term bmp efficiencies the framework needs to consider all possible components affecting the efficiencies of bmps as they age the diagram for the modeling framework is shown in fig 1 a a conceptual graph of components in the modeling framework for simulating the long term impacts of bmps is shown in fig 1b 1 establishment period efficiency for bmps with vegetation the vegetation needs time to grow before these bmps reach expected efficiency microbial community assemblage and soil development would also affect bmp establishment the efficiency during the establishment period is called the establishment period efficiency establishment period efficiency would be unique for each type of practice and could be represented as a function of vegetation establishment microbial community assemblage and soil development 2 starting efficiency this is the efficiency right after the bmp is fully established starting efficiencies for each bmp type would have a distribution for reducing runoff volume and pollutant concentrations due to design installation and local condition differences designs of specific bmp types differ from one another due to different design standards used for each practice for example each design of rain gardens would be unique due to different vegetation type trees or shrubs media type type of soil and depth selected installation differences occur due to who installs the practices and how skilled they are local conditions include different soils climate and vegetation types in the drainage area starting efficiency could be represented as a function of design installation and local conditions 3 efficiency for each storm event distributions of bmp efficiency for each storm event in reducing runoff volume and pollutant concentrations would occur due to issues including storm event characteristics time of year watershed conditions and bmp conditions during each storm event features of storm events include size intensity and duration of an event small events low precipitation low intensity and or short duration typically increase bmp performance compared to average performance due to the small amount of runoff large and extreme events high precipitation high intensity and or long duration are expected to decrease bmp efficiency due to reaching or exceeding storage based on a specific design storm bmp conditions during each storm event have impacts on the performance of bmps for that storm event for example whether there is enough time for a detention basin to drain the ponded water between storm events and the conditions of vegetation practices during each storm event time of year could affect the performance of bmps due to the growth or decline of vegetation watershed conditions include land uses that would affect pollutant concentrations and loading rates and slope of the watershed that would influence delivery of runoff and pollutants bmps implemented in series would also be considered part of watershed conditions efficiency for each storm event could be represented as a function of storm event features time of year watershed conditions and bmp conditions during each storm event 4 efficiency between maintenance usually the effectiveness of non vegetative bmps would degrade between maintenance due to changes of engineered capabilities of practices such as clogging issues for infiltration bmps sediment accumulation for sedimentation bmps and degradation of bmp structure condition the performance of vegetative bmps would fluctuate between maintenance due to seasonal vegetation changes and decreasing trends would also occur due to degradation of engineering functions the performance of bmps which is pollutant specific may improve over a period in some cases such as the growth of vegetation for forested buffer strips efficiency between maintenance could be represented as a function of engineered capability of practices and seasonal vegetation changes 5 efficiency over life cycle during a bmp life cycle multiple maintenance activities would partially restore the performance of bmps the frequencies and impacts of maintenance activities differ due to the various levels of control and oversight given to each practice during a practice life cycle the failure point of a bmp that would require replacement of the practice needs to be considered some bmps are removed for various reasons such as the bmp fails to perform properly someone else acquires the property or the practice is no longer required therefore maintenance frequency restored bmp performance and failure point of bmps could be distributions efficiency over the life cycle is represented as a function of maintenance frequency restored bmp performance and failure point the five components above were combined to represent long term efficiency for a specific type of practice and specific environmental concern runoff pollutant 2 2 an approach for possible implementation of the modeling framework the following section describes an approach for possible implementation of the modeling framework to represent long term performance of bmps in reducing runoff volume and pollutant concentrations the relationships between bmp performance and time would be initially created with values that could be modified based on scientific literature limited data and best assumptions from experts in this study experts refers to the senior co authors of this paper who have substantial experience in modeling and or monitoring bmps in general experts are called upon to provide assumptions for bmp function and effectiveness when only limited data are available the efficiencies of bmps were estimated over time with appropriate relationships and parameters using an approach with the following steps 1 relationships of mean bmp effectiveness during the establishment period would be created for each bmp type and each environmental concern runoff pollutant 2 distributions of starting bmp efficiencies would be created for each bmp type and each environmental concern runoff pollutant the starting bmp efficiency would be selected from the distribution for each specific bmp application 3 different relationships mean bmp effectiveness vs time would be assumed for the long term performance of each bmp in reducing runoff volume and pollutant concentrations during periods between maintenance for some bmps such as grass swales and grass strips which are not as functional during the winter the relationships would be selected considering seasonal variation 4 during the life of a practice maintenance may be performed and each maintenance activity would partially restore mean bmp efficiency a time distributed around the design life would be used as the failure point of the bmp design life is the expected life of a bmp during which the practice performs properly with regular maintenance activities relationships of mean bmp effectiveness vs time would be created for the bmp life cycle 5 distributions of bmp efficiency for each storm event would be created for each bmp type and each environmental concern runoff pollutant mean value of the distribution for each storm event would be adjusted based on the relationship of mean bmp effectiveness over time the bmp efficiency for each storm event would be selected from the adjusted distribution for each specific bmp application 2 3 possible relationships of each component in the modeling framework 2 3 1 bmp establishment period efficiencies fig 2 a shows possible trends in mean bmp effectiveness y axis changing over time x axis for the establishment period the possible relationships which were based on experts knowledge consider vegetation growth for the establishment period fig 2a a a f show various relationships linear linear with a change of slope and four forms of non linearity effectiveness increases faster at the beginning and slower at the end effectiveness increases slower at the beginning and faster at the end effectiveness increases faster at the beginning slower in the middle and faster at the end and effectiveness increases slower at the beginning faster in the middle and slower at the end 2 3 2 possible distributions of starting bmp efficiencies and bmp efficiencies for each storm event possible distributions of starting bmp efficiencies and bmp efficiencies for each storm event were created with frequency density vs effectiveness fig 2b the distributions in fig 2b are assumptions for potential distributions of starting bmp efficiencies based on experts knowledge including normal distribution uniform distribution positively skewed distribution and negatively skewed distribution 2 3 3 possible mean bmp effectiveness changing between maintenance due to many bmps having similar maintenance requirements flynn et al 2012 in this study the example bmps were divided into 3 groups to create different possible distributions of mean bmp effectiveness changes between maintenance the 3 groups were filter infiltration porous pavement and blind inlet sedimentation dry pond wet pond and wetland and vegetative practices green roof wetland channel grass buffer strip grassed waterways and bioretention system similar to fig 2a c and d were relationships between bmp effectiveness and time based on linearity linear vs non linear and the rate slower vs faster at which bmp effectiveness changes over time increase vs decrease based on experts knowledge 1 filter infiltration practices or sedimentation practice the distributions in fig 2c were selected for the filter infiltration practices or the sedimentation practices due to the degradation of bmp effectiveness over time starting from the beginning of bmp implementation e g emerson et al 2010 haile et al 2016 the decrease in bmp effectiveness was because of degradation of physical functions of the practices such as clogging issues for infiltration bmps and sediment accumulation for sedimentation bmps 2 vegetative practices fig 2d shows the potential change in mean bmp effectiveness during each year for vegetative practices in the northern hemisphere these relationships were picked for vegetative practices with seasonal variations because these bmps start with lower efficiencies due to reduced efficiencies during winter months then these bmps have increasing efficiencies with the growth of vegetation finally bmp efficiencies drop again due to the decline of vegetation for estimating bmp effectiveness of vegetative practices in the southern hemisphere the relationships shown in fig 2d would need to be off set in time by 6 months fig 3 a shows an example of mean bmp effectiveness over time between maintenance for vegetative practices using fig 2d d based on experts knowledge relationships for mean bmp effectiveness from fig 2d d were selected for each year to create a time series of mean bmp effectiveness between maintenance for each year the potential efficiency would decline compared to the previous year an example of how bmp efficiencies are represented between maintenance is shown in fig 3b the steps of representing bmp efficiencies between maintenance are shown in fig 3b a a and b are the same bmp type however they are implemented in different areas with different designs and installations efficiencies of the two bmps change linearly linear relationship picked as an example between maintenance first based on the distribution of starting efficiencies the starting efficiencies for a and b are selected considering upper lower limits of starting efficiency then based on the mean efficiencies over time between maintenance upper lower limits of efficiency for each event and distribution of bmp efficiency for each storm event the efficiency for each storm event between maintenance is selected for a and b respectively fig 3b b shows an example randomly selected of the final results for bmp efficiencies between maintenance 2 3 4 change in mean bmp effectiveness for life cycle an example relationship of mean bmp effectiveness over time for the life cycle is shown in fig 3c based on experts knowledge during the life cycle maintenance was performed and each maintenance activity partially restored the mean efficiency of the bmp maintenance frequency for each practice was obtained based on bmp standards and expert opinion the relationships for the life cycle were created by combining multiple relationships between maintenance failure points existed when bmps needed to be replaced the possible probability distributions of bmp failure points relative to bmp life spans are shown in fig 2b x axes show time year and y axes show frequency densities 3 case study demonstration of the modeling framework the goal of the case study was to use the limited data available to demonstrate the creation of the relationships for each of the components in the modeling framework assumptions were made when data were not available more detailed equations can replace simple assumptions that can be improved when more data become available the long term impacts on tp were simulated for two commonly used bmps grass buffer strips agricultural bmp and bioretention systems urban bmp this section contains descriptions of the following subsections first the observed distributions of bmp efficiencies were summarized for grass buffer strips gbs and bioretention systems bs second relationships and parameters of the two bmps were selected for components in the framework third the steps of using the modeling framework to represent long term effectiveness of bmps with the selected relationships and parameters were described fourth two simulation scenarios were conducted 1 results were explored using the default parameters and 2 with the assumption of observed data being able to represent long term bmp efficiencies the bayesian method was used to match the simulated distribution of long term bmp efficiencies with the observed distribution 3 1 observed distributions of bmp efficiencies distributions of bmp efficiencies in removing pollutants based on limited data from the international stormwater bmp database www bmpdatabase org and literature gitau et al 2005 merriman et al 2009 were plotted for grass buffer strips and bioretention systems fig 4 a shows the distributions of grass buffer strip efficiencies in reducing tp and tss fig 4b shows the distribution of tp reduction efficiencies of bioretention systems these distributions were combinations of various bmps of the same type which had different designs installations ages storm events watershed conditions time of year and so on negatively skewed distributions were found data in fig 4a a are grass buffer strip efficiencies in reducing tp for agricultural land uses which are based on limited observed data literature data collected by gitau et al 2005 and merriman et al 2009 with no negative values no negative values were reported because the values represented averages of bmp efficiencies over study periods instead of efficiencies for individual storm events in reality bmp effectiveness can vary greatly from event to event and over time with bmps sometimes becoming sources of pollutants ahiablame et al 2012 dietz 2007 sharpley et al 2015 therefore we cannot use this distribution to represent grass buffer strips treating tp due to limited overall data and no negative values to represent negative efficiencies data in fig 4a b are grass buffer strip efficiencies in reducing tp for urban land use and contain many negative values this may be due to the amount of sediment in urban runoff typically being less than sediment in agricultural runoff and or phosphorus in runoff treated by grass buffer strips being mainly bound to sediment resulting in small masses of phosphorus reduction we considered grass buffer strips as an agricultural practice in this study the efficiency of grass buffer strips in reducing tp was assumed to be similar to tss therefore the fitted distribution in fig 4a c was used as the distribution of tp reduction efficiencies of grass buffer strips considered as an agricultural bmp 3 2 relationships and parameters for components in the modeling framework the modeling framework requires inputs describing the efficiencies for the establishment period starting point each storm event changes between maintenance and changes for the life cycle based on scientific literature limited data and best assumptions from experts relationships and parameters default min and max were selected for components in the modeling framework to represent long term bmp grass buffer strip and bioretention system effectiveness in reducing total phosphorus table 1 the selection of relationships and parameters is discussed in the following sections after completing the steps in the following sections all of the parameters in table 1 together can capture long term bmp efficiency with components of establishment period efficiency starting efficiency efficiency for each storm event efficiency between maintenance and efficiency over the life cycle fig 1a 3 2 1 establishment period efficiency the relationship shown in fig 2a c was selected to represent mean values of establishment period efficiency changing over time for both grass buffer strip and bioretention system due to the fact that once the vegetation height exceeds the maximum flow depth further growth may not provide additional benefit one full growing season 6 months or 184 days may through october plus two months or 61 days was recommended as the length of establishment period epe l for both grass buffer strips and bioretention systems njdep 2004 pdep 2006 the relationship for the mean establishment period efficiency was created using eq 1 1 epe mean epe b 1 e epe c epe day epe a epe b where epe mean is the mean establishment period efficiency epe day 0 to epe l is the day during the establishment period epe a effectiveness at point a was assumed to be the same as the initial mean efficiency of the next year epe b effectiveness at point b was assumed to be 0 and epe c is the exponential parameter in the relationship of the mean establishment period efficiency epe c 0 17 when the bmp was established in 60 days epe c 0 055 when the bmp was established in 184 days 3 2 2 starting efficiency the generalized extreme value gev distribution was used to fit the observed data distribution the probability density function pdf of the gev distribution pdf gev kotz and nadarajah 2000 is shown as eq 2 2 pdf gev f x k œÉ Œº 1 œÉ 1 k x Œº œÉ k 1 k e 1 k x Œº œÉ 1 k when k 0 1 œÉ e x Œº œÉ e x Œº œÉ when k 0 where k œÉ and Œº are shape scale and location parameters of the gev distribution respectively x is the effectiveness of bmps in reducing tp to create the pdf of the gev distribution for starting efficiency se pdf gev eq 2 becomes 3 se pdf gev pdf gev x se k se sigma se mu default values of the parameters se k se sigma and se mu were the same as the fitted distribution curves fig 4a c for gbs and fig 4b for bs se k was defined in a range so that the distributions would be negatively skewed the ranges of se sigma and se mu were defined as default values increased or decreased by 50 the distributions of the starting efficiencies were assumed to have mean values se mlar larger than the means of the overall efficiencies from the data because the mean bmp efficiencies immediately after full establishment of practices should be greater than those of the observed mean overall efficiencies 46 9 for gbs and 14 2 for bs the default values and ranges of se mlar were assumptions therefore the starting efficiency se is calculated as 4 se random se pdf gev 100 se mlar where random se pdf gev means to sample randomly from se pdf gev if the random sample of se was not between 0 and 100 then another random sample would be drawn the mean starting efficiency equals to the mean efficiency at the end of the establishment period 3 2 3 efficiency for each storm event bmp efficiency for each storm event was represented by sampling a distribution instead of being determined by a computer model for this demonstration each sampling from the distribution of efficiency for each storm event would consider storm event characteristics as one of the factors other factors included time of year watershed conditions and bmp conditions during each storm event if a model could capture pollutant concentration removal efficiency changes for each storm

values of the parameters ese k ese sigma ese mu were the same as the fitted distribution curves fig 4a c for gbs and fig 4b for bs ese k was defined in a range so that the distributions would be negatively skewed the ranges of ese sigma and ese mu were defined as default values increased or decreased by 50 based on the difference between the mean value of the ese distribution and the mean bmp

cycle the calculation of elc mean is discussed in the following sections if the random sample of ese was not between 100 and 100 then another random sample would be drawn 3 2 4 change of efficiency between maintenance activities fig 2d d was selected as the mean bmp effectiveness over time during each year for both grass buffer strips and bioretention systems this relationship was selected because bmp efficiencies would be expected to be low at the beginning and end of each year northern hemisphere due to vegetation growth and decline and the efficiencies would be greater for the period

where œÉ is the standard deviation and Œº is the mean of x to use the pdf norm in eq 7 to represent mean bmp effectiveness over time during each year Œº was assumed to be 0 x was between 6 and 6 and ebm sigma was used as parameter œÉ with a default value of 1 and a range of 0 5 5 8 ebm pdf norm pdf norm x ebm sigma 0 next 365 equally distributed points were obtained for x between 6 and 6 in eq 8 to represent mean bmp efficiency on each day of a year to represent mean bmp efficiencies density values of the 365 points on the line of ebm pdf norm were adjusted based on the highest mean

pdf norm x 0 for the first year after the establishment period ebm highest is the same as the starting efficiency se between maintenance activities ebm highest was assumed to be ebm nh less than that of the previous year due to the degradation of bmp conditions over time 10 ebm highest n year ebm highest n year 1 1 ebm nh n year 1 where n year is the number of years between maintenance or between the end of establishment period and first maintenance ebm nh was assumed to have a default value of 10 and a range of 5 to 15 n year was between 1 and ebm yr maintenance frequency various standards provide maintenance activities and frequencies for grass buffer strips casqa 2003 idem 2007 nrcs 2006 2008 and bioretention systems casqa 2003 hunt and lord 2006 idem 2007 njdep 2004 the maintenance frequencies for grass buffer strip and bioretention system were assumed to be 5 and 3 years respectively a series of edy mean values was used to represent mean bmp effectiveness between maintenance ebm mean 11 ebm mean edy mean n year 1 edy mean n year ebm yr 3 2 5 change of efficiency over the life cycle the highest mean efficiency after n main times of maintenance eam highest was also the highest mean efficiency of the first year after each maintenance it was assumed to be 12 eam highest n main se 1 n main elc r where elc r is the restored factor and assumed to have a default value of

where elc sigma is the œÉ parameter in eq 7 assumed to have a default value of 1 and a range of 0 5 1 5 and random is the process of sampling randomly from the pdf the grass buffer strip is designed to have a 10 year life span nrcs 2008 the phosphorus reduction service life of bioretention systems can be more than 30 years lucas and greenway 2010 in this study life spans of the grass buffer strip and bioretention system were assumed to be 15 and 30 years respectively due to maintenance activities if a bmp was not replaced after the failure point zero efficiency was assumed for the practice from that point forward in time the mean efficiency over the life cycle elc mean was the combination of establishment period mean efficiency and mean efficiency between maintenance activities 14 elc mean epe mean ebm mean n main 0 ebm mean n main 1 ebm mean n main max n main where max n main represents the maximum number of maintenance events applied which is determined by the maintenance frequency and the bmp failure point 3 3 simulation scenarios 3 3 1 exploration of simulation results using default parameters to explore results using default parameters the default values in table 1 were used the method described in section 2 2 an approach for possible implementation of modeling framework was extended and used for the case study 1 starting efficiency was sampled using the method in section 3 2 2 starting efficiency if extreme values less than 0 or greater than 100 were obtained the sampling was repeated 2 the relationship of mean bmp efficiency over time during the establishment period between maintenance events and over the life cycle was created using the methods in section 3 2 1 establishment period efficiency section 3 2 4 change of efficiency between maintenance activities and section 3 2 5 change of efficiency over the life cycle respectively 3 bmp efficiency for each storm event was sampled using the method in section 3 2 3 efficiency for each storm event with varying mean efficiencies over the life cycle representing the adjusted mean of efficiency distribution for each storm event for extreme values less than 100 or greater than 100 the sampling was repeated following the above steps the efficiency distributions for each storm event fell around the line of the mean bmp efficiency such that bmp efficiencies less than 0 were possible 3 3 2 exploration of simulation results using the bayesian method due to limited available bmp efficiency data it was assumed that the observed data plotted in fig 4a c and b could represent the long term efficiencies of grass buffer strips and bioretention systems respectively the goal of this scenario was to demonstrate the application of the modeling framework by matching observed and simulated distributions using the bayesian method as more observed data become available in the future this method can be used to further improve the simulation results of long term bmp effectiveness uncertainties of predicted results of the modeling framework were explored using the bayesian method in bayesian inference box and tiao 2011 woodbury 1989 the parameters of a model z can be defined as

source code for the log likelihood function and dream zs algorithm can be found at http faculty sites uci edu jasper software the prior uncertainty ranges of simulation model parameters are shown in table 1 for parameters in the residual error model the heteroscedasticity intercept Œ∏ 0 was between 0 and 1 the heteroscedasticity slope Œ∏ 1 was between 0 and 1 the autocorrelation coefficient 1 was between 0 and 1 and the kurtosis parameter Œ± was between 1 and 1 two thousand equally distributed points were obtained for bmp efficiencies between 100 and 100 the density values of the corresponding points in the distributions of the predictions and the observed data were compared the pdf of the prior parameters were assumed to be uniform which was reasonable due to the large sample size schoups and vrugt 2010 the efficiencies of multiple bmps of the same type were needed to make simulation results more comparable to the observed results in the international stormwater bmp database therefore 100 grass buffer strips and 100 bioretention systems were simulated by modeling each practice 100 times with randomly selected starting efficiencies and other parameters 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of using default parameters the predicted efficiencies of a single grass buffer strip and bioretention system over the life cycle using default parameters are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively the first eight months of data were efficiencies during the establishment period for each year the efficiencies varied with lower efficiencies during winter and higher efficiencies during summer the potential highest efficiencies of each year would decrease compared to that of the previous year after each maintenance activity the highest efficiencies would be partially restored there were bmp failure points when practices needed to be replaced and the demonstrations in this study ended at these points fig 5 also shows many negative efficiency values during the winter this was supported by literature which reported decreased infiltration rates of infiltration bmps for winter months compared to those of summer months emerson and traver 2008 emerson et al 2010 hunt et al 2006 studied bioretention systems at three locations in north carolina and found the efficiencies were higher in warm seasons compared to those for winter uusi k√§mpp√§ and jauhiainen 2010 studied the ability of grass buffer strips in retaining total phosphorus in different seasons and found that effectiveness was lower in colder seasons compared to those for warmer seasons this modeling framework can provide suggestions of robust bmps with the consideration of prediction uncertainties for example uncertainty of the starting efficiency was represented as a distribution with the mean value greater than the overall mean from the database uncertainty of efficiency for each storm event was represented as a distribution along the line of mean efficiency over time uncertainty at a failure point was represented as a distribution around the life span currently the observed data from the international stormwater bmp database are limited and cannot represent long term bmp efficiencies and therefore cannot be sufficiently compared with simulated results for the following reasons 1 establishment period efficiencies were considered in the predicted results while observed results did not specify establishment period efficiencies 2 predicted starting efficiencies were selected from adjusted observed data distributions but the observed results did not specify which data were starting efficiencies if any 3 the predicted efficiency for each storm event was created by randomly sampling daily bmp efficiency based on adjusted observed distributions and considering the efficiencies changing over time during each year between maintenance and changing over the life cycle however observed data were either non winter month data or winter month data from warm states such as ca fl had limited data collected for each individual bmp and had mostly short term efficiencies for recently established bmps 4 changes in predicted efficiency between maintenance considered changes in mean bmp efficiencies over time however the observed data were short term and insufficient to represent changes in bmp efficiencies over time 5 changes in predicted efficiency for the life cycle considered failure points of bmps and regular maintenance activities that partially restored bmp efficiencies however the observed data were not sufficient to consider these the theoretical modeling framework can capture data gaps in estimating the long term performance of bmps to fill the data gaps detailed suggestions for new data collection were discussed in liu et al 2017b these suggestions included collecting data on the bmp design standard and specific design details for each practice quality of bmp installation skill level of installers installation process date of bmp installation monitoring and reporting paired inflow and outflow volume pollutant concentrations from practices for each day and each storm event maintenance dates and activities performed during maintenance bmp visual condition and high resolution photos with the location information recorded age of bmp when replacement is expected and reason for bmp being replaced soil land use slope vegetation and weather at bmp location and detailed information for any bmps implemented in series 4 2 results of using bayesian method comparisons of observed and simulated bmp efficiency distributions are provided in fig 6 the maximum a posteriori map values of epe c se mlar se k se sigma se mu ese k ese sigma ese mu ebm sigma ebm nh elc r and elc sigma for the grass buffer strip were 0 114 0 429 0 352 28 99 47 37 0 986 70 73 18 97 4 844 0 051 0 044 and 1 157 respectively map values of those parameters for the bioretention system were 0 140 0 373 0 821 32 53 2 013 0 400 80 58 1 702 3 821 0 146 0 033 and 1 385 respectively simulated distributions of long term bmp efficiency obtained from the map parameters are compared to observed distributions in the left side figures and simulated distributions matched the observed distributions well with 2000 points obtained from each distribution the r2 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse for the grass buffer strips were 0 994 and 0 992 respectively the r2 and nse for the bioretention systems were 0 996 and 0 991 respectively the right side figures show the predictive uncertainties for the long term bmp efficiency distributions with 95 confidence intervals the black bands show the uncertainties due to the parameters of the simulation model while the gray bands display total uncertainties the red dots are observed data in the figures of the uncertainty results the x axes plot 2000 data points obtained from individual distributions with equal intervals of x and the observed data were within the total uncertainties the total predictive uncertainties were small which was mainly due to the suitable posterior distributions of simulation model parameters and the residual error model parameters selected table 2 shows posterior parameter correlation coefficients no high posterior correlations between parameters were found with the map values of parameters the relationships of the key components of the modeling framework are plotted in fig 7 examples of starting efficiency 90 for both gbs and bs and failure point 15 years for gbs and 30 years for bs were used to plot mean efficiency changing between maintenance events and for the life cycle the calibrated mean percentages of epe a epe b during the establishment period had similar shapes for gbs and bs the calibrated epe c indicated that gbs would be fully established on day 88 and bs would be fully established on day 72 the distributions of the starting efficiencies were greatly different for gbs and bs due to the large number of high efficiencies in the observed data the distribution of starting efficiencies for gbs had very few negative values however the distribution of starting efficiencies for bs had many more negative values due to the mean values of the observed data being much smaller than that of gbs distributions of efficiency for each storm event were also greatly different for gbs and bs with gbs having a heavier negatively skewed distribution due to the larger number of observed high efficiencies the distributions of failure points were also different for gbs and bs with bs having a larger distribution space the mean efficiency between maintenance activities and for the life cycle showed that average efficiencies would change over time during each year with lower efficiencies at the beginning and the end of each year and with higher efficiencies during the summer between maintenance the highest efficiency of each year was lower than that of the previous year after each maintenance activity the bmp efficiencies were partially restored the values of calibrated parameter ebm sigma indicated that during each year the shape of the mean gbs efficiencies was flatter than that of bs for the same starting efficiency this meant that the changes in gbs efficiencies over each year were not as fast as those of bs deeper physical meanings of the parameters and relationships were not explored here due to the limited data available as more data become available the time series of observed data and calibrated data can be matched using the bayesian method for example the time series of bmp efficiencies over the establishment period during each year between maintenance and over the life cycle can be calibrated separately with further calibration of parameters the parameters and relationships in the components of the modeling framework can represent deeper physical meanings the equations proposed were verified using limited data a bayesian method was used to match the simulated distribution of long term bmp efficiencies with the observed distribution with the assumption that the observed data represented long term bmp efficiencies with additional data the same approach utilizing the bayesian method can be used to further improve the simulation results and modify verify the equations 4 3 extending the modeling framework to other models the modeling framework and results in this study could be adopted in hydrologic water quality models such as soil and water assessment tool swat long term hydrologic impact assessment low impact development l thia lid and storm water management model swmm as well as other models to better represent long term bmp effectiveness by changing model approaches for example the percent pollutant concentration reduction of each bmp in the l thia lid model would not be constant for long term effectiveness instead the removal efficiencies in the enhanced model would change during each year between maintenance and over the life cycle based on the framework and results of this study to improve the representation of bmps in swat and swmm relationships represented in the functions for components of the modeling framework section 2 1 need to be developed and incorporated in the models for instance to represent long term effectiveness of grassed waterways in swat variables including manning s roughness channel cover factor and channel erodibility factor would vary over time instead of being constant using the proposed modeling framework representation of long term bmp efficiencies can be further improved as more data become available the modeling framework can be adopted in various hydrologic water quality models to better represent long term bmp effectiveness the improved representation of long term bmp performance can help decision makers enhance decision support systems for creating long term stormwater management strategies for watershed management projects 5 conclusions the performance of bmps changes over their life cycle with substantial uncertainties which may result in overestimating long term efficiencies of bmps as they age in watershed planning strategies this study developed a high level and forward looking modeling framework to represent long term impacts of bmps that could be used to represent changes in bmp effectiveness over time in hydrologic and water quality models the components in the modeling framework would be considered together to represent long term efficiency for a specific type of practice and specific environmental concern runoff pollutant an approach for possible implementation of the framework was discussed possible relationships of each component in the framework were identified the long term efficiencies of two commonly used bmps grass buffer strips agricultural bmp and bioretention systems urban bmp in reducing tp were simulated to demonstrate the modeling framework the changes in efficiencies over the life cycle for a single bmp show that the efficiencies varied for each year with lower efficiencies during winter and higher efficiencies during summer the potential highest efficiencies of each year would decrease compared to those of the previous year after each maintenance activity the highest efficiencies would be partially restored there were failure points of bmps when they needed to be replaced not replaced in this study data gaps were captured in estimating long term performance of bmps with the assumption of observed data being able to represent long term bmp efficiencies the bayesian method was used to match the simulated distribution of long term bmp efficiencies with the observed distribution the simulated distribution can match the observed distribution well with small total predictive uncertainties with more observed data available in the future this method can be used to further improve the simulation results of long term bmp effectiveness the framework and results in this study could be adopted in hydrologic water quality models such as swat l thia lid and swmm to better represent long term bmp effectiveness the detailed use of the modeling framework in other hydrologic water quality models should be demonstrated in future studies currently there are insufficient data to determine long term variability of bmp efficiency in reducing runoff pollutants the scientific community needs to work together on this such as in exploring datasets to determine whether there are existing data to help solve the problem and collecting new data considering various components in the modeling framework developed in this study other modeling methods could also be developed to represent long term performance of bmps such as considering bmp efficiencies as a function of runoff amount pollutant load captured the simulated results were not compared to time series of observed data in this study due to the limited data available and this could be explored using the bayesian method in the future when more data are available acknowledgements this work was supported by usda nifa grant number s1063 quantification of best management practice effectiveness for water quality protection at the watershed scale 
7360,best management practices bmps are popular approaches used to improve hydrology and water quality uncertainties in bmp effectiveness over time may result in overestimating long term efficiency in watershed planning strategies to represent varying long term bmp effectiveness in hydrologic water quality models a high level and forward looking modeling framework was developed the components in

help improve decision support systems for creating long term stormwater management strategies for watershed management projects keywords low impact development practice efficiency over time life cycle bayesian method uncertainty 1 introduction best management practices bmps such as constructed wetlands ponds grass buffer strips and bioretention systems are popular approaches used to manage stormwater in agricultural and urban areas ahiablame and shakya 2016 alighalehbabakhani et al 2017 dietz 2007 edwards et al 2016 leit√£o et al 2018 liu et al 2016b c marques et al 2017 seo et al 2017a b usepa 2008 however addressing water quantity and nonpoint source pollution issues lacks anticipated progress despite large numbers of bmps implemented jokela et al 2004 lim and lu 2016 liu et al 2015a b meals 1996 meals et al 2010 wang et al 2014 failure of these efforts to reach water quantity and quality goals are likely due to many reasons including lack of landowner participation improper design poor choice of bmps failure to address pollution sources inadequate numbers and areas of bmps implemented lag time between the implementation of bmps and the improvement of downstream water quality significant variation in performance due to weather and overly high anticipation of long term bmp performance liu et al 2017b meals and dressing 2015 meals et al 2010 among these factors the inaccurate prediction of bmp performance as the practices age may be among the most important reasons bmp efficiencies effectiveness or performance in this study were defined as percent changes of flow pollutants compared to original conditions due to the implementation of bmps many studies have explored the immediate or short term water quantity and quality impacts of individual bmps e g emerson and traver 2008 emerson et al 2010 hunt et al 2006 thompson et al 2016 for example to determine seasonal variation of infiltration emerson and traver 2008 monitored two bmps that can reduce stormwater runoff through infiltration for a two year period and results showed significant seasonal changes but no general decrease in bmp effectiveness during the study period hunt et al 2006 studied the runoff and nutrient reduction of bioretention systems at three locations in north carolina for one year and found statistically significant differences in bmp efficiencies comparing warm seasons to winter few experimental studies have reported long term bmp performance as the effectiveness of the practice changes this is largely due to limited data that document the long term performance of bmps as they age dietz 2007 jeon et al 2014a b koch et al 2014 liu et al 2017b in fact those studies that have collected water quality and quantity data as bmps age have found variable short term results related to bmp type and pollutant of interest but no noticeable degradation of overall long term bmp performance within the study periods for example bates 2014 studied the impacts of a bio infiltration rain garden on metal removals from 2001 to 2013 and found large variation of pollutant concentrations but no obvious trends for dissolved and suspended metal concentrations over time komlos and traver 2012 examined the nine year performance of a bio infiltration rain garden in removing orthophosphate using field data but variation of pollutant concentrations was large with no consistent reduction in removal performance other studies found degradation of practice performance over long time periods e g bracmort et al 2006 2004 haile et al 2016 for example haile et al 2016 studied the long term efficiencies of infiltration systems using experimental methods and found degraded performance in saturated hydraulic conductivity and reduced metal removal bracmort et al 2004 assessed the long term 20 years after installation effectiveness of bmps by evaluating the condition of bmps using a three point scale rating system a score of three meant fully functional and a score of one indicated no longer performing as designed according to visual inspection as compared to selected original design dimensions and found that one third of the bmps no longer existed with the conditions of remaining bmps being fair computer models are commonly used to simulate performance of bmps to assist stakeholders planning strategies due to the high cost of data collection and numerous possible implementation scenarios brunetti et al 2016 chen et al 2017b fox et al 2018 gatel et al 2016 gitau et al 2016 liu et al 2016a c turco et al 2017 wang and kalin 2017 wright et al 2016 zhang and zhang 2011 bracmort et al 2006 studied the long term impacts of bmps on sediment and phosphorus reductions with the soil and water assessment tool swat model and represented bmps using different parameters when they were completely functional and when their condition deteriorated and found that deteriorated bmps were less effective than those in good condition however most simulation studies do not account for the possible degradation of bmp effectiveness or assume maintenance strategies sustaining long term pollutant removal efficiency of bmps and therefore assume no degradation of bmp effectiveness liu et al 2015b studied the performance of bmps in reducing runoff volume and pollutant loads using the long term hydrologic impact assessment low impact development 2 1 model they estimated the cost of bmps considering construction ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs and assumed that the performance of each bmp was constant through its life due to maintenance the performance of bmps likely varies over their life irrespective of regular maintenance for various reasons such as clogging vegetation growth and sedimentation e g bracmort et al 2006 chen et al 2016 2017a kang et al 2008 koch et al 2014 liu et al 2017a b wang and kalin 2011 bracmort et al 2006 indicated that although a design life of a bmp had been established the ability and duration of a bmp to perform effectively during its design life was uncertain and a bmp was expected to function fully for a short period after installation beyond which the decrease of bmp performance would likely occur kang et al 2008 pointed out that to minimize overall maintenance costs without losing the anticipated bmp performance an optimal maintenance interval was needed so problems were solved before the degradation of bmp effectiveness to undesirable levels based on the review of previous studies the following issues regarding performance of bmps as they age have not been fully addressed 1 each type of bmp is expected to have a range of starting efficiencies in reducing runoff volume and pollutant concentrations due to installation and local condition differences 2 for a given type of practice performance variability is expected due to storm event characteristics time of year watershed conditions and bmp condition at that particular time etc 3 bmp efficiencies will likely decrease over time due to degradation of engineered capabilities of practices such as clogging issues for infiltration bmps sediment accumulation for sedimentation bmps and degradation of bmp structure condition 4 maintenance will likely enhance degraded bmp efficiency 5 bmp efficiencies are expected to decrease with increased inflow volume treated 6 bmp efficiencies are expected to decrease with increased pollutant loads treated and 7 a lag time in the water quality response likely occurs after bmp implementation and the factors of lag time include the period required for a bmp to show impact period required for the influence to reach a water body period required for a water body to react to the impact and the effectiveness of monitoring the impact on a water body among the above issues not fully addressed the following questions arise regarding long term performance of bmps as they age 1 what are the distributions type and values of bmp starting efficiencies 2 what are the distributions type and values of performance for each storm event 3 how do bmp efficiencies degrade as they age 4 how much would maintenance enhance the performance of bmps these issues may be part of the reason why large expenditures in watershed projects to implement bmps failed to adequately resolve water quantity and quality problems a method to reliably incorporate the substantial uncertainties in the bmp performance over time needs to be studied hence we need to develop techniques to address these issues and incorporate these in models to better simulate long term performance of bmps as they age the objectives of this study were to 1 develop a modeling framework to represent the long term effectiveness of bmps as they age that could be adopted in hydrologic water quality models to better represent the performance of bmps 2 demonstrate and evaluate the modeling framework by simulating the long term impacts of two commonly used bmps grass buffer strip agricultural bmp and bioretention system urban bmp in reducing total phosphorus tp using default parameters and 3 demonstrate the application of the modeling framework by exploring simulation results using a bayesian method scope of the paper the scope of this paper is to develop a high level and forward looking modeling framework of representing long term effectiveness of bmps and provide a detailed demonstration of applying the modeling framework using a bayesian method as shown in the review paper written by liu et al 2017b more detailed data need to be collected to better describe the relationships in this paper we use the best dataset available international stormwater bmp database www bmpdatabase org scientific literature and best assumptions from experts to demonstrate the creation of the relationships for each of the components in the modeling framework some representations of relationships are initially only assumptions that can be improved in the future ultimately more detailed equations can replace simple assumptions and the representation of long term bmp efficiencies can be further improved as more data become available 2 modeling framework for simulating long term impacts of bmps 2 1 development of modeling framework to simulate long term impacts of bmps a conceptual high level and forward looking modeling framework was developed to represent long term performance of bmps as they age with five components including establishment period efficiency starting efficiency efficiency for each storm event efficiency changes between maintenance and efficiency over the life cycle life cycle of a practice is from the installation of a bmp to the failure point that would require replacement of the practice the distributions for bmp efficiencies collected in current bmp databases such as the international stormwater bmp database www bmpdatabase org which are empirical results represent the results for combining all of these components in order to represent long term bmp efficiencies the framework needs to consider all possible components affecting the efficiencies of bmps as they age the diagram for the modeling framework is shown in fig 1 a a conceptual graph of components in the modeling framework for simulating the long term impacts of bmps is shown in fig 1b 1 establishment period efficiency for bmps with vegetation the vegetation needs time to grow before these bmps reach expected efficiency microbial community assemblage and soil development would also affect bmp establishment the efficiency during the establishment period is called the establishment period efficiency establishment period efficiency would be unique for each type of practice and could be represented as a function of vegetation establishment microbial community assemblage and soil development 2 starting efficiency this is the efficiency right after the bmp is fully established starting efficiencies for each bmp type would have a distribution for reducing runoff volume and pollutant concentrations due to design installation and local condition differences designs of specific bmp types differ from one another due to different design standards used for each practice for example each design of rain gardens would be unique due to different vegetation type trees or shrubs media type type of soil and depth selected installation differences occur due to who installs the practices and how skilled they are local conditions include different soils climate and vegetation types in the drainage area starting efficiency could be represented as a function of design installation and local conditions 3 efficiency for each storm event distributions of bmp efficiency for each storm event in reducing runoff volume and pollutant concentrations would occur due to issues including storm event characteristics time of year watershed conditions and bmp conditions during each storm event features of storm events include size intensity and duration of an event small events low precipitation low intensity and or short duration typically increase bmp performance compared to average performance due to the small amount of runoff large and extreme events high precipitation high intensity and or long duration are expected to decrease bmp efficiency due to reaching or exceeding storage based on a specific design storm bmp conditions during each storm event have impacts on the performance of bmps for that storm event for example whether there is enough time for a detention basin to drain the ponded water between storm events and the conditions of vegetation practices during each storm event time of year could affect the performance of bmps due to the growth or decline of vegetation watershed conditions include land uses that would affect pollutant concentrations and loading rates and slope of the watershed that would influence delivery of runoff and pollutants bmps implemented in series would also be considered part of watershed conditions efficiency for each storm event could be represented as a function of storm event features time of year watershed conditions and bmp conditions during each storm event 4 efficiency between maintenance usually the effectiveness of non vegetative bmps would degrade between maintenance due to changes of engineered capabilities of practices such as clogging issues for infiltration bmps sediment accumulation for sedimentation bmps and degradation of bmp structure condition the performance of vegetative bmps would fluctuate between maintenance due to seasonal vegetation changes and decreasing trends would also occur due to degradation of engineering functions the performance of bmps which is pollutant specific may improve over a period in some cases such as the growth of vegetation for forested buffer strips efficiency between maintenance could be represented as a function of engineered capability of practices and seasonal vegetation changes 5 efficiency over life cycle during a bmp life cycle multiple maintenance activities would partially restore the performance of bmps the frequencies and impacts of maintenance activities differ due to the various levels of control and oversight given to each practice during a practice life cycle the failure point of a bmp that would require replacement of the practice needs to be considered some bmps are removed for various reasons such as the bmp fails to perform properly someone else acquires the property or the practice is no longer required therefore maintenance frequency restored bmp performance and failure point of bmps could be distributions efficiency over the life cycle is represented as a function of maintenance frequency restored bmp performance and failure point the five components above were combined to represent long term efficiency for a specific type of practice and specific environmental concern runoff pollutant 2 2 an approach for possible implementation of the modeling framework the following section describes an approach for possible implementation of the modeling framework to represent long term performance of bmps in reducing runoff volume and pollutant concentrations the relationships between bmp performance and time would be initially created with values that could be modified based on scientific literature limited data and best assumptions from experts in this study experts refers to the senior co authors of this paper who have substantial experience in modeling and or monitoring bmps in general experts are called upon to provide assumptions for bmp function and effectiveness when only limited data are available the efficiencies of bmps were estimated over time with appropriate relationships and parameters using an approach with the following steps 1 relationships of mean bmp effectiveness during the establishment period would be created for each bmp type and each environmental concern runoff pollutant 2 distributions of starting bmp efficiencies would be created for each bmp type and each environmental concern runoff pollutant the starting bmp efficiency would be selected from the distribution for each specific bmp application 3 different relationships mean bmp effectiveness vs time would be assumed for the long term performance of each bmp in reducing runoff volume and pollutant concentrations during periods between maintenance for some bmps such as grass swales and grass strips which are not as functional during the winter the relationships would be selected considering seasonal variation 4 during the life of a practice maintenance may be performed and each maintenance activity would partially restore mean bmp efficiency a time distributed around the design life would be used as the failure point of the bmp design life is the expected life of a bmp during which the practice performs properly with regular maintenance activities relationships of mean bmp effectiveness vs time would be created for the bmp life cycle 5 distributions of bmp efficiency for each storm event would be created for each bmp type and each environmental concern runoff pollutant mean value of the distribution for each storm event would be adjusted based on the relationship of mean bmp effectiveness over time the bmp efficiency for each storm event would be selected from the adjusted distribution for each specific bmp application 2 3 possible relationships of each component in the modeling framework 2 3 1 bmp establishment period efficiencies fig 2 a shows possible trends in mean bmp effectiveness y axis changing over time x axis for the establishment period the possible relationships which were based on experts knowledge consider vegetation growth for the establishment period fig 2a a a f show various relationships linear linear with a change of slope and four forms of non linearity effectiveness increases faster at the beginning and slower at the end effectiveness increases slower at the beginning and faster at the end effectiveness increases faster at the beginning slower in the middle and faster at the end and effectiveness increases slower at the beginning faster in the middle and slower at the end 2 3 2 possible distributions of starting bmp efficiencies and bmp efficiencies for each storm event possible distributions of starting bmp efficiencies and bmp efficiencies for each storm event were created with frequency density vs effectiveness fig 2b the distributions in fig 2b are assumptions for potential distributions of starting bmp efficiencies based on experts knowledge including normal distribution uniform distribution positively skewed distribution and negatively skewed distribution 2 3 3 possible mean bmp effectiveness changing between maintenance due to many bmps having similar maintenance requirements flynn et al 2012 in this study the example bmps were divided into 3 groups to create different possible distributions of mean bmp effectiveness changes between maintenance the 3 groups were filter infiltration porous pavement and blind inlet sedimentation dry pond wet pond and wetland and vegetative practices green roof wetland channel grass buffer strip grassed waterways and bioretention system similar to fig 2a c and d were relationships between bmp effectiveness and time based on linearity linear vs non linear and the rate slower vs faster at which bmp effectiveness changes over time increase vs decrease based on experts knowledge 1 filter infiltration practices or sedimentation practice the distributions in fig 2c were selected for the filter infiltration practices or the sedimentation practices due to the degradation of bmp effectiveness over time starting from the beginning of bmp implementation e g emerson et al 2010 haile et al 2016 the decrease in bmp effectiveness was because of degradation of physical functions of the practices such as clogging issues for infiltration bmps and sediment accumulation for sedimentation bmps 2 vegetative practices fig 2d shows the potential change in mean bmp effectiveness during each year for vegetative practices in the northern hemisphere these relationships were picked for vegetative practices with seasonal variations because these bmps start with lower efficiencies due to reduced efficiencies during winter months then these bmps have increasing efficiencies with the growth of vegetation finally bmp efficiencies drop again due to the decline of vegetation for estimating bmp effectiveness of vegetative practices in the southern hemisphere the relationships shown in fig 2d would need to be off set in time by 6 months fig 3 a shows an example of mean bmp effectiveness over time between maintenance for vegetative practices using fig 2d d based on experts knowledge relationships for mean bmp effectiveness from fig 2d d were selected for each year to create a time series of mean bmp effectiveness between maintenance for each year the potential efficiency would decline compared to the previous year an example of how bmp efficiencies are represented between maintenance is shown in fig 3b the steps of representing bmp efficiencies between maintenance are shown in fig 3b a a and b are the same bmp type however they are implemented in different areas with different designs and installations efficiencies of the two bmps change linearly linear relationship picked as an example between maintenance first based on the distribution of starting efficiencies the starting efficiencies for a and b are selected considering upper lower limits of starting efficiency then based on the mean efficiencies over time between maintenance upper lower limits of efficiency for each event and distribution of bmp efficiency for each storm event the efficiency for each storm event between maintenance is selected for a and b respectively fig 3b b shows an example randomly selected of the final results for bmp efficiencies between maintenance 2 3 4 change in mean bmp effectiveness for life cycle an example relationship of mean bmp effectiveness over time for the life cycle is shown in fig 3c based on experts knowledge during the life cycle maintenance was performed and each maintenance activity partially restored the mean efficiency of the bmp maintenance frequency for each practice was obtained based on bmp standards and expert opinion the relationships for the life cycle were created by combining multiple relationships between maintenance failure points existed when bmps needed to be replaced the possible probability distributions of bmp failure points relative to bmp life spans are shown in fig 2b x axes show time year and y axes show frequency densities 3 case study demonstration of the modeling framework the goal of the case study was to use the limited data available to demonstrate the creation of the relationships for each of the components in the modeling framework assumptions were made when data were not available more detailed equations can replace simple assumptions that can be improved when more data become available the long term impacts on tp were simulated for two commonly used bmps grass buffer strips agricultural bmp and bioretention systems urban bmp this section contains descriptions of the following subsections first the observed distributions of bmp efficiencies were summarized for grass buffer strips gbs and bioretention systems bs second relationships and parameters of the two bmps were selected for components in the framework third the steps of using the modeling framework to represent long term effectiveness of bmps with the selected relationships and parameters were described fourth two simulation scenarios were conducted 1 results were explored using the default parameters and 2 with the assumption of observed data being able to represent long term bmp efficiencies the bayesian method was used to match the simulated distribution of long term bmp efficiencies with the observed distribution 3 1 observed distributions of bmp efficiencies distributions of bmp efficiencies in removing pollutants based on limited data from the international stormwater bmp database www bmpdatabase org and literature gitau et al 2005 merriman et al 2009 were plotted for grass buffer strips and bioretention systems fig 4 a shows the distributions of grass buffer strip efficiencies in reducing tp and tss fig 4b shows the distribution of tp reduction efficiencies of bioretention systems these distributions were combinations of various bmps of the same type which had different designs installations ages storm events watershed conditions time of year and so on negatively skewed distributions were found data in fig 4a a are grass buffer strip efficiencies in reducing tp for agricultural land uses which are based on limited observed data literature data collected by gitau et al 2005 and merriman et al 2009 with no negative values no negative values were reported because the values represented averages of bmp efficiencies over study periods instead of efficiencies for individual storm events in reality bmp effectiveness can vary greatly from event to event and over time with bmps sometimes becoming sources of pollutants ahiablame et al 2012 dietz 2007 sharpley et al 2015 therefore we cannot use this distribution to represent grass buffer strips treating tp due to limited overall data and no negative values to represent negative efficiencies data in fig 4a b are grass buffer strip efficiencies in reducing tp for urban land use and contain many negative values this may be due to the amount of sediment in urban runoff typically being less than sediment in agricultural runoff and or phosphorus in runoff treated by grass buffer strips being mainly bound to sediment resulting in small masses of phosphorus reduction we considered grass buffer strips as an agricultural practice in this study the efficiency of grass buffer strips in reducing tp was assumed to be similar to tss therefore the fitted distribution in fig 4a c was used as the distribution of tp reduction efficiencies of grass buffer strips considered as an agricultural bmp 3 2 relationships and parameters for components in the modeling framework the modeling framework requires inputs describing the efficiencies for the establishment period starting point each storm event changes between maintenance and changes for the life cycle based on scientific literature limited data and best assumptions from experts relationships and parameters default min and max were selected for components in the modeling framework to represent long term bmp grass buffer strip and bioretention system effectiveness in reducing total phosphorus table 1 the selection of relationships and parameters is discussed in the following sections after completing the steps in the following sections all of the parameters in table 1 together can capture long term bmp efficiency with components of establishment period efficiency starting efficiency efficiency for each storm event efficiency between maintenance and efficiency over the life cycle fig 1a 3 2 1 establishment period efficiency the relationship shown in fig 2a c was selected to represent mean values of establishment period efficiency changing over time for both grass buffer strip and bioretention system due to the fact that once the vegetation height exceeds the maximum flow depth further growth may not provide additional benefit one full growing season 6 months or 184 days may through october plus two months or 61 days was recommended as the length of establishment period epe l for both grass buffer strips and bioretention systems njdep 2004 pdep 2006 the relationship for the mean establishment

establishment period epe a effectiveness at point a was assumed to be the same as the initial mean efficiency of the next year epe b effectiveness at point b was assumed to be 0 and epe c is the exponential parameter in the relationship of the mean establishment period efficiency epe c 0 17 when the bmp was established in 60 days epe c 0 055 when the bmp was established in 184 days 3 2 2 starting efficiency the generalized extreme value gev distribution was used to fit the observed data distribution the probability density function pdf of the gev distribution pdf gev kotz and

sigma se mu default values of the parameters se k se sigma and se mu were the same as the fitted distribution curves fig 4a c for gbs and fig 4b for bs se k was defined in a range so that the distributions would be negatively skewed the ranges of se sigma and se mu were defined as default values increased or decreased by 50 the distributions of the starting efficiencies were assumed to have mean values se mlar larger than the means of the overall efficiencies from the data because the mean bmp efficiencies immediately after full establishment of practices should be greater than those of the observed mean overall efficiencies 46 9 for gbs and 14 2 for bs the default values and ranges of se mlar were assumptions therefore the starting efficiency se is calculated as 4 se random se pdf gev 100 se mlar where random se pdf gev means to sample randomly from se pdf gev if the random sample of se was not between 0 and 100 then another random sample would be drawn the mean starting efficiency equals to the mean efficiency at the end of the establishment period 3 2 3 efficiency for each storm event bmp efficiency for each storm event was represented by sampling a distribution instead of being determined by a computer model for this demonstration each sampling from the distribution of efficiency for each storm event would consider storm event characteristics as one of the factors other factors included time of year watershed conditions and bmp conditions during each storm event if a model could capture pollutant concentration removal efficiency changes for each storm

between maintenance activities fig 2d d was selected as the mean bmp effectiveness over time during each year for both grass buffer strips and bioretention systems this relationship was selected because bmp efficiencies would be expected to be low at the beginning and end of each year northern hemisphere due to vegetation growth and decline and the efficiencies would be greater for the period

to have a 10 year life span nrcs 2008 the phosphorus reduction service life of bioretention systems can be more than 30 years lucas and greenway 2010 in this study life spans of the grass buffer strip and bioretention system were assumed to be 15 and 30 years respectively due to maintenance activities if a bmp was not replaced after the failure point zero efficiency was assumed for the practice from that point forward in time the mean efficiency over the life cycle elc mean was the combination of establishment period mean efficiency and mean efficiency between maintenance activities 14 elc

frequency and the bmp failure point 3 3 simulation scenarios 3 3 1 exploration of simulation results using default parameters to explore results using default parameters the default values in table 1 were used the method described in section 2 2 an approach for possible implementation of modeling framework was extended and used for the case study 1 starting efficiency was sampled using the method in section 3 2 2 starting efficiency if extreme values less than 0 or greater than 100 were obtained the sampling was repeated 2 the relationship of mean bmp efficiency over time during the establishment period between maintenance events and over the life cycle was created using the methods in section 3 2 1 establishment period efficiency section 3 2 4 change of efficiency between maintenance activities and section 3 2 5 change of efficiency over the life cycle respectively 3 bmp efficiency for each storm event was sampled using the method in section 3 2 3 efficiency for each storm event with varying mean efficiencies over the life cycle representing the adjusted mean of efficiency distribution for each storm event for extreme values less than 100 or greater than 100 the sampling was repeated following the above steps the efficiency distributions for each storm event fell around the line of the mean bmp efficiency such that bmp efficiencies less than 0 were possible 3 3 2 exploration of simulation results using the bayesian method due to limited available bmp efficiency data it was assumed that the observed data plotted in fig 4a c and b could represent the long term efficiencies of grass buffer strips and bioretention systems respectively the goal of this scenario was to demonstrate the application of the modeling framework by matching observed and simulated distributions using the bayesian method as more observed data become available in the future this method can be used to further improve the simulation results of long term bmp effectiveness uncertainties of predicted results of the modeling framework were explored using the bayesian method in bayesian inference box and tiao 2011 woodbury 1989 the parameters of a model z can be defined as a prior probability density functions pdf representing information regarding the parameters before observed data y are available the parameters are œÜ œÜh œÜe where œÜh represents parameters of the simulation model and œÜe represents parameters of the residual error model the prior pdf pdf prior œÜ which is from observations or experience can be modified as new information becomes available in

developed by schoups and vrugt 2010 to extend the use of likelihood functions when residuals are non gaussian nonstationary and correlated with various kurtosis and skewness reduces the need for assumptions about residuals this method provides statistics of the data and model residual errors with no separation of error sources the likelihood function was 16 l œÜ y nlog 2 Œ∏ Œ≥ Œ≤ Œ± Œ≥ Œ≥ 1 i

parameter sets based on yh predicted percentiles yœâ can be calculated prediction percentiles due to the uncertainties of the simulated model parameter values and errors can then be estimated matlab source code for the log likelihood function and dream zs algorithm can be found at http faculty sites uci edu jasper software the prior uncertainty ranges of simulation model parameters are shown in table 1 for parameters in the residual error model the heteroscedasticity intercept Œ∏ 0 was between 0 and 1 the heteroscedasticity slope Œ∏ 1 was between 0 and 1 the autocorrelation coefficient 1 was between 0 and 1 and the kurtosis parameter Œ± was between 1 and 1 two thousand equally distributed points were obtained for bmp efficiencies between 100 and 100 the density values of the corresponding points in the distributions of the predictions and the observed data were compared the pdf of the prior parameters were assumed to be uniform which was reasonable due to the large sample size schoups and vrugt 2010 the efficiencies of multiple bmps of the same type were needed to make simulation results more comparable to the observed results in the international stormwater bmp database therefore 100 grass buffer strips and 100 bioretention systems were simulated by modeling each practice 100 times with randomly selected starting efficiencies and other parameters 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of using default parameters the predicted efficiencies of a single grass buffer strip and bioretention system over the life cycle using default parameters are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively the first eight months of data were efficiencies during the establishment period for each year the efficiencies varied with lower efficiencies during winter and higher efficiencies during summer the potential highest efficiencies of each year would decrease compared to that of the previous year after each maintenance activity the highest efficiencies would be partially restored there were bmp failure points when practices needed to be replaced and the demonstrations in this study ended at these points fig 5 also shows many negative efficiency values during the winter this was supported by literature which reported decreased infiltration rates of infiltration bmps for winter months compared to those of summer months emerson and traver 2008 emerson et al 2010 hunt et al 2006 studied bioretention systems at three locations in north carolina and found the efficiencies were higher in warm seasons compared to those for winter uusi k√§mpp√§ and jauhiainen 2010 studied the ability of grass buffer strips in retaining total phosphorus in different seasons and found that effectiveness was lower in colder seasons compared to those for warmer seasons this modeling framework can provide suggestions of robust bmps with the consideration of prediction uncertainties for example uncertainty of the starting efficiency was represented as a distribution with the mean value greater than the overall mean from the database uncertainty of efficiency for each storm event was represented as a distribution along the line of mean efficiency over time uncertainty at a failure point was represented as a distribution around the life span currently the observed data from the international stormwater bmp database are limited and cannot represent long term bmp efficiencies and therefore cannot be sufficiently compared with simulated results for the following reasons 1 establishment period efficiencies were considered in the predicted results while observed results did not specify establishment period efficiencies 2 predicted starting efficiencies were selected from adjusted observed data distributions but the observed results did not specify which data were starting efficiencies if any 3 the predicted efficiency for each storm event was created by randomly sampling daily bmp efficiency based on adjusted observed distributions and considering the efficiencies changing over time during each year between maintenance and changing over the life cycle however observed data were either non winter month data or winter month data from warm states such as ca fl had limited data collected for each individual bmp and had mostly short term efficiencies for recently established bmps 4 changes in predicted efficiency between maintenance considered changes in mean bmp efficiencies over time however the observed data were short term and insufficient to represent changes in bmp efficiencies over time 5 changes in predicted efficiency for the life cycle considered failure points of bmps and regular maintenance activities that partially restored bmp efficiencies however the observed data were not sufficient to consider these the theoretical modeling framework can capture data gaps in estimating the long term performance of bmps to fill the data gaps detailed suggestions for new data collection were discussed in liu et al 2017b these suggestions included collecting data on the bmp design standard and specific design details for each practice quality of bmp installation skill level of installers installation process date of bmp installation monitoring and reporting paired inflow and outflow volume pollutant concentrations from practices for each day and each storm event maintenance dates and activities performed during maintenance bmp visual condition and high resolution photos with the location information recorded age of bmp when replacement is expected and reason for bmp being replaced soil land use slope vegetation and weather at bmp location and detailed information for any bmps implemented in series 4 2 results of using bayesian method comparisons of observed and simulated bmp efficiency distributions are provided in fig 6 the maximum a posteriori map values of epe c se mlar se k se sigma se mu ese k ese sigma ese mu ebm sigma ebm nh elc r and elc sigma for the grass buffer strip were 0 114 0 429 0 352 28 99 47 37 0 986 70 73 18 97 4 844 0 051 0 044 and 1 157 respectively map values of those parameters for the bioretention system were 0 140 0 373 0 821 32 53 2 013 0 400 80 58 1 702 3 821 0 146 0 033 and 1 385 respectively simulated distributions of long term bmp efficiency obtained from the map parameters are compared to observed distributions in the left side figures and simulated distributions matched the observed distributions well with 2000 points obtained from each distribution the r2 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse for the grass buffer strips were 0 994 and 0 992 respectively the r2 and nse for the bioretention systems were 0 996 and 0 991 respectively the right side figures show the predictive uncertainties for the long term bmp efficiency distributions with 95 confidence intervals the black bands show the uncertainties due to the parameters of the simulation model while the gray bands display total uncertainties the red dots are observed data in the figures of the uncertainty results the x axes plot 2000 data points obtained from individual distributions with equal intervals of x and the observed data were within the total uncertainties the total predictive uncertainties were small which was mainly due to the suitable posterior distributions of simulation model parameters and the residual error model parameters selected table 2 shows posterior parameter correlation coefficients no high posterior correlations between parameters were found with the map values of parameters the relationships of the key components of the modeling framework are plotted in fig 7 examples of starting efficiency 90 for both gbs and bs and failure point 15 years for gbs and 30 years for bs were used to plot mean efficiency changing between maintenance events and for the life cycle the calibrated mean percentages of epe a epe b during the establishment period had similar shapes for gbs and bs the calibrated epe c indicated that gbs would be fully established on day 88 and bs would be fully established on day 72 the distributions of the starting efficiencies were greatly different for gbs and bs due to the large number of high efficiencies in the observed data the distribution of starting efficiencies for gbs had very few negative values however the distribution of starting efficiencies for bs had many more negative values due to the mean values of the observed data being much smaller than that of gbs distributions of efficiency for each storm event were also greatly different for gbs and bs with gbs having a heavier negatively skewed distribution due to the larger number of observed high efficiencies the distributions of failure points were also different for gbs and bs with bs having a larger distribution space the mean efficiency between maintenance activities and for the life cycle showed that average efficiencies would change over time during each year with lower efficiencies at the beginning and the end of each year and with higher efficiencies during the summer between maintenance the highest efficiency of each year was lower than that of the previous year after each maintenance activity the bmp efficiencies were partially restored the values of calibrated parameter ebm sigma indicated that during each year the shape of the mean gbs efficiencies was flatter than that of bs for the same starting efficiency this meant that the changes in gbs efficiencies over each year were not as fast as those of bs deeper physical meanings of the parameters and relationships were not explored here due to the limited data available as more data become available the time series of observed data and calibrated data can be matched using the bayesian method for example the time series of bmp efficiencies over the establishment period during each year between maintenance and over the life cycle can be calibrated separately with further calibration of parameters the parameters and relationships in the components of the modeling framework can represent deeper physical meanings the equations proposed were verified using limited data a bayesian method was used to match the simulated distribution of long term bmp efficiencies with the observed distribution with the assumption that the observed data represented long term bmp efficiencies with additional data the same approach utilizing the bayesian method can be used to further improve the simulation results and modify verify the equations 4 3 extending the modeling framework to other models the modeling framework and results in this study could be adopted in hydrologic water quality models such as soil and water assessment tool swat long term hydrologic impact assessment low impact development l thia lid and storm water management model swmm as well as other models to better represent long term bmp effectiveness by changing model approaches for example the percent pollutant concentration reduction of each bmp in the l thia lid model would not be constant for long term effectiveness instead the removal efficiencies in the enhanced model would change during each year between maintenance and over the life cycle based on the framework and results of this study to improve the representation of bmps in swat and swmm relationships represented in the functions for components of the modeling framework section 2 1 need to be developed and incorporated in the models for instance to represent long term effectiveness of grassed waterways in swat variables including manning s roughness channel cover factor and channel erodibility factor would vary over time instead of being constant using the proposed modeling framework representation of long term bmp efficiencies can be further improved as more data become available the modeling framework can be adopted in various hydrologic water quality models to better represent long term bmp effectiveness the improved representation of long term bmp performance can help decision makers enhance decision support systems for creating long term stormwater management strategies for watershed management projects 5 conclusions the performance of bmps changes over their life cycle with substantial uncertainties which may result in overestimating long term efficiencies of bmps as they age in watershed planning strategies this study developed a high level and forward looking modeling framework to represent long term impacts of bmps that could be used to represent changes in bmp effectiveness over time in hydrologic and water quality models the components in the modeling framework would be considered together to represent long term efficiency for a specific type of practice and specific environmental concern runoff pollutant an approach for possible implementation of the framework was discussed possible relationships of each component in the framework were identified the long term efficiencies of two commonly used bmps grass buffer strips agricultural bmp and bioretention systems urban bmp in reducing tp were simulated to demonstrate the modeling framework the changes in efficiencies over the life cycle for a single bmp show that the efficiencies varied for each year with lower efficiencies during winter and higher efficiencies during summer the potential highest efficiencies of each year would decrease compared to those of the previous year after each maintenance activity the highest efficiencies would be partially restored there were failure points of bmps when they needed to be replaced not replaced in this study data gaps were captured in estimating long term performance of bmps with the assumption of observed data being able to represent long term bmp efficiencies the bayesian method was used to match the simulated distribution of long term bmp efficiencies with the observed distribution the simulated distribution can match the observed distribution well with small total predictive uncertainties with more observed data available in the future this method can be used to further improve the simulation results of long term bmp effectiveness the framework and results in this study could be adopted in hydrologic water quality models such as swat l thia lid and swmm to better represent long term bmp effectiveness the detailed use of the modeling framework in other hydrologic water quality models should be demonstrated in future studies currently there are insufficient data to determine long term variability of bmp efficiency in reducing runoff pollutants the scientific community needs to work together on this such as in exploring datasets to determine whether there are existing data to help solve the problem and collecting new data considering various components in the modeling framework developed in this study other modeling methods could also be developed to represent long term performance of bmps such as considering bmp efficiencies as a function of runoff amount pollutant load captured the simulated results were not compared to time series of observed data in this study due to the limited data available and this could be explored using the bayesian method in the future when more data are available acknowledgements this work was supported by usda nifa grant number s1063 quantification of best management practice effectiveness for water quality protection at the watershed scale 
7361,sediment cores from aquatic environments can provide valuable information about historical pollution levels and sources however there is little understanding of the uncertainties associated with these findings the aim of this study is to fill this knowledge gap by proposing a framework for quantifying the uncertainties in historical heavy metal pollution records reconstructed from sediment cores this uncertainty framework consists of six sources of uncertainty uncertainties in 1 metals analysis methods 2 spatial variability of sediment core heavy metal profiles 3 sub sampling intervals 4 the sediment chronology 5 the assumption that metal levels in bed sediments reflect the magnitude of metal inputs into the aquatic system and 6 post depositional transformation of metals we apply this uncertainty framework to an urban floodplain lake in south east australia willsmere billabong we find that for this site uncertainties in historical dated heavy metal profiles can be up to 176 largely due to uncertainties in the sediment chronology and in the assumption that the settled heavy metal mass is equivalent to the heavy metal mass entering the aquatic system as such we recommend that future studies reconstructing historical pollution records using sediment cores from aquatic systems undertake an investigation of the uncertainties in the reconstructed pollution record using the uncertainty framework provided in this study we envisage that quantifying and understanding the uncertainties associated with the reconstructed pollution records will facilitate the practical application of sediment core heavy metal profiles in environmental management projects keywords heavy metals historical trends palaeolimnology sediment cores uncertainty 1 introduction sediment cores from aquatic environments such as lakes estuaries and oceans are invaluable in developing an understanding of historical environmental changes that have occurred within the aquatic system and its catchment moy et al 2002 turney et al 2008 historical trends in the pollution of aquatic systems for example heavy metal pollution can be identified using sedimentary records from the beds of these waterbodies dated heavy metal depth profiles have the potential to guide the restoration and management of polluted aquatic ecosystems because they can be used to understand the main factors of pollution bindler et al 2011 ruiz fernandez et al 2004 vane et al 2011 they can also be used to understand the pre pollution or reference levels of an aquatic system which can assist in the development of environmental restoration targets bennion et al 2011 previous studies e g boyle 2001a have acknowledged that there are uncertainties in reconstructed heavy metal records these investigations have explored certain sources of uncertainties including uncertainties in sediment chronologies binford 1990 blaauw and heegaard 2012 telford et al 2004 walker 2012 and in microfossils maher et al 2012 however overall uncertainties in the use of sedimentary records for understanding historical environmental change are still not well understood nor have they been quantified smol et al 2012 there is a need to build upon these existing studies e g studies on sediment chronology uncertainty by placing these specific sources of uncertainties in the context of total uncertainty by accounting for these uncertainties we can create more robust historical heavy metal records that can guide environmental management and restoration in this investigation we propose to fill the existing knowledge gap by introducing an uncertainty framework for the reconstruction of historical heavy metal pollution records of aquatic systems using sediment cores we also demonstrate the use of this framework by applying it to a case study an urban floodplain lake of the yarra river in south east australia willsmere billabong the framework will enable us to assess not only the extent of uncertainty in the heavy metal record reconstructed using sediment cores but also will enable us to assess the largest sources of uncertainty we envisage that this work will facilitate greater confidence in historical heavy metal pollution records developed using sediment cores which in turn will lead to the implementation of these data in the design of environmental management and restoration strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 the proposed uncertainty framework fig 1 is the proposed uncertainty framework that shows the sources of uncertainty in heavy metal pollution records reconstructed using sediment cores it also describes how these uncertainty sources contribute to the total or overall uncertainty of these reconstructed records u total fig 1 the relationships between the sources of uncertainty depicted in fig 1 are as follows 1 there are uncertainties in the heavy metal depth profiles u metal depth profile due to analytical uncertainties in metal concentrations u metal analysis uncertainty in the spatial representativeness of the coring location u spatial and uncertainty in the sub sampling interval of the core u sub sampling the latter two uncertainties can be grouped together and classified as sampling uncertainties u sampling 2 uncertainties associated with age depth modelling u chronology have the potential to compound the uncertainties in the heavy metal depth profiles total uncertainty in the chronology is comprised of the uncertainty in the analysis of the age depth marker e g radio isotopes u dating analysis and uncertainties in the age depth modelling u modelling 3 the assumption that the pollutant concentration of sediments deposited on the sediment bed is representative of the pollutant levels entering the aquatic system u metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs also contributes to the total uncertainty 4 finally contributing to the total uncertainty is the assumption that there is no post depositional mobilization or loss of heavy metals buried in the bed sediment u post depositional changes 2 1 1 uncertainty in the metal analysis method heavy metal contents of sediment sub samples from cores can be analysed using techniques such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms conventional x ray fluorescence xrf inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes and micro x ray fluorescence micro xrf core scanning boyle 2001a croudace et al 2006 haschke 2006 different results can arise from these analytical techniques due to differences in metal speciation and partitioning this in turn can be affected by the source of metals the uncertainties associated with metal analysis of sediments using traditional techniques such as icp ms conventional xrf and icp aes has been previously explored e g moor et al 2001 pyle et al 1996 as such this source of uncertainty will not be discussed in this paper in detail 2 1 2 spatial variability when sediment cores are collected from aquatic systems it is assumed that the region of the sediment bed sampled can reliably represent the deposition occurring in a system that may be as large as several squared kilometres in area muir et al 2009 thapalia et al 2010 several studies b√°bek et al 2011 menounou and presley 2003 winter et al 2001 have obtained multiple cores from lakes with areas of 0 03 ha to 40 ha in europe the united kingdom and north america but the spatial variability between the heavy metal profiles obtained from cores were not investigated quantitatively there is still a need to understand the potential errors associated with choosing not to pursue multiple sampling 2 1 3 sub sampling interval uncertainty high resolution sampling can improve the precision of the heavy metal profiles however at the same time the costs of analysing large numbers of samples can be prohibitive there have been no studies to our knowledge that have quantified the potential errors associated with selecting coarser resolution sub sampling to develop pollutant profiles better understanding of the errors associated with coarser resolution sub sampling will allow future studies to select optimal sub sampling intervals and thereby enable more cost effective analyses 2 1 4 sediment chronology uncertainty uncertainties in the sediment chronology can result from uncertainties in the analysis of age depth markers e g radio isotopes or in the development of the age depth model using individual markers appleby 2001 bjorck and wohlfarth 2002 telford et al 2004 this type of uncertainty has been explored in previous studies e g binford 1990 telford et al 2004 for example using first order error analysis error propagation and monte carlo simulation analysis binford 1990 estimated that uncertainties in 210pb dates can be 1 2 years for 10 year old sediments 10 20 years for 100 year old sediments and between eight and 90 years old for 150 year old north american lake sediments additionally barnekow et al 1998 have noted an error of approximately 1000 years in the date assigned to bulk sediments deposited approximately 9000 years ago in a swedish lake however these previous studies have not compared the effect of the age depth modelling uncertainties against other uncertainties inherent in the reconstruction of historical heavy metal records 2 1 5 uncertainty due to the assumption that metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs it has been hypothesized that the water quality of aquatic systems can affect the extent to which heavy metals bind to particulate matter which in turn impacts the transfer of the pollution signal from the water column to the bed sediments boyle 2001a foster and charlesworth 1996 previous studies have compared historical heavy metal trends reconstructed using sediment cores against known heavy metal emission levels e g lockhart et al 2000 and used the correlation between the two to argue that sediment core heavy metal profiles accurately represent historical pollution trends however the differences between monitored heavy metal inputs into an aquatic system and the amount of heavy metals deposited on the bed sediment have not yet been quantified 2 1 6 uncertainty due to post depositional changes several studies have discussed how heavy metals in sediment cores could theoretically transform and move through buried bed sediments boyle 2001b foster and charlesworth 1996 hudson edwards et al 1998 spencer et al 2003 as outlined in these studies this can occur due to biological processes such as i the up take of heavy metals by aquatic plants ii increased oxygen levels in the plant root zones du laing et al 2009 wildi et al 2004 or iii the release of contaminants upon the degradation of organic matter van den berg et al 1999 water column chemistry ph dissolved oxygen and salinity can also affect the association of heavy metals to bed sediments boyle 2001a foster and charlesworth 1996 hudson edwards et al 1998 wildi et al 2004 in anoxic or low ph waters metals previously bound to sediments can be released and either become re associated to sediments at a different location in the sediment matrix or be completely lost to the water column foster and charlesworth 1996 increases in salinity can also lead to the increased transfer of metals from surface sediments to the water column du laing et al 2009 this post depositional mobility is largely impacted by the speciation and partitioning of metals which can be influenced by the metal source some previous investigations have monitored the loss of metals from sediments sakata 1985 studied the release of cu and pb from freshwater pond sediments in a 38 m deep reservoir in japan and found that these metals were generally not released from the bed sediment to the water column using seven annually laminated sediment cores from a lake in the north of sweden rydberg and martinez cortizas 2014 compared the concentration of metals on the surface of each of these cores with the concentration of metals in this same layer after burial whilst these studies found that there was minimal change in heavy metal content of surface sediments as they were buried they did not assess whether changes in heavy metals affects non surficial sediments 2 2 assessment and quantification of uncertainties to test the uncertainty framework discussed above we applied it to willsmere billabong 2 2 1 case study site geography willsmere billabong 37 79 s 145 04 e is located in the yarra river catchment in victoria australia fig 2 the bank full area is 1 9 ha and the local catchment area is approximately 15 ha leahy 2007 willsmere billabong receives stormwater from a local residential catchment of 1 8 ha fig 2b via a stormwater treatment wetland and also receives overbank flows from the main river channel when the water level exceeds 3 m ahd at willsmere billabong vic ses 2013 historically these overbank flow events occurred once a year but in the last 60 years this frequency has reduced to once every 3 to 4 years sinclair knight merz 2005 we selected this site because it is an urban aquatic system that has not experienced sediment dredging or disturbance and hence contains continuous deposition of sediments and their associated heavy metals 2 2 2 sediment core sampling and analyses in october 2012 and september 2013 three sediment cores were obtained from willsmere billabong fig 2b these cores were taken using a 40 mm diameter livingstone corer livingstone 1955 the lengths were 81 cm for w1 1 location 1 in fig 2b september 2013 96 cm for w4 location 2 in fig 2b october 2012 and 83 cm for w3 1 location 3 in fig 2b september 2013 two cores were taken from each of these locations a 204 cm core previously taken from willsmere billabong in 2001 w2001 was also used this was taken from location 2 fig 2b using the light weight modified hammer driven piston corer neale and walker 1996 with a 50 mm diameter pvc barrel this core was in storage at 4 c for 13 years before analysis before the cores were opened magnetic susceptibility was measured at 1 cm intervals using a bartington ms series one meter and core scanning loop bartington instruments witney uk all four sediment cores were then split longitudinally high resolution optical and radiographic images and magnetic susceptibility readings were obtained at 0 5 cm intervals using the itrax micro xrf core scanner croudace et al 2006 at the australian nuclear science and technology organisation ansto micro xrf data were obtained for w1 1 w4 and w3 1 using a molybdenum tube 30 kv voltage 45 ma current with a 10 s exposure time and readings obtained at 1 mm intervals chromium cr copper cu lead pb nickel ni and zinc zn the counts obtained for each element were normalised to total counts per second as per martin et al 2014 to enable comparison of heavy metal trends between cores w4 and w2001 were sub sampled at 1 cm intervals for heavy metal analyses w2001 from 0 to 79 cm all sub samples were dried and then sent to a national association of testing authorities nata accredited laboratory where metals were analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms following aqua regia nitric and hydrochloric acids digestion us epa 2007 the limits of reporting lors were 5 mg kg dry weight for as cr cu pb ni and zn when heavy metal concentrations were below the lor we reported the concentration as the lor divided by two standard quality assurance and control procedures were conducted including analyses of blank duplicates and spiked samples all blank samples were below the detection limit the maximum relative percentage difference between duplicates was 22 6 and the minimum recover rate was 80 2 further discussion of the quality assurance and quality control results are provided in section 3 1 in addition w4 was sub sampled for radio isotopic dating lintern et al 2016 sediment sub samples 1 cm thick were obtained from the top 42 cm of w4 at intervals of 1 to 5 cm and were processed as described by atahan et al 2015 unsupported 210pb activities were estimated as the difference between 210pb measured using 210po and supported 210pb activities measured using 226ra appleby 2001 at intervals of 5 12 cm between 18 and 70 cm in w4 137cs activities were measured and these activities were used to validate the chronology developed using the unsupported 210pb activities hollins et al 2011 2 2 3 field monitoring field monitoring of willsmere billabong was conducted over 12 months to assess whether the heavy metal inputs into the aquatic system could be accurately represented by the heavy metal levels in the sediments deposited on the billabong bed to sample sediments settling on the bed of willsmere billabong sediment traps were installed in september 2013 at the three locations within willsmere billabong fig 2b these sediment traps figure a2 in supplementary materials were comprised of four pvc tubes 53 mm internal diameter 300 mm length these dimensions were selected to ensure an aspect ratio of at least five as recommended by bloesch and burns 1980 for small lakes 200 ml jars with 5 cm diameter openings were fixed to the ends of the pvc tubes to collect settling sediment the total height of the trap structure was 1 m concurrently a dust deposition gauge figure a2 in supplementary materials was deployed approximately 100 m away from the lake fig 2b the gauge was designed in accordance with as nzs 3580 10 1 2003 standards australia 2003 and attached to a pole 2 m high approximately once a month over a 12 month period from october 2013 until november 2014 the sediment traps from the three locations were brought out of the water and the jars were removed so that the settled sediments could be analysed for heavy metals clean jars were then attached and the sediment traps re deployed at each collection water quality parameters ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ at one location in the lake using the u 50 horiba multi parameter water quality probe kyoto japan we also collected a grab sample 200 ml of the water column of willsmere billabong at the location of trap 2 from just under the water surface and collected samples of atmospheric deposition using the dust deposition gauge for the dust samples at collection the gauge was rinsed with a known volume of deionised water and all heavy metals adsorbed to the gauge were collected and combined into the dust deposition gauge samples hence we also accounted for the dissolution of particulate fractions in addition on nine occasions following rainfall events over 1 mm depth 200 ml grab samples of stormwater were taken from the stormwater drain that discharges into willsmere billabong all samples were sent to a nata accredited laboratory for heavy metals analyses the suspension was filtered 0 45 ¬µm and both particulate and dissolved fractions were digested using aqua regia and analysed for as cr cu pb ni and zn contents using icp ms us epa 2007 the filtered volume and total suspended solids tss concentration of the suspension were also recorded the lor for the particulate fractions were 0 1 Œºg sample for as cr zn and 0 05 Œºg sample for cu pb and ni the lor for the dissolved fractions were 1 Œºg l triplicate analyses were performed for the sediment suspensions in the 12 month sediment trap standard quality assurance and control procedures analysis of blanks duplicates and spiked samples were undertaken for all water column and sediment deposit samples all blank samples were below the limit of reporting the maximum relative percentage difference of duplicate samples was 26 and the minimum and maximum percentage recovery of spiked samples was 84 and 112 2 2 4 data analysis uncertainty in the metal analysis method u metal analysis quality assurance and quality control procedures from the icp ms analysis for w4 and w2001 were used to determine the magnitude of uncertainties in metal analysis duplicate analyses i e a check of analysis precision were conducted on one sample from w4 and three samples from w2001 the differences between duplicate analyses were expressed as relative percentage differences rpd the median rpd for cr cu ni pb and zn were calculated in addition to the central range of rpds for each of the metals four spiked samples i e samples with a known amount of heavy metals were analysed and the extent of the spiked sample recovered was expressed as recovery the median recovery and the central range of the recovery for cr cu ni pb and zn were determined spatial variability u spatial first the major sedimentary or lithological units contained in the cores were identified using optical and radiographic images and magnetic susceptibility profiles obtained for the three cores taken from willsmere billabong in 2012 and 2013 w4 w1 1 and w3 1 chronological markers were not used because they are only available for one core the heavy metal cr cu ni pb zn micro xrf measurements were averaged over 0 5 cm intervals in order to smooth the profile the uncertainty due to spatial variability was quantified as the percentage difference in the central tendency median and the spread central range of the heavy metal levels across the three cores for each sedimentary unit the median was used due to the non normal distribution of the data the uncertainty in the whole core due to spatial variability was calculated as the average of the percentage differences in central tendency medians and spread central range determined for each of the four sedimentary units these uncertainties were calculated for each of the heavy metals analysed using micro xrf cr cu ni pb and zn sub sampling interval uncertainty u sub sampling uncertainties due to coarse sub sampling intervals were assessed using the icp ms 1 cm interval heavy metal profiles as cr cu ni pb zn for w4 the icp ms profiles were used instead of the micro xrf results so that as could also be included in the analysis heavy metal profiles with intervals of 5 10 and 15 cm were constructed by i selecting every 5th 10th and 15th sub sample from the existing icp ms dataset and ii linearly interpolating between these selected points we assessed the strength of the correlation between the coarse sub sampling interval heavy metal profiles and the 1 cm resolution sub sampling heavy metal profile using the spearman rank correlation coefficient œÅ p 0 05 we then found the percentage difference between the interpolated heavy metal profiles and actual heavy metal profile at 1 cm intervals we calculated the median and the central range of these percentage differences to assess the accuracy of the heavy metal profiles developed using the coarser resolutions sediment chronology uncertainty u chronology the expected ages of the sediment sub samples from 0 2 5 10 15 17 20 25 28 33 37 and 42 cm depth in w4 were previously estimated in lintern et al 2016 using 210pb dating and using both the constant initial concentration cic and the constant rate of supply crs models appleby 2001 after correcting for sediment density measurement uncertainties of the ages at these 12 discrete points in w4 were also estimated in lintern et al 2016 these ages and the measurement uncertainties of these ages are provided in table a1 in the supplementary materials further details of the determination of these age depth models using 210pb radioisotopes are provided in lintern et al 2016 when generating sediment chronologies we first randomly generated the age of the sediment at the 12 points in w4 for which 210pb analysis was conducted we assumed that the age at that depth was drawn from a population of ages with a normal distribution the mean and standard deviation of this distribution being equal to the expected age and the measurement uncertainty from the 210pb analysis respectively table a1 constraints were placed on this stochastic process such that the age depth model would be realistic i e sediments deeper in the core would always be older than sediments higher in the core and that the sediments below 50 cm could not be older than 1964 and sediments above 50 cm would not be younger than 1964 as per the 137cs measurements lintern et al 2016 we also assumed that sediments in the core were younger than 1870 due to the presence of pollen from non native vegetation in a replicate core at a depth equivalent to the bottom of w4 lintern et al 2016 this was repeated 10 000 times using sediment ages determined using the cic model and 10 000 times using sediment ages determined using the crs model the age of each 1 cm thick sediment deposit in between the 12 discrete 210pb analysis depths was estimated by linear interpolation as such 20 000 different possible dated heavy metal profiles for as cr cu pb ni and zn were determined for w4 the uncertainty in sediment chronology was calculated as the median and central range of the relative difference the range divided by the average heavy metal concentration determined over the 20 000 iterations in each year uncertainty due to the assumption that metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs u metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs when quantifying the uncertainties due to the assumption that metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs the key metal inputs at the site at which the framework is being applied must first be identified for willsmere billabong the key metal inputs are urban stormwater atmospheric deposition and overbank flooding of the main river channel for willsmere billabong we developed a metals mass balance model figure a1 in supplementary materials to identify whether the total mass of metals entering willsmere billabong were equivalent to the mass of particulate metals deposited on the bed sediment and subsequently buried there input data for this model was collected over a period of 12 months at willsmere billabong despite potential errors and uncertainties in the results we adopted this modelling approach due to our inability to collect real time and high accuracy data of metal inputs and outputs of the floodplain lake and the metal deposition onto the lake bed the implications of these potential errors will be discussed further 2 2 4 1 mass balance model sediment traps retrieved each month contained both settled sediment and a small portion of the overlying water column fig 3 the mass of particulate settled metals collected by the sediment traps pms were calculated as 1 pm s pm st pm wc where pmst is the total mass of particulate metals in the sediment trap and pmwc is the mass of particulate metals in the water column these terms were calculated as follows 2 pm st pm st conc s st conc v st 3 pm wc pm pm conc s wc conc v st where pmst conc and pmwc conc are the concentrations of particulate metals in the sediment trap and water column respectively ¬µg mg sst conc and swc conc the concentration of sediments in the sediment trap and water column mg l vst is the volume of the sediment trap l vst was 250 ml the suspended sediments swc dissolved metal concentrations dmwc and particulate metal concentrations pmwc in the sediment trap water column were assumed to be equivalent to the suspended sediments dissolved metals and particulate metal concentrations in the lake water column which were measured before each sediment trap retrieval as previously discussed it should be noted that when heavy metal concentrations were below the lor half of the lor was reported the total metal inputs into the lake and the settled particulate metals were expressed in terms of the mass per area mg m2 as such the mass of settled particulate metals pms was divided by the area of the trap opening aj the diameter of the opening was 5 cm in the mass balance we only included the metals deposited on the bed sediment in the particulate form because these are the metals that are analysed when analysing heavy metals in sediment core sub samples furthermore the mass of dissolved metals in the pore water of settled sediments at the sediment water interface were found to be negligible when it was included in the mass balance figure a3 in the supplementary material the two main inputs for metals into willsmere billabong included in the mass balance are stormwater msw and atmospheric deposition ma although flooding of willsmere billabong by the main river channel mf is also a source of metals into willsmere billabong it was not included in the mass balance because flood events did not occur during the 12 month

rainfall during the month calculated using daily rainfall data collected approximately 6 km away from the lake melbourne regional office site australian bureau of meteorology and eia directly

drain using topographic and stormwater drainage network maps and 2 measure the areas of directly connected impervious surfaces roofs footpaths roads and driveways for the stormwater catchment using satellite photographs 50 90 40 and 0 of roofs roads driveways and footpaths were assumed to be directly connected respectively moglia et al 2014 roy and shuster 2009 the average and standard deviation of the five estimates of eia were used to develop a normal distribution random sampling from this distribution was used to estimate the eia the aim of this was to take into account measurement errors by the five individuals the metal mass delivered to the lake via stormwater each month was divided by the average wetland surface area aw surface areas of the lake were estimated from interpolation of

sediments reflect metal inputs the mass balance model was run 100 000 times to allow parameters to be varied stochastically the uncertainty u metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs is quantified as the percentage difference in the central tendency medians and the spread central range between 1 the modelled total metal input masses across the 100 000 iterations and 2 the observed 12 month accumulation of particulate metal masses in the sediment traps uncertainty due to post depositional changes u post depositional changes we identified the main sedimentary units within cores taken from willsmere billabong in 2001 core w2001 and 2012 core w4 using core images optical and radiographic and magnetic susceptibility profiles as for when uncertainties due to spatial variability were investigated w4 and w2001 are taken from the same location in willsmere billabong 10 years apart and as such minimal spatial variability between the two cores was assumed we calculated the percentage difference in the central tendency the median of the heavy metal concentration profiles and the spread central range in the heavy metal concentration profiles between w4 and w2001 within each sedimentary unit the overall uncertainty for the whole core was calculated as the average of the percentage differences calculated for each of the four sedimentary units 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantifying the uncertainties a framework that summarizes the uncertainties inherent in reconstructing historical heavy metal pollution trends using sediment cores is provided in table 1 units a to d in table 1 refer to lithological units common to cores w1 1 w4 w3 1 and w2001 sediment cores taken from locations 1 to 3 respectively in willsmere billabong and in 2001 fig 2b these sedimentary units that are similar across the three cores both according to colour texture and magnetic susceptibility profiles fig 4 are assumed to have been deposited in the same time period by comparable processes appendix c in the supplementary materials provides a detailed discussion on spatial variability in these stratigraphic units in willsmere billabong substantial uncertainties exist for reconstructed historical heavy metal records particularly due to i uncertainties in the sediment chronology and ii in the assumption that the settled heavy metal mass is equivalent to the heavy metal mass entering the aquatic system it is important to take note of the fact that the magnitude the primary origin of uncertainty differs between metals for as and zn the greatest uncertainty appears to be associated with the chronology for the remaining metals cr cu ni and pb the greatest uncertainty is the assumption that metal inputs into the lake are adequately represented by the accumulation of metals in bed sediments in the sub sections below we briefly discuss each source of uncertainty 3 1 1 uncertainties in the metal analysis method the results of duplicate and spiked samples analyses in the quality control procedures of the icp ms analysis table 1 indicates relatively low levels of uncertainty in the metal analysis 0 9 difference between duplicates and 81 90 recovery rates of spiked samples it is important to note however that these uncertainty measures were calculated using icp ms analytical techniques we recommend further work to identify uncertainty measures for additional analytical techniques such as xrf and micro xrf core scanning 3 1 2 uncertainties due to spatial variability table 1 indicates that there is spatial variability in heavy metal accumulation in aquatic environments even between locations only 30 m apart in terms of the whole core zn pb and cu experience the largest uncertainties of 58 40 and 36 table 1 3 1 3 uncertainties due to sub sampling intervals expected errors for as cr cu ni pb and zn with sub sampling intervals of 5 10 and 15 cm vary according to the level of variability present in the high resolution i e high precision heavy metal profile table 1 where the heavy metal concentrations exhibit low variability there is generally less error in the coarser resolution profiles fig 5 for example uncertainties are greater for zn compared to cr despite the magnitude in the uncertainties the spearman rank correlation coefficients indicated strong correlations œÅ 0 5 for all metals between the measured 1 cm resolution heavy metal profiles and the coarser resolution profiles table 1 as such it appears that overall heavy metal trend is not greatly affected by the sub sampling interval 3 1 4 uncertainties in the sediment chronology the heavy metal profiles vary considerably due to uncertainties in the sediment chronologies particularly for heavy metals that have large variability in sediment heavy metal concentrations over time for example zn which has increasing concentrations over time exhibits the largest 95 confidence interval in heavy metal concentrations from 50 mg kg to 540 mg kg in 1959 fig 5 with the large variability in heavy metal concentrations the largest uncertainty thus far we recommend that future studies account for the uncertainties associated with the sediment chronology however it is important to note that regardless of the large spread in heavy metals identified in each year s sediment deposit the overall trend in heavy metal concentrations e g increasing or constant with time is generally represented in the heavy metal profiles 3 1 5 uncertainties in the assumption that metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs most metals as cr pb zn have statistically significant differences between the distributions of modelled metal inputs into the lake and the mass of metals settling on the sediment bed table 1 this may indicate that there are high uncertainties in the assumption that metal inputs into aquatic systems are entrained in the bed sediment and subsequently buried in particular this may be suggesting that some metal inputs are dissolving upon deposition on the bed sediment surface either due to redox conditions ph levels or due to organic matter decomposition this is unlikely to be the case for pb and zn because the modelled total particulate and dissolved fractions input of pb and zn into the lake was less than the actual mass of settled sediments fig 6 as such for pb and zn and possibly for as and cr also this difference may be due to the errors in the analytical approach that we have adopted for this study this difference may be due to i the simplified conceptualisation of the mass balance of metals in willsmere billabong i e simplification in the mass balance model in section 2 2 4 and figure a1 in the supplementary materials or ii limitations in the collection of field data discussed in section 3 2 regardless of the discrepancies between modelled inputs of metals and the settled masses of metals the trends in the mass of particulate metals deposited on the lake bed generally correlates positively to the trends in the modelled mass of metals entering the system by atmospheric deposition and stormwater each month fig 6 there is a strong and statistically significant correlation for pb œÅ 0 71 p 0 05 figure a13 supplementary materials this suggests that a large fraction of the settlement of these metals on the sediment bed is governed by stormwater and atmospheric deposition inputs it appears that the trends in heavy metal profiles from willsmere billabong might be reflecting the metal fluxes from stormwater and atmospheric deposition there are however some limitations in the calculated values this is partly due to simplifications in the mass balance model one source of heavy metals and sediments that has not been quantified in the mass balance model is the transport of soils and sediments by overland runoff into the lake i e runoff that does not enter the lake through the stormwater drain this may be an important sediment source particularly given that during the 12 month field monitoring period several construction projects e g playground construction installation of underground irrigation systems were observed within the local willsmere billabong catchment these construction activities would have inevitably resulted in the mobilization of local catchment soils and sediments which could be carried into the lake by local overland runoff e g langbein and schumm 1958 wolman and schick 1967 another simplification in the mass balance model is that we have also not considered the effects of sediment focussing and resuspension from the lake bed in the mass balance sediments already deposited on the lake bed can be re suspended by wind and the activity of benthic aquatic species carper and bachmann 1984 gulati et al 2008 indeed verschuren 1999 has previously identified that re suspension of sediments can affect the accumulation of sediments and climate proxies in lake cores sediments re suspended from other regions of the sediment bed and therefore not included in stormwater or atmospheric sediment inputs may have settled in the sediment traps these sediment traps were designed so that sediments would not be resuspended from the traps bloesch and burns 1980 given the short fetch of willsmere billabong 140 m for the first 6 months of sampling and 60 m for the last 6 months of sampling it is unlikely that wind action would have contributed to significant amounts of sediment resuspension carper and bachmann 1984 however the presence of wildlife in the lake may have contributed to sediment re suspension leahy 2007 there were also some limitations in the collection of field data which may introduce errors in the values calculated for u metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs firstly the mass of deposited metals measured by the sediment trap may be an overestimation of the mass of metals settling onto the sediment bed surface in the absence of a sediment trap this can occur due to the fact that the presence of the sediment trap may interfere with the wind driven mixing in the water column leading to the greater settlement of particles into sediment traps brown et al 2000 in addition some simplifications were made when analysing the dust deposition gauge data it is possible that the dust deposition gauge may have overflowed in some months leading to the loss of heavy metals and underestimation of metal inputs this may account for the high temporal variability in atmospheric dust and metal deposition however measured values are likely reasonable as the mass of particulates entering the lake by atmospheric deposition 56 g m2 year is similar to total particle atmospheric deposition masses calculated for medium traffic density regions in sydney australia davis and birch 2011 indeed willsmere billabong is situated 300 m from a busy freeway estimated traffic load of 130 000 vehicles per day parris et al 2009 furthermore not all stormwater flow events were captured in the sampling and instead stormwater heavy metal concentrations and loads were modelled the peak stormwater tss and metal inputs may have been underestimated stormwater suspended solids concentrations had a mean of 7 5 mg l and a standard deviation of 2 7 mg l whilst this is less than typical tss concentrations in stormwater of 150 mg l duncan 1999 this difference may be due to the presence of a stormwater treatment wetland although the performance of the wetland that treats the stormwater draining into willsmere billabong has not been measured stormwater treatment wetlands can have tss removal efficiencies of up to 95 carleton et al 2001 3 1 6 uncertainties due to post depositional mobilization in buried sediments the kruskal wallis test indicates that whilst the heavy metal profiles from the two sediment cores are similar there are statistically significant differences observed for several heavy metals in some of the units table 1 these differences are within the range of differences resulting from spatial variability in the heavy metal profiles table 1 the percentage difference in medians of metal concentrations within unit a were 3 and 12 for cr and pb respectively and these are in a similar range as the absolute percentage difference in medians that are due to spatial variability 2 for cr and 9 for pb table 1 this suggests that the percentage differences between w4 and w2001 heavy metal concentrations may not be a result of post depositional mobility this discrepancy instead may be due to spatial variability because although w4 and w2001 were both taken from the same point in willsmere billabong location 2 in fig 2b they are likely to have been taken several centimetres apart from each other indeed visual inspection of the high resolution metal profiles of w2001 and w4 suggests that the metal trends of the two cores are quite similar figure a14 in the supplementary material this also suggests that there were negligible changes to the heavy metal profiles over the 13 years that the core was in storage 3 2 general discussion we recommend that future studies that intend to use sediment cores to reconstruct historical trends in heavy metal levels in aquatic systems use this framework to investigate the magnitude of uncertainty associated with the reconstructed record of historical heavy metal contamination in the aquatic system in addition the findings from this study about the main sources of uncertainty of different metals could be used to better plan sampling and analytical methods in future studies in particular it appears that the more variable the heavy metal levels in a sediment core the greater level of uncertainty can arise as such for sediment cores where large fluctuations in heavy metal levels are expected finer resolution of sub sampling interval should be adopted however there are limitations associated with the presented uncertainty framework which should be addressed in future studies firstly the uncertainty values provided in table 1 are specific to a relatively small and shallow urban floodplain lake in south east australia the magnitudes of uncertainty calculated for the historical heavy metal records for this lake may differ to those of other lakes globally it is likely that lake properties such as the lake size bathymetry hydrology catchment characteristics and physico chemical properties of the water column would impact the magnitude and effect of each of the uncertainties discussed above as such uncertainty values should be calculated for other aquatic systems with varying characteristics e g climatic conditions ecologies catchment characteristics and physico chemical properties of both the water column and bed sediments in addition it is expected that different systems e g marine and oceanic will have different sediment and heavy metal accumulation rates therefore further work that studies the differences in sub sampling effect in marine and other lake sediment cores would be of great benefit further work should be conducted to identify if homogenised sediments over 5 10 or 15 cm intervals would yield similar levels of uncertainty the methods and framework discussed here could be applied to several of these other systems to identify these underlying processes we acknowledge however that the method of quantifying each of the uncertainties in the framework utilised in this study may not be applicable to all sites specifically sites that are not small urbanised lakes like willsmere billabong in which case the methodology should be adapted to suit the specific site secondly further work is required to develop more understanding of the uncertainties in reconstructed heavy metal records due to the uncertainties in metal analysis methods section 3 1 we calculated uncertainties associated with only one technique icp ms and conducted at one particular laboratory we recommend the identification of uncertainty magnitudes for other techniques such as xrf micro xrf core scanning or icp aes and for a range of different instruments finally there may be some errors associated with the uncertainty values calculated for the uncertainties in reconstructed heavy metal records due to the assumption that bed sediment heavy metal concentrations reflect metal inputs into the lake section 3 1 5 there were limitations in both the data collection and simplifications in the conceptualisations of the mass balance model as detailed above in section 3 1 4 conclusions through this investigation we have demonstrated the importance of quantifying the uncertainties underlying the use of sediment cores to reconstruct historical trends in metal pollution in a small aquatic system we recommend that future studies use the proposed uncertainty framework and methods to quantify and assess the magnitude of uncertainty associated with historical heavy metal water quality trends developed using sediment cores from aquatic systems this is because the uncertainties quantified in this study are relevant to willsmere billabong further work is needed to identify the chemo dynamic processes occurring in these aquatic environments to better understand the way in which these uncertainties will vary across different sites in addition future work should aim to refine the estimates of uncertainty determined in this study for example it would be of great benefit to conduct a longer term field monitoring study over a period of 5 to 10 years to develop a more thorough understanding of the representativeness of the sediment core data of metal inputs into the lake employing real time monitoring of metal

7361,sediment cores from aquatic environments can provide valuable information about historical pollution levels and sources however there is little understanding of the uncertainties associated with these findings the aim of this study is to fill this knowledge gap by proposing a framework for quantifying the uncertainties in historical heavy metal pollution records reconstructed from sediment cores this uncertainty framework consists of six sources of uncertainty uncertainties in 1 metals analysis methods 2 spatial variability of sediment core heavy metal profiles 3 sub sampling intervals 4 the sediment chronology 5 the assumption that metal levels in bed sediments reflect the magnitude of metal inputs into the aquatic system and 6 post depositional transformation of metals we apply this uncertainty framework to an urban floodplain lake in south east australia willsmere billabong we find that for this site uncertainties in historical dated heavy metal profiles can be up to 176 largely due to uncertainties in the sediment chronology and in the assumption that the settled heavy metal mass is equivalent to the heavy metal mass entering the aquatic system as such we recommend that future studies reconstructing historical pollution records using sediment cores from aquatic systems undertake an investigation of the uncertainties in the reconstructed pollution record using the uncertainty framework provided in this study we envisage that quantifying and understanding the uncertainties associated with the reconstructed pollution records will facilitate the practical application of sediment core heavy metal profiles in environmental management projects keywords heavy metals historical trends palaeolimnology sediment cores uncertainty 1 introduction sediment cores from aquatic environments such as lakes estuaries and oceans are invaluable in developing an understanding of historical environmental changes that have occurred within the aquatic system and its catchment moy et al 2002 turney et al 2008 historical trends in the pollution of aquatic systems for example heavy metal pollution can be identified using sedimentary records from the beds of these waterbodies dated heavy metal depth profiles have the potential to guide the restoration and management of polluted aquatic ecosystems because they can be used to understand the main factors of pollution bindler et al 2011 ruiz fernandez et al 2004 vane et al 2011 they can also be used to understand the pre pollution or reference levels of an aquatic system which can assist in the development of environmental restoration targets bennion et al 2011 previous studies e g boyle 2001a have acknowledged that there are uncertainties in reconstructed heavy metal records these investigations have explored certain sources of uncertainties including uncertainties in sediment chronologies binford 1990 blaauw and heegaard 2012 telford et al 2004 walker 2012 and in microfossils maher et al 2012 however overall uncertainties in the use of sedimentary records for understanding historical environmental change are still not well understood nor have they been quantified smol et al 2012 there is a need to build upon these existing studies e g studies on sediment chronology uncertainty by placing these specific sources of uncertainties in the context of total uncertainty by accounting for these uncertainties we can create more robust historical heavy metal records that can guide environmental management and restoration in this investigation we propose to fill the existing knowledge gap by introducing an uncertainty framework for the reconstruction of historical heavy metal pollution records of aquatic systems using sediment cores we also demonstrate the use of this framework by applying it to a case study an urban floodplain lake of the yarra river in south east australia willsmere billabong the framework will enable us to assess not only the extent of uncertainty in the heavy metal record reconstructed using sediment cores but also will enable us to assess the largest sources of uncertainty we envisage that this work will facilitate greater confidence in historical heavy metal pollution records developed using sediment cores which in turn will lead to the implementation of these data in the design of environmental management and restoration strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 the proposed uncertainty framework fig 1 is the proposed uncertainty framework that shows the sources of uncertainty in heavy metal pollution records reconstructed using sediment cores it also describes how these uncertainty sources contribute to the total or overall uncertainty of these reconstructed records u total fig 1 the relationships between the sources of uncertainty depicted in fig 1 are as follows 1 there are uncertainties in the heavy metal depth profiles u metal depth profile due to analytical uncertainties in metal concentrations u metal analysis uncertainty in the spatial representativeness of the coring location u spatial and uncertainty in the sub sampling interval of the core u sub sampling the latter two uncertainties can be grouped together and classified as sampling uncertainties u sampling 2 uncertainties associated with age depth modelling u chronology have the potential to compound the uncertainties in the heavy metal depth profiles total uncertainty in the chronology is comprised of the uncertainty in the analysis of the age depth marker e g radio isotopes u dating analysis and uncertainties in the age depth modelling u modelling 3 the assumption that the pollutant concentration of sediments deposited on the sediment bed is representative of the pollutant levels entering the aquatic system u metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs also contributes to the total uncertainty 4 finally contributing to the total uncertainty is the assumption that there is no post depositional mobilization or loss of heavy metals buried in the bed sediment u post depositional changes 2 1 1 uncertainty in the metal analysis method heavy metal contents of sediment sub samples from cores can be analysed using techniques such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms conventional x ray fluorescence xrf inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes and micro x ray fluorescence micro xrf core scanning boyle 2001a croudace et al 2006 haschke 2006 different results can arise from these analytical techniques due to differences in metal speciation and partitioning this in turn can be affected by the source of metals the uncertainties associated with metal analysis of sediments using traditional techniques such as icp ms conventional xrf and icp aes has been previously explored e g moor et al 2001 pyle et al 1996 as such this source of uncertainty will not be discussed in this paper in detail 2 1 2 spatial variability when sediment cores are collected from aquatic systems it is assumed that the region of the sediment bed sampled can reliably represent the deposition occurring in a system that may be as large as several squared kilometres in area muir et al 2009 thapalia et al 2010 several studies b√°bek et al 2011 menounou and presley 2003 winter et al 2001 have obtained multiple cores from lakes with areas of 0 03 ha to 40 ha in europe the united kingdom and north america but the spatial variability between the heavy metal profiles obtained from cores were not investigated quantitatively there is still a need to understand the potential errors associated with choosing not to pursue multiple sampling 2 1 3 sub sampling interval uncertainty high resolution sampling can improve the precision of the heavy metal profiles however at the same time the costs of analysing large numbers of samples can be prohibitive there have been no studies to our knowledge that have quantified the potential errors associated with selecting coarser resolution sub sampling to develop pollutant profiles better understanding of the errors associated with coarser resolution sub sampling will allow future studies to select optimal sub sampling intervals and thereby enable more cost effective analyses 2 1 4 sediment chronology uncertainty uncertainties in the sediment chronology can result from uncertainties in the analysis of age depth markers e g radio isotopes or in the development of the age depth model using individual markers appleby 2001 bjorck and wohlfarth 2002 telford et al 2004 this type of uncertainty has been explored in previous studies e g binford 1990 telford et al 2004 for example using first order error analysis error propagation and monte carlo simulation analysis binford 1990 estimated that uncertainties in 210pb dates can be 1 2 years for 10 year old sediments 10 20 years for 100 year old sediments and between eight and 90 years old for 150 year old north american lake sediments additionally barnekow et al 1998 have noted an error of approximately 1000 years in the date assigned to bulk sediments deposited approximately 9000 years ago in a swedish lake however these previous studies have not compared the effect of the age depth modelling uncertainties against other uncertainties inherent in the reconstruction of historical heavy metal records 2 1 5 uncertainty due to the assumption that metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs it has been hypothesized that the water quality of aquatic systems can affect the extent to which heavy metals bind to particulate matter which in turn impacts the transfer of the pollution signal from the water column to the bed sediments boyle 2001a foster and charlesworth 1996 previous studies have compared historical heavy metal trends reconstructed using sediment cores against known heavy metal emission levels e g lockhart et al 2000 and used the correlation between the two to argue that sediment core heavy metal profiles accurately represent historical pollution trends however the differences between monitored heavy metal inputs into an aquatic system and the amount of heavy metals deposited on the bed sediment have not yet been quantified 2 1 6 uncertainty due to post depositional changes several studies have discussed how heavy metals in sediment cores could theoretically transform and move through buried bed sediments boyle 2001b foster and charlesworth 1996 hudson edwards et al 1998 spencer et al 2003 as outlined in these studies this can occur due to biological processes such as i the up take of heavy metals by aquatic plants ii increased oxygen levels in the plant root zones du laing et al 2009 wildi et al 2004 or iii the release of contaminants upon the degradation of organic matter van den berg et al 1999 water column chemistry ph dissolved oxygen and salinity can also affect the association of heavy metals to bed sediments boyle 2001a foster and charlesworth 1996 hudson edwards et al 1998 wildi et al 2004 in anoxic or low ph waters metals previously bound to sediments can be released and either become re associated to sediments at a different location in the sediment matrix or be completely lost to the water column foster and charlesworth 1996 increases in salinity can also lead to the increased transfer of metals from surface sediments to the water column du laing et al 2009 this post depositional mobility is largely impacted by the speciation and partitioning of metals which can be influenced by the metal source some previous investigations have monitored the loss of metals from sediments sakata 1985 studied the release of cu and pb from freshwater pond sediments in a 38 m deep reservoir in japan and found that these metals were generally not released from the bed sediment to the water column using seven annually laminated sediment cores from a lake in the north of sweden rydberg and martinez cortizas 2014 compared the concentration of metals on the surface of each of these cores with the concentration of metals in this same layer after burial whilst these studies found that there was minimal change in heavy metal content of surface sediments as they were buried they did not assess whether changes in heavy metals affects non surficial sediments 2 2 assessment and quantification of uncertainties to test the uncertainty framework discussed above we applied it to willsmere billabong 2 2 1 case study site geography willsmere billabong 37 79 s 145 04 e is located in the yarra river catchment in victoria australia fig 2 the bank full area is 1 9 ha and the local catchment area is approximately 15 ha leahy 2007 willsmere billabong receives stormwater from a local residential catchment of 1 8 ha fig 2b via a stormwater treatment wetland and also receives overbank flows from the main river channel when the water level exceeds 3 m ahd at willsmere billabong vic ses 2013 historically these overbank flow events occurred once a year but in the last 60 years this frequency has reduced to once every 3 to 4 years sinclair knight merz 2005 we selected this site because it is an urban aquatic system that has not experienced sediment dredging or disturbance and hence contains continuous deposition of sediments and their associated heavy metals 2 2 2 sediment core sampling and analyses in october 2012 and september 2013 three sediment cores were obtained from willsmere billabong fig 2b these cores were taken using a 40 mm diameter livingstone corer livingstone 1955 the lengths were 81 cm for w1 1 location 1 in fig 2b september 2013 96 cm for w4 location 2 in fig 2b october 2012 and 83 cm for w3 1 location 3 in fig 2b september 2013 two cores were taken from each of these locations a 204 cm core previously taken from willsmere billabong in 2001 w2001 was also used this was taken from location 2 fig 2b using the light weight modified hammer driven piston corer neale and walker 1996 with a 50 mm diameter pvc barrel this core was in storage at 4 c for 13 years before analysis before the cores were opened magnetic susceptibility was measured at 1 cm intervals using a bartington ms series one meter and core scanning loop bartington instruments witney uk all four sediment cores were then split longitudinally high resolution optical and radiographic images and magnetic susceptibility readings were obtained at 0 5 cm intervals using the itrax micro xrf core scanner croudace et al 2006 at the australian nuclear science and technology organisation ansto micro xrf data were obtained for w1 1 w4 and w3 1 using a molybdenum tube 30 kv voltage 45 ma current with a 10 s exposure time and readings obtained at 1 mm intervals chromium cr copper cu lead pb nickel ni and zinc zn the counts obtained for each element were normalised to total counts per second as per martin et al 2014 to enable comparison of heavy metal trends between cores w4 and w2001 were sub sampled at 1 cm intervals for heavy metal analyses w2001 from 0 to 79 cm all sub samples were dried and then sent to a national association of testing authorities nata accredited laboratory where metals were analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms following aqua regia nitric and hydrochloric acids digestion us epa 2007 the limits of reporting lors were 5 mg kg dry weight for as cr cu pb ni and zn when heavy metal concentrations were below the lor we reported the concentration as the lor divided by two standard quality assurance and control procedures were conducted including analyses of blank duplicates and spiked samples all blank samples were below the detection limit the maximum relative percentage difference between duplicates was 22 6 and the minimum recover rate was 80 2 further discussion of the quality assurance and quality control results are provided in section 3 1 in addition w4 was sub sampled for radio isotopic dating lintern et al 2016 sediment sub samples 1 cm thick were obtained from the top 42 cm of w4 at intervals of 1 to 5 cm and were processed as described by atahan et al 2015 unsupported 210pb activities were estimated as the difference between 210pb measured using 210po and supported 210pb activities measured using 226ra appleby 2001 at intervals of 5 12 cm between 18 and 70 cm in w4 137cs activities were measured and these activities were used to validate the chronology developed using the unsupported 210pb activities hollins et al 2011 2 2 3 field monitoring field monitoring of willsmere billabong was conducted over 12 months to assess whether the heavy metal inputs into the aquatic system could be accurately represented by the heavy metal levels in the sediments deposited on the billabong bed to sample sediments settling on the bed of willsmere billabong sediment traps were installed in september 2013 at the three locations within willsmere billabong fig 2b these sediment traps figure a2 in supplementary materials were comprised of four pvc tubes 53 mm internal diameter 300 mm length these dimensions were selected to ensure an aspect ratio of at least five as recommended by bloesch and burns 1980 for small lakes 200 ml jars with 5 cm diameter openings were fixed to the ends of the pvc tubes to collect settling sediment the total height of the trap structure was 1 m concurrently a dust deposition gauge figure a2 in supplementary materials was deployed approximately 100 m away from the lake fig 2b the gauge was designed in accordance with as nzs 3580 10 1 2003 standards australia 2003 and attached to a pole 2 m high approximately once a month over a 12 month period from october 2013 until november 2014 the sediment traps from the three locations were brought out of the water and the jars were removed so that the settled sediments could be analysed for heavy metals clean jars were then attached and the sediment traps re deployed at each collection water quality parameters ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ at one location in the lake using the u 50 horiba multi parameter water quality probe kyoto japan we also collected a grab sample 200 ml of the water column of willsmere billabong at the location of trap 2 from just under the water surface and collected samples of atmospheric deposition using the dust deposition gauge for the dust samples at collection the gauge was rinsed with a known volume of deionised water and all heavy metals adsorbed to the gauge were collected and combined into the dust deposition gauge samples hence we also accounted for the dissolution of particulate fractions in addition on nine occasions following rainfall events over 1 mm depth 200 ml grab samples of stormwater were taken from the stormwater drain that discharges into willsmere billabong all samples were sent to a nata accredited laboratory for heavy metals analyses the suspension was filtered 0 45 ¬µm and both particulate and dissolved fractions were digested using aqua regia and analysed for as cr cu pb ni and zn contents using icp ms us epa 2007 the filtered volume and total suspended solids tss concentration of the suspension were also recorded the lor for the particulate fractions were 0 1 Œºg sample for as cr zn and 0 05 Œºg sample for cu pb and ni the lor for the dissolved fractions were 1 Œºg l triplicate analyses were performed for the sediment suspensions in the 12 month sediment trap standard quality assurance and control procedures analysis of blanks duplicates and spiked samples were undertaken for all water column and sediment deposit samples all blank samples were below the limit of reporting the maximum relative percentage difference of duplicate samples was 26 and the minimum and maximum percentage recovery of spiked samples was 84 and 112 2 2 4 data analysis uncertainty in the metal analysis method u metal analysis quality assurance and quality control procedures from the icp ms analysis for w4 and w2001 were used to determine the magnitude of uncertainties in metal analysis duplicate analyses i e a check of analysis precision were conducted on one sample from w4 and three samples from w2001 the differences between duplicate analyses were expressed as relative percentage differences rpd the median rpd for cr cu ni pb and zn were calculated in addition to the central range of rpds for each of the metals four spiked samples i e samples with a known amount of heavy metals were analysed and the extent of the spiked sample recovered was expressed as recovery the median recovery and the central range of the recovery for cr cu ni pb and zn were determined spatial variability u spatial first the major sedimentary or lithological units contained in the cores were identified using optical and radiographic images and magnetic susceptibility profiles obtained for the three cores taken from willsmere billabong in 2012 and 2013 w4 w1 1 and w3 1 chronological markers were not used because they are only available for one core the heavy metal cr cu ni pb zn micro xrf measurements were averaged over 0 5 cm intervals in order to smooth the profile the uncertainty due to spatial variability was quantified as the percentage difference in the central tendency median and the spread central range of the heavy metal levels across the three cores for each sedimentary unit the median was used due to the non normal distribution of the data the uncertainty in the whole core due to spatial variability was calculated as the average of the percentage differences in central tendency medians and spread central range determined for each of the four sedimentary units these uncertainties were calculated for each of the heavy metals analysed using micro xrf cr cu ni pb and zn sub sampling interval uncertainty u sub sampling uncertainties due to coarse sub sampling intervals were assessed using the icp ms 1 cm interval heavy metal profiles as cr cu ni pb zn for w4 the icp ms profiles were used instead of the micro xrf results so that as could also be included in the analysis heavy metal profiles with intervals of 5 10 and 15 cm were constructed by i selecting every 5th 10th and 15th sub sample from the existing icp ms dataset and ii linearly interpolating between these selected points we assessed the strength of the correlation between the coarse sub sampling interval heavy metal profiles and the 1 cm resolution sub sampling heavy metal profile using the spearman rank correlation coefficient œÅ p 0 05 we then found the percentage difference between the interpolated heavy metal profiles and actual heavy metal profile at 1 cm intervals we calculated the median and the central range of these percentage differences to assess the accuracy of the heavy metal profiles developed using the coarser resolutions sediment chronology uncertainty u chronology the expected ages of the sediment sub samples from 0 2 5 10 15 17 20 25 28 33 37 and 42 cm depth in w4 were previously estimated in lintern et al 2016 using 210pb dating and using both the constant initial concentration cic and the constant rate of supply crs models appleby 2001 after correcting for sediment density measurement uncertainties of the ages at these 12 discrete points in w4 were also estimated in lintern et al 2016 these ages and the measurement uncertainties of these ages are provided in table a1 in the supplementary materials further details of the determination of these age depth models using 210pb radioisotopes are provided in lintern et al 2016 when generating sediment chronologies we first randomly generated the age of the sediment at the 12 points in w4 for which 210pb analysis was conducted we assumed that the age at that depth was drawn from a population of ages with a normal distribution the mean and standard deviation of this distribution being equal to the expected age and the measurement uncertainty from the 210pb analysis respectively table a1 constraints were placed on this stochastic process such that the age depth model would be realistic i e sediments deeper in the core would always be older than sediments higher in the core and that the sediments below 50 cm could not be older than 1964 and sediments above 50 cm would not be younger than 1964 as per the 137cs measurements lintern et al 2016 we also assumed that sediments in the core were younger than 1870 due to the presence of pollen from non native vegetation in a replicate core at a depth equivalent to the bottom of w4 lintern et al 2016 this was repeated 10 000 times using sediment ages determined using the cic model and 10 000 times using sediment ages determined using the crs model the age of each 1 cm thick sediment deposit in between the 12 discrete 210pb analysis depths was estimated by linear interpolation as such 20 000 different possible dated heavy metal profiles for as cr cu pb ni and zn were determined for w4 the uncertainty in sediment chronology was calculated as the median and central range of the relative difference the range divided by the average heavy metal concentration determined over the 20 000 iterations in each year uncertainty due to the assumption that metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs u metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs when quantifying the uncertainties due to the assumption that metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs the key metal inputs at the site at which the framework is being applied must first be identified for willsmere billabong the key metal inputs are urban stormwater atmospheric deposition and overbank flooding of the main river channel for willsmere billabong we developed a metals mass balance model figure a1 in supplementary materials to identify whether the total mass of metals entering willsmere billabong were equivalent to the mass of particulate metals deposited on the bed sediment and subsequently buried there input data for this model was collected over a period of 12 months at willsmere billabong despite potential errors and uncertainties in the results we adopted this modelling approach due to our inability to collect real time and high accuracy data of metal inputs and outputs of the floodplain lake and the metal deposition onto the lake bed the implications of these potential errors will be discussed further 2 2 4 1 mass balance model sediment traps retrieved each month contained both settled sediment and a small portion of the overlying water column fig 3 the mass of particulate settled metals collected by the sediment traps pms were calculated as 1 pm s pm st pm wc where pmst is the total mass of particulate metals in the sediment trap and pmwc is the mass of particulate metals in the water column these terms were calculated as follows 2 pm st pm st conc s st conc v st 3 pm wc pm pm conc s wc conc v st where pmst conc and pmwc conc are the concentrations of particulate metals in the sediment trap and water column respectively ¬µg mg sst conc and swc conc the concentration of sediments in the sediment trap and water column mg l vst is the volume of the sediment trap l vst was 250 ml the suspended sediments swc dissolved metal concentrations dmwc and particulate metal concentrations pmwc in the sediment trap water column were assumed to be equivalent to the suspended sediments dissolved metals and particulate metal concentrations in the lake water column which were measured before each sediment trap retrieval as previously discussed it should be noted that when heavy metal concentrations were below the lor half of the lor was reported the total metal inputs into the lake and the settled particulate metals were expressed in terms of the mass per area mg m2 as such the mass of settled particulate metals pms was divided by the area of the trap opening aj the diameter of the opening was 5 cm in the mass balance we only included the metals deposited on the bed sediment in the particulate form because these are the metals that are analysed when analysing heavy metals in sediment core sub samples furthermore the mass of dissolved metals in the pore water of settled sediments at the sediment water interface were found to be negligible when it was included in the mass balance figure a3 in the supplementary material the two main inputs for metals into willsmere billabong included in the mass balance are stormwater msw and atmospheric deposition ma although flooding of willsmere billabong by the main river channel mf is also a source of metals into willsmere billabong it was not included in the mass balance because flood events did not occur during the 12 month

rainfall during the month calculated using daily rainfall data collected approximately 6 km away from the lake melbourne regional office site australian bureau of meteorology and eia directly

drain using topographic and stormwater drainage network maps and 2 measure the areas of directly connected impervious surfaces roofs footpaths roads and driveways for the stormwater catchment using satellite photographs 50 90 40 and 0 of roofs roads driveways and footpaths were assumed to be directly connected respectively moglia et al 2014 roy and shuster 2009 the average and standard deviation of the five estimates of eia were used to develop a normal distribution random sampling from this distribution was used to estimate the eia the aim of this was to take into account measurement errors by the five individuals the metal mass delivered to the lake via stormwater each month was divided by the average wetland surface area aw surface areas of the lake were estimated from interpolation of

sediments reflect metal inputs the mass balance model was run 100 000 times to allow parameters to be varied stochastically the uncertainty u metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs is quantified as the percentage difference in the central tendency medians and the spread central range between 1 the modelled total metal input masses across the 100 000 iterations and 2 the observed 12 month accumulation of particulate metal masses in the sediment traps uncertainty due to post depositional changes u post depositional changes we identified the main sedimentary units within cores taken from willsmere billabong in 2001 core w2001 and 2012 core w4 using core images optical and radiographic and magnetic susceptibility profiles as for when uncertainties due to spatial variability were investigated w4 and w2001 are taken from the same location in willsmere billabong 10 years apart and as such minimal spatial variability between the two cores was assumed we calculated the percentage difference in the central tendency the median of the heavy metal concentration profiles and the spread central range in the heavy metal concentration profiles between w4 and w2001 within each sedimentary unit the overall uncertainty for the whole core was calculated as the average of the percentage differences calculated for each of the four sedimentary units 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantifying the uncertainties a framework that summarizes the uncertainties inherent in reconstructing historical heavy metal pollution trends using sediment cores is provided in table 1 units a to d in table 1 refer to lithological units common to cores w1 1 w4 w3 1 and w2001 sediment cores taken from locations 1 to 3 respectively in willsmere billabong and in 2001 fig 2b these sedimentary units that are similar across the three cores both according to colour texture and magnetic susceptibility profiles fig 4 are assumed to have been deposited in the same time period by comparable processes appendix c in the supplementary materials provides a detailed discussion on spatial variability in these stratigraphic units in willsmere billabong substantial uncertainties exist for reconstructed historical heavy metal records particularly due to i uncertainties in the sediment chronology and ii in the assumption that the settled heavy metal mass is equivalent to the heavy metal mass entering the aquatic system it is important to take note of the fact that the magnitude the primary origin of uncertainty differs between metals for as and zn the greatest uncertainty appears to be associated with the chronology for the remaining metals cr cu ni and pb the greatest uncertainty is the assumption that metal inputs into the lake are adequately represented by the accumulation of metals in bed sediments in the sub sections below we briefly discuss each source of uncertainty 3 1 1 uncertainties in the metal analysis method the results of duplicate and spiked samples analyses in the quality control procedures of the icp ms analysis table 1 indicates relatively low levels of uncertainty in the metal analysis 0 9 difference between duplicates and 81 90 recovery rates of spiked samples it is important to note however that these uncertainty measures were calculated using icp ms analytical techniques we recommend further work to identify uncertainty measures for additional analytical techniques such as xrf and micro xrf core scanning 3 1 2 uncertainties due to spatial variability table 1 indicates that there is spatial variability in heavy metal accumulation in aquatic environments even between locations only 30 m apart in terms of the whole core zn pb and cu experience the largest uncertainties of 58 40 and 36 table 1 3 1 3 uncertainties due to sub sampling intervals expected errors for as cr cu ni pb and zn with sub sampling intervals of 5 10 and 15 cm vary according to the level of variability present in the high resolution i e high precision heavy metal profile table 1 where the heavy metal concentrations exhibit low variability there is generally less error in the coarser resolution profiles fig 5 for example uncertainties are greater for zn compared to cr despite the magnitude in the uncertainties the spearman rank correlation coefficients indicated strong correlations œÅ 0 5 for all metals between the measured 1 cm resolution heavy metal profiles and the coarser resolution profiles table 1 as such it appears that overall heavy metal trend is not greatly affected by the sub sampling interval 3 1 4 uncertainties in the sediment chronology the heavy metal profiles vary considerably due to uncertainties in the sediment chronologies particularly for heavy metals that have large variability in sediment heavy metal concentrations over time for example zn which has increasing concentrations over time exhibits the largest 95 confidence interval in heavy metal concentrations from 50 mg kg to 540 mg kg in 1959 fig 5 with the large variability in heavy metal concentrations the largest uncertainty thus far we recommend that future studies account for the uncertainties associated with the sediment chronology however it is important to note that regardless of the large spread in heavy metals identified in each year s sediment deposit the overall trend in heavy metal concentrations e g increasing or constant with time is generally represented in the heavy metal profiles 3 1 5 uncertainties in the assumption that metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs most metals as cr pb zn have statistically significant differences between the distributions of modelled metal inputs into the lake and the mass of metals settling on the sediment bed table 1 this may indicate that there are high uncertainties in the assumption that metal inputs into aquatic systems are entrained in the bed sediment and subsequently buried in particular this may be suggesting that some metal inputs are dissolving upon deposition on the bed sediment surface either due to redox conditions ph levels or due to organic matter decomposition this is unlikely to be the case for pb and zn because the modelled total particulate and dissolved fractions input of pb and zn into the lake was less than the actual mass of settled sediments fig 6 as such for pb and zn and possibly for as and cr also this difference may be due to the errors in the analytical approach that we have adopted for this study this difference may be due to i the simplified conceptualisation of the mass balance of metals in willsmere billabong i e simplification in the mass balance model in section 2 2 4 and figure a1 in the supplementary materials or ii limitations in the collection of field data discussed in section 3 2 regardless of the discrepancies between modelled inputs of metals and the settled masses of metals the trends in the mass of particulate metals deposited on the lake bed generally correlates positively to the trends in the modelled mass of metals entering the system by atmospheric deposition and stormwater each month fig 6 there is a strong and statistically significant correlation for pb œÅ 0 71 p 0 05 figure a13 supplementary materials this suggests that a large fraction of the settlement of these metals on the sediment bed is governed by stormwater and atmospheric deposition inputs it appears that the trends in heavy metal profiles from willsmere billabong might be reflecting the metal fluxes from stormwater and atmospheric deposition there are however some limitations in the calculated values this is partly due to simplifications in the mass balance model one source of heavy metals and sediments that has not been quantified in the mass balance model is the transport of soils and sediments by overland runoff into the lake i e runoff that does not enter the lake through the stormwater drain this may be an important sediment source particularly given that during the 12 month field monitoring period several construction projects e g playground construction installation of underground irrigation systems were observed within the local willsmere billabong catchment these construction activities would have inevitably resulted in the mobilization of local catchment soils and sediments which could be carried into the lake by local overland runoff e g langbein and schumm 1958 wolman and schick 1967 another simplification in the mass balance model is that we have also not considered the effects of sediment focussing and resuspension from the lake bed in the mass balance sediments already deposited on the lake bed can be re suspended by wind and the activity of benthic aquatic species carper and bachmann 1984 gulati et al 2008 indeed verschuren 1999 has previously identified that re suspension of sediments can affect the accumulation of sediments and climate proxies in lake cores sediments re suspended from other regions of the sediment bed and therefore not included in stormwater or atmospheric sediment inputs may have settled in the sediment traps these sediment traps were designed so that sediments would not be resuspended from the traps bloesch and burns 1980 given the short fetch of willsmere billabong 140 m for the first 6 months of sampling and 60 m for the last 6 months of sampling it is unlikely that wind action would have contributed to significant amounts of sediment resuspension carper and bachmann 1984 however the presence of wildlife in the lake may have contributed to sediment re suspension leahy 2007 there were also some limitations in the collection of field data which may introduce errors in the values calculated for u metals in bed sediments reflect metal inputs firstly the mass of deposited metals measured by the sediment trap may be an overestimation of the mass of metals settling onto the sediment bed surface in the absence of a sediment trap this can occur due to the fact that the presence of the sediment trap may interfere with the wind driven mixing in the water column leading to the greater settlement of particles into sediment traps brown et al 2000 in addition some simplifications were made when analysing the dust deposition gauge data it is possible that the dust deposition gauge may have overflowed in some months leading to the loss of heavy metals and underestimation of metal inputs this may account for the high temporal variability in atmospheric dust and metal deposition however measured values are likely reasonable as the mass of particulates entering the lake by atmospheric deposition 56 g m2 year is similar to total particle atmospheric deposition masses calculated for medium traffic density regions in sydney australia davis and birch 2011 indeed willsmere billabong is situated 300 m from a busy freeway estimated traffic load of 130 000 vehicles per day parris et al 2009 furthermore not all stormwater flow events were captured in the sampling and instead stormwater heavy metal concentrations and loads were modelled the peak stormwater tss and metal inputs may have been underestimated stormwater suspended solids concentrations had a mean of 7 5 mg l and a standard deviation of 2 7 mg l whilst this is less than typical tss concentrations in stormwater of 150 mg l duncan 1999 this difference may be due to the presence of a stormwater treatment wetland although the performance of the wetland that treats the stormwater draining into willsmere billabong has not been measured stormwater treatment wetlands can have tss removal efficiencies of up to 95 carleton et al 2001 3 1 6 uncertainties due to post depositional mobilization in buried sediments the kruskal wallis test indicates that whilst the heavy metal profiles from the two sediment cores are similar there are statistically significant differences observed for several heavy metals in some of the units table 1 these differences are within the range of differences resulting from spatial variability in the heavy metal profiles table 1 the percentage difference in medians of metal concentrations within unit a were 3 and 12 for cr and pb respectively and these are in a similar range as the absolute percentage difference in medians that are due to spatial variability 2 for cr and 9 for pb table 1 this suggests that the percentage differences between w4 and w2001 heavy metal concentrations may not be a result of post depositional mobility this discrepancy instead may be due to spatial variability because although w4 and w2001 were both taken from the same point in willsmere billabong location 2 in fig 2b they are likely to have been taken several centimetres apart from each other indeed visual inspection of the high resolution metal profiles of w2001 and w4 suggests that the metal trends of the two cores are quite similar figure a14 in the supplementary material this also suggests that there were negligible changes to the heavy metal profiles over the 13 years that the core was in storage 3 2 general discussion we recommend that future studies that intend to use sediment cores to reconstruct historical trends in heavy metal levels in aquatic systems use this framework to investigate the magnitude of uncertainty associated with the reconstructed record of historical heavy metal contamination in the aquatic system in addition the findings from this study about the main sources of uncertainty of different metals could be used to better plan sampling and analytical methods in future studies in particular it appears that the more variable the heavy metal levels in a sediment core the greater level of uncertainty can arise as such for sediment cores where large fluctuations in heavy metal levels are expected finer resolution of sub sampling interval should be adopted however there are limitations associated with the presented uncertainty framework which should be addressed in future studies firstly the uncertainty values provided in table 1 are specific to a relatively small and shallow urban floodplain lake in south east australia the magnitudes of uncertainty calculated for the historical heavy metal records for this lake may differ to those of other lakes globally it is likely that lake properties such as the lake size bathymetry hydrology catchment characteristics and physico chemical properties of the water column would impact the magnitude and effect of each of the uncertainties discussed above as such uncertainty values should be calculated for other aquatic systems with varying characteristics e g climatic conditions ecologies catchment characteristics and physico chemical properties of both the water column and bed sediments in addition it is expected that different systems e g marine and oceanic will have different sediment and heavy metal accumulation rates therefore further work that studies the differences in sub sampling effect in marine and other lake sediment cores would be of great benefit further work should be conducted to identify if homogenised sediments over 5 10 or 15 cm intervals would yield similar levels of uncertainty the methods and framework discussed here could be applied to several of these other systems to identify these underlying processes we acknowledge however that the method of quantifying each of the uncertainties in the framework utilised in this study may not be applicable to all sites specifically sites that are not small urbanised lakes like willsmere billabong in which case the methodology should be adapted to suit the specific site secondly further work is required to develop more understanding of the uncertainties in reconstructed heavy metal records due to the uncertainties in metal analysis methods section 3 1 we calculated uncertainties associated with only one technique icp ms and conducted at one particular laboratory we recommend the identification of uncertainty magnitudes for other techniques such as xrf micro xrf core scanning or icp aes and for a range of different instruments finally there may be some errors associated with the uncertainty values calculated for the uncertainties in reconstructed heavy metal records due to the assumption that bed sediment heavy metal concentrations reflect metal inputs into the lake section 3 1 5 there were limitations in both the data collection and simplifications in the conceptualisations of the mass balance model as detailed above in section 3 1 4 conclusions through this investigation we have demonstrated the importance of quantifying the uncertainties underlying the use of sediment cores to reconstruct historical trends in metal pollution in a small aquatic system we recommend that future studies use the proposed uncertainty framework and methods to quantify and assess the magnitude of uncertainty associated with historical heavy metal water quality trends developed using sediment cores from aquatic systems this is because the uncertainties quantified in this study are relevant to willsmere billabong further work is needed to identify the chemo dynamic processes occurring in these aquatic environments to better understand the way in which these uncertainties will vary across different sites in addition future work should aim to refine the estimates of uncertainty determined in this study for example it would be of great benefit to conduct a longer term field monitoring study over a period of 5 to 10 years to develop a more thorough understanding of the representativeness of the sediment core data of metal inputs into the lake employing real time monitoring of metal

7362,in a groundwater flow system the age of groundwater should gradually increase from the recharge zone to the discharge zone within the same streamline however it is occasionally observed that the groundwater age becomes younger in the discharge zone in the piedmont alluvial plain and the oldest age often appears in the middle of the plain a new set of groundwater chemistry and isotopes was employed to reassess the groundwater 14c ages from the discharge zone in the north china plain ncp carbonate precipitation organic matter oxidation and cross flow mixing in the groundwater from the recharge zone to the discharge zone are recognized according to the corresponding changes of hco3 or dic and Œ¥13c in the same streamline of the third aquifer of the ncp the effects of carbonate precipitation and organic matter oxidation are calibrated with a 13c mixing model and dic correction but these corrected 14c ages seem unreasonable because they grow younger from the middle plain to the discharge zone in the ncp the relationship of cl content and the recharge distance is used to estimate the expected cl content in the discharge zone and ln a14c cl is proposed to correct the a14c in groundwater for the effect of cross flow mixing the 14c ages were reassessed with the corrected a14c due to the cross flow mixing varying from 1 25 to 30 58 ka and the groundwater becomes older gradually from the recharge zone to the discharge zone the results suggest that the reassessed 14c ages are more reasonable for the groundwater from the discharge zone due to cross flow mixing keywords 14c age reassessment a14c cross flow mixing the discharge zone north china plain 1 introduction radiocarbon 14c is the most widely used dating technique in the study of regional aquifers partially because of its range of groundwater dating from 102 to 3 4 104 yrs and partially due to the common and widespread presence of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in groundwater during recharge andrews and lee 1979 desaulniers et al 1981 geyh and k√ºnzl 1981 karlsson and wikberg 1987 buckau et al 2000 iwatsuki et al 2001 edmunds 2009 cartwright et al 2010 the 14c activity a14c of dic obeys the law of radioactive decay and records the residence time since the groundwater recharge the reliability of 14c groundwater dating is certainly related to the changes of a14c and dic in the processes of groundwater flow dic is associated not only with dissolved atmospheric co2 but also with calcite dissolution gonfiantini and zuppi 2003 so4 2 reduction baijjali et al 1997 clark and fritz 1997 methanogenesis geyh and k√ºnzl 1981 aravena et al 1995 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 and other redox reactions involving organic matter oxidation along groundwater flow in unsaturated and saturated zones carmi et al 2009 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 gillon et al 2009 thus many studies focus on the influence of geochemical reactions to a14c of dic in unsaturated and saturated zones trying to calibrate the initial a14c and dic fontes and garnier 1979 kroitoru et al 1989 hori et al 2008 carmi et al 2009 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 dorsett et al 2011 there are four common correction models for 14c dating groundwater clark and fritz 1997 1 the simplest correction scheme is a statistical approach vogel 1967 where the initial a14c a0 is estimated from measured values in young samples 2 in the approach of the chemical mass balance cmb model clark and fritz 1997 an initial recharge water composition with dic formed under open system conditions is calculated and further carbonate dissolution under closed conditions is assumed in order to match the observed water chemistry 3 the Œ¥13c mixing model relies on a 13c mass balance rather than the carbonate stoichiometry as a basis for 14c dilution correction pearson and hanshaw 1970 4 the fontes and garnier model rely strongly on the measured Œ¥13c values and this model also considers the chemical mass balance fontes and garnier 1979 the selection of the appropriate correction model depends on the hydrogeochemical conditions of the study area a graphical method was proposed to evaluate the predominant geochemical processes occurring in groundwater systems for radiocarbon dating han et al 2012 han and plummer 2013 and the plotted 14c vs Œ¥13c relationship was regarded as a useful tool for groundwater age and geochemical interpretations han et al 2014 han and plummer 2016 summarized that successful application depends on scrutiny of the isotopic 14c and 13c and chemical data to conceptualize the reactions and processes that affect the 14c content of dic in aquifers however in many cases 14c age is the mixed age of groundwater because the cross flows change the 14c content of dic in groundwater it is hard to determine the ages of groundwater before the mix of flow according to 14c content of dic in aquifers and there are few discussions of this hydrogeological problem for the same groundwater flow system the age of groundwater should gradually increase from the recharge zone to the discharge zone in the same streamline the groundwater age is getting older until it reaches the maximum in the discharge zone therefore the groundwater age in the discharge zone should be the oldest however it is occasionally observed that the groundwater age becomes younger in the discharge zone in the piedmont alluvial plain in the distribution of groundwater age the oldest age often appears in the middle of the plain not in the discharge zone there are two possibilities one possibility is that the groundwater in the middle has mixed with the young groundwater of lateral runoff the other is that the groundwater in the middle has mixed with the young groundwater of cross flow in the vertical discharge process this paper focuses on the effects of cross flow mixing on the age of groundwater and the reassessment of its true age the north china plain ncp is the largest alluvial plain in eastern asia and has a dense population and a semi arid climate the intensive exploitation of groundwater for increased irrigation resulted in a regional decline of groundwater tables since the 1960s foster et al 2004 kendy et al 2004 chen et al 2005 groundwater geochemistry and isotopes have been employed to study the water balance and recharge mechanisms in the ncp kendy et al 2004 chen et al 2005 von rohden et al 2010 xing et al 2013 for the deep confined groundwater in the ncp a record of temperature and monsoon intensity was recognized by comparison of the stable isotope thermometer and noble gas temperatures from the same deep confined aquifer kendy et al 2004 wang et al 2015 and the radiocarbon determined the oldest ages to be less than 40 ka chen et al 2003 2005 kendy et al 2004 according to the distribution of groundwater 14c ages in the ncp the middles of the plains are the oldest and the recharge zone and the discharge zone are relatively young here we present a new set of groundwater chemistry and isotopes to reassess the groundwater 14c ages from the discharge zone in the ncp 2 hydrogeologic setting the ncp located in north central china to the west of the bohai sea and to the east of the taihang mountains fig 1 a is a relatively stable and piedmont sedimentary plain wu et al 1996 xu et al 1996 the altitude of the ncp decreases from west and southwest to east most parts of the ncp have relatively flat topography with elevations of approximately 20 m above mean sea level m s l a very small part near the west boundary of the ncp is the mountain front recharge zone and has elevations of approximately 100 m above m s l the ncp has a mid latitude continental semi arid monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 10 14 c with the maximum temperature of 45 8 c and the minimum temperature of 28 2 c although the average annual precipitation is 500 600 mm more than 60 of the precipitation is concentrated during june to august the average annual evaporation is from 1100 to 1800 mm the bedrock is composed of archaeozoic gneiss and proterozoic carbonate tertiary and quaternary deposits that are 300 500 m thick have accumulated from the west to the east in the ncp the sediments are dominated by fluvial deposits in the piedmont plain alluvial and lacustrine deposits in the central plain and alluvial deposits with interbedded marine deposits in the littoral plain liu 1987 hong 1990 four main aquifers from top to bottom are distributed in the ncp fig 1b the first aquifer shallow and semi confined groundwater is the top aquifer with a depth of less than 50 m and represents the strata of the holocene q2 and late pleistocene the sediment grain sizes change from gravel at the piedmont to fine sand at the coastal plain the groundwater is fresh in the piedmont plain but saline water occurs in the central and littoral plain tds 2 g l the second aquifer shallow confined groundwater represents the quzhuang q1 3 o stratum of the late pleistocene and is composed of gravel medium and fine sands the burial depth of the second aquifer varies from 60 m to 170 m as in the first aquifer groundwater is saline with tds 2 g l from the central to the littoral plain the third aquifer deep confined groundwater represents the yangliuqing q1 2 y stratum of the middle pleistocene and is composed of coarse medium and fine sands the burial depth of the third aquifer varies from 170 m to 350 m groundwater is successively of hco3 na ca cl hco3 na and cl na types with tds of 300 500 mg l chen et al 2003 xing et al 2013 the fourth aquifer deep confined groundwater represents the gu an q1 1 g stratum of the early pleistocene and covers the local bedrock of the ncp the thickness of the fourth aquifer varies from 50 m to 60 m and its burial depth is generally more than 350 m the tds of water is approximately 500 1500 mg l and 1500 2000 mg l in the central and littoral plains respectively quartz k feldspar and hornblende are the dominant minerals in the deep aquifers calcite is commonly present at approximately 5 14 illite kaolinite and montmorillonite may also be observed in the central and littoral plain chen et al 2003 the main exploitation layer of deep groundwater in the ncp is the third aquifer and the groundwater flow regime has changed over time because of long term uncontrolled excessive pumping the water table in the third aquifer has continued to decline since 1959 the direction of the deep groundwater flow in the coastal areas reversed after the 1990s with its new direction from the eastern bohai sea to the western cangzhou groundwater depression chen et al 2010 two great groundwater depressions occur in one main flow pathway of deep groundwater from baoding to huanghua and are shown in fig 1 as rgd renqiu groundwater depression and cgd cangzhou groundwater depression from 1959 to 2015 the maximum drawdown of groundwater table was approximately 55 m and 90 m in the center of the rgd and cgd respectively 3 sampling and analysis methods the main profile from baoding to cangzhou in the ncp is selected to sample deep groundwater in the third aquifer it is consistent with the main flowing direction of deep groundwater and crosses two groundwater depressions the rgd and the cgd the groundwater has high salinity and is undrinkable in the first and second aquifers of the ncp but is fresh and drinkable in the third and fourth aquifers groundwater supply wells in the ncp are almost all drilled into the third aquifer the sections of the first and second aquifers in wells are sealed to prevent salty water from entering into the wells to ensure that the sampling occurred from the same aquifer and avoided cross flow mixing groundwater samples were collected from deep drinking wells furthermore the depth and pumping history of each sampling well was carefully documented to ensure that all groundwater samples were derived from the third aquifer of the ncp the sampling locations and depths are shown in fig 1 and table 1 the temperatures tds and ph values of water samples were measured in situ with a 5 star multi parameter water quality analyzer 520m 01 model the concentrations of unstable hco3 co3 2 and dissolved molecular co2 were measured in situ by titration with precision of 1 mg l the concentrations of anions and cations were measured on a dx 120 ion chromatograph and an iris intrepid ii type icp aes respectively the precision of anion and cation based on replicate analyses is 2 samples for 14c analysis were taken by precipitating baco3 by addition of excess bacl2 to 150 l water previously brought to ph up to 12 by addition of naoh the 14c was determined radiometrically by liquid scintillation counting after conversion to benzene with the analytical error less than 0 5 pmc Œ¥d Œ¥18o Œ¥13c were measured on a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat253 the values of Œ¥d and Œ¥18o were expressed relative to the smow and the precision was 0 2 the Œ¥13c values were expressed relative to the pdb and the precision was 0 2 all of the analytical work was done in the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geosciences wuhan the results of groundwater chemistry are listed in table 1 and the results of Œ¥d Œ¥18o Œ¥13c a14c and corresponding 14c ages are listed in table 2 4 results 4 1 groundwater chemistry the temperatures of groundwater samples were between 18 and 23 c which is higher than the local annual average temperature all groundwater samples were alkaline because the ph was between 7 5 and 8 97 tds in the groundwater samples changed greatly and gradually increased from the recharge zone to the discharge zone the recharge zone was between 271 37 mg l and 1236 52 mg l according to the piper diagram of groundwater samples fig 2 the types of groundwater chemistry in the recharge and discharge zones are significantly different in the recharge zone the major cation and anion are ca2 and hco3 respectively in the discharge zone the major cation and anion have changed to na and cl respectively the water chemistry type changes from hco3 ca mg to so4 cl na and hco3 so4 na ca and so4 cl na ca occurs in the middle of the plain of groundwater runoff for the major cation na and tds show a good linear relationship but the linear relationship between k ca2 mg2 and tds are not obvious fig 3 a d for the major anion cl and tds have a good linear relationship and so4 2 also has a significant linear relationship with tds but hco3 and dic decrease first and then increase with the increase in tds fig 3e h this means that the increase in salinity in groundwater is closely related to the dissolution of salt and sulfate several chemical processes have been identified as being important in controlling the major ion chemistry of deep groundwater in the ncp zhang et al 2000 these processes include the following ion exchange of na on the solids for ca2 and mg2 in solution dissolution of carbonate minerals and gypsum in response to cation exchange and mixing of saline water from the overlying aquifer through leakage the groundwater is supersaturated with respect to calcite in all the groundwater samples as all of the sicalcite saturation index of calcite calculated with phreeqc and listed in table 1 values are greater than zero but is unsaturated with respect to gypsum as the sigypsum values are less than zero the carbonate undergoes a dynamic process of dissolution and precipitation equilibrium while the sulfate is in a dissolved state the increase of na concentration in parallel with cl concentration relates to the mixing of different water types or dissolution of evaporites within the aquifers although an increase in this ratio relates to exchange reactions or to mineral dissolution edmunds and smedley 2000 the mixing process mostly occurred in the littoral area or discharge area because of the large depression cones caused by groundwater overexploitation this finding has been confirmed by several studies zhang et al 2000 indicating that approximately 10 20 saline water is mixed with fresh water in the littoral area or discharge area 4 2 h o c isotopes the Œ¥d values of groundwater samples range from 96 47 to 71 77 average 79 49 whereas the Œ¥18o values range from 11 68 to 8 65 average 10 44 the global meteoric water line gmwl Œ¥d 8Œ¥18o 10 craig 1961 the local meteoric water line lmwl Œ¥d 7 02341Œ¥18o 1 72339 r 2 0 95 zhang et al 2000 and the yong ding river water line ydrwl Œ¥d 5 8Œ¥18o 14 9 xing et al 2013 are used to determine the origin of groundwater in the plot of Œ¥d and Œ¥18o fig 4 the groundwater samples from the recharge zone are close to lmwl indicating that they are mainly derived from the local meteoric water however the other groundwater samples are enriched in 18o and are located to the right of lmwl indicating that the recharge meteoric waters have experienced different degree of evaporation however chen et al 2003 and kreuzer et al 2009 suggested that pleistocene groundwater samples presumably recharged during the last glacial period had a range from 9 4 to 11 7 for Œ¥18o and 76 to 85 for Œ¥d in the ncp recharge of these waters was thought to have occurred at the end of the pleistocene when it would hardly be affected by evaporation therefore the hydrogen and oxygen isotope signatures in deep groundwater may reflect the groundwater recharged from precipitation in glacial or interglacial periods the Œ¥13c values of groundwater samples change greatly from 10 51 to 5 85 with an average of 8 22 according to the relationship of hco3 and Œ¥13c fig 5 some groundwater samples are mainly associated with the oxidation of organic matter and the others are apparently related to calcite dissolution cation exchange and methanogenesis blavoux and olive 1981 abid et al 2012 gillon et al 2009 thus the 13c values indicate the characteristics of multiple sources of carbon in groundwater samples the radiocarbon activities a14c vary from 52 9 to 3 8 pmc in the groundwater samples from the third aquifer of the ncp there is no significant relationship between Œ¥13c and a14c which further demonstrates that there are other sources of carbon mixed in groundwater besides the dissolved atmospheric co2 fig 6 furthermore these additional carbon sources may be of dead carbon han et al 2014 5 discussion 5 1 14c age correction for carbonate precipitation for moderate climates as in the ncp plants that follow the c3 photosynthetic cycle predominate with an average Œ¥13c value of 27 anid et al 1993 tobias et al 1993 co2 from soils with c3 vegetation has an average Œ¥13c value of 23 as a result of co2 degassing following the decomposition of organic matter from c3 plants deines et al 1974 cerling et al 1991 along with the dissolution of soil co2 a small fractionation occurs leading to a Œ¥13c value of 24 for co2 aq clark and fritz 1997 szaran 1998 on the other hand the Œ¥13c value of calcite is generally considered to be 0 the Œ¥13c values of dic of groundwater samples from the third aquifer of the ncp change from 10 51 to 5 85 with the average of 8 22 therefore it is estimated that about one third of the carbon in the deep aquifer of the ncp is from co2 in the vadose zone for the oxidation of organic matter of course calcite dissolution cation exchange and methanogenesis cannot be excluded according to the relationship between hco3 and Œ¥13c fig 5 and the isotopic fractionation between 13c and 14c should also be considered during the 14c dating process reardon and fritz 1978 for the ncp values of soil gas Œ¥13c between 17 and 21 have been used before and the mean value of this range 19 was adopted which produces reasonable results for the young samples whereas a more negative value e g 25 as is often assumed in temperate regions would clearly overcorrect the young samples and lead to a large bias of the fontes and garnier model toward young ages compared to the other models the Œ¥13c of the carbonate endmember was taken to be 1 5 chen et al 2003 kreuzer et al 2009 since there are only slight differences in hco3 concentration and Œ¥13c values between saline water and fresh water zhang et al 2000 the influence of dic by mixing in the recharge zone is neglected however the contribution of 14c from modern saline waters should be taken into account because those waters have 14c activity of approximately 60 40 pmc the initial a14c value of 60 pmc was selected to calculate 14c age in the ncp chen et al 2003 kreuzer et al 2009 from the recharge zone to the middle of the ncp both hco3 and dic are gradually decreasing in the direction of groundwater flow fig 7 a and b while the Œ¥13c is gradually increasing fig 7c the decrease of hco3 and dic along the groundwater flow path is highly associated with carbonate precipitation craig 1954 which will lead to 13c enrichment in groundwater because of carbon isotope fractionation mook et al 1974 carbonate precipitation occurs in the third aquifer of ncp as the sicalcite values of all of the groundwater samples are greater than zero chen et al 2003 suggested that the 13c mixing model ages were likely to be the most representative for the deep groundwater 14c dating in the ncp therefore 14c ages need to be corrected with Œ¥13c because of carbonate precipitation emrich et al 1970 the corrected 14c ages for carbonate precipitation calculated with 13c mixing model marked as 14c age cp in table 2 vary from 1 25 to 22 52 ka 5 2 14c age correction for organic matter oxidation in fig 5 organic matter oxidation probably predominates in the change of hco3 and Œ¥13c in some of groundwater samples from the third aquifer of the ncp from the middle of the ncp to the discharge zone both hco3 and dic are gradually increasing in the direction of groundwater flow fig 7a and b while the Œ¥13c is gradually decreasing fig 7c the increase of hco3 and dic along the groundwater flow path is highly associated with the additional co2 mixing the additional co2 is most likely derived from the organic matter oxidation because the third aquifer in the middle plain and the littoral plain are marine sediments that are rich in organic matter liu 1987 hong 1990 the organic matter contains fossil carbon which is dead carbon due to the addition of dead carbon from the organic matter oxidation the 14c abundances of groundwater samples need to be reevaluated dic is used to correct the a14c in the groundwater for the addition of dead carbon from the organic matter oxidation boaretto et al 1998 the groundwater samples from the middle of the ncp have the lower dic content and the higher Œ¥13c m10 m11 m12 in table 1 and their average 243 1 mg l can be used as the initial value of the dic content before the addition of dead carbon from the organic matter oxidation 1 corrected a 14 c measured a 14 c 243 1 measured dic the corrected a14c for organic matter oxidation is consistently less than the measured a14c for the groundwater samples from the middle of the ncp to the discharge zone fig 8 then the corrected 14c ages for organic matter oxidation calculated with 13c mixing model marked as 14c age omo in table 2 varies from 1 25 to 25 39 ka 5 3 14c age correction for cross flow mixing near the discharge zone both hco3 and dic again start decreasing in the direction of groundwater flow fig 7a and b while the Œ¥13c again starts increasing fig 7c the influences of carbonate precipitation and organic matter oxidation cannot be excluded for the groundwater samples from the discharge zone but it is still hard to explain the changes of dic and Œ¥13c blaser et al 2010 cartwright 2010 tds cl and na have a significant linear relationship with the recharge distance for all the groundwater samples collected from the third aquifer of the ncp fig 9 this relationship indicates that soluble minerals such as salt have gradually dissolved into the groundwater along the flow path clark et al 1997 the contribution of sulfate dissolution to the increase of tds cannot be ignored in the groundwater and cation exchange can increase the na content in groundwater in addition to the contribution of nacl dissolution edmunds et al 2006 then the relationship between cl content and the groundwater flow distance become the reliable clue with which to recognize the cross flow mixing in the deep confined aquifer of the ncp in fig 10 cl content and the groundwater flow distance show a good linear relationship except for the four samples from the discharge zone the expected cl contents of the four samples from the discharge zone can be calculated 2 expected cl content 0 8001 recharge distance 3 0662 the four samples from the discharge zone m19 m20 m21 m22 have higher cl content than the other samples from the recharge zone and the middle of the ncp they are also much higher than the expected cl contents calculated with the recharge distance according to the linear relationship by eq 2 therefore the four samples from the discharge zone are likely to be affected by the cross flow mixing then the relationship between cl content and the groundwater flow distance is used to correct the a14c in the four samples from the discharge zone ln a14c cl and the groundwater flow distance of the groundwater samples from the recharge zone and the middle of the ncp have a good curve relationship fig 11 3 ln a 14 c cl 0 229 e 0 023 recharge distance then a14c of the four samples from the discharge zone are corrected with the expected cl contents according to the curve relationship for the cross flow mixing by eq 3 the corrected a14c for cross flow mixing are consistently less than the measured a14c and are also less than the corrected a14c for organic matter oxidation fig 12 for the four groundwater samples in the discharge zone from the third aquifer of the ncp the corrected a14c for cross flow mixing show a reasonable gradual reduction the corrected 14c ages for the cross flow mixing calculated with 13c mixing model marked as 14c age cfm in table 2 vary from 1 25 to 30 58 ka in a streamline of the same aquifer the groundwater age should gradually increase and reach the maximum in the discharge zone pearson and white 1967 this means that the groundwater 14c age is getting older with the flow distance both the corrected 14c ages for carbonate precipitation 14c age cp and the corrected 14c ages for organic matter oxidation 14c age omo of groundwater samples become younger with the recharge distance in the middle of the ncp while the corrected 14c ages for the cross flow mixing 14c age cfm of groundwater samples become older with the recharge distance from the recharge zone to the discharge zone fig 13 this finding indicates that the corrected 14c ages for the cross flow mixing 14c age cfm of groundwater samples are more reasonable to estimate the groundwater resident time in the third aquifer of the ncp then it is significant to reassess the 14c age of the groundwater from the discharge zone due to cross flow mixing 6 conclusions 14c ages calibrated with the 13c mixing model were regarded as the most reasonable estimation of residence time for the deep groundwater in the confined aquifer of the ncp chen et al 2003 kreuzer et al 2009 from the corresponding changes of hco3 or dic and Œ¥13c in the same streamline of the third aquifer of the ncp we recognize the effects of carbonate precipitation organic matter oxidation and cross flow mixing in the groundwater from the recharge zone to the discharge zone the 13c mixing model and dic correction can resolve the effects of carbonate precipitation and organic matter oxidation respectively for 14c age calibration the relationship of cl content and the recharge distance can be used to estimate the expected cl content in the discharge zone and ln a14c cl is proposed to correct the a14c in groundwater for the effect of cross flow mixing 14c ages corrected for carbonate precipitation and organic matter oxidation grew younger from the middle plain to the discharge zone which is unreasonable given the groundwater flow time in the same streamline of the same aquifer the 14c ages of groundwater from the discharge zone are reassessed due to the cross flow mixing which grow older with the distance from the recharge zone to the discharge zone the distribution of corrected 14c ages is more reasonable demonstrating the significance of 14c age reassessment for the groundwater from the discharge zone due to cross flow mixing

7362,in a groundwater flow system the age of groundwater should gradually increase from the recharge zone to the discharge zone within the same streamline however it is occasionally observed that the groundwater age becomes younger in the discharge zone in the piedmont alluvial plain and the oldest age often appears in the middle of the plain a new set of groundwater chemistry and isotopes was employed to reassess the groundwater 14c ages from the discharge zone in the north china plain ncp carbonate precipitation organic matter oxidation and cross flow mixing in the groundwater from the recharge zone to the discharge zone are recognized according to the corresponding changes of hco3 or dic and Œ¥13c in the same streamline of the third aquifer of the ncp the effects of carbonate precipitation and organic matter oxidation are calibrated with a 13c mixing model and dic correction but these corrected 14c ages seem unreasonable because they grow younger from the middle plain to the discharge zone in the ncp the relationship of cl content and the recharge distance is used to estimate the expected cl content in the discharge zone and ln a14c cl is proposed to correct the a14c in groundwater for the effect of cross flow mixing the 14c ages were reassessed with the corrected a14c due to the cross flow mixing varying from 1 25 to 30 58 ka and the groundwater becomes older gradually from the recharge zone to the discharge zone the results suggest that the reassessed 14c ages are more reasonable for the groundwater from the discharge zone due to cross flow mixing keywords 14c age reassessment a14c cross flow mixing the discharge zone north china plain 1 introduction radiocarbon 14c is the most widely used dating technique in the study of regional aquifers partially because of its range of groundwater dating from 102 to 3 4 104 yrs and partially due to the common and widespread presence of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in groundwater during recharge andrews and lee 1979 desaulniers et al 1981 geyh and k√ºnzl 1981 karlsson and wikberg 1987 buckau et al 2000 iwatsuki et al 2001 edmunds 2009 cartwright et al 2010 the 14c activity a14c of dic obeys the law of radioactive decay and records the residence time since the groundwater recharge the reliability of 14c groundwater dating is certainly related to the changes of a14c and dic in the processes of groundwater flow dic is associated not only with dissolved atmospheric co2 but also with calcite dissolution gonfiantini and zuppi 2003 so4 2 reduction baijjali et al 1997 clark and fritz 1997 methanogenesis geyh and k√ºnzl 1981 aravena et al 1995 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 and other redox reactions involving organic matter oxidation along groundwater flow in unsaturated and saturated zones carmi et al 2009 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 gillon et al 2009 thus many studies focus on the influence of geochemical reactions to a14c of dic in unsaturated and saturated zones trying to calibrate the initial a14c and dic fontes and garnier 1979 kroitoru et al 1989 hori et al 2008 carmi et al 2009 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 dorsett et al 2011 there are four common correction models for 14c dating groundwater clark and fritz 1997 1 the simplest correction scheme is a statistical approach vogel 1967 where the initial a14c a0 is estimated from measured values in young samples 2 in the approach of the chemical mass balance cmb model clark and fritz 1997 an initial recharge water composition with dic formed under open system conditions is calculated and further carbonate dissolution under closed conditions is assumed in order to match the observed water chemistry 3 the Œ¥13c mixing model relies on a 13c mass balance rather than the carbonate stoichiometry as a basis for 14c dilution correction pearson and hanshaw 1970 4 the fontes and garnier model rely strongly on the measured Œ¥13c values and this model also considers the chemical mass balance fontes and garnier 1979 the selection of the appropriate correction model depends on the hydrogeochemical conditions of the study area a graphical method was proposed to evaluate the predominant geochemical processes occurring in groundwater systems for radiocarbon dating han et al 2012 han and plummer 2013 and the plotted 14c vs Œ¥13c relationship was regarded as a useful tool for groundwater age and geochemical interpretations han et al 2014 han and plummer 2016 summarized that successful application depends on scrutiny of the isotopic 14c and 13c and chemical data to conceptualize the reactions and processes that affect the 14c content of dic in aquifers however in many cases 14c age is the mixed age of groundwater because the cross flows change the 14c content of dic in groundwater it is hard to determine the ages of groundwater before the mix of flow according to 14c content of dic in aquifers and there are few discussions of this hydrogeological problem for the same groundwater flow system the age of groundwater should gradually increase from the recharge zone to the discharge zone in the same streamline the groundwater age is getting older until it reaches the maximum in the discharge zone therefore the groundwater age in the discharge zone should be the oldest however it is occasionally observed that the groundwater age becomes younger in the discharge zone in the piedmont alluvial plain in the distribution of groundwater age the oldest age often appears in the middle of the plain not in the discharge zone there are two possibilities one possibility is that the groundwater in the middle has mixed with the young groundwater of lateral runoff the other is that the groundwater in the middle has mixed with the young groundwater of cross flow in the vertical discharge process this paper focuses on the effects of cross flow mixing on the age of groundwater and the reassessment of its true age the north china plain ncp is the largest alluvial plain in eastern asia and has a dense population and a semi arid climate the intensive exploitation of groundwater for increased irrigation resulted in a regional decline of groundwater tables since the 1960s foster et al 2004 kendy et al 2004 chen et al 2005 groundwater geochemistry and isotopes have been employed to study the water balance and recharge mechanisms in the ncp kendy et al 2004 chen et al 2005 von rohden et al 2010 xing et al 2013 for the deep confined groundwater in the ncp a record of temperature and monsoon intensity was recognized by comparison of the stable isotope thermometer and noble gas temperatures from the same deep confined aquifer kendy et al 2004 wang et al 2015 and the radiocarbon determined the oldest ages to be less than 40 ka chen et al 2003 2005 kendy et al 2004 according to the distribution of groundwater 14c ages in the ncp the middles of the plains are the oldest and the recharge zone and the discharge zone are relatively young here we present a new set of groundwater chemistry and isotopes to reassess the groundwater 14c ages from the discharge zone in the ncp 2 hydrogeologic setting the ncp located in north central china to the west of the bohai sea and to the east of the taihang mountains fig 1 a is a relatively stable and piedmont sedimentary plain wu et al 1996 xu et al 1996 the altitude of the ncp decreases from west and southwest to east most parts of the ncp have relatively flat topography with elevations of approximately 20 m above mean sea level m s l a very small part near the west boundary of the ncp is the mountain front recharge zone and has elevations of approximately 100 m above m s l the ncp has a mid latitude continental semi arid monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 10 14 c with the maximum temperature of 45 8 c and the minimum temperature of 28 2 c although the average annual precipitation is 500 600 mm more than 60 of the precipitation is concentrated during june to august the average annual evaporation is from 1100 to 1800 mm the bedrock is composed of archaeozoic gneiss and proterozoic carbonate tertiary and quaternary deposits that are 300 500 m thick have accumulated from the west to the east in the ncp the sediments are dominated by fluvial deposits in the piedmont plain alluvial and lacustrine deposits in the central plain and alluvial deposits with interbedded marine deposits in the littoral plain liu 1987 hong 1990 four main aquifers from top to bottom are distributed in the ncp fig 1b the first aquifer shallow and semi confined groundwater is the top aquifer with a depth of less than 50 m and represents the strata of the holocene q2 and late pleistocene the sediment grain sizes change from gravel at the piedmont to fine sand at the coastal plain the groundwater is fresh in the piedmont plain but saline water occurs in the central and littoral plain tds 2 g l the second aquifer shallow confined groundwater represents the quzhuang q1 3 o stratum of the late pleistocene and is composed of gravel medium and fine sands the burial depth of the second aquifer varies from 60 m to 170 m as in the first aquifer groundwater is saline with tds 2 g l from the central to the littoral plain the third aquifer deep confined groundwater represents the yangliuqing q1 2 y stratum of the middle pleistocene and is composed of coarse medium and fine sands the burial depth of the third aquifer varies from 170 m to 350 m groundwater is successively of hco3 na ca cl hco3 na and cl na types with tds of 300 500 mg l chen et al 2003 xing et al 2013 the fourth aquifer deep confined groundwater represents the gu an q1 1 g stratum of the early pleistocene and covers the local bedrock of the ncp the thickness of the fourth aquifer varies from 50 m to 60 m and its burial depth is generally more than 350 m the tds of water is approximately 500 1500 mg l and 1500 2000 mg l in the central and littoral plains respectively quartz k feldspar and hornblende are the dominant minerals in the deep aquifers calcite is commonly present at approximately 5 14 illite kaolinite and montmorillonite may also be observed in the central and littoral plain chen et al 2003 the main exploitation layer of deep groundwater in the ncp is the third aquifer and the groundwater flow regime has changed over time because of long term uncontrolled excessive pumping the water table in the third aquifer has continued to decline since 1959 the direction of the deep groundwater flow in the coastal areas reversed after the 1990s with its new direction from the eastern bohai sea to the western cangzhou groundwater depression chen et al 2010 two great groundwater depressions occur in one main flow pathway of deep groundwater from baoding to huanghua and are shown in fig 1 as rgd renqiu groundwater depression and cgd cangzhou groundwater depression from 1959 to 2015 the maximum drawdown of groundwater table was approximately 55 m and 90 m in the center of the rgd and cgd respectively 3 sampling and analysis methods the main profile from baoding to cangzhou in the ncp is selected to sample deep groundwater in the third aquifer it is consistent with the main flowing direction of deep groundwater and crosses two groundwater depressions the rgd and the cgd the groundwater has high salinity and is undrinkable in the first and second aquifers of the ncp but is fresh and drinkable in the third and fourth aquifers groundwater supply wells in the ncp are almost all drilled into the third aquifer the sections of the first and second aquifers in wells are sealed to prevent salty water from entering into the wells to ensure that the sampling occurred from the same aquifer and avoided cross flow mixing groundwater samples were collected from deep drinking wells furthermore the depth and pumping history of each sampling well was carefully documented to ensure that all groundwater samples were derived from the third aquifer of the ncp the sampling locations and depths are shown in fig 1 and table 1 the temperatures tds and ph values of water samples were measured in situ with a 5 star multi parameter water quality analyzer 520m 01 model the concentrations of unstable hco3 co3 2 and dissolved molecular co2 were measured in situ by titration with precision of 1 mg l the concentrations of anions and cations were measured on a dx 120 ion chromatograph and an iris intrepid ii type icp aes respectively the precision of anion and cation based on replicate analyses is 2 samples for 14c analysis were taken by precipitating baco3 by addition of excess bacl2 to 150 l water previously brought to ph up to 12 by addition of naoh the 14c was determined radiometrically by liquid scintillation counting after conversion to benzene with the analytical error less than 0 5 pmc Œ¥d Œ¥18o Œ¥13c were measured on a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat253 the values of Œ¥d and Œ¥18o were expressed relative to the smow and the precision was 0 2 the Œ¥13c values were expressed relative to the pdb and the precision was 0 2 all of the analytical work was done in the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geosciences wuhan the results of groundwater chemistry are listed in table 1 and the results of Œ¥d Œ¥18o Œ¥13c a14c and corresponding 14c ages are listed in table 2 4 results 4 1 groundwater chemistry the temperatures of groundwater samples were between 18 and 23 c which is higher than the local annual average temperature all groundwater samples were alkaline because the ph was between 7 5 and 8 97 tds in the groundwater samples changed greatly and gradually increased from the recharge zone to the discharge zone the recharge zone was between 271 37 mg l and 1236 52 mg l according to the piper diagram of groundwater samples fig 2 the types of groundwater chemistry in the recharge and discharge zones are significantly different in the recharge zone the major cation and anion are ca2 and hco3 respectively in the discharge zone the major cation and anion have changed to na and cl respectively the water chemistry type changes from hco3 ca mg to so4 cl na and hco3 so4 na ca and so4 cl na ca occurs in the middle of the plain of groundwater runoff for the major cation na and tds show a good linear relationship but the linear relationship between k ca2 mg2 and tds are not obvious fig 3 a d for the major anion cl and tds have a good linear relationship and so4 2 also has a significant linear relationship with tds but hco3 and dic decrease first and then increase with the increase in tds fig 3e h this means that the increase in salinity in groundwater is closely related to the dissolution of salt and sulfate several chemical processes have been identified as being important in controlling the major ion chemistry of deep groundwater in the ncp zhang et al 2000 these processes include the following ion exchange of na on the solids for ca2 and mg2 in solution dissolution of carbonate minerals and gypsum in response to cation exchange and mixing of saline water from the overlying aquifer through leakage the groundwater is supersaturated with respect to calcite in all the groundwater samples as all of the sicalcite saturation index of calcite calculated with phreeqc and listed in table 1 values are greater than zero but is unsaturated with respect to gypsum as the sigypsum values are less than zero the carbonate undergoes a dynamic process of dissolution and precipitation equilibrium while the sulfate is in a dissolved state the increase of na concentration in parallel with cl concentration relates to the mixing of different water types or dissolution of evaporites within the aquifers although an increase in this ratio relates to exchange reactions or to mineral dissolution edmunds and smedley 2000 the mixing process mostly occurred in the littoral area or discharge area because of the large depression cones caused by groundwater overexploitation this finding has been confirmed by several studies zhang et al 2000 indicating that approximately 10 20 saline water is mixed with fresh water in the littoral area or discharge area 4 2 h o c isotopes the Œ¥d values of groundwater samples range from 96 47 to 71 77 average 79 49 whereas the Œ¥18o values range from 11 68 to 8 65 average 10 44 the global meteoric water line gmwl Œ¥d 8Œ¥18o 10 craig 1961 the local meteoric water line lmwl Œ¥d 7 02341Œ¥18o 1 72339 r 2 0 95 zhang et al 2000 and the yong ding river water line ydrwl Œ¥d 5 8Œ¥18o 14 9 xing et al 2013 are used to determine the origin of groundwater in the plot of Œ¥d and Œ¥18o fig 4 the groundwater samples from the recharge zone are close to lmwl indicating that they are mainly derived from the local meteoric water however the other groundwater samples are enriched in 18o and are located to the right of lmwl indicating that the recharge meteoric waters have experienced different degree of evaporation however chen et al 2003 and kreuzer et al 2009 suggested that pleistocene groundwater samples presumably recharged during the last glacial period had a range from 9 4 to 11 7 for Œ¥18o and 76 to 85 for Œ¥d in the ncp recharge of these waters was thought to have occurred at the end of the pleistocene when it would hardly be affected by evaporation therefore the hydrogen and oxygen isotope signatures in deep groundwater may reflect the groundwater recharged from precipitation in glacial or interglacial periods the Œ¥13c values of groundwater samples change greatly from 10 51 to 5 85 with an average of 8 22 according to the relationship of hco3 and Œ¥13c fig 5 some groundwater samples are mainly associated with the oxidation of organic matter and the others are apparently related to calcite dissolution cation exchange and methanogenesis blavoux and olive 1981 abid et al 2012 gillon et al 2009 thus the 13c values indicate the characteristics of multiple sources of carbon in groundwater samples the radiocarbon activities a14c vary from 52 9 to 3 8 pmc in the groundwater samples from the third aquifer of the ncp there is no significant relationship between Œ¥13c and a14c which further demonstrates that there are other sources of carbon mixed in groundwater besides the dissolved atmospheric co2 fig 6 furthermore these additional carbon sources may be of dead carbon han et al 2014 5 discussion 5 1 14c age correction for carbonate precipitation for moderate climates as in the ncp plants that follow the c3 photosynthetic cycle predominate with an average Œ¥13c value of 27 anid et al 1993 tobias et al 1993 co2 from soils with c3 vegetation has an average Œ¥13c value of 23 as a result of co2 degassing following the decomposition of organic matter from c3 plants deines et al 1974 cerling et al 1991 along with the dissolution of soil co2 a small fractionation occurs leading to a Œ¥13c value of 24 for co2 aq clark and fritz 1997 szaran 1998 on the other hand the Œ¥13c value of calcite is generally considered to be 0 the Œ¥13c values of dic of groundwater samples from the third aquifer of the ncp change from 10 51 to 5 85 with the average of 8 22 therefore it is estimated that about one third of the carbon in the deep aquifer of the ncp is from co2 in the vadose zone for the oxidation of organic matter of course calcite dissolution cation exchange and methanogenesis cannot be excluded according to the relationship between hco3 and Œ¥13c fig 5 and the isotopic fractionation between 13c and 14c should also be considered during the 14c dating process reardon and fritz 1978 for the ncp values of soil gas Œ¥13c between 17 and 21 have been used before and the mean value of this range 19 was adopted which produces reasonable results for the young samples whereas a more negative value e g 25 as is often assumed in temperate regions would clearly overcorrect the young samples and lead to a large bias of the fontes and garnier model toward young ages compared to the other models the Œ¥13c of the carbonate endmember was taken to be 1 5 chen et al 2003 kreuzer et al 2009 since there are only slight differences in hco3 concentration and Œ¥13c values between saline water and fresh water zhang et al 2000 the influence of dic by mixing in the recharge zone is neglected however the contribution of 14c from modern saline waters should be taken into account because those waters have 14c activity of approximately 60 40 pmc the initial a14c value of 60 pmc was selected to calculate 14c age in the ncp chen et al 2003 kreuzer et al 2009 from the recharge zone to the middle of the ncp both hco3 and dic are gradually decreasing in the direction of groundwater flow fig 7 a and b while the Œ¥13c is gradually increasing fig 7c the decrease of hco3 and dic along the groundwater flow path is highly associated with carbonate precipitation craig 1954 which will lead to 13c enrichment in groundwater because of carbon isotope fractionation mook et al 1974 carbonate precipitation occurs in the third aquifer of ncp as the sicalcite values of all of the groundwater samples are greater than zero chen et al 2003 suggested that the 13c mixing model ages were likely to be the most representative for the deep groundwater 14c dating in the ncp therefore 14c ages need to be corrected with Œ¥13c because of carbonate precipitation emrich et al 1970 the corrected 14c ages for carbonate precipitation calculated with 13c mixing model marked as 14c age cp in table 2 vary from 1 25 to 22 52 ka 5 2 14c age correction for organic matter oxidation in fig 5 organic matter oxidation probably predominates in the change of hco3 and Œ¥13c in some of groundwater samples from the third aquifer of the ncp from the middle of the ncp to the discharge zone both hco3 and dic are gradually increasing in the direction of groundwater flow fig 7a and b while the Œ¥13c is gradually decreasing fig 7c the increase of hco3 and dic along the groundwater flow path is highly associated with the additional co2 mixing the additional co2 is most likely derived from the organic matter oxidation because the third aquifer in the middle plain and the littoral plain are marine sediments that are rich in organic matter liu 1987 hong 1990 the organic matter contains fossil carbon which is dead carbon due to the addition of dead carbon from the organic matter oxidation the 14c abundances of groundwater samples need to be reevaluated dic is used to correct the a14c in the groundwater for the addition of dead carbon from the organic matter oxidation boaretto et al 1998 the groundwater samples from the middle of the ncp have the lower dic content and the higher Œ¥13c m10 m11 m12 in table 1 and their average 243 1 mg l can be used as the initial value of the dic content before the addition of dead carbon from the organic matter oxidation 1 corrected a 14 c measured a 14 c 243 1 measured dic the corrected a14c for organic matter oxidation is consistently less than the measured a14c for the groundwater samples from the middle of the ncp to the discharge zone fig 8 then the corrected 14c ages for organic matter oxidation calculated with 13c mixing model marked as 14c age omo in table 2 varies from 1 25 to 25 39 ka 5 3 14c age correction for cross flow mixing near the discharge zone both hco3 and dic again start decreasing in the direction of groundwater flow fig 7a and b while the Œ¥13c again starts increasing fig 7c the influences of carbonate precipitation and organic matter oxidation cannot be excluded for the groundwater samples from the discharge zone but it is still hard to explain the changes of dic and Œ¥13c blaser et al 2010 cartwright 2010 tds cl and na have a significant linear relationship with the recharge distance for all the groundwater samples collected from the third aquifer of the ncp fig 9 this relationship indicates that soluble minerals such as salt have gradually dissolved into the groundwater along the flow path clark et al 1997 the contribution of sulfate dissolution to the increase of tds cannot be ignored in the groundwater and cation exchange can increase the na content in groundwater in addition to the contribution of nacl dissolution edmunds et al 2006 then the relationship between cl content and the groundwater flow distance become the reliable clue with which to recognize the cross flow mixing in the deep confined aquifer of the ncp in fig 10 cl content and the groundwater flow distance show a good linear relationship except for the four samples from the discharge zone the expected cl contents of the four samples from the discharge zone can be calculated 2 expected cl content 0 8001 recharge distance 3 0662 the four samples from the discharge zone m19 m20 m21 m22 have higher cl content than the other samples from the recharge zone and the middle of the ncp they are also much higher than the expected cl contents calculated with the recharge distance according to the linear relationship by eq 2 therefore the four samples from the discharge zone are likely to be affected by the cross flow mixing then the relationship between cl content and the groundwater flow distance is used to correct the a14c in the four samples from the discharge zone ln a14c cl and the groundwater flow distance of the groundwater samples from the recharge zone and the middle of the ncp have a good curve relationship fig 11 3 ln a 14 c cl 0 229 e 0 023 recharge distance then a14c of the four samples from the discharge zone are corrected with the expected cl contents according to the curve relationship for the cross flow mixing by eq 3 the corrected a14c for cross flow mixing are consistently less than the measured a14c and are also less than the corrected a14c for organic matter oxidation fig 12 for the four groundwater samples in the discharge zone from the third aquifer of the ncp the corrected a14c for cross flow mixing show a reasonable gradual reduction the corrected 14c ages for the cross flow mixing calculated with 13c mixing model marked as 14c age cfm in table 2 vary from 1 25 to 30 58 ka in a streamline of the same aquifer the groundwater age should gradually increase and reach the maximum in the discharge zone pearson and white 1967 this means that the groundwater 14c age is getting older with the flow distance both the corrected 14c ages for carbonate precipitation 14c age cp and the corrected 14c ages for organic matter oxidation 14c age omo of groundwater samples become younger with the recharge distance in the middle of the ncp while the corrected 14c ages for the cross flow mixing 14c age cfm of groundwater samples become older with the recharge distance from the recharge zone to the discharge zone fig 13 this finding indicates that the corrected 14c ages for the cross flow mixing 14c age cfm of groundwater samples are more reasonable to estimate the groundwater resident time in the third aquifer of the ncp then it is significant to reassess the 14c age of the groundwater from the discharge zone due to cross flow mixing 6 conclusions 14c ages calibrated with the 13c mixing model were regarded as the most reasonable estimation of residence time for the deep groundwater in the confined aquifer of the ncp chen et al 2003 kreuzer et al 2009 from the corresponding changes of hco3 or dic and Œ¥13c in the same streamline of the third aquifer of the ncp we recognize the effects of carbonate precipitation organic matter oxidation and cross flow mixing in the groundwater from the recharge zone to the discharge zone the 13c mixing model and dic correction can resolve the effects of carbonate precipitation and organic matter oxidation respectively for 14c age calibration the relationship of cl content and the recharge distance can be used to estimate the expected cl content in the discharge zone and ln a14c cl is proposed to correct the a14c in groundwater for the effect of cross flow mixing 14c ages corrected for carbonate precipitation and organic matter oxidation grew younger from the middle plain to the discharge zone which is unreasonable given the groundwater flow time in the same streamline of the same aquifer the 14c ages of groundwater from the discharge zone are reassessed due to the cross flow mixing which grow older with the distance from the recharge zone to the discharge zone the distribution of corrected 14c ages is more reasonable demonstrating the significance of 14c age reassessment for the groundwater from the discharge zone due to cross flow mixing

7363,the intensity and form of changes in closed lakes upstream lakes and outflow lakes on the third pole tp differ based on their drainage mode researchers insufficient understanding of the hydrological networks associated with lakes hampers studies of the relationship between lakes and climate in this study we establish a comprehensive hydrological network for each lake 1 km2 on the tp using 106 landsat images 236 chinese topographic maps and srtm dem three hundred ninety seven closed lakes 488 upstream lakes and 317 outflow lakes totaling 3 5498 49 km2 7 378 82 km2 and 3 382 29 km2 respectively were identified on the tp using 2010 data two hundred thirty four closed lakes were found to not be linked to upstream lakes the remaining 163 closed lakes were connected to and fed by the 488 upstream lakes the object oriented analyses within this study indicated that more rapid changes occurred in the surface extent of closed lakes than in upstream lakes or outflow lakes on the tp from 1970 s to 2010 furthermore the water volume of the examined closed lakes was almost nine times greater than that of the upstream lakes from 2003 to 2009 all the examined closed lakes exhibited an obvious water volume change compared to the corresponding upstream lakes in the same basin furthermore two case studies illustrate that the annual and seasonal dynamics associated with the changes in closed lakes may reflect climate change patterns while the upstream lake dynamics may be more controlled by the lakeshore terrain and drainage characteristics the lake inventory and hydrological network catalogued in this study provide a basis for developing a better understanding of lake response to climate change on the tp keywords lake hydrological network lake classification third pole 1 introduction the third pole tp which includes the tibetan plateau and its surroundings is referred to as the asian water tower because it stores a large amount of water in different forms qiu 2008 immerzeel et al 2010 yao et al 2012a 1000 lakes 1 km2 with a total area 4 104 km2 have been recorded on the tp from the 1970s to 2010 wang et al 1998 ma et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 these alpine lakes have been used as laboratories to explore the hydrologic process evaluate water resources and understand climate change yang et al 2011 during the past four decades most lakes on the tp shrank between the 1970s and 1990 followed by a slight and then greater expansion in the 1990s and 2000s respectively zhang et al 2014 regionally most lakes in the southern tp shrank while those in the central tp expanded greatly song et al 2013 these changes in lake surface extent are primarily caused by trade offs between surface runoff from precipitation on lake precipitation glacier meltwater runoff glacier fed lake and lake water evaporation zhang et al 2017 case studies and more general research indicate that increased precipitation decreased evaporation and accelerated glacier retreats identified in the region are the primary factors driving recent lake expansions and mass gains lei et al 2014 song et al 2014 zhu et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 yet the primary drives forces and climate driven mechanisms of lake variations still remain debated few studies have analysed the impact of a river s structure whether a lake is closed or runs off to other lakes or rivers on its relationship to climate patterns phan et al 2013 closed lakes have an inlet but no outlet water in a closed lake does not leave the basin as surface runoff those with an inlet and outlet are defined as upstream lake when the runoff flows into a closed lake and as outflow lakes when the runoff connects to a river or eventually flows into the ocean these three types of lakes have different drainage modes so the effect of climate change on their intensity and forms may differ it s necessary to distinguish between these lakes and consider them separately in lake climate researches however the comprehensive hydrological network of lakes on the tp has not been delineated and an understanding of this network s characteristic is lacking the primary aims of this work are to identify the hydrological networks associated with each lake on the tp including the catchments streams runoff inputs into lakes and how lakes are connected to one another or to rivers to classify the lakes as closed upstream or outflow lakes explore the different dynamic between these lake types the rest of the paper is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 describe the study area data and methods used in this paper section 4 details the results of the hydrological network analysis and classification of lakes on the tp as well as provides a comparison and evaluation of closed lake upstream lake and outflow lake dynamics section 5 concludes the paper by summarizing the major results of this study 2 study area the tp covers an area over 5 000 000 km2 with an average elevation over 4000 m stretching counterclockwise from the hindu kush in the west to the himalayas in the south to the hengduan mountains in the east and to the qilian and kunlun mountains in the north the climate over the southern part of the tp is primarily controlled by the indian monsoon in the warm season and the westerlies in the cold season that over the central to northern parts of the tp is primarily controlled by the westerlies with limited influence from the east asian monsoon yao et al 2012b these two circulation systems combined with the extensive relief induce strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the tp s climate over the past four decades climate over the tp has changed rapidly temperature on the tp has risen 0 3 0 4 c per decade which is twice the global warming rate liu et al 2000 and the warming in the northern tp is significantly greater than that in the southern tp precipitation on the tp increased significantly by 2 2 per decade kang et al 2010 over the same period precipitation in the northern tp increase while that in the southern tp decreased yao et al 2012b fig 1 illustrates the tp zones shi et al 2005 firstly the tp is divided into internal and external drainage area based on the river dividing principle and the supplying relationship between lakes and rivers external drainage area are defined as hydrological networks connected to other regions via surface runoff while internal drainage areas are independent hydrological networks external drainage areas are then subdivided into nine zones including amudarya inner east asia yellow r river yangtze r mekong r salween r brahmaputra r ganges and indus r regional difference in climate and geomorphology are used to subdivide internal drainage areas into seven zones yellow background color in fig 1 including the qinghai l lake zone ayakku l zone dogaicoring l zone bangongco zone yibugcaka zone zharinamco zone and serlingco zone each zone is named after the largest lake therein 3 data and methods 3 1 data the data used in this study include landsat images chinese topographic maps ctms the map of glaciers and lakes on the tibetan plateau and adjoining regions mgltp the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem and river network and drainage basin data from hydrosheds the landsat images and ctms were used to interpret lake boundaries maps and image specifications are detailed in table 1 the mgltp and ctms were used to obtain certain lake attributes including lakes names and type the srtm dem ctms and some images were used to delineate the catchment for every lake and construct the hydrological network 3 1 1 optical images the landsat series mutispectral scanner mss thematic mapper tm and enhanced thematic mapper plus etm images have been widely used to map lake boundaries to reduce the impact of clouds and seasonal variations the images are selected using the following criteria 1 all images used were cloud free over the lake boundary 2 the image acquisition date was from september to november that is at the end of the wet season when the lake water budget is relatively stable song et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 and 3 the maximum time between data points was two years if no data were available in a year however the coarse spatial resolution and quality of the landsat mss images necessitated the use of all available landsat mss images from 1972 to 1977 these images were used as reference data in the identification of lake boundaries in the 1970 s in total 311 landsat images from the u s geological survey usgs http govis usgs gov were used table1 of these 60 images from 2003 and 65 images from 2009 were used to analyse the change in water volume for 162 typical lakes with available icesat water level data to reduce the influence of intra annual change in a lake s surface extent all of the images from 2003 and 2009 were obtained between september and november for the same lake the difference in the date between photos was within one month of the 106 images taken in the 2010 s 90 images were obtained in september to november which represents 95 lakes the pre process procedures include geo referencing and radiometric correction those scenes that have already been systematically calibrated and geo referenced are used as references for the image to image registration of others the root mean squared errors of the rectifications are controlled within one pixel gaps in the landsat etm images are removed using the neighborhood similar pixel interpolator algorithm developed by chen et al 2011 3 1 2 maps the ctms at scale 1 100 000 are based on aerial photography during the period from 1960 to 1980 with spatial resolution of 30 m they illustrate natural geographical elements such as rivers lakes and social elements such as villages roads most of this information was verified by field surveying the geographic coordinate system is the 1954 beijing geodetic coordinate system bj54 geoid datum level is yellow sea mean sea level at qingdao tidal observatory in 1956 and the projection is 6 degree gauss kruger projection 236 topographic maps from the national geomatics center of china ngcc are used table 1 raw geo reference of these topographic maps is firstly defined and then re projected into world geodetic system 1984 wgs84 universal transverse mercator utm projection based on the corresponding landsat benchmark data the mgltp at scale 1 2 000 000 shows some mountains rivers lakes glaciers as well as the relevant geomorphology ecology and the transportation network from 70 e to 105 e and from 27 n to 45 n highlighting the distribution of water resources of glaciers and lakes yao et al 2008 geo reference for the map is defined using 55 feature points selected from the benchmark landsat data and google earth a little offset occurred at the edge of the map due to its large extent but this offset has no influence on this study since we do not use any geographic information from mgltp 3 1 3 srtm dem and hydrosheds data the srtm was launched in february 2000 by the national geospatial intelligence agency nga and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and it detected the earth s topography by the single pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique the near global 56 s 60 n srtm dem data are with liner vertical absolute height error less than 16 m and relative height error less than 10 m at 90 confidence interval farr et al 2007 the srtm dem with cell size of 87 m and latitude longitude geographic projection were free available from http srtm csi cgiar org the srtm dem data from 70 e to 105 e and from 27 n to 45 n are downloaded mosaicked and then referenced to the wgs84 horizontal datum the hydrosheds river network as riv 15s and drainage basin as bas 15s with the spatial resolution of 410 m on tp from the usgs website http hydrosheds cr usgs gov are used as a reference data to identify the internal drainage 3 2 methods 3 2 1 making the lake inventory on the tp a lake vector is an object with an independent position shape contour and size the lake boundaries on the tp in 2003 2009 and 2010 from landsat tm and etm images have been automatically determined as shown in fig 2 the raw digital number dn values in the landsat data were first converted to surface reflectance using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps version 1 2 0 feng et al 2013 the surface reflectance provides more appropriate measurements of surface properties than the original dn value or uncorrected radiance and top of atmosphere reflectance vermote et al 2002 next a two step automated method was used to identify water pixels by combing the modified normalized difference water index mndwi with digital image processing techniques jiang et al 2014 first the land and water body features were delineated using a deliberately strict threshold the unmarked pixels may be land or mixed water pixels which will be classified in the next steps second a watershed segmentation algorithm was used to determine the final lake extent the algorithm iteratively expands all typical pixels to their neighbor pixels and the final boundaries between lake and land are determined by the maximum gradient of the mndwi which is calculated via the commonly used sobel operator meyer 2012 the segmentation finishes after all of the pixels are marked as lake or land next the extracted lakes rasters are vectorized into lake polygons the lake boundaries in 1970 s and the landsat etm images with gaps are determined by manually visual interpretation based on the enhanced colour images from landsat mss and ctms finally all of the lakes were manually improved and carefully checked one by one by a single expert in this study all of the lakes over 1 km2 were detected the water bodies on the major river bed and artificial reservoirs such as liuyangxia reservoir were excluded from this review to illustrate the lake evolution small lakes around a larger lake are identified as independent if they are separated by land 3 2 2 establishing the lake hydrological network and classifying the lakes the lakes hydrological network includes the catchment of every lake and the main streams the catchments are used to describe how the runoff from rain melting snow or ice converges on a lake and the main streams revel how lakes connect to other lakes or rivers this information was derived using three procedures below fig 3 the 2000 srtm dem and 1970s ctms were used to delineate the number of catchment in 2010 each catchment is surrounded by a geographical barrier typically a mountain ridge the uplift rate in the tp was derived from several china earthquake administration stations with continuous gps measurements this rate is approximately 0 5 mm y zhang et al 2013 this small change is unlikely to have caused a change in catchment boundaries between the 1970s and 2010 1 calculating a preliminary stream network psn and drainage basin pdb forty five srtm dem tiles over the tp were merged automatic delineation including fill sinks flow direction flow accumulation stream definition stream segmentation catchment grid delineation and catchment polygon processing was applied to the merged srtm dems using arcgis archydro tools the threshold for defining streams and the catchments at plateau scale was 4000 32 km2 inappropriate search and fill process may create some artificial stream networks and basins khan et al 2014 thus manual quality control and revisions occurred to improve the psn and pdb 2 confirming the drainage links and watershed areas of the closed lakes drainage links and watershed areas were carefully identified and manually revised by a single expert one by one based on rivers and mountain ridges visible on ctms and landsat images the visual inspections were performed at a scale of 1 50 000 first the lakes psn and pdb within every closed hydrosheds drainage basin hdb were separated into independent groups within every group the lake with the lowest elevation from the srtm dem and ctms was determined to be closed within that basin the stream networks were formatted as polyline vectors and consisted of many oriented river segment routes running from one node with higher elevation to another with lower elevation using each closed lake as a starting point we upward tracked the psn from lower elevation to higher elevation until the boundary of the watershed to confirm the drainage links and identify the independent stream network in some flat area located mostly in the center of the lake basins psn cannot be extracted accurately and only some parallel lines appear we deleted these lines and re delineated the river segment roads from the closed lake to the psn in the light of the rivers in the ctms which include most of the main streams meanwhile we found some connected segments were divided into different parts by the hdb these segments were carefully identified based on the ctms and landsat images if the connection really exists the connected neighboring psns and pdbs were looked as a new group the closed lake determination and stream network identification were iterated and the inaccurate hdb was marked if not the false segments were deleted especially the rivers connected with lake were checked to confirm whether they are the input or output according to the elevation difference and the river orientation after the independent stream network was identified we merged the pdbs covered the independent stream network into a single closed lake catchment and then the next independent group was checked until all the groups were done 3 classifying the other lakes as upstream or outflow lakes and identifying their drainage links and sub catchment within every closed lake catchment all other lakes with the higher elevation than the closed lake were defined as the upstream lakes qiao and zhu 2017 this occurred even for lakes where a seasonal river was the only connection between two adjacent lakes in this case the lake type was defined based on the seasonal stream s orientation in the independent stream network the intersection between every upstream lake and output river was pointed manually all pdbs found to drain into a given intersection point were merged as sub catchment of its corresponding upstream lake all lakes outside of the closed lakes catchments were defined as the outflow lakes similar with the mentioned method first the rivers connected with the outflow lake were checked to confirm whether they are the input or output according to the elevation and the river orientation we began this check from the outflow lake with the lowest elevation because some outflow lakes also have their upstream lakes since the runoff from the upstream lakes of the outflow lakes eventually flows into a river and the ocean we also defined them as the outflow lakes using the outflow lake as a starting point we upward tracked the psn to confirm and revise the drainage links meanwhile we downward tracked the psn to confirm that the output river finally merges into the outflow river and then the intersection between every outflow lake and output river was pointed manually all pdbs found to drain into a given intersection point were merged as sub catchment of its corresponding outflow lake here we found some lakes were misclassified as the outflow lakes because these lakes have no outlet but the hdb dataset were not identified them then we redefined them and rebuilt the catchment and stream network according to the above mentioned method for the closed lake and upstream lake 56 upstream lakes and 78 outflow lakes were found to have no sub catchments as they were less than 32 km2 to identify sub catchments within these catchments we clipped the merged srtm dem to a smaller range and ran the hydro process again using a smaller threshold catchments for an additional 18 upstream lakes and 7 outflow lakes were delineated manually using the ctms these catchments were less than 10 km2 and were primarily associated with glacier lakes 3 2 3 calculating the lake water volume change lake water volume change can be modelled by combing time series for a given lake area and water level change rate song et al 2013 lake water volume change is calculated as 1 Œ¥ w s i 1 s i h i 1 h i d s d h s i s i 1 2 h i h i 1 s i s i 1 2 r h t where Œ¥w is the water volume change during the period from i to i 1 s i and s i 1 is the lake surface area at i and i 1 respectively and h i and h i 1 represent the water level at i and i 1 respectively rh is the water level change rate and t is the time period from i to i 1 the geoscience laser altimeter system glas on board the ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat can be used to obtain time series of lake water levels with decimeter accuracy the available icesat data for the tp and a linear regression analysis were previously used to developed two published datasets that indicate water level change rates for 117 lakes over 10 km2 from 2003 to 2009 song et al 2013 as well as those of 154 lakes over 1 km2 phan et al 2012 in this study we use these reported water level change rates to calculate the water volume change from 2003 to 2009 the reported lakes can be easily located using the coordinates provided in these datasets 4 results and discussion 4 1 the hydrological network and classification of lakes fig 4 shows the catchments and distribution of lakes on the tp in 2010 1202 lakes with a total area of 46 258 96 km2 were identified on the tp including 397 33 closed lakes 488 41 upstream lakes and 317 26 outflow lakes these lake types accounted for a total area of 35 498 49 km2 77 7 378 18 km2 16 and 3 382 29 km2 7 respectively table2 of the 397 closed lakes 234 59 were not connected to upstream lakes the remaining 163 41 closed lakes were linked to one or more of the 488 upstream lakes 93 of closed lakes and 96 of upstream lakes were located within the internal drainage area while all outflow lakes were identified in an external drainage area within the external drainage area the number of lakes associated with the yangtze r basin 109 lakes and brahmaputra r basin 103 lakes exceeded those identified in other regions and the average area of lakes in the yellow r basin 38 2 km2 was greater than that for any other external drainage area within the internal drainage area the average area of lakes in the qinghai l zone was greatest and reached 156 6 km2 the average area of lakes in the serlingco zone ayakku l zone zharinamco zone and bangongco zone was 66 0 km2 61 8 km2 60 8 km2 and 43 2 km2 respectively in the central dogaicoring l zone and yibugcaka zone the average area of lakes was 18 3 km2 and 17 4 km2 respectively these latter values were low given the relatively large number of lakes existed in these two regions 197 and 140 lakes this indicates that most of the larger lakes are located in the surrounding region while many small lakes are found within the tp fig 5 shows the differences between the closed catchment identified using the hydrosheds data and this dataset as well as examples of the primary drainage links and sub catchments within independent basins of the 397 closed lakes 358 lakes had similar boundaries in both the hdb and manually derived dataset with minor differences in details see the example in fig 5b these differences were likely due to the spatial resolution of the hdb and the fact that the new drainage basins blue line had a higher spatial resolution 90 m relative to the hdb 410 m red line the other 39 hdbs generally contained four types of errors a the hdbs include some false edges an example in fig 5c green lines these were identified by comparing the hdbs to the ctms and deleting the inaccurate edges b 19 closed lakes and their catchments including bangongco maindongco fig 5d yamzhogyumco chemco bajuco and chiguco fig 5e were not identified using the hdb dataset we constructed these catchments using the psn and pdb c small channels occasionally existed between two nearby lakes however the hdb resolution resulted in these lakes being combined into one for the purposes of this study these lakes were combined for example the dorsoidongco and migriggyangzhamco basins shown in fig 5f and d 18 catchments were divided into multiple parts due to the inaccurate classification of segments for example in the hdb an inaccurate segment divides the serlingco basin into two however we know that this southeastern river is one of three tributaries within the serlingco basin fig 5 g two cases representing inaccurate lake linkage identification within the dorsoidongco migriggyangzhamco d m and serlingco basins are shown in fig 6 dorsoidongco and migriggyangzhamco are considered independent lakes with their own drainage basins the red line in fig 6a in the hydrosheds data however the ctm mapping based on aerial photography from october 1969 fig 6b revealed that a seasonal channel existed between these two adjacent lakes and a seasonal country road passed through the channel between the 1970 s and 2010 the area of these two lakes reached a minimum in 1996 at that time this small channel still existed fig 6c with the expansion of these two lakes an obvious channel formed approximately 2002 fig 6d and the dam that separated these two lakes became more narrow fig 6e the dam had almost disappeared by 2010 fig 6f thus we identified these two lakes as one lake and merged the pdbs of these two lakes using the boundary in fig 5f black line fig 6g l shows the inaccurate division of serlingco based on the hydrosheds data the serlingco drainage basin is defined as the red boundary in fgiure6g however the ctm mapping based on aerial photography from october 1970 fig 6h showed that the river zhagen zangbu connects urruco and serlingco the mean elevations of urruco and serlingco were 4547 m and 4530 m respectively in 1970 and 4553 m and 4539 m respectively in 2000 the water in urruco flows into serlingco through the river zhagen zangbu to confirm that this connection has always exsited four landsat images from 1976 1991 2000 and 2011 were analysed then the urruco and serlingco pdbs were modified and the boundary of serlingco derived black boundary in fgiure5g phan et al 2013 created drainage links between tibetan glaciers lakes and rivers based on a glacier mask modis mod44w water product and hydrosheds river networks there are two primary differences between phan s drainage links and the dataset in this study first phan s dataset is based on 891 lakes from the 250 m modis mod44w water product while the dataset in this study is based on 1197 lakes identified using 30 m landsat images due to the relative higher spatial resolution of the landsat images more lakes can be identified second phan s drainage links were primarily identified based on the hydrosheds river network while the dataset in this study revised the base drainage network using ctms and multi period remote sensing images zhang et al 2014 reported that the number and area of lakes over 1 km2 on the tp and surroundings were 1236 and 47 366 km2 in 2010 the comparison between these two datasets suggests that the difference between the two datasets stems from the definition and interpretation of lakes first some water bodies 257 km2 on the major rivers channels were not counted in the present study including the brahmaputra r and some artificial reservoirs such as liujiaxia reservoir 363 km2 second islands within lakes such as the island within the yamzhog yumco 33 km2 were ignored the most significant difference stemmed from different interpretation of salt lakes 430 km2 in the present study we did not include dry lakes or areas that are now dry or only covered by salt 4 2 variations in surface extent change between three lake types from 1970s to 2010 the driving mechanism of lake change is a complex combination of multiple climate factors meanwhile the variations in different lakes may be affected by their own hydrological processes changes in closed lakes upstream lakes and outflow lakes from the 1970 s to 2010 were summarized in fig 7 most of the closed lakes 91 upstream lakes 85 and outflow lakes 75 expanded during the time frame increasing by 5 710 6 km2 939 3 km2 and 367 8 km2 respectively the number of expanding closed lakes 3 6 2 and upstream lakes 4 1 3 is comparable while the increase in area of the closed lakes was 6 1 times that of the upstream lakes and 15 5 times that of the outflow lakes on the other hand 35 closed lakes 70 upstream lakes and 76 outflow lakes shrank during the study period with decrease decline of 345 9 km2 65 2 km2 and 90 5 km2 respectively the larger lakes were generally associated with greater changes in area however fig 7b indicates that lake size is not the only factor that affects lake area change 54 of expanding closed lakes exhibited an area increase over 5 km2 while only 10 2 of expanding upstream lakes and 4 of expanding outflow lakes exhibited increase of that size fig 7b this indicates that the surface area changes expanding or shrinking of closed lakes are more noticeable than those of upstream lakes and outflow lakes as mentioned above 163 closed lakes are supplied by 488 upstream lakes to further clarify whether changes in the closed lakes occurs more rapidly than those of their corresponding upstream lakes we divided these lakes into 163 groups each group includes one closed lake and their corresponding upstream lakes from the 1970s to 2010 16 closed lakes shrank while the other 147 expanded representing a changed area of 108 2 km2 to 679 0 km2 fig 8 compares 82 groups of closed lakes and their corresponding upstream lakes the others are not included due to the relatively smaller changed area of 1 3 km2 to 9 5 km2 fig 8a indicates that the decreased in the areas of qinghai l and yamzhogyumco were far greater than those of their corresponding upstream lakes and the other six closed lakes also shrank more than their corresponding upstream lakes fig 8b d reveal greater expansions of closed lakes relative to their corresponding upstream lakes with the area increase from 10 4 km2 to114 6 km2 the top four expanding closed lakes are serlingco ayakkuh l dorsoidongco and dogaicoringqangco which increased by 679 0 km2 323 3 km2 150 5 km2 and 149 2 km2 respectively the change in area for their corresponding upstream lakes was much less than that of the closed lakes with a changed area of 1 9 km2 to 11 2 km2 0 5 km2 to 9 5 km2 0 3 km2 to 4 9 km2 and 0 1 km2 to 10 8 km2 respectively these comparisons show that no matter the change mode and intensity of the closed lakes the upstream lakes remained relatively stable some previous studies have compared changes in lake serlingco silingco to those in congoin co e the two lakes are within one kilometer of one another and have similar climate conditions including precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration serlingco has expanded dramatically whereas congoin has remained relatively stable it is inferred that the critical reason for this difference is that congoin is not supplemented by glacial melt water while serlingco is meng et al 2012 song et al 2014 however this inference does not take into account the drainage type of these two lakes the hydrological network developed in this study indicates that serlingco is a closed lake while congoin is an upstream lake that feeds into serlingco fig 5g thus water from conogoin flows into serlingco through the yunzhugzangbo river the connection between the closed lake and its corresponding upstream lakes likely impacted the dramatic expansion of serlingco and the stability of congoin 4 3 variations in water level surface extent and water volume change in three lake types from 2003 to 2009 two published datasets provide information on the changes in water level of some tp lakes from 2003 to 2009 of the 154 lakes studied by phan et al 2012 89 were closed lakes 41 were upstream lakes 18 were outflow lakes and six lakes were unidentified of the 117 lakes studied by song et al 2013 87 were closed lakes 24 were upstream lakes five were outflow lakes and one was unidentified fig 9 a and d illustrate the water level change rate of these three types of lakes the average change rate of closed lakes upstream lakes and outflow lakes is 0 23 m y 0 25 m y 0 10 m y 0 13 m y 0 10 m y 0 11 m y respectively per phan et al 2012 song et al 2013 the average change rate of the closed lakes is almost two times greater than that of the upstream lakes small differences in the water level change rate of the same lake may exist between these two datasets for example serlingco has the maximum water level increase of 0 68 m y vs 0 63 m y this may be the result of the differences in the lakes elevation data or the noise removal and filtering methods employed song et al 2013 however these minor differences do not affect the trend comparison fig 9b c e and f show the changed area and volume of the examined closed upstream and outflow lakes from 2003 to 2009 respectively most of the closed lakes have an area that fluctuates by approximately 5 while the upstream lakes and outflow lakes remain relatively stable during this period the average changed volume of the closed lakes upstream lakes and outflow lakes is 0 42 109 m3 0 40 109 m3 0 04 109 m3 0 06 109 m3 0 07 109 m3 0 20 109 m3 respectively the changed volume of the closed lakes is almost six to ten times greater than that of the upstream lakes comparing closed lake with their corresponding upstream lakes in the same basin can provide a more direct evidence of these changes the water level change rate of 10 closed lakes with 20 corresponding upstream lakes and eight closed lakes with 12 corresponding upstream lakes can be obtained from phan et al 2012 and song et al 2013 respectively among these 18 groups eight groups represent the same closed lakes while some of the corresponding upstream lakes vary fig 10 a and d illustrates the water level change rates for these groups and indicate that six and three upstream lakes respectively have a greater change rate than their supplied closed lakes however all of these upstream lakes remain relatively unchanged in surface extent while the closed lake undergo greater changes in area and have strong spatial heterogeneity fig 10b and e thus these closed lakes have obviously greater water volume change than their corresponding upstream lakes fig 10c and f 4 4 case studies seasonal change in closed lake and upstream lake two case studies can be used to compare the seasonal change in area for closed lake and their corresponding upstream lakes mermaco and aruco dorsoidongco and rumuchenco the mermaco basin 34 22 n 82 31 e is located in the northwest of the internal drainage area of the tp and has an area of 159 24 km2 there is only one upstream lake in this basin aruco which has an area of 105 42 km2 fig 11 a from the 1970 s to 2010 the area of mermaco increases by 21 10 km2 13 3 while that of aruco increased by 0 33 km2 0 3 from 2003 to 2009 the water level area and volume change of mermaco and aruco were 0 48 m y 1 66 km2 y 0 43 109 m3 and 0 03 m y 0 03 km2 y and 0 02 109 m3 respectively mermaco and aruco both begin to freeze in november mermaco melts completely by june of the following year while aruco melts by may the closed lake mermaco has expanded steadily and exhibits a seasonal increase during the non frozen period from july to october fig 11b the change in non frozen period accounts for 30 80 of the change throughout the year meanwhile the upstream lake aruco exhibits almost no seasonal and annual fluctuation fig 11c the dorsoidongco basin is located at 33 43 n 90 07 e in the east of the internal drainage area of the tp and has an area of 1032 19 km2 it has nine upstream lakes however only rumuchenco has a water level change rate available in icesat this lake has an area of 33 74 km2 from the 1970 s to 2010 dorsoidongco increased by 150 49 km2 14 6 while rumuchenco increased by 3 18 km2 9 4 from 2003 to 2009 the water level area and volume change in dorsoidongco and rumuchenco was 0 53 m y 11 02 km2 y and 3 15 109 m3 and 0 27 m y 0 35 km2 y and 0 05 109 m3 respectively these two lakes both begin to freeze in november and melt in may next year the closed lake dorsoidongco has expanded steadily and there is an apparent seasonal increase during the non frozen period from june to october which account for 74 97 of the change each year fig 11e meanwhile the inter annual area change of the upstream lake rumuchenco exhibited an increasing trend similar to that of dorsoidongco from 2006 to 2009 although the absolute change was less than 1 5 km2 furthermore the upstream lake values fluctuates in the non frozen period but remained stable in the frozen period fig 11f the intra annual changes in rumuchenco were similar to those identified for dorsoidongco in 2003 2007 and 2009 these two case studies indicate that the seasonal and annual change of a closed lake may be linked to climate change on the other hand while the seasonal and annual changes in upstream lakes may sometimes reflect climate change they are more often constrained by the lakeshore terrain and drainage characteristics 5 conclusion researchers understanding of hydrological characteristic of lakes on the tp is insufficient which limits studies interested in the lake climate relationships a hydrological network of lakes on the tp was developed to show how runoff converges to a lake and how lake connect to one another or rivers downstream according to the hydrological network derived in this study lakes can be classified as closed upstream or outflow lake this study indicates that there are 397 closed lakes 488 upstream lakes and 317 outflow lakes over 1 km2 on the tp with an area of 35 498 49 km2 7 378 18 km2 and 3 382 29 km2 respectively in 2010 234 closed lakes are independent and not associated with upstream lakes the remaining 163 closed lakes are supplied by the 488 upstream lakes 93 closed lakes and 96 upstream lakes are located in the internal drainage area of the tp while all of the outflow lakes are located in the external drainage area most of the larger lakes are located in the surrounding region while the majority of small lakes are in the interior region in the internal drainage area of the tp closed upstream and outflow lakes have different drainage modes the comparison and object oriented analyses indicate that changes in the surface extent of closed lakes are more apparent than those of upstream lakes and outflow lakes the increase in area of the closed lakes is 6 1 times that of the upstream lakes and 15 5 times that of the outflow lakes although the number of expanding closed lakes and upstream lakes is comparable 362 vs 413 the closed lake and their corresponding upstream lakes in a given basin show distinct changes although their hydro meteorological conditions are similar the object oriented analyses further prove that no matter the mode or intensity of the closed lake changes the upstream lakes remain relatively stable based on the water level change rate of two published datasets and the lake areas in 2003 and 2009 changes in lake water volume were calculated and analysed from 2003 to 2009 most of the closed lake areas fluctuated by approximately 5 while the upstream lakes and outflow lakes remained relatively stable the water level change rate of the closed lakes is almost two times greater than that of the upstream lakes while the volume change of the closed lakes is almost nine times greater than that of the upstream lakes the comparison between the closed lakes and their corresponding upstream lakes further confirms that all the examined closed lakes have an obviously greater volume change than their corresponding upstream lakes even if some of the closed lakes have less water level change two case studies compare the seasonal area change between closed lakes and their corresponding upstream lakes mermaco and aruco are located in the northwest and dorsoidongco and rumuchenco are located in the east of the internal drainage area of the tp from the 1970 s to 2010 these two closed lake basins exhibited more rapid increases in area than their upstream counterparts from 2003 to 2009 these two closed lakes exhinbited greater water levels area and water storage changes than their upstream counterparts these two closed lakes continued to expand steadily and exhibited a seasonal increase during the non frozen period from june to october however the changes exhibited by their associated upstream lakes were different aruco exhibited almost no seasonal and annual fluctuation while rumuchenco exhibited similar seasonal and annual fluctuation to its closed lake counterpart in some years but not others thus the changes experienced by the closed lakes may be a reflection of climate change while those of the upstream lakes may be limited by the lakeshore terrain and drainage characteristics compared to upstream and outflow lake closed lakes are the terminal point in a regional water cycle and thus a resultant response to regional climate change as a result the change process within closed lakes is much more apparent and significant to quantify the lake climate relationship researchers should investigate whether and how different lakes are connected as well as classify and discuss these lakes separately the hydrological network and relationship between lakes in this study supports a better understanding of lake responses to climate change on the tp and

7363,the intensity and form of changes in closed lakes upstream lakes and outflow lakes on the third pole tp differ based on their drainage mode researchers insufficient understanding of the hydrological networks associated with lakes hampers studies of the relationship between lakes and climate in this study we establish a comprehensive hydrological network for each lake 1 km2 on the tp using 106 landsat images 236 chinese topographic maps and srtm dem three hundred ninety seven closed lakes 488 upstream lakes and 317 outflow lakes totaling 3 5498 49 km2 7 378 82 km2 and 3 382 29 km2 respectively were identified on the tp using 2010 data two hundred thirty four closed lakes were found to not be linked to upstream lakes the remaining 163 closed lakes were connected to and fed by the 488 upstream lakes the object oriented analyses within this study indicated that more rapid changes occurred in the surface extent of closed lakes than in upstream lakes or outflow lakes on the tp from 1970 s to 2010 furthermore the water volume of the examined closed lakes was almost nine times greater than that of the upstream lakes from 2003 to 2009 all the examined closed lakes exhibited an obvious water volume change compared to the corresponding upstream lakes in the same basin furthermore two case studies illustrate that the annual and seasonal dynamics associated with the changes in closed lakes may reflect climate change patterns while the upstream lake dynamics may be more controlled by the lakeshore terrain and drainage characteristics the lake inventory and hydrological network catalogued in this study provide a basis for developing a better understanding of lake response to climate change on the tp keywords lake hydrological network lake classification third pole 1 introduction the third pole tp which includes the tibetan plateau and its surroundings is referred to as the asian water tower because it stores a large amount of water in different forms qiu 2008 immerzeel et al 2010 yao et al 2012a 1000 lakes 1 km2 with a total area 4 104 km2 have been recorded on the tp from the 1970s to 2010 wang et al 1998 ma et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 these alpine lakes have been used as laboratories to explore the hydrologic process evaluate water resources and understand climate change yang et al 2011 during the past four decades most lakes on the tp shrank between the 1970s and 1990 followed by a slight and then greater expansion in the 1990s and 2000s respectively zhang et al 2014 regionally most lakes in the southern tp shrank while those in the central tp expanded greatly song et al 2013 these changes in lake surface extent are primarily caused by trade offs between surface runoff from precipitation on lake precipitation glacier meltwater runoff glacier fed lake and lake water evaporation zhang et al 2017 case studies and more general research indicate that increased precipitation decreased evaporation and accelerated glacier retreats identified in the region are the primary factors driving recent lake expansions and mass gains lei et al 2014 song et al 2014 zhu et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 yet the primary drives forces and climate driven mechanisms of lake variations still remain debated few studies have analysed the impact of a river s structure whether a lake is closed or runs off to other lakes or rivers on its relationship to climate patterns phan et al 2013 closed lakes have an inlet but no outlet water in a closed lake does not leave the basin as surface runoff those with an inlet and outlet are defined as upstream lake when the runoff flows into a closed lake and as outflow lakes when the runoff connects to a river or eventually flows into the ocean these three types of lakes have different drainage modes so the effect of climate change on their intensity and forms may differ it s necessary to distinguish between these lakes and consider them separately in lake climate researches however the comprehensive hydrological network of lakes on the tp has not been delineated and an understanding of this network s characteristic is lacking the primary aims of this work are to identify the hydrological networks associated with each lake on the tp including the catchments streams runoff inputs into lakes and how lakes are connected to one another or to rivers to classify the lakes as closed upstream or outflow lakes explore the different dynamic between these lake types the rest of the paper is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 describe the study area data and methods used in this paper section 4 details the results of the hydrological network analysis and classification of lakes on the tp as well as provides a comparison and evaluation of closed lake upstream lake and outflow lake dynamics section 5 concludes the paper by summarizing the major results of this study 2 study area the tp covers an area over 5 000 000 km2 with an average elevation over 4000 m stretching counterclockwise from the hindu kush in the west to the himalayas in the south to the hengduan mountains in the east and to the qilian and kunlun mountains in the north the climate over the southern part of the tp is primarily controlled by the indian monsoon in the warm season and the westerlies in the cold season that over the central to northern parts of the tp is primarily controlled by the westerlies with limited influence from the east asian monsoon yao et al 2012b these two circulation systems combined with the extensive relief induce strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the tp s climate over the past four decades climate over the tp has changed rapidly temperature on the tp has risen 0 3 0 4 c per decade which is twice the global warming rate liu et al 2000 and the warming in the northern tp is significantly greater than that in the southern tp precipitation on the tp increased significantly by 2 2 per decade kang et al 2010 over the same period precipitation in the northern tp increase while that in the southern tp decreased yao et al 2012b fig 1 illustrates the tp zones shi et al 2005 firstly the tp is divided into internal and external drainage area based on the river dividing principle and the supplying relationship between lakes and rivers external drainage area are defined as hydrological networks connected to other regions via surface runoff while internal drainage areas are independent hydrological networks external drainage areas are then subdivided into nine zones including amudarya inner east asia yellow r river yangtze r mekong r salween r brahmaputra r ganges and indus r regional difference in climate and geomorphology are used to subdivide internal drainage areas into seven zones yellow background color in fig 1 including the qinghai l lake zone ayakku l zone dogaicoring l zone bangongco zone yibugcaka zone zharinamco zone and serlingco zone each zone is named after the largest lake therein 3 data and methods 3 1 data the data used in this study include landsat images chinese topographic maps ctms the map of glaciers and lakes on the tibetan plateau and adjoining regions mgltp the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem and river network and drainage basin data from hydrosheds the landsat images and ctms were used to interpret lake boundaries maps and image specifications are detailed in table 1 the mgltp and ctms were used to obtain certain lake attributes including lakes names and type the srtm dem ctms and some images were used to delineate the catchment for every lake and construct the hydrological network 3 1 1 optical images the landsat series mutispectral scanner mss thematic mapper tm and enhanced thematic mapper plus etm images have been widely used to map lake boundaries to reduce the impact of clouds and seasonal variations the images are selected using the following criteria 1 all images used were cloud free over the lake boundary 2 the image acquisition date was from september to november that is at the end of the wet season when the lake water budget is relatively stable song et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 and 3 the maximum time between data points was two years if no data were available in a year however the coarse spatial resolution and quality of the landsat mss images necessitated the use of all available landsat mss images from 1972 to 1977 these images were used as reference data in the identification of lake boundaries in the 1970 s in total 311 landsat images from the u s geological survey usgs http govis usgs gov were used table1 of these 60 images from 2003 and 65 images from 2009 were used to analyse the change in water volume for 162 typical lakes with available icesat water level data to reduce the influence of intra annual change in a lake s surface extent all of the images from 2003 and 2009 were obtained between september and november for the same lake the difference in the date between photos was within one month of the 106 images taken in the 2010 s 90 images were obtained in september to november which represents 95 lakes the pre process procedures include geo referencing and radiometric correction those scenes that have already been systematically calibrated and geo referenced are used as references for the image to image registration of others the root mean squared errors of the rectifications are controlled within one pixel gaps in the landsat etm images are removed using the neighborhood similar pixel interpolator algorithm developed by chen et al 2011 3 1 2 maps the ctms at scale 1 100 000 are based on aerial photography during the period from 1960 to 1980 with spatial resolution of 30 m they illustrate natural geographical elements such as rivers lakes and social elements such as villages roads most of this information was verified by field surveying the geographic coordinate system is the 1954 beijing geodetic coordinate system bj54 geoid datum level is yellow sea mean sea level at qingdao tidal observatory in 1956 and the projection is 6 degree gauss kruger projection 236 topographic maps from the national geomatics center of china ngcc are used table 1 raw geo reference of these topographic maps is firstly defined and then re projected into world geodetic system 1984 wgs84 universal transverse mercator utm projection based on the corresponding landsat benchmark data the mgltp at scale 1 2 000 000 shows some mountains rivers lakes glaciers as well as the relevant geomorphology ecology and the transportation network from 70 e to 105 e and from 27 n to 45 n highlighting the distribution of water resources of glaciers and lakes yao et al 2008 geo reference for the map is defined using 55 feature points selected from the benchmark landsat data and google earth a little offset occurred at the edge of the map due to its large extent but this offset has no influence on this study since we do not use any geographic information from mgltp 3 1 3 srtm dem and hydrosheds data the srtm was launched in february 2000 by the national geospatial intelligence agency nga and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and it detected the earth s topography by the single pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique the near global 56 s 60 n srtm dem data are with liner vertical absolute height error less than 16 m and relative height error less than 10 m at 90 confidence interval farr et al 2007 the srtm dem with cell size of 87 m and latitude longitude geographic projection were free available from http srtm csi cgiar org the srtm dem data from 70 e to 105 e and from 27 n to 45 n are downloaded mosaicked and then referenced to the wgs84 horizontal datum the hydrosheds river network as riv 15s and drainage basin as bas 15s with the spatial resolution of 410 m on tp from the usgs website http hydrosheds cr usgs gov are used as a reference data to identify the internal drainage 3 2 methods 3 2 1 making the lake inventory on the tp a lake vector is an object with an independent position shape contour and size the lake boundaries on the tp in 2003 2009 and 2010 from landsat tm and etm images have been automatically determined as shown in fig 2 the raw digital number dn values in the landsat data were first converted to surface reflectance using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps version 1 2 0 feng et al 2013 the surface reflectance provides more appropriate measurements of surface properties than the original dn value or uncorrected radiance and top of atmosphere reflectance vermote et al 2002 next a two step automated method was used to identify water pixels by combing the modified normalized difference water index mndwi with digital image processing techniques jiang et al 2014 first the land and water body features were delineated using a deliberately strict threshold the unmarked pixels may be land or mixed water pixels which will be classified in the next steps second a watershed segmentation algorithm was used to determine the final lake extent the algorithm iteratively expands all typical pixels to their neighbor pixels and the final boundaries between lake and land are determined by the maximum gradient of the mndwi which is calculated via the commonly used sobel operator meyer 2012 the segmentation finishes after all of the pixels are marked as lake or land next the extracted lakes rasters are vectorized into lake polygons the lake boundaries in 1970 s and the landsat etm images with gaps are determined by manually visual interpretation based on the enhanced colour images from landsat mss and ctms finally all of the lakes were manually improved and carefully checked one by one by a single expert in this study all of the lakes over 1 km2 were detected the water bodies on the major river bed and artificial reservoirs such as liuyangxia reservoir were excluded from this review to illustrate the lake evolution small lakes around a larger lake are identified as independent if they are separated by land 3 2 2 establishing the lake hydrological network and classifying the lakes the lakes hydrological network includes the catchment of every lake and the main streams the catchments are used to describe how the runoff from rain melting snow or ice converges on a lake and the main streams revel how lakes connect to other lakes or rivers this information was derived using three procedures below fig 3 the 2000 srtm dem and 1970s ctms were used to delineate the number of catchment in 2010 each catchment is surrounded by a geographical barrier typically a mountain ridge the uplift rate in the tp was derived from several china earthquake administration stations with continuous gps measurements this rate is approximately 0 5 mm y zhang et al 2013 this small change is unlikely to have caused a change in catchment boundaries between the 1970s and 2010 1 calculating a preliminary stream network psn and drainage basin pdb forty five srtm dem tiles over the tp were merged automatic delineation including fill sinks flow direction flow accumulation stream definition stream segmentation catchment grid delineation and catchment polygon processing was applied to the merged srtm dems using arcgis archydro tools the threshold for defining streams and the catchments at plateau scale was 4000 32 km2 inappropriate search and fill process may create some artificial stream networks and basins khan et al 2014 thus manual quality control and revisions occurred to improve the psn and pdb 2 confirming the drainage links and watershed areas of the closed lakes drainage links and watershed areas were carefully identified and manually revised by a single expert one by one based on rivers and mountain ridges visible on ctms and landsat images the visual inspections were performed at a scale of 1 50 000 first the lakes psn and pdb within every closed hydrosheds drainage basin hdb were separated into independent groups within every group the lake with the lowest elevation from the srtm dem and ctms was determined to be closed within that basin the stream networks were formatted as polyline vectors and consisted of many oriented river segment routes running from one node with higher elevation to another with lower elevation using each closed lake as a starting point we upward tracked the psn from lower elevation to higher elevation until the boundary of the watershed to confirm the drainage links and identify the independent stream network in some flat area located mostly in the center of the lake basins psn cannot be extracted accurately and only some parallel lines appear we deleted these lines and re delineated the river segment roads from the closed lake to the psn in the light of the rivers in the ctms which include most of the main streams meanwhile we found some connected segments were divided into different parts by the hdb these segments were carefully identified based on the ctms and landsat images if the connection really exists the connected neighboring psns and pdbs were looked as a new group the closed lake determination and stream network identification were iterated and the inaccurate hdb was marked if not the false segments were deleted especially the rivers connected with lake were checked to confirm whether they are the input or output according to the elevation difference and the river orientation after the independent stream network was identified we merged the pdbs covered the independent stream network into a single closed lake catchment and then the next independent group was checked until all the groups were done 3 classifying the other lakes as upstream or outflow lakes and identifying their drainage links and sub catchment within every closed lake catchment all other lakes with the higher elevation than the closed lake were defined as the upstream lakes qiao and zhu 2017 this occurred even for lakes where a seasonal river was the only connection between two adjacent lakes in this case the lake type was defined based on the seasonal stream s orientation in the independent stream network the intersection between every upstream lake and output river was pointed manually all pdbs found to drain into a given intersection point were merged as sub catchment of its corresponding upstream lake all lakes outside of the closed lakes catchments were defined as the outflow lakes similar with the mentioned method first the rivers connected with the outflow lake were checked to confirm whether they are the input or output according to the elevation and the river orientation we began this check from the outflow lake with the lowest elevation because some outflow lakes also have their upstream lakes since the runoff from the upstream lakes of the outflow lakes eventually flows into a river and the ocean we also defined them as the outflow lakes using the outflow lake as a starting point we upward tracked the psn to confirm and revise the drainage links meanwhile we downward tracked the psn to confirm that the output river finally merges into the outflow river and then the intersection between every outflow lake and output river was pointed manually all pdbs found to drain into a given intersection point were merged as sub catchment of its corresponding outflow lake here we found some lakes were misclassified as the outflow lakes because these lakes have no outlet but the hdb dataset were not identified them then we redefined them and rebuilt the catchment and stream network according to the above mentioned method for the closed lake and upstream lake 56 upstream lakes and 78 outflow lakes were found to have no sub catchments as they were less than 32 km2 to identify sub catchments within these catchments we clipped the merged srtm dem to a smaller range and ran the hydro process again using a smaller threshold catchments for an additional 18 upstream lakes and 7 outflow lakes were delineated manually using the ctms these catchments were less than 10 km2 and were primarily associated with glacier lakes 3 2 3 calculating the lake water volume change lake water volume change can be modelled by combing time series for a given lake area and water level change rate song et al 2013 lake water volume change is calculated as 1 Œ¥ w s i 1 s i h i 1 h i d s d h s i s i 1 2 h i h i 1 s i s i 1 2 r h t where Œ¥w is the water volume change during the period from i to i 1 s i and s i 1 is the lake surface area at i and i 1 respectively and h i and h i 1 represent the water level at i and i 1 respectively rh is the water level change rate and t is the time period from i to i 1 the geoscience laser altimeter system glas on board the ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat can be used to obtain time series of lake water levels with decimeter accuracy the available icesat data for the tp and a linear regression analysis were previously used to developed two published datasets that indicate water level change rates for 117 lakes over 10 km2 from 2003 to 2009 song et al 2013 as well as those of 154 lakes over 1 km2 phan et al 2012 in this study we use these reported water level change rates to calculate the water volume change from 2003 to 2009 the reported lakes can be easily located using the coordinates provided in these datasets 4 results and discussion 4 1 the hydrological network and classification of lakes fig 4 shows the catchments and distribution of lakes on the tp in 2010 1202 lakes with a total area of 46 258 96 km2 were identified on the tp including 397 33 closed lakes 488 41 upstream lakes and 317 26 outflow lakes these lake types accounted for a total area of 35 498 49 km2 77 7 378 18 km2 16 and 3 382 29 km2 7 respectively table2 of the 397 closed lakes 234 59 were not connected to upstream lakes the remaining 163 41 closed lakes were linked to one or more of the 488 upstream lakes 93 of closed lakes and 96 of upstream lakes were located within the internal drainage area while all outflow lakes were identified in an external drainage area within the external drainage area the number of lakes associated with the yangtze r basin 109 lakes and brahmaputra r basin 103 lakes exceeded those identified in other regions and the average area of lakes in the yellow r basin 38 2 km2 was greater than that for any other external drainage area within the internal drainage area the average area of lakes in the qinghai l zone was greatest and reached 156 6 km2 the average area of lakes in the serlingco zone ayakku l zone zharinamco zone and bangongco zone was 66 0 km2 61 8 km2 60 8 km2 and 43 2 km2 respectively in the central dogaicoring l zone and yibugcaka zone the average area of lakes was 18 3 km2 and 17 4 km2 respectively these latter values were low given the relatively large number of lakes existed in these two regions 197 and 140 lakes this indicates that most of the larger lakes are located in the surrounding region while many small lakes are found within the tp fig 5 shows the differences between the closed catchment identified using the hydrosheds data and this dataset as well as examples of the primary drainage links and sub catchments within independent basins of the 397 closed lakes 358 lakes had similar boundaries in both the hdb and manually derived dataset with minor differences in details see the example in fig 5b these differences were likely due to the spatial resolution of the hdb and the fact that the new drainage basins blue line had a higher spatial resolution 90 m relative to the hdb 410 m red line the other 39 hdbs generally contained four types of errors a the hdbs include some false edges an example in fig 5c green lines these were identified by comparing the hdbs to the ctms and deleting the inaccurate edges b 19 closed lakes and their catchments including bangongco maindongco fig 5d yamzhogyumco chemco bajuco and chiguco fig 5e were not identified using the hdb dataset we constructed these catchments using the psn and pdb c small channels occasionally existed between two nearby lakes however the hdb resolution resulted in these lakes being combined into one for the purposes of this study these lakes were combined for example the dorsoidongco and migriggyangzhamco basins shown in fig 5f and d 18 catchments were divided into multiple parts due to the inaccurate classification of segments for example in the hdb an inaccurate segment divides the serlingco basin into two however we know that this southeastern river is one of three tributaries within the serlingco basin fig 5 g two cases representing inaccurate lake linkage identification within the dorsoidongco migriggyangzhamco d m and serlingco basins are shown in fig 6 dorsoidongco and migriggyangzhamco are considered independent lakes with their own drainage basins the red line in fig 6a in the hydrosheds data however the ctm mapping based on aerial photography from october 1969 fig 6b revealed that a seasonal channel existed between these two adjacent lakes and a seasonal country road passed through the channel between the 1970 s and 2010 the area of these two lakes reached a minimum in 1996 at that time this small channel still existed fig 6c with the expansion of these two lakes an obvious channel formed approximately 2002 fig 6d and the dam that separated these two lakes became more narrow fig 6e the dam had almost disappeared by 2010 fig 6f thus we identified these two lakes as one lake and merged the pdbs of these two lakes using the boundary in fig 5f black line fig 6g l shows the inaccurate division of serlingco based on the hydrosheds data the serlingco drainage basin is defined as the red boundary in fgiure6g however the ctm mapping based on aerial photography from october 1970 fig 6h showed that the river zhagen zangbu connects urruco and serlingco the mean elevations of urruco and serlingco were 4547 m and 4530 m respectively in 1970 and 4553 m and 4539 m respectively in 2000 the water in urruco flows into serlingco through the river zhagen zangbu to confirm that this connection has always exsited four landsat images from 1976 1991 2000 and 2011 were analysed then the urruco and serlingco pdbs were modified and the boundary of serlingco derived black boundary in fgiure5g phan et al 2013 created drainage links between tibetan glaciers lakes and rivers based on a glacier mask modis mod44w water product and hydrosheds river networks there are two primary differences between phan s drainage links and the dataset in this study first phan s dataset is based on 891 lakes from the 250 m modis mod44w water product while the dataset in this study is based on 1197 lakes identified using 30 m landsat images due to the relative higher spatial resolution of the landsat images more lakes can be identified second phan s drainage links were primarily identified based on the hydrosheds river network while the dataset in this study revised the base drainage network using ctms and multi period remote sensing images zhang et al 2014 reported that the number and area of lakes over 1 km2 on the tp and surroundings were 1236 and 47 366 km2 in 2010 the comparison between these two datasets suggests that the difference between the two datasets stems from the definition and interpretation of lakes first some water bodies 257 km2 on the major rivers channels were not counted in the present study including the brahmaputra r and some artificial reservoirs such as liujiaxia reservoir 363 km2 second islands within lakes such as the island within the yamzhog yumco 33 km2 were ignored the most significant difference stemmed from different interpretation of salt lakes 430 km2 in the present study we did not include dry lakes or areas that are now dry or only covered by salt 4 2 variations in surface extent change between three lake types from 1970s to 2010 the driving mechanism of lake change is a complex combination of multiple climate factors meanwhile the variations in different lakes may be affected by their own hydrological processes changes in closed lakes upstream lakes and outflow lakes from the 1970 s to 2010 were summarized in fig 7 most of the closed lakes 91 upstream lakes 85 and outflow lakes 75 expanded during the time frame increasing by 5 710 6 km2 939 3 km2 and 367 8 km2 respectively the number of expanding closed lakes 3 6 2 and upstream lakes 4 1 3 is comparable while the increase in area of the closed lakes was 6 1 times that of the upstream lakes and 15 5 times that of the outflow lakes on the other hand 35 closed lakes 70 upstream lakes and 76 outflow lakes shrank during the study period with decrease decline of 345 9 km2 65 2 km2 and 90 5 km2 respectively the larger lakes were generally associated with greater changes in area however fig 7b indicates that lake size is not the only factor that affects lake area change 54 of expanding closed lakes exhibited an area increase over 5 km2 while only 10 2 of expanding upstream lakes and 4 of expanding outflow lakes exhibited increase of that size fig 7b this indicates that the surface area changes expanding or shrinking of closed lakes are more noticeable than those of upstream lakes and outflow lakes as mentioned above 163 closed lakes are supplied by 488 upstream lakes to further clarify whether changes in the closed lakes occurs more rapidly than those of their corresponding upstream lakes we divided these lakes into 163 groups each group includes one closed lake and their corresponding upstream lakes from the 1970s to 2010 16 closed lakes shrank while the other 147 expanded representing a changed area of 108 2 km2 to 679 0 km2 fig 8 compares 82 groups of closed lakes and their corresponding upstream lakes the others are not included due to the relatively smaller changed area of 1 3 km2 to 9 5 km2 fig 8a indicates that the decreased in the areas of qinghai l and yamzhogyumco were far greater than those of their corresponding upstream lakes and the other six closed lakes also shrank more than their corresponding upstream lakes fig 8b d reveal greater expansions of closed lakes relative to their corresponding upstream lakes with the area increase from 10 4 km2 to114 6 km2 the top four expanding closed lakes are serlingco ayakkuh l dorsoidongco and dogaicoringqangco which increased by 679 0 km2 323 3 km2 150 5 km2 and 149 2 km2 respectively the change in area for their corresponding upstream lakes was much less than that of the closed lakes with a changed area of 1 9 km2 to 11 2 km2 0 5 km2 to 9 5 km2 0 3 km2 to 4 9 km2 and 0 1 km2 to 10 8 km2 respectively these comparisons show that no matter the change mode and intensity of the closed lakes the upstream lakes remained relatively stable some previous studies have compared changes in lake serlingco silingco to those in congoin co e the two lakes are within one kilometer of one another and have similar climate conditions including precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration serlingco has expanded dramatically whereas congoin has remained relatively stable it is inferred that the critical reason for this difference is that congoin is not supplemented by glacial melt water while serlingco is meng et al 2012 song et al 2014 however this inference does not take into account the drainage type of these two lakes the hydrological network developed in this study indicates that serlingco is a closed lake while congoin is an upstream lake that feeds into serlingco fig 5g thus water from conogoin flows into serlingco through the yunzhugzangbo river the connection between the closed lake and its corresponding upstream lakes likely impacted the dramatic expansion of serlingco and the stability of congoin 4 3 variations in water level surface extent and water volume change in three lake types from 2003 to 2009 two published datasets provide information on the changes in water level of some tp lakes from 2003 to 2009 of the 154 lakes studied by phan et al 2012 89 were closed lakes 41 were upstream lakes 18 were outflow lakes and six lakes were unidentified of the 117 lakes studied by song et al 2013 87 were closed lakes 24 were upstream lakes five were outflow lakes and one was unidentified fig 9 a and d illustrate the water level change rate of these three types of lakes the average change rate of closed lakes upstream lakes and outflow lakes is 0 23 m y 0 25 m y 0 10 m y 0 13 m y 0 10 m y 0 11 m y respectively per phan et al 2012 song et al 2013 the average change rate of the closed lakes is almost two times greater than that of the upstream lakes small differences in the water level change rate of the same lake may exist between these two datasets for example serlingco has the maximum water level increase of 0 68 m y vs 0 63 m y this may be the result of the differences in the lakes elevation data or the noise removal and filtering methods employed song et al 2013 however these minor differences do not affect the trend comparison fig 9b c e and f show the changed area and volume of the examined closed upstream and outflow lakes from 2003 to 2009 respectively most of the closed lakes have an area that fluctuates by approximately 5 while the upstream lakes and outflow lakes remain relatively stable during this period the average changed volume of the closed lakes upstream lakes and outflow lakes is 0 42 109 m3 0 40 109 m3 0 04 109 m3 0 06 109 m3 0 07 109 m3 0 20 109 m3 respectively the changed volume of the closed lakes is almost six to ten times greater than that of the upstream lakes comparing closed lake with their corresponding upstream lakes in the same basin can provide a more direct evidence of these changes the water level change rate of 10 closed lakes with 20 corresponding upstream lakes and eight closed lakes with 12 corresponding upstream lakes can be obtained from phan et al 2012 and song et al 2013 respectively among these 18 groups eight groups represent the same closed lakes while some of the corresponding upstream lakes vary fig 10 a and d illustrates the water level change rates for these groups and indicate that six and three upstream lakes respectively have a greater change rate than their supplied closed lakes however all of these upstream lakes remain relatively unchanged in surface extent while the closed lake undergo greater changes in area and have strong spatial heterogeneity fig 10b and e thus these closed lakes have obviously greater water volume change than their corresponding upstream lakes fig 10c and f 4 4 case studies seasonal change in closed lake and upstream lake two case studies can be used to compare the seasonal change in area for closed lake and their corresponding upstream lakes mermaco and aruco dorsoidongco and rumuchenco the mermaco basin 34 22 n 82 31 e is located in the northwest of the internal drainage area of the tp and has an area of 159 24 km2 there is only one upstream lake in this basin aruco which has an area of 105 42 km2 fig 11 a from the 1970 s to 2010 the area of mermaco increases by 21 10 km2 13 3 while that of aruco increased by 0 33 km2 0 3 from 2003 to 2009 the water level area and volume change of mermaco and aruco were 0 48 m y 1 66 km2 y 0 43 109 m3 and 0 03 m y 0 03 km2 y and 0 02 109 m3 respectively mermaco and aruco both begin to freeze in november mermaco melts completely by june of the following year while aruco melts by may the closed lake mermaco has expanded steadily and exhibits a seasonal increase during the non frozen period from july to october fig 11b the change in non frozen period accounts for 30 80 of the change throughout the year meanwhile the upstream lake aruco exhibits almost no seasonal and annual fluctuation fig 11c the dorsoidongco basin is located at 33 43 n 90 07 e in the east of the internal drainage area of the tp and has an area of 1032 19 km2 it has nine upstream lakes however only rumuchenco has a water level change rate available in icesat this lake has an area of 33 74 km2 from the 1970 s to 2010 dorsoidongco increased by 150 49 km2 14 6 while rumuchenco increased by 3 18 km2 9 4 from 2003 to 2009 the water level area and volume change in dorsoidongco and rumuchenco was 0 53 m y 11 02 km2 y and 3 15 109 m3 and 0 27 m y 0 35 km2 y and 0 05 109 m3 respectively these two lakes both begin to freeze in november and melt in may next year the closed lake dorsoidongco has expanded steadily and there is an apparent seasonal increase during the non frozen period from june to october which account for 74 97 of the change each year fig 11e meanwhile the inter annual area change of the upstream lake rumuchenco exhibited an increasing trend similar to that of dorsoidongco from 2006 to 2009 although the absolute change was less than 1 5 km2 furthermore the upstream lake values fluctuates in the non frozen period but remained stable in the frozen period fig 11f the intra annual changes in rumuchenco were similar to those identified for dorsoidongco in 2003 2007 and 2009 these two case studies indicate that the seasonal and annual change of a closed lake may be linked to climate change on the other hand while the seasonal and annual changes in upstream lakes may sometimes reflect climate change they are more often constrained by the lakeshore terrain and drainage characteristics 5 conclusion researchers understanding of hydrological characteristic of lakes on the tp is insufficient which limits studies interested in the lake climate relationships a hydrological network of lakes on the tp was developed to show how runoff converges to a lake and how lake connect to one another or rivers downstream according to the hydrological network derived in this study lakes can be classified as closed upstream or outflow lake this study indicates that there are 397 closed lakes 488 upstream lakes and 317 outflow lakes over 1 km2 on the tp with an area of 35 498 49 km2 7 378 18 km2 and 3 382 29 km2 respectively in 2010 234 closed lakes are independent and not associated with upstream lakes the remaining 163 closed lakes are supplied by the 488 upstream lakes 93 closed lakes and 96 upstream lakes are located in the internal drainage area of the tp while all of the outflow lakes are located in the external drainage area most of the larger lakes are located in the surrounding region while the majority of small lakes are in the interior region in the internal drainage area of the tp closed upstream and outflow lakes have different drainage modes the comparison and object oriented analyses indicate that changes in the surface extent of closed lakes are more apparent than those of upstream lakes and outflow lakes the increase in area of the closed lakes is 6 1 times that of the upstream lakes and 15 5 times that of the outflow lakes although the number of expanding closed lakes and upstream lakes is comparable 362 vs 413 the closed lake and their corresponding upstream lakes in a given basin show distinct changes although their hydro meteorological conditions are similar the object oriented analyses further prove that no matter the mode or intensity of the closed lake changes the upstream lakes remain relatively stable based on the water level change rate of two published datasets and the lake areas in 2003 and 2009 changes in lake water volume were calculated and analysed from 2003 to 2009 most of the closed lake areas fluctuated by approximately 5 while the upstream lakes and outflow lakes remained relatively stable the water level change rate of the closed lakes is almost two times greater than that of the upstream lakes while the volume change of the closed lakes is almost nine times greater than that of the upstream lakes the comparison between the closed lakes and their corresponding upstream lakes further confirms that all the examined closed lakes have an obviously greater volume change than their corresponding upstream lakes even if some of the closed lakes have less water level change two case studies compare the seasonal area change between closed lakes and their corresponding upstream lakes mermaco and aruco are located in the northwest and dorsoidongco and rumuchenco are located in the east of the internal drainage area of the tp from the 1970 s to 2010 these two closed lake basins exhibited more rapid increases in area than their upstream counterparts from 2003 to 2009 these two closed lakes exhinbited greater water levels area and water storage changes than their upstream counterparts these two closed lakes continued to expand steadily and exhibited a seasonal increase during the non frozen period from june to october however the changes exhibited by their associated upstream lakes were different aruco exhibited almost no seasonal and annual fluctuation while rumuchenco exhibited similar seasonal and annual fluctuation to its closed lake counterpart in some years but not others thus the changes experienced by the closed lakes may be a reflection of climate change while those of the upstream lakes may be limited by the lakeshore terrain and drainage characteristics compared to upstream and outflow lake closed lakes are the terminal point in a regional water cycle and thus a resultant response to regional climate change as a result the change process within closed lakes is much more apparent and significant to quantify the lake climate relationship researchers should investigate whether and how different lakes are connected as well as classify and discuss these lakes separately the hydrological network and relationship between lakes in this study supports a better understanding of lake responses to climate change on the tp and

ecoregions indicate that the methodology proposed here adequately partitions et keywords tracer aided modelling evapotranspiration partitioning stable water isotopes data scarce seasonal watersheds 1 introduction evaporation e and transpiration t are intricately linked components of the water cycle that affect water storage in watersheds worldwide large changes in water abundance due to climate change may affect both vegetation growth and type and water storage sugimoto et al 2002 in mid to high latitude watersheds increasing temperatures are likely to increase storage lengthen growing seasons and increase evapotranspiration et rates woo 1992 however these changes will unequally affect the timing and relative rates of e and t abtew and melesse 2013 calanca et al 2006 the uncoupled temporal variance of e and t is problematic for hydrologic models simulating e and t as a single lumped component et in regions most prone to changing rates of e and t mid to high latitude watersheds there is limited available data to independently estimate e and t fluxes therefore to improve the understanding of the effects of temporal variations of e and t on water availability using hydrologic models temporal partitioning of the et flux is essential while a number of different measurement techniques for et e and t have been developed kool et al 2014 the techniques are generally data intensive and limited to smaller field scales et e and t have also been estimated using amongst others the monteith equation meteorological and vegetation observations monteith 1965 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the sweat model soil and canopy air resistances daamen and simmonds 1996 the enwatbal model canopy and soil energy balance lascano et al 1987 the hydrus 1d model canopy and soil energy balance balugani et al 2017 simunek et al 2009 and soil surface temperature moran et al 2009 in addition to the complex methods above simpler estimation and measurement methods have been used to estimate global scale et partitions using independent measures of two of the three components of et e t or et wang et al 2014 synthesized a relationship of t et to measured leaf area index the global

approach with measurements of the isotopic composition of et Œ¥et t xylem water or root uptake Œ¥x Œ¥t evaporative vapour Œ¥e and the rate of et flux sutanto et al 2012 yepez et al 2003 zhang et al 2010 the fluxes of e and t from et are estimated by rearranging the vapour mass balance however the isotopic et end members et e and t are difficult to measure and numerous methods have been developed to estimate the isotopic composition of each component methods for estimating the end members include the craig gordon model for Œ¥ e craig and gordon 1965 leaf resistance and leaf area index methods for Œ¥ t farquhar and cernusak 2005 hu et al 2014 and the keeling plot keeling 1960 lu et al 2017 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 and flux gradient method for Œ¥ et hu et al 2014 wen et al 2016 while such models can adequately reproduce measured end members the models have large data requirements and hence application is generally not feasible at meso or macro scales et from macro scale watersheds has been partitioned on long term data sets using stable isotope measurements of surface water jasechko et al 2013 applied long term watershed scale mass balances worldwide to assess spatial

to isolate the isotope ratio of marine water and subsequently identify the continental fluxes of et and t producing a global t et of 56 74 assuming d h is not affected by t lastly a recent large scale study on the tibetan plateau has used high temporal resolution stream water to partition et with hydrograph separation guo et al 2017 despite the success of large scale et estimation methods these methods do not account for temporal variability fatichi and pappas 2017 good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 wang et al 2014 or require high frequency isotopic sampling guo et al 2017 and therefore have limited application to hydrologic models of high latitude or data scarce regions the goal of this study was to develop a method to estimate a temporally variable watershed average et partition that is suitable for implementation in operational tracer aided hydrologic models of the data required for tracer aided hydrologic models the et partition method requires only precipitation and riverine compositions of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h for calibration the et partitioning model is developed in three steps first by simulating riverine isotopic composition assuming et is fully non fractionating in unsaturated soil storage and wetland storage but accounting for open water fractionation second by conducting hydrograph separation and identifying the required enrichment in the simulated isotopic composition in storage to the observed riverine isotopic composition and third by using required enrichment and model inputs to empirically estimate the et partition application of the empirical model to four northern canadian watersheds over a multi year period is used to identify the temporal variability of the et partition in these watersheds 2 site description and data collection the study watersheds are located on the canadian shield in north central manitoba canada above 50 n fig 1 four watersheds were selected based on geographic location physiographic differences land cover and the availability of isotopic and discharge data the drainage areas of the watersheds span the meso scale spectrum from small 410 km2 to large 6109 km2 table 1 2 1 land cover and surficial geology low watershed topographic relief results in a landscape with high open water and wetland percentages including headwater lakes in stream lakes and connected and disconnected wetlands table 1 welch et al 2018 the watersheds are primarily differentiated by vegetation coverage the vegetation of the odei and sapochi river watersheds are the most similar of the four watersheds differing only in the coverage of open water and shrubs high percentages of wetlands in the gunisao river watershed are noticeable departures from the dominant coverage of shrub and broadleaf forests present in other watersheds within each watershed the density of vegetation coverage is highly variable ranging from dense mixed vegetation to exposed bedrock field surveys and surface imagery indicate that the wetlands are comprised of a mixture of trees shrubs open water and peat moss and that the understory of some forested regions may be primarily comprised of peat moss silt till clay and organic materials are the dominant soil types of the watersheds and are underlain by precambrian bedrock geogratis 2016 the proportion of each soil type spatially varies within each watershed due to physiographic features e g distance from lake winnipeg and topographic slope and depositional processes from glaciation the depth of soil to bedrock is spatially variable within and between watersheds ranging from zero exposed bedrock to greater than 18 m flynn et al 2016 of the four watersheds the burntwood river watershed has the highest proportion of rock outcrops and underlying till and the highest open water coverage 2 2 climate precipitation over the watershed was measured at environment and climate change canada eccc weather stations and supplemented with estimated gridded precipitation in particular the large distance from the burntwood river watershed to the closest measurement location flin flon necessitated the use of gridded precipitation the north american regional reanalysis narr and canadian precipitation analysis capa precipitation values within the burntwood river are relatively similar to the measurements at flin flon when both are availabe climate data collection commenced at thompson airport in 1967 at cross lake jenpeg in 1967 at norway house in 2005 and at flin flon in 1927 eccc 2016a while temperature was collected at each station from the beginning of its operation at two locations cross lake jenpeg and flin flon precipitation measurement began in subsequent years recent precipitation measurements were obtained using automated total precipitation weighing gauges while older precipitation measurements were obtained using tipping bucket rain gauges eccc 2016a temperature and dew point temperature were recorded and measured on an hourly basis at the same location as precipitation though dew point temperature was not available at all gauging stations table 2 the climate of all watersheds is continental sub arctic july and august are the wettest months with an average 178 mm to 203 mm of rainfall most snowfall occurs in november and march 42 mm to 52 mm total snow water equivalent warmer temperatures in transition months april may and october result in mixed liquid solid precipitation events 29 91 monthly rain precipitation ratio and signal the beginning and end of the growing season may to september 150 days although the growing season occasionally extends into april and october hall 2001 myneni et al 1997 approximately one third of annual precipitation is received as snow table 2 eccc 2016a b large differences in total annual precipitation between watersheds primarily occur due to differences in snowfall table 2 2 3 sample collection and analysis river water samples were collected from the watershed outlets of the gunisao and burntwood rivers beginning in 2010 and sapochi and odei rivers in 2011 grab samples were collected from shore approximately 30 cm below the water surface using a retractable sampling pole site accessibility limited sample collection frequency however samples encompassed high and low precipitation years precipitation samples were collected as composite samples at thompson service center jenpeg generating station and notigi control structure on average 12 5 and 6 times per year respectively the composite samples represent a volume weighted average of precipitation since the last sample date incorporating short term variability and seasonality of the precipitation isotopic compositions groundwater samples were collected at the same locations 22 5 and 4 times per year respectively details of the sampling program are presented in smith et al 2015 all water samples were analyzed for Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h using a mass spectrometer by innotech alberta and compared to vienna standard mean ocean water 2 vsmow2 with precision of 0 2 per mille for Œ¥18o and 1 for Œ¥2h 2 4 flow regime of the watersheds the annual hydrograph is defined by two peak events a freshet may and june and a late summer or early autumn rainfall peak august and september in nearly a third of the years on record large late season precipitation events result in discharge events larger than the freshet the watersheds have over 20 years of daily observed discharge sapochi 22 years odei 36 years burntwood 30 years and gunisao 44 years hydrometric data were collected by environment and climate change canada using in stream pressure transducers eccc 2016b stream gauging was conducted multiple times per year and stage discharge curves adjusted when necessary three of four watersheds sapochi odei and burntwood river observed their highest discharge in 2005 and lowest in 2003 minimum and maximum discharge was observed in the gunisao river in 1993 and 2010 respectively the boxplots show variability of discharge throughout the sampling years and the responsiveness of each watershed to snowmelt and rainfall isotopic sampling years in the sapochi and odei rivers boxplots and red dashed line capture average discharge variability the sapochi river fig 2 b has the largest number of outliers relative to the other watersheds indicating that the watersehd is the most responsive high responsiveness is also observed at the odei river outlet fig 2h though slightly less due to its larger watershed size despite similar watershed drainage area the burntwood river fig 2h has relatively stable annual discharge compared to the odei river due to a greater proportion of lakes which attenuate discharge lastly the gunisao river fig 2d is the least responsive likely resulting from high wetland coverage relative to the burntwood and odei river watersheds of similar size the gunisao river has high inter annual variability of the interquartile range iqr this indicates that the gunisao river discharge is largely dependent on annual precipitation and has shorter storage residence times average discharge since 2000 has been greater than historical average 1971 2015 coinciding with greater than average precipitation in the region 3 evapotranspiration partition model development isotopic composition and discharge are simulated using the hydrological evapotranspiration partition lumped isotopic simulation helios model developed in the numerical mathematical software matlab helios is a sub basin lumped model that expands a previously developed model umswim university of manitoba stable water isotope model smith et al 2016 by improving representation of et and catchment storages and incorporating the simulation of Œ¥2h helios consists of individual modules for discharge and isotopic simulations evaporative fractionation of water was applied to storages undergoing significant evaporation open water and near surface storages calibration is conducted using a multi step approach to directly address isotopic equifinality identify the temporal variability of the et partition and calibrate the et partition model the initial model calibration prevents wetland and soil water evaporative fractionation and permits only open water fractionation this ensures that isotopic compositions in storage and within the stream are not over enriched prior to soil and wetland evaporative fractionation the resulting simulations are then assessed for periods of under enrichment within the stream these periods are used to identify the required evaporative enrichment in storage to correctly estimate stream isotopic compositions finally the amount of required enrichment is used to inform the temporal partition of et 3 1 hydrologic

using tracer aided watershed modelling exploits the difference between Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h fractionation using the discharge isotopic composition at the outlet since modelled isotopic compositions of water

however be influenced by i precipitation composition ii relative humidity rh eqs b 1 b 3 and iii temporal changes in the et rate these dependencies must be removed from re to obtain a direct comparison to et the influence of precipitation and rh isotopic compositions on storage isotopic compositions are dependent on storage volume and flux which may change in time and with parameter sets the influence of precipitation isotopic composition may be removed from re by subtracting the normalized average annual precipitation isotopic composition the effect of rh on storage is estimated

eq b 1 to estimate the change in isotopic composition gef c f c o subtracting gef yields the required enrichment due to e fluxes rev lastly temporal et trends are subtracted from rev the ratio of rev to et provides a general ratio of e to et e et there are three potential scenarios of et partitioning using rev i max rev max et ii max rev min et and iii et constant in the first scenario the greatest e et occurs when the et rate is the highest the second scenario is the inverse of the first the greatest e et occurs at the lowest et rate finally when et is constant the greatest e et occurs at max re 3 6 identifying the relationship of simulated required enrichment to meteorological variables meteorological conditions control the total fluxes of e and t establishing a relationship of e et to meteorological variables enables identification of a temporally variable relationship between e and t the general relationship of e et to any meteorological variable is described as 10 e et f v

fraction e g groundwater prior to identification of rev source removal of groundwater and normalizing between zero and one revealed non linear annual changes in dre fig 5 the dre increased rapidly during spring and early summer and reached a maximum at the end of summer august as there were insufficient measurements to directly develop a significant interannual relationship to meteorological

against meteorological variables temperature relative humidity wind speed and atmospheric pressure for each watershed reveals that the strongest relationship is to temperature change r2 values 0 61 0 87 fig 5 for each watershed the inverse relationships of e et to temperature follow a power function the regressions only provide general temporal trends because they are not specific to storage volume or mass changes i e isotopic precipitation and rh effects total e isotopic fractionation is dependent on storage therefore the magnitude between the extreme e et and minimum e et are not known until calibration of discharge and isotopic compositions is completed e et can be estimated from temperature using a power function fig 5 independent of units 12 e et f t t ma sc lim t 0 f t d n e

sensitivity analysis indicated that the realistic parameter range for ma was 0 1 to 2 and for sc between 0 and 1 when ma is less than 2 variability is so large that e et is binary only 0 or 1 with the consideration of additional meteorological variables in addition to temperature parameter ranges may be established by fitting the function e g eq 11 to non changing e et d e et dt 0 to allow for changes in e et as a result of storage e g eq a 20 and to the maximum e et change max d e et dt 1 since the change in e et cannot be greater than the range of e et 0 1 the et partition model based on temperature eq 13 was applied to three storages within the helios model wetlands unsaturated soils and ponded water helios was calibrated and evaluated using simultaneous discharge and isotopic observations the influence of ponded water in previous studies sutanto et al 2012 prompted the use of a different partition from unsaturated soils calibration was evaluated using the minimization function in section 3 4 eq 1 and nash sutcliffe and kling gupta of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h nse18 nse2 kge18 and kge2 discharge and isotopic composition was calibrated using dds with 20 trials of 2000 runs 40 000 total runs from 2000 to 2014 2015 was simulated as the validation period the parameter set with the lowest value within the minimization function from each trial was assumed to be behavioral and used in analysis uncertainty bounds were determined using the upper and lower bound of all behavioral parameter sets 4 application to field sites 4 1 helios model performance and source contributions simulations of calibrated discharge generally agreed with measured streamflow discharge when the et partition model was applied table 4 the discharge efficiency criteria nse kge were slightly higher for discharge only calibration 0 1 greater section 3 4 than the tracer aided calibration however tracer aided calibration resulted in a reduction of behavioral parameters not shown observed discharge was generally within the uncertainty bounds of all behavioral simulations at the outlets fig 6 spring and summer peak flow events were generally well captured by simulations however some events were overestimated in the sapochi river overestimation typically occurred during low intensity multi day rainfall events 2012 2013 fig 6a in the gunisao and burntwood rivers overestimation occurred due to high precipitation events 2011 fig 6b c simulated winter flows were generally representative of the observed discharge despite proportionally higher uncertainty in all watersheds while the burntwood river simulations overestimated winter flows in three isotopic years fig 6c this was not typical of all simulation years 2000 2010 not shown although the uncertainty bounds captured the observed discharge of the recession limb higher uncertainty of source contribution i e connected wetlands and groundwater resulted in an ambiguous shape of the simulated recession limb the volume of snowmelt was low in 2013 relative to the amount of precipitation received during winter when compared to other years the underestimation was likely due to overestimation of sublimation during the winter and e during a longer than average snowmelt period simulations of calibrated streamflow isotopic compositions were temporally comparable to measured streamflow isotopic compositions when the et partition model was applied table 4 fig 7 the simulations of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h were essentially equivalent for kge kge18 was 0 76 and kge2 was 0 75 mean efficiency of the simulations for all watersheds while Œ¥18o evaluated better for nse18 nse18 was 0 56 and nse2 was 0 52 mean efficiency of the simulations for all watersheds table 4 in particular tight uncertainty bounds were obtained in simulations during the e seasons the model replicated the observed isotopic depletion induced by snowmelt in all years except 2013 underestimation of snowmelt in 2013 led to over enriched riverine isotopic composition throughout the remainder of the year and resulted in decreased nse for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o the validation year 2015 uncertainty bounds captured the isotopic composition in three of four watersheds sapochi odei and burntwood indicating appropriate e and evaporative fractionation estimation in contrast enrichment appeared to be vastly overestimated in the gunisao river such extreme enrichment was not observed in other simulated years and was likely the result of limited isotopic precipitation samples 2 which were largely enriched these samples were applied as representative composite precipitation input throughout the year no further samples collected which most likely did not capture seasonal variation on average fractionation dependent storages unsaturated soils and connected wetlands accounted for 45 75 of total watershed discharge table 4 connected wetlands accounted for 53 73 of the fractionation dependent storage flux overland flow was a large source contribution in each watershed however contributions were temporally limited to high input events i e snowmelt and precipitation hence the proportion of total discharge contributed by overland flux was often lower than indicated in table 4 disconnected wetland contribution was a relatively small portion of the watershed discharge similar to overland flow disconnected wetland contribution only occurred during high input events and was generally restricted to snowmelt and late season precipitation groundwater contribution was relatively consistent throughout the year but was a greater proportion of streamflow during winter months when only groundwater and connected wetlands discharged to the channels the uncertainty of connected wetland and groundwater contribution was greatest during recession limbs not shown this was likely due to inter annual changes in freezing depths of wetlands and shallow ground freezing is assumed binary in storage frozen or unfrozen on average the simulated peak et rate during the summer months was between 1 7 and 2 5 mm day for each of the watersheds 4 2 evapotranspiration partition trend the watershed wide partition of e et was determined from flux weighted unsaturated soil and wetland storage partitions fig 8 the e et trend followed a general parabolic shape for each storage with a higher e et during the spring april and may and autumn september and october and lower during the summer june to august when t dominated in three of the four watersheds e et was lowest in june july for the other watershed e et was highest for ponded water when present in all watersheds and in three of the four watersheds wetland storage e et was greater than unsaturated soil e et partition parameters ma and sc were very similar for the sapochi burntwood and odei rivers likely because of similar physiography and land cover table 1 appendix c the gunisao had much higher e et throughout the year than the other watersheds and was less variable for example in summer the upper uncertainty bound for e et was approximately 0 4 in the gunisao river watershed compared to approximately 0 2 in the three other watersheds high intra annual variability of the monthly partition was observed for each fractionating storage and watershed wide e et averaged from 2000 to 2015 fig 8 the watershed wide e et was highly dependent on the volume of unsaturated soil storage within the sapochi odei and burntwood watersheds while watershed wide et partition in the gunisao was equally dependent on unsaturated soil and wetland storage variability was the greatest in the spring and autumn when et rates and temperatures varied the most inter annually despite higher temperatures in august the lowest e et partitions were generally observed in june the timing of the lowest e et partition was consistent with the timing of vegetation budding increased e et later in the year august and september coincided with the largest precipitation events as well as the beginning of abscission the higher e et upper bounds of the box plots resulted from increased presence of ponded water highest e et appendix c and increased estimated intercepted e due to more consistent contribution to intercepted water storage eqs a 14 a 17 during the growing season june august the average et partition varied from 0 16 to 0 56 for unsaturated soils and 0 17 0 46 for wetlands the watershed wide annual average partition varied from 0 22 to 0 60 4 3 sources of evaporation uncertainty the uncertainty of e over soils i e shrubs conifers broadleaf forest and wetlands connected and disconnected was split into the contributions of different e sources relative to total e e i etotal i unsaturated soil ponded water or intercepted water table 5 intercepted e was not calibrated with the et partition since intercepted water did not contribute to watershed storages and therefore had no influence on soil wetland isotopic composition higher potential for interception e resulted in the greatest evaporative loss relative to ponded water and unsaturated soil e in three of the four watersheds table 5 interception e was the dominant source of e for both unsaturated soils and wetlands ponded water had the highest parameter uncertainty appendix c however it accounted for the least e uncertainty due to the short periods it was present generally the highest uncertainty of e was from unsaturated soil e and subsurface e in wetlands which varied temporally not shown uncertainty of e in unsaturated soils increased with increasing e soil e total estimations table 5 soil e accounted for over 50 of the total partition uncertainty despite having the most constrained parameter ranges appendix c the uncertainty of e from unsaturated soil was a function of both the e et partition and estimates of storage these effects were separated by identifying the effects of storage parameters on et partition parameters the shape parameter ma for unsaturated soils was simultaneously influenced by unsaturated soil depth and wetland depth mean storage depth over simulation length fig 9 a ma exhibited low sensitivity when the depth of water stored in the unsaturated soil storage was low 0 5 m regardless of wetland volume mean ma decreased from 0 25 to 1 07 with increased unsaturated soil volume while the mean unsaturated scale parameter sc increased from 0 94 to 0 62 fig 9b soil ma was also maximized when wetland depth was at its extremes min 0 2 m and max 0 7 m wetland ma was most uncertain when the unsaturated soil depth was low fig 9c however it similarly decreased 0 61 to 1 14 as soil depth increased there was no noticeable change in sc for ponded water with unsaturated soil depth fig 9e there were limited temporal periods when ponded water was present therefore it was difficult to establish the effect of ponded water e on unsaturated soil isotopic compositions the relative influence of individual components of unsaturated soil storage volume and wetland storage volume on the e et partition parameters was identified through stepwise linear regression using depth to groundwater table soil moisture and wetland moisture table 6 the inclusion of a variable in the linear regression was considered significant when p 0 05 asterisks a significant positive linear relationship between soil moisture and unsaturated soil e et was obtained for all watersheds a significant relationship between the depth to the groundwater table and unsaturated soil e et was only obtained for the sapochi river a significant positive correlation between the wetland e et to the depth to the groundwater table and significant negative correlation of wetland e et to wetland moisture was observed for all watersheds the negative relationship to wetland moisture was merely a function of including the groundwater table independent regression of wetland moisture to wetland e et had a positive trend similar to soil e et to soil moisture soil and wetland e et had a significant positive correlation to the moisture level of the storage 4 4 riverine sensitivity to storage fractionation identification of the storage s in which e fractionation most influenced the isotopic composition of streamflow at watershed outlets was complicated by the routing of unsaturated soil water through connected wetlands where present to separate the sources of fractionation sensitivity analysis of e on the isotopic composition at the outlet was conducted using the optimum parameters for each trial 20 trials in each watershed each trial was conducted twice changing e fractionating to t non fractionating in unsaturated soil storage then in wetlands the average changes in simulated isotopic composition were calculated for each storage for the isotope sampling period 2011 2015 the dependence of e on storage volume and land cover percentages was removed by calculating ratios of e to storage volume and area e s a fig 10 a log linear relationship between isotopic change and e change per storage volume was identified for unsaturated soil and wetland storages fig 10 the greatest rate of change in riverine isotopic composition was observed when the e s a ratio was small and least rate of change when the e s a was high decreasing e in wetlands exerted greater influence with the rate of change almost twice as high for wetlands slope of 0 42 compared to unsaturated soils slope of 0 25 the rate of change was the most pronounced when e s a was low additionally the relationship was much stronger for wetlands r2 0 93 than unsaturated soils r2 0 54 due to complex mixing of unsaturated soil water and ponded water 5 discussion 5 1 assessment of watershed and storage et partitioning the observed discharge and isotopic compositions of streamflow at the outlets of four watershed were adequately simulated by incorporating an et partition model that was a function of julian day and air temperature in contrast to previous studies this study used isotopic differences of river samples and model calibration to verify the accuracy of the et partitioning method rather than observations of two of the three components e t and et kool et

these studies were situated in high latitudes significantly higher e et ratios are however estimated in the gunisao river in this study vegetation in the gunisao watershed is predominantly shrubs or shrub wetlands and more analogous to open canopy crop cover which may result in higher e gabrielli 2016 kool et al 2014 higher proportions of herbed wetland than shrub wetland may be the cause of increases in e et for the burntwood and gunisao 0 31 and 0 6 respectively relative to the sapochi and odei watersheds 0 21 and 0 22 respectively herbed wetlands have lower leaf area index lai than shrub wetlands barbour and billings 2000 which typically results in higher e rates gabrielli 2016 the burntwood likely has a lower e et than the gunisao due to a greater proportion of treed area higher lai in the watershed table 1 the total et estimated within each watershed is comparable to the boreas study same geographic region which estimated average peak summer et of 2 mm day amthor et al 2001 temperature the meteorological variable identified as the most appropriate for these four study watersheds has previously been used to estimate e fluxes from unsaturated soil allen 1990 deol et al 2012 penuelas et al 2009 however rh subsurface moisture content and leaf area index lai are also known to be important relative humidity has a direct influence on both the total e and total t monteith 1965 and the isotopic compositions of soil Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o changes in soil water isotopic composition due to e are strongly dependent on kinetic fractionation function of relative humidity eq b 1 the sensitivity of the et partition to changes in the isotopic composition of soil water has previously been shown on small scales wang et al 2013 while temporal changes in rh were directly considered in the calculation of rev section 3 5 the uncertainty of Œ¥a atmospheric isotopic composition on the soil isotopic composition may also be substantial in the craig gordon model the change in soil isotopic composition is driven by kinetic fractionation and the gradient of isotopic composition from the soil to the atmosphere craig and gordon 1965 gat 2010 for example for a constant rh lower Œ¥a will result in much greater fractionating effects in soil water than when Œ¥a is higher 20 potentially resulting in overestimation of soil fractionation during spring and autumn this coincides with periods of higher model uncertainty in the watersheds studied here in some environments rh at the soil atmosphere interface may be influenced by the canopy of dense forest regions e g amazon rainforest lowman and rinker 2004 the low density of the boreal watershed canopy studied here is less likely to impact rh brooks and kyker snowman 2008 the complexities of soil moisture on the rh at the air water interface may result in either enhanced or diminished fractionation effects good et al 2014 soderberg et al 2012 measured soil moisture at various depths may help to further constrain the partition of et where near surface waters primarily control soil e and deeper soil moistures control root uptake cavanaugh et al 2011 raz yaseef et al 2012 vertical heterogeneity of soil properties such as grain size can result in soil moisture contents that are vertically heterogeneous thereby affecting e and t fluxes and their isotopic compositions independently in time this vertical heterogeneity was simulated in helios exponential distribution however the shape of the distribution was not time variable in large watersheds 2 d spatial validation using measured data for soil moisture is unrealistic and assessment of spatial variability with depth is difficult additional temporal factors may influence e et including lai increasing lai increases t and decreases soil e booth and loheide 2010 raz yaseef et al 2012 on global scales higher vegetation lai has been shown to increase the fraction of t relative to et wang et al 2014 though mostly when lai is low 2 m2 m2 temporal variability of canopy coverage and ground vegetation e g sphagnum moss may further influence the total et partition wang et al 2010 specific inclusion of ground vegetation in simulations may result in greater spatial variability of e et due to its influence on variation in moisture content and water retention e g peat material mccarter and price 2014 within the watersheds studied here the temporal periods where the lai in boreal watersheds is most variable is during the spring leaf out and autumn senescence barr et al 2004 which are periods in which model uncertainty is highest soil moisture rh and lai all influence the et partition although the individual influence of each is difficult to determine with the limited data presented here high temporal resolution data over multiple years using the method presented would potentially identify the relative influence on the et partition i e eqs 10 11 the additional assessment of inter annual variability of e et using re would benefit from inclusion of time variable land cover inter annual land cover changes may be driven by changes in vegetation and therefore change the lai this may lead to under over estimation of interception and thereby influence interception e e g dingman 2002 in more extreme cases the inter annual land cover variability may change the classification of storage e g soil to wetland permafrost degradation in northern watersheds has changed sub surface storages and has resulted in permanent changes of forested areas to wetlands in recent years quinton et al 2011 the relatively high influence of wetland e fractionation on the stream isotopic compositions fig 10 with long term changes in wetland area may also lead to mis identification of the watershed e et 5 2 implications for modelling calibrating a tracer aided model with storage isotopic fractionation and e et partitioning parameters facilitates more accurate estimations of isotopic compositions within storage than models that do not account for e and t fractionation independently incorrect estimation of evaporative fractionation within storage may result in mis identification of primary flow components similar to the effect of temporally dependent precipitation mcdonnell et al 1991 for example partitioning et results in temporal increases in water sourced from wetland and groundwater storages compared to those previously identified for the sapochi and odei rivers smith et al 2016 inclusion of the et partition and other improvements separation of connected and disconnected wetlands reduces uncertainty of isotopic composition Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o during et dominated months and reduces uncertainty of simulated discharge the e et partition using simulated stream isotopic compositions is directly related to the estimated moisture content and subsurface storage volume higher uncertainty of simulated moisture content or storage volume increases the uncertainty of estimated e et the higher uncertainty during periods of increased storage depth during modelling may be explained through mass balance where large volumes or inflows dampen the fractionation effects of e gibson 2002 gibson et al 1993 therefore reduction of uncertainty of e et may be achieved most simply with more accurate soil moisture and storage depth estimates uncertainties of e et estimation due to ponded water remains difficult to establish due to limited periods that ponded water is present in sites where ponded water conditions are limited to short temporal periods days the parameterization of e et for ponded water is likely not essential to capture watershed scale fractionation effects using temperature to partition e et overestimated isotopic compositions in the stream immediately after the freshet some of this uncertainty is likely due to inter annual variability of ice and soil thaw and snowmelt the et partition developed here was limited to the average intra annual e et improved estimation of snowmelt fractionation and soil thaw may reduce uncertainty during spring when variably enriched snowmelt may influence identification of sources penna et al 2014 taylor et al 2002 parameterization and calibration of estimated e et are contingent on the availability of water between storages i e ponded water wetland and unsaturated soil and within storages moisture content table 6 as it is infeasible to parameterize e et for all degrees of saturation in all storages the inclusion of moisture content and subsequent storage depth in a general watershed scale e et partitioning model will likely reduce model parameterization the increase in e et with soil moisture shown in this study has also been observed with alternative methods raz yaseef et al 2012 stannard and weltz 2006 the observed higher e from wetlands over unsaturated soils suggests that soil properties within the partition equation may additionally help to reduce parameterization riverine enrichment observed at a catchment outlet depends on the fraction of e et within a catchment and the influence of e on water in storage as spatial and temporal measurements of e and soil Œ¥s are impractical in many large watersheds it is useful to identify the storage where measurement will most constrain uncertainty tetzlaff et al 2008 model sensitivity within helios indicated that wetlands proportionally increased the riverine composition due to e more than unsaturated soils fig 10 therefore focused sampling of the wetlands within large watersheds may reduce uncertainty in identifying the source waters contributing to autumn streamflow hinton et al 1994 laudon et al 2004 in addition fractionated stream isotopic compositions have previously been significantly linked to e in wetlands sprenger et al 2017 welch et al 2018 the need to identify a minimum data collection frequency for adequate tracer aided simulations is also warranted in our data scarce region we clearly saw that two samples per year is insufficient in seasonal climates with increased stream flow sampling it may be possible to identify a minimum isotopic data collection frequency using methods similar to those used to identify minimum discharge measurement frequency for simulating ungauged watersheds seibert and beven 2009 6 conclusions this study provides a new method for partitioning et at the catchment scale using the isotopic composition of river water and air temperature in seasonal watersheds e et is strongly correlated to air temperature and follows a parabolic trend from spring to autumn calibration of a tracer aided model with a temperature dependent et partition indicates distinct differences in e et between storages ponded water yields the highest e et ratios highest e while unsaturated soil storages generally have the lowest e et ratio highest t wetlands yielded higher e et than unsaturated soils despite lower interception e due to higher subsurface water availability and ensuing subsurface e higher moisture content results in higher e et and large storage volumes increase the uncertainty of the partition evaporation from different storages does not influence stream isotopic compositions equally rather evaporative fractionation in wetlands has a proportionally greater effect on the riverine isotopic composition than that in unsaturated soils in watersheds where stream flow isotopic data are available at higher temporal resolution the methods presented here may provide insight to multiple model variables e g soil moisture temperature lai on the et partition using

7364,evapotranspiration et partitioning is a growing field of research in hydrology due to the significant fraction of watershed water loss it represents the use of tracer aided models has improved understanding of watershed processes and has significant potential for identifying time variable partitioning of evaporation e from et a tracer aided model was used to establish a time series of e et using differences in riverine Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h in four northern canadian watersheds lower nelson river manitoba canada on average e et follows a parabolic trend ranging from 0 7 in the spring and autumn to 0 15 three watersheds and 0 5 fourth watershed during the summer growing season in the fourth watershed wetlands and shrubs dominate land cover during the summer e et ratios are highest in wetlands for three watersheds 10 higher than unsaturated soil storage while lowest for the fourth watershed 20 lower than unsaturated soil storage uncertainty of the et partition parameters is strongly influenced by storage volumes with large storage volumes increasing partition uncertainty in addition higher simulated soil moisture increases estimated e et although unsaturated soil storage accounts for larger surface areas in these watersheds than wetlands riverine isotopic composition is more strongly affected by e from wetlands comparisons of e et to measurement intensive studies in similar ecoregions indicate that the methodology proposed here adequately partitions et keywords tracer aided modelling evapotranspiration partitioning stable water isotopes data scarce seasonal watersheds 1 introduction evaporation e and transpiration t are intricately linked components of the water cycle that affect water storage in watersheds worldwide large changes in water abundance due to climate change may affect both vegetation growth and type and water storage sugimoto et al 2002 in mid to high latitude watersheds increasing temperatures are likely to increase storage lengthen growing seasons and increase evapotranspiration et rates woo 1992 however these changes will unequally affect the timing and relative rates of e and t abtew and melesse 2013 calanca et al 2006 the uncoupled temporal variance of e and t is problematic for hydrologic models simulating e and t as a single lumped component et in regions most prone to changing rates of e and t mid to high latitude watersheds there is limited available data to independently estimate e and t fluxes therefore to improve the understanding of the effects of temporal variations of e and t on water availability using hydrologic models temporal partitioning of the et flux is essential while a number of different measurement techniques for et e and t have been developed kool et al 2014 the techniques are generally data intensive and limited to smaller field scales et e and t have also been estimated using amongst others the monteith equation meteorological and vegetation observations monteith 1965 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the sweat model soil and canopy air resistances daamen and simmonds 1996 the enwatbal model canopy and soil energy balance lascano et al 1987 the hydrus 1d model canopy and soil energy balance balugani et al 2017 simunek et al 2009 and soil surface temperature moran et al 2009 in addition to the complex methods above simpler estimation and measurement methods have been used to estimate global scale et partitions using independent measures of two of the three components of et e t or et wang et al 2014 synthesized a relationship of t et to measured leaf area index the global analysis produced an e et range of 38 77 fatichi and pappas 2017 simulated long term annual mean values of et e and t using parameters to estimate vegetation productivity energy and water balance for multiple biomes and identified t et of 61 79 however temporally variable methods e g sweat enwatbal hydrus 1d remain impractical for application in large scale hydrologic models because data required for these methods are not readily available while simplified large scale techniques are limited in their ability to yield temporally variable estimates of the et partition the stable water isotopes oxygen 18 Œ¥18o and deuterium Œ¥2h provide an alternative method for partitioning et using the fractionation of isotopes in storage to infer the total flux of e this method combines a mass balance approach with measurements of the isotopic composition of et Œ¥et t xylem water or root uptake Œ¥x Œ¥t evaporative vapour Œ¥e and the rate of et flux sutanto et al 2012 yepez et al 2003 zhang et al 2010 the fluxes of e and t from et are estimated by rearranging the vapour mass balance however the isotopic et end members et e and t are difficult to measure and numerous methods have been developed to estimate the isotopic composition of each component methods for estimating the end members include the craig gordon model for Œ¥ e craig and gordon 1965 leaf resistance and leaf area index methods for Œ¥ t farquhar and cernusak 2005 hu et al 2014 and the keeling plot keeling 1960 lu et al 2017 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 and flux gradient method for Œ¥ et hu et al 2014 wen et al 2016 while such models can adequately reproduce measured end members the models have large data requirements and hence application is generally not feasible at meso or macro scales et from macro scale watersheds has been partitioned on long term data sets using stable isotope measurements of surface water jasechko et al 2013 applied long term watershed scale mass balances worldwide to assess spatial differences in the annual average partition isotopic compositions and t flux were estimated using fluxes and isotopic compositions of discharge precipitation and groundwater and estimated a global t et of 80 90 good et al 2015 partitioned et on an annual average basis using continental runoff and atmospheric mass balance with oceanic waters they used the deuterium to hydrogen ratios d h of runoff to isolate the isotope ratio of marine water and subsequently identify the continental fluxes of et and t producing a global t et of 56 74 assuming d h is not affected by t lastly a recent large scale study on the tibetan plateau has used high temporal resolution stream water to partition et with hydrograph separation guo et al 2017 despite the success of large scale et estimation methods these methods do not account for temporal variability fatichi and pappas 2017 good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 wang et al 2014 or require high frequency isotopic sampling guo et al 2017 and therefore have limited application to hydrologic models of high latitude or data scarce regions the goal of this study was to develop a method to estimate a temporally variable watershed average et partition that is suitable for implementation in operational tracer aided hydrologic models of the data required for tracer aided hydrologic models the et partition method requires only precipitation and riverine compositions of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h for calibration the et partitioning model is developed in three steps first by simulating riverine isotopic composition assuming et is fully non fractionating in unsaturated soil storage and wetland storage but accounting for open water fractionation second by conducting hydrograph separation and identifying the required enrichment in the simulated isotopic composition in storage to the observed riverine isotopic composition and third by using required enrichment and model inputs to empirically estimate the et partition application of the empirical model to four northern canadian watersheds over a multi year period is used to identify the temporal variability of the et partition in these watersheds 2 site description and data collection the study watersheds are located on the canadian shield in north central manitoba canada above 50 n fig 1 four watersheds were selected based on geographic location physiographic differences land cover and the availability of isotopic and discharge data the drainage areas of the watersheds span the meso scale spectrum from small 410 km2 to large 6109 km2 table 1 2 1 land cover and surficial geology low watershed topographic relief results in a landscape with high open water and wetland percentages including headwater lakes in stream lakes and connected and disconnected wetlands table 1 welch et al 2018 the watersheds are primarily differentiated by vegetation coverage the vegetation of the odei and sapochi river watersheds are the most similar of the four watersheds differing only in the coverage of open water and shrubs high percentages of wetlands in the gunisao river watershed are noticeable departures from the dominant coverage of shrub and broadleaf forests present in other watersheds within each watershed the density of vegetation coverage is highly variable ranging from dense mixed vegetation to exposed bedrock field surveys and surface imagery indicate that the wetlands are comprised of a mixture of trees shrubs open water and peat moss and that the understory of some forested regions may be primarily comprised of peat moss silt till clay and organic materials are the dominant soil types of the watersheds and are underlain by precambrian bedrock geogratis 2016 the proportion of each soil type spatially varies within each watershed due to physiographic features e g distance from lake winnipeg and topographic slope and depositional processes from glaciation the depth of soil to bedrock is spatially variable within and between watersheds ranging from zero exposed bedrock to greater than 18 m flynn et al 2016 of the four watersheds the burntwood river watershed has the highest proportion of rock outcrops and underlying till and the highest open water coverage 2 2 climate precipitation over the watershed was measured at environment and climate change canada eccc weather stations and supplemented with estimated gridded precipitation in particular the large distance from the burntwood river watershed to the closest measurement location flin flon necessitated the use of gridded precipitation the north american regional reanalysis narr and canadian precipitation analysis capa precipitation values within the burntwood river are relatively similar to the measurements at flin flon when both are availabe climate data collection commenced at thompson airport in 1967 at cross lake jenpeg in 1967 at norway house in 2005 and at flin flon in 1927 eccc 2016a while temperature was collected at each station from the beginning of its operation at two locations cross lake jenpeg and flin flon precipitation measurement began in subsequent years recent precipitation measurements were obtained using automated total precipitation weighing gauges while older precipitation measurements were obtained using tipping bucket rain gauges eccc 2016a temperature and dew point temperature were recorded and measured on an hourly basis at the same location as precipitation though dew point temperature was not available at all gauging stations table 2 the climate of all watersheds is continental sub arctic july and august are the wettest months with an average 178 mm to 203 mm of rainfall most snowfall occurs in november and march 42 mm to 52 mm total snow water equivalent warmer temperatures in transition

although the growing season occasionally extends into april and october hall 2001 myneni et al 1997 approximately one third of annual precipitation is received as snow table 2 eccc 2016a b large differences in total annual precipitation between watersheds primarily occur due to differences in snowfall table 2 2 3 sample collection and analysis river water samples were collected from the watershed outlets of the gunisao and burntwood rivers beginning in 2010 and sapochi and odei rivers in 2011 grab samples were collected from shore approximately 30 cm below the water surface using a retractable sampling pole site accessibility limited sample collection frequency however samples encompassed high and low precipitation years precipitation samples were collected as composite samples at thompson service center jenpeg generating station and notigi control structure on average 12 5 and 6 times per year respectively the composite samples represent a volume weighted average of precipitation since the last sample date incorporating short term variability and seasonality of the precipitation isotopic compositions groundwater samples were collected at the same locations 22 5 and 4 times per year respectively details of the sampling program are presented in smith et al 2015 all water samples were analyzed for Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h using a mass spectrometer by innotech alberta and compared to vienna standard mean ocean water 2 vsmow2 with precision of 0 2 per mille for Œ¥18o and 1 for Œ¥2h 2 4 flow regime of the watersheds the annual hydrograph is defined by two peak events a freshet may and june and a late summer or early autumn rainfall peak august and september in nearly a third of the years on record large late season precipitation events result in discharge events larger than the freshet the watersheds have over 20 years of daily observed discharge sapochi 22 years odei 36 years burntwood 30 years and gunisao 44 years hydrometric data were collected by environment and climate change canada using in stream pressure transducers eccc 2016b stream gauging was conducted multiple times per year and stage discharge curves adjusted when necessary three of four watersheds sapochi odei and burntwood river observed their highest discharge in 2005 and lowest in 2003 minimum and maximum discharge was observed in the gunisao river in 1993 and 2010 respectively the boxplots show variability of discharge throughout the sampling years and the responsiveness of each watershed to snowmelt and rainfall isotopic sampling years in the sapochi and odei rivers boxplots and red dashed line capture average discharge variability the sapochi river fig 2 b has the largest number of outliers relative to the other watersheds indicating that the watersehd is the most responsive high responsiveness is also observed at the odei river outlet fig 2h though slightly less due to its larger watershed size despite similar watershed drainage area the burntwood river fig 2h has relatively stable annual discharge compared to the odei river due to a greater proportion of lakes which attenuate discharge lastly the gunisao river fig 2d is the least responsive likely resulting from high wetland coverage relative to the burntwood and odei river watersheds of similar size the gunisao river has high inter annual variability of the interquartile range iqr this indicates that the gunisao river discharge is largely dependent on annual precipitation and has shorter storage residence times average discharge since 2000 has been greater than historical average 1971 2015 coinciding with greater than average precipitation in the region 3 evapotranspiration partition model development isotopic composition and discharge are simulated using the hydrological evapotranspiration partition lumped isotopic simulation helios model developed in the numerical mathematical software matlab helios is a sub basin lumped model that expands a previously developed model umswim university of manitoba stable water isotope model smith et al 2016 by improving representation of et and catchment storages and incorporating the simulation of Œ¥2h helios consists of individual modules for discharge and isotopic simulations evaporative fractionation of water was applied to storages undergoing significant evaporation open water and near surface storages calibration is conducted using a multi step approach to directly address isotopic equifinality identify the temporal variability of the et partition and calibrate the et partition model the initial model calibration prevents wetland and soil water evaporative fractionation and permits only open water fractionation this ensures that isotopic compositions in storage and within the stream are not over enriched prior to soil and wetland evaporative fractionation the resulting simulations are then assessed for periods of under enrichment within the stream these periods are used to identify the required evaporative enrichment in storage to correctly estimate stream isotopic compositions finally the amount of required enrichment is used to inform the temporal partition of et 3 1 hydrologic module helios has five compartments that store and release water unsaturated soil storage groundwater ponded water connected wetlands and disconnected wetlands fig 3 precipitation is added to helios as spatially averaged daily precipitation over the watershed area the energy balance method is used to estimate snowmelt eqs a 1 a 4 usace 1956 ponded water storage receives water through rainfall and

the muskingum method eqs a 25 routing is necessary due to the attenuation of flow by low topographic relief channel slopes in stream lakes and watershed size lateral channel inflows are added as point

appendix b the craig and gordon model is used for e and snowmelt isotopic fractionation eqs b 1 b 5 craig and gordon 1965 horita and wesolowski 1994 gibson and reid 2014 temporal snowmelt fractionation is included since it is important for source identification in seasonal watersheds hayashi et al 2004 laudon et al 2002 the isotopic mixing model is generally volume fraction dependent

is depth dependent estimating higher influences of evaporative fractionation near the surface relative to deeper soil depths the total isotope mass flux from soil is estimated using the craig and gordon 1965 model the incomplete mixing of the soil storage drives preferential flow and generally results in near surface water exhibiting higher degrees of fractionation the fractionation due to the mass flux is translated to a depth dependent soil isotopic composition with an exponential curve eqs b 6 b 8 the exponential curve is a function of soil moisture groundwater isotopic composition Œ¥ and a storage mixing parameter pexp low values of pexp approaching a minimum of 1 increase mixing and isotopic fractionation with depth high values of pexp 5 decrease mixing and result in near surface fractionation only fig b1 pexp may be calibrated when depth dependent soil isotopic compositions are known otherwise the parameter should be held constant at 1 for consistency with previous models

estimated using the arcmap percent slope tool and a digital elevation model usgs 2016 rasterized to grid cells of 30 m land cover was determined for sub basins using geogratis land cover images 10 m geogratis 2016 which is an average of land cover conditions over multiple seasons land covers were aggregated into five classes coniferous forest broadleaf forest shrub wetlands and water wetlands were divided into connected and disconnected classes using an eight direction connectivity method and were considered connected when adjacent to the river network or other connected wetlands welch et al 2018 the percentages of channels lined with wetlands were used to calculate the area through which the wetlands discharge to channels meteorological data used during simulation were obtained from the sources indicated in table 2 with norway house used for the gunisao river watershed and narr and capa model used for the burntwood river watershed observed discharge at catchment outlets were obtained from environment and climate change canada eccc 2016b and manitoba hydro mh 2016 3 4 discharge model calibration to determine the required enrichment discharge Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were simulated using helios and calibrated assuming open water e was the sole contributor to observed watershed fractionation at the outlet i e no isotopic fractionation occurred in soil water and wetland water storages this calibration process eliminated parameter sets that yielded more enriched isotopic compositions of stream water than observed the model was calibrated using a multi objective function

Œ¥s gw Œ¥o gw to total groundwater samples was minimized over enrichment of simulated groundwater occurred due to improper parameter sets i e incorrect sources the model was calibrated from 2000 to 2014 to include diverse hydrological conditions and validated against 2015 a long calibration period was required due to limited temporal resolution of sampling in early isotopic collection years for most watersheds 2010 2013 and an unusually large snowpack in 2014 discharge calibration was evaluated using eq 1 a combination of the nash sutcliffe nse peak flow kling gupta kge average error log

et was not measured the multi objective calibration process was conducted as follows 1 calibration of stream discharge and primary source flow parameters using observed discharge data 20 000 dynamically dimensioned search dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 simulations were used to calibrate the discharge for each watershed keeping e et constant at zero 2 parameter sets with simulated riverine

is used to infer e referred to as the required enrichment 3 5 inferring watershed scale isotopic fractionation in soil and wetland storages from simulated stream isotopic compositions partitioning et using tracer aided watershed modelling exploits the difference between Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h fractionation using the discharge isotopic composition at the outlet since modelled isotopic compositions of water held in non fractionating storage do not change with the inclusion of fractionation the difference between simulated riverine isotopic composition that neglects storage e fractionation calibration

available to establish trend significance however the comparison of re over multiple years yields a long term estimate of the intra annual variability re is compared over multiple years using the julian day of each sample and regressing a relationship of re and julian day in seasonal watersheds there may be increased uncertainty of the relationship in the spring and autumn months due to timing

however be influenced by i precipitation composition ii relative humidity rh eqs b 1 b 3 and iii temporal changes in the et rate these dependencies must be removed from re to obtain a direct comparison to et the influence of precipitation and rh isotopic compositions on storage isotopic compositions are dependent on storage volume and flux which may change in time and with parameter sets the influence of precipitation isotopic composition may be removed from re by subtracting the normalized average annual precipitation isotopic composition the effect of rh on storage is estimated

eq b 1 to estimate the change in isotopic composition gef c f c o subtracting gef yields the required enrichment due to e fluxes rev lastly temporal et trends are subtracted from rev the ratio of rev to et provides a general ratio of e to et e et there are three potential scenarios of et partitioning using rev i max rev max et ii max rev min et and iii et constant in the first scenario the greatest e et occurs when the et rate is the highest the second scenario is the inverse of the first the greatest e et occurs at the lowest et rate finally when et is constant the greatest e et occurs at max re 3 6 identifying the relationship of simulated required enrichment to meteorological variables meteorological conditions control the total fluxes of e and t establishing a relationship of e et to meteorological variables enables identification of a temporally variable relationship between e and t the general relationship of e et to any meteorological variable is described as 10 e et f v

relationship from 0 59 to 0 66 though does not significantly change regression parameters addressing the temporal variability of isotopes in precipitation rh and et trends demonstrates that the highest e et occurs when et is low second scenario in section 3 5 fig 5e the trends of e et were normalized between zero and one for each watershed to facilitate direct comparison the perceived early start julian day 110 april 20 of the e et trend fig 5e is a function of the watershed routing eqs 6 and 7 rather than et on average et was insignificant prior to may regression of julian day e et against meteorological variables temperature relative humidity wind speed and atmospheric pressure for each watershed reveals that the strongest relationship is to temperature change r2 values 0 61 0

volume or mass changes i e isotopic precipitation and rh effects total e isotopic fractionation is dependent on storage therefore the magnitude between the extreme e et and minimum e et are not known until calibration of discharge and isotopic compositions is completed e et can be estimated from temperature using a power function fig 5 independent of units 12 e et f t t ma sc lim t 0 f t d n e

numerical errors since the e component of et cannot be greater than total et eq 13 has a maximum and minimum 14 e et 1 f t 0 f t 1 0 f t 1 f t 0 where e et has a maximum of 1 and minimum of 0 sensitivity analysis indicated that the realistic parameter range for ma was 0 1 to 2 and for sc between 0 and 1 when ma is less than 2 variability is so large that e et is binary only 0 or 1 with the consideration of additional meteorological variables in addition to temperature parameter ranges may be established by fitting the function e g eq 11 to non changing e et d e et dt 0 to allow for changes in e et as a result of storage e g eq a 20 and to the maximum e et change max d e et dt 1 since the change in e et cannot be greater than the range of e et 0 1 the et partition model based on temperature eq 13 was applied to three storages within the helios model wetlands unsaturated soils and ponded water helios was calibrated and evaluated using simultaneous discharge and isotopic observations the influence of ponded water in previous studies sutanto et al 2012 prompted the use of a different partition from unsaturated soils calibration was evaluated using the minimization function in section 3 4 eq 1 and nash sutcliffe and kling gupta of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h nse18 nse2 kge18 and kge2 discharge and isotopic composition was calibrated using dds with 20 trials of 2000 runs 40 000 total runs from 2000 to 2014 2015 was simulated as the validation period the parameter set with the lowest value within the minimization function from each trial was assumed to be behavioral and used in analysis uncertainty bounds were determined using the upper and lower bound of all behavioral parameter sets 4 application to field sites 4 1 helios model performance and source contributions simulations of calibrated discharge generally agreed with measured streamflow discharge when the et partition model was applied table 4 the discharge efficiency criteria nse kge were slightly higher for discharge only calibration 0 1 greater section 3 4 than the tracer aided calibration however tracer aided calibration resulted in a reduction of behavioral parameters not shown observed discharge was generally within the uncertainty bounds of all behavioral simulations at the outlets fig 6 spring and summer peak flow events were generally well captured by simulations however some events were overestimated in the sapochi river overestimation typically occurred during low intensity multi day rainfall events 2012 2013 fig 6a in the gunisao and burntwood rivers overestimation occurred due to high precipitation events 2011 fig 6b c simulated winter flows were generally representative of the observed discharge despite proportionally higher uncertainty in all watersheds while the burntwood river simulations overestimated winter flows in three isotopic years fig 6c this was not typical of all simulation years 2000 2010 not shown although the uncertainty bounds captured the observed discharge of the recession limb higher uncertainty of source contribution i e connected wetlands and groundwater resulted in an ambiguous shape of the simulated recession limb the volume of snowmelt was low in 2013 relative to the amount of precipitation received during winter when compared to other years the underestimation was likely due to overestimation of sublimation during the winter and e during a longer than average snowmelt period simulations of calibrated streamflow isotopic compositions were temporally comparable to measured streamflow isotopic compositions when the et partition model was applied table 4 fig 7 the simulations of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h were essentially equivalent for kge kge18 was 0 76 and kge2 was 0 75 mean efficiency of the simulations for all watersheds while Œ¥18o evaluated better for nse18 nse18 was 0 56 and nse2 was 0 52 mean efficiency of the simulations for all watersheds table 4 in particular tight uncertainty bounds were obtained in simulations during the e seasons the model replicated the observed isotopic depletion induced by snowmelt in all years except 2013 underestimation of snowmelt in 2013 led to over enriched riverine isotopic composition throughout the remainder of the year and resulted in decreased nse for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o the validation year 2015 uncertainty bounds captured the isotopic composition in three of four watersheds sapochi odei and burntwood indicating appropriate e and evaporative fractionation estimation in contrast enrichment appeared to be vastly overestimated in the gunisao river such extreme enrichment was not observed in other simulated years and was likely the result of limited isotopic precipitation samples 2 which were largely enriched these samples were applied as representative composite precipitation input throughout the year no further samples collected which most likely did not capture seasonal variation on average fractionation dependent storages unsaturated soils and connected wetlands accounted for 45 75 of total watershed discharge table 4 connected wetlands accounted for 53 73 of the fractionation dependent storage flux overland flow was a large source contribution in each watershed however contributions were temporally limited to high input events i e snowmelt and precipitation hence the proportion of total discharge contributed by overland flux was often lower than indicated in table 4 disconnected wetland contribution was a relatively small portion of the watershed discharge similar to overland flow disconnected wetland contribution only occurred during high input events and was generally restricted to snowmelt and late season precipitation groundwater contribution was relatively consistent throughout the year but was a greater proportion of streamflow during winter months when only groundwater and connected wetlands discharged to the channels the uncertainty of connected wetland and groundwater contribution was greatest during recession limbs not shown this was likely due to inter annual changes in freezing depths of wetlands and shallow ground freezing is assumed binary in storage frozen or unfrozen on average the simulated peak et rate during the summer months was between 1 7 and 2 5 mm day for each of the watersheds 4 2 evapotranspiration partition trend the watershed wide partition of e et was determined from flux weighted unsaturated soil and wetland storage partitions fig 8 the e et trend followed a general parabolic shape for each storage with a higher e et during the spring april and may and autumn september and october and lower during the summer june to august when t dominated in three of the four watersheds e et was lowest in june july for the other watershed e et was highest for ponded water when present in all watersheds and in three of the four watersheds wetland storage e et was greater than unsaturated soil e et partition parameters ma and sc were very similar for the sapochi burntwood and odei rivers likely because of similar physiography and land cover table 1 appendix c the gunisao had much higher e et throughout the year than the other watersheds and was less variable for example in summer the upper uncertainty bound for e et was approximately 0 4 in the gunisao river watershed compared to approximately 0 2 in the three other watersheds high intra annual variability of the monthly partition was observed for each fractionating storage and watershed wide e et averaged from 2000 to 2015 fig 8 the watershed wide e et was highly dependent on the volume of unsaturated soil storage within the sapochi odei and burntwood watersheds while watershed wide et partition in the gunisao was equally dependent on unsaturated soil and wetland storage variability was the greatest in the spring and autumn when et rates and temperatures varied the most inter annually despite higher temperatures in august the lowest e et partitions were generally observed in june the timing of the lowest e et partition was consistent with the timing of vegetation budding increased e et later in the year august and september coincided with the largest precipitation events as well as the beginning of abscission the higher e et upper bounds of the box plots resulted from increased presence of ponded water highest e et appendix c and increased estimated intercepted e due to more consistent contribution to intercepted water storage eqs a 14 a 17 during the growing season june august the average et partition varied from 0 16 to 0 56 for unsaturated soils and 0 17 0 46 for wetlands the watershed wide annual average partition varied from 0 22 to 0 60 4 3 sources of evaporation uncertainty the uncertainty of e over soils i e shrubs conifers broadleaf forest and wetlands connected and disconnected was split into the contributions of different e sources relative to total e e i etotal i unsaturated soil ponded water or intercepted water table 5 intercepted e was not calibrated with the et partition since intercepted water did not contribute to watershed storages and therefore had no influence on soil wetland isotopic composition higher potential for interception e resulted in the greatest evaporative loss relative to ponded water and unsaturated soil e in three of the four watersheds table 5 interception e was the dominant source of e for both unsaturated soils and wetlands ponded water had the highest parameter uncertainty appendix c however it accounted for the least e uncertainty due to the short periods it was present generally the highest uncertainty of e was from unsaturated soil e and subsurface e in wetlands which varied temporally not shown uncertainty of e in unsaturated soils increased with increasing e soil e total estimations table 5 soil e accounted for over 50 of the total partition uncertainty despite having the most constrained parameter ranges appendix c the uncertainty of e from unsaturated soil was a function of both the e et partition and estimates of storage these effects were separated by identifying the effects of storage parameters on et partition parameters the shape parameter ma for unsaturated soils was simultaneously influenced by unsaturated soil depth and wetland depth mean storage depth over simulation length fig 9 a ma exhibited low sensitivity when the depth of water stored in the unsaturated soil storage was low 0 5 m regardless of wetland volume mean ma decreased from 0 25 to 1 07 with increased unsaturated soil volume while the mean unsaturated scale parameter sc increased from 0 94 to 0 62 fig 9b soil ma was also maximized when wetland depth was at its extremes min 0 2 m and max 0 7 m wetland ma was most uncertain when the unsaturated soil depth was low fig 9c however it similarly decreased 0 61 to 1 14 as soil depth increased there was no noticeable change in sc for ponded water with unsaturated soil depth fig 9e there were limited temporal periods when ponded water was present therefore it was difficult to establish the effect of ponded water e on unsaturated soil isotopic compositions the relative influence of individual components of unsaturated soil storage volume and wetland storage volume on the e et partition parameters was identified through stepwise linear regression using depth to groundwater table soil moisture and wetland moisture table 6 the inclusion of a variable in the linear regression was considered significant when p 0 05 asterisks a significant positive linear relationship between soil moisture and unsaturated soil e et was obtained for all watersheds a significant relationship between the depth to the groundwater table and unsaturated soil e et was only obtained for the sapochi river a significant positive correlation between the wetland e et to the depth to the groundwater table and significant negative correlation of wetland e et to wetland moisture was observed for all watersheds the negative relationship to wetland moisture was merely a function of including the groundwater table independent regression of wetland moisture to wetland e et had a positive trend similar to soil e et to soil moisture soil and wetland e et had a significant positive correlation to the moisture level of the storage 4 4 riverine sensitivity to storage fractionation identification of the storage s in which e fractionation most influenced the isotopic composition of streamflow at watershed outlets was complicated by the routing of unsaturated soil water through connected wetlands where present to separate the sources of fractionation sensitivity analysis of e on the isotopic composition at the outlet was conducted using the optimum parameters for each trial 20 trials in each watershed each trial was conducted twice changing e fractionating to t non fractionating in unsaturated soil storage then in wetlands the average changes in simulated isotopic composition were calculated for each storage for the isotope sampling period 2011 2015 the dependence of e on storage volume and land cover percentages was removed by calculating ratios of e to storage volume and area e s a fig 10 a log linear relationship between isotopic change and e change per storage volume was identified for unsaturated soil and wetland storages fig 10 the greatest rate of change in riverine isotopic composition was observed when the e s a ratio was small and least rate of change when the e s a was high decreasing e in wetlands exerted greater influence with the rate of change almost twice as high for wetlands slope of 0 42 compared to unsaturated soils slope of 0 25 the rate of change was the most pronounced when e s a was low additionally the relationship was much stronger for wetlands r2 0 93 than unsaturated soils r2 0 54 due to complex mixing of unsaturated soil water and ponded water 5 discussion 5 1 assessment of watershed and storage et partitioning the observed discharge and isotopic compositions of streamflow at the outlets of four watershed were adequately simulated by incorporating an et partition model that was a function of julian day and air temperature in contrast to previous studies this study used isotopic differences of river samples and model calibration to verify the accuracy of the et partitioning method rather than observations of two of the three components e t and et kool et al 2014 calibrated mean watershed et partitions for the sapochi odei and burntwood river watersheds during the growing season are comparable to studies conducted in forested and shrub regions 0 07 0 4

these studies were situated in high latitudes significantly higher e et ratios are however estimated in the gunisao river in this study vegetation in the gunisao watershed is predominantly shrubs or shrub wetlands and more analogous to open canopy crop cover which may result in higher e gabrielli 2016 kool et al 2014 higher proportions of herbed wetland than shrub wetland may be the cause of increases in e et for the burntwood and gunisao 0 31 and 0 6 respectively relative to the sapochi and odei watersheds 0 21 and 0 22 respectively herbed wetlands have lower leaf area index lai than shrub wetlands barbour and billings 2000 which typically results in higher e rates gabrielli 2016 the burntwood likely has a lower e et than the gunisao due to a greater proportion of treed area higher lai in the watershed table 1 the total et estimated within each watershed is comparable to the boreas study same geographic region which estimated average peak summer et of 2 mm day amthor et al 2001 temperature the meteorological variable identified as the most appropriate for these four study watersheds has previously been used to estimate e fluxes from unsaturated soil allen 1990 deol et al 2012 penuelas et al 2009 however rh subsurface moisture content and leaf area index lai are also known to be important relative humidity has a direct influence on both the total e and total t monteith 1965 and the isotopic compositions of soil Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o changes in soil water isotopic composition due to e are strongly dependent on kinetic fractionation function of relative humidity eq b 1 the sensitivity of the et partition to changes in the isotopic composition of soil water has previously been shown on small scales wang et al 2013 while temporal changes in rh were directly considered in the calculation of rev section 3 5 the uncertainty of Œ¥a atmospheric isotopic composition on the soil isotopic composition may also be substantial in the craig gordon model the change in soil isotopic composition is driven by kinetic fractionation and the gradient of isotopic composition from the soil to the atmosphere craig and gordon 1965 gat 2010 for example for a constant rh lower Œ¥a will result in much greater fractionating effects in soil water than when Œ¥a is higher 20 potentially resulting in overestimation of soil fractionation during spring and autumn this coincides with periods of higher model uncertainty in the watersheds studied here in some environments rh at the soil atmosphere interface may be influenced by the canopy of dense forest regions e g amazon rainforest lowman and rinker 2004 the low density of the boreal watershed canopy studied here is less likely to impact rh brooks and kyker snowman 2008 the complexities of soil moisture on the rh at the air water interface may result in either enhanced or diminished fractionation effects good et al 2014 soderberg et al 2012 measured soil moisture at various depths may help to further constrain the partition of et where near surface waters primarily control soil e and deeper soil moistures control root uptake cavanaugh et al 2011 raz yaseef et al 2012 vertical heterogeneity of soil properties such as grain size can result in soil moisture contents that are vertically heterogeneous thereby affecting e and t fluxes and their isotopic compositions independently in time this vertical heterogeneity was simulated in helios exponential distribution however the shape of the distribution was not time variable in large watersheds 2 d spatial validation using measured data for soil moisture is unrealistic and assessment of spatial variability with depth is difficult additional temporal factors may influence e et including lai increasing lai increases t and decreases soil e booth and loheide 2010 raz yaseef et al 2012 on global scales higher vegetation lai has been shown to increase the fraction of t relative to et wang et al 2014 though mostly when lai is low 2 m2 m2 temporal variability of canopy coverage and ground vegetation e g sphagnum moss may further influence the total et partition wang et al 2010 specific inclusion of ground vegetation in simulations may result in greater spatial variability of e et due to its influence on variation in moisture content and water retention e g peat material mccarter and price 2014 within the watersheds studied here the temporal periods where the lai in boreal watersheds is most variable is during the spring leaf out and autumn senescence barr et al 2004 which are periods in which model uncertainty is highest soil moisture rh and lai all influence the et partition although the individual influence of each is difficult to determine with the limited data presented here high temporal resolution data over multiple years using the method presented would potentially identify the relative influence on the et partition i e eqs 10 11 the additional assessment of inter annual variability of e et using re would benefit from inclusion of time variable land cover inter annual land cover changes may be driven by changes in vegetation and therefore change the lai this may lead to under over estimation of interception and thereby influence interception e e g dingman 2002 in more extreme cases the inter annual land cover variability may change the classification of storage e g soil to wetland permafrost degradation in northern watersheds has changed sub surface storages and has resulted in permanent changes of forested areas to wetlands in recent years quinton et al 2011 the relatively high influence of wetland e fractionation on the stream isotopic compositions fig 10 with long term changes in wetland area may also lead to mis identification of the watershed e et 5 2 implications for modelling calibrating a tracer aided model with storage isotopic fractionation and e et partitioning parameters facilitates more accurate estimations of isotopic compositions within storage than models that do not account for e and t fractionation independently incorrect estimation of evaporative fractionation within storage may result in mis identification of primary flow components similar to the effect of temporally dependent precipitation mcdonnell et al 1991 for example partitioning et results in temporal increases in water sourced from wetland and groundwater storages compared to those previously identified for the sapochi and odei rivers smith et al 2016 inclusion of the et partition and other improvements separation of connected and disconnected wetlands reduces uncertainty of isotopic composition Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o during et dominated months and reduces uncertainty of simulated discharge the e et partition using simulated stream isotopic compositions is directly related to the estimated moisture content and subsurface storage volume higher uncertainty of simulated moisture content or storage volume increases the uncertainty of estimated e et the higher uncertainty during periods of increased storage depth during modelling may be explained through mass balance where large volumes or inflows dampen the fractionation effects of e gibson 2002 gibson et al 1993 therefore reduction of uncertainty of e et may be achieved most simply with more accurate soil moisture and storage depth estimates uncertainties of e et estimation due to ponded water remains difficult to establish due to limited periods that ponded water is present in sites where ponded water conditions are limited to short temporal periods days the parameterization of e et for ponded water is likely not essential to capture watershed scale fractionation effects using temperature to partition e et overestimated isotopic compositions in the stream immediately after the freshet some of this uncertainty is likely due to inter annual variability of ice and soil thaw and snowmelt the et partition developed here was limited to the average intra annual e et improved estimation of snowmelt fractionation and soil thaw may reduce uncertainty during spring when variably enriched snowmelt may influence identification of sources penna et al 2014 taylor et al 2002 parameterization and calibration of estimated e et are contingent on the availability of water between storages i e ponded water wetland and unsaturated soil and within storages moisture content table 6 as it is infeasible to parameterize e et for all degrees of saturation in all storages the inclusion of moisture content and subsequent storage depth in a general watershed scale e et partitioning model will likely reduce model parameterization the increase in e et with soil moisture shown in this study has also been observed with alternative methods raz yaseef et al 2012 stannard and weltz 2006 the observed higher e from wetlands over unsaturated soils suggests that soil properties within the partition equation may additionally help to reduce parameterization riverine enrichment observed at a catchment outlet depends on the fraction of e et within a catchment and the influence of e on water in storage as spatial and temporal measurements of e and soil Œ¥s are impractical in many large watersheds it is useful to identify the storage where measurement will most constrain uncertainty tetzlaff et al 2008 model sensitivity within helios indicated that wetlands proportionally increased the riverine composition due to e more than unsaturated soils fig 10 therefore focused sampling of the wetlands within large watersheds may reduce uncertainty in identifying the source waters contributing to autumn streamflow hinton et al 1994 laudon et al 2004 in addition fractionated stream isotopic compositions have previously been significantly linked to e in wetlands sprenger et al 2017 welch et al 2018 the need to identify a minimum data collection frequency for adequate tracer aided simulations is also warranted in our data scarce region we clearly saw that two samples per year is insufficient in seasonal climates with increased stream flow sampling it may be possible to identify a minimum isotopic data collection frequency using methods similar to those used to identify minimum discharge measurement frequency for simulating ungauged watersheds seibert and beven 2009 6 conclusions this study provides a new method for partitioning et at the catchment scale using the isotopic composition of river water and air temperature in seasonal watersheds e et is strongly correlated to air temperature and follows a parabolic trend from spring to autumn calibration of a tracer aided model with a temperature dependent et partition indicates distinct differences in e et between storages ponded water yields the highest e et ratios highest e while unsaturated soil storages generally have the lowest e et ratio highest t wetlands yielded higher e et than unsaturated soils despite lower interception e due to higher subsurface water availability and ensuing subsurface e higher moisture content results in higher e et and large storage volumes increase the uncertainty of the partition evaporation from different storages does not influence stream isotopic compositions equally rather evaporative fractionation in wetlands has a proportionally greater effect on the riverine isotopic composition than that in unsaturated soils in watersheds where stream flow isotopic data are available at higher temporal resolution the methods presented here may provide insight to multiple model variables e g soil moisture temperature lai on the et partition using the implicit solution eq 5 simplifications to et partitioning methods are particularly useful for application in meso and macroscale watersheds with limited data available acknowledgements the authors
