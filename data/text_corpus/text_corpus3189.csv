15945,reports that the exploitation of metal free carbon materials to enhance permanganate pm oxidation to abate organic pollution in water have emerged in recent publications however the activation mechanism and active sites involved are ambiguous because of the intricate physicochemical properties of carbon in this study reduced graphene oxide rgo as a typical carbon material exhibits excellent capability to boost permanganate oxidation for removing a wide array of organic contaminants the simultaneous two reaction pathways in the rgo pm system were justified i rgo donates to electrons to decompose pm and produce highly reactive intermediate mn species for oxidizing organic contaminants ii rgo mediates electron transfer from organics to pm oxygen containing groups hydroxyl carboxyl and carbonyl were justified as electron donating groups while structural defects vacancy and edge defects were shown to be critical for rgo mediated electron transfer therefore the oxidation pathway of the rgo pm system can be controlled by regulating oxygen functional groups and structural defects the changeover from electron donor to electron mediator by decorating surface active sites of carbon materials will be of great help to the design and application of carbocatalysts graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon catalysis permanganate oxygen containing groups structural defects electron transfer 1 introduction permanganate pm kmno4 is a relatively stable low cost and high efficiency chemical oxidant which has been widely used in environmental remediation liu et al 2009 dissimilar to ozone 2 07 v hydroxyl radical 2 7 v and sulfate radical 2 5 3 1 v the lower oxidation potential of pm 1 68 v limits its application lee et al 2020 song et al 2021 wang et al 2020 hence many efforts focusing on enhancing the oxidation capacity of pm have been made to broaden its practical application various classes of approaches such as ligands jiang et al 2010 bisulfite cheng et al 2019a electricity zhu et al 2019 ultraviolet irradiation hu et al 2018 were attempted to promote pm oxidation by producing highly reactive intermediate manganese species rmns however these methods require continuous addition of chemicals and result in secondary pollution or involve intensive energy input which strongly impede the scientific progress of enhanced pm oxidation towards practical application recently metal free carbon materials have emerged as attractive alternatives to boost pm oxidation in an environmentally benign manner for example in the presence of biochar organics degradation by pm can be strongly enhanced because biochar can interact with pm to produce rmns tian et al 2019 in addition carbon nanotubes cnts and graphite have also been reported to activate pm to enhance pollutants oxidation peng et al 2021 zhao et al 2016 however the underlying mechanism of carbon catalysis in enhanced pm oxidation is still controversial some literatures suggested that the redox active moieties e g phenolic hydroxyl on carbon materials enable them as electron donors to provide electrons to decomposing pm and producing rmns which contributes to the enhanced oxidation of organic pollutants tian et al 2020 on the other hand other literatures revealed that carbon materials e g graphite and cnts can mediate direct electron transfer from organics to pm leading to the oxidative degradation of organic pollutants rather than reductive sites of carbon induced conversion from pm to rmns peng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the active sites on the surface of carbon materials influence the catalytic pathway significantly li et al 2021 therefore the difference of catalytic pathway of carbon materials in pm activation may be caused by their differences in active sites however due to the intricate physicochemical properties and network structure of carbon materials the active sites involved remain obscure the catalytic performances of carbon materials are closely linked to their surface chemistry such as structural defects and oxygen containing groups duan et al 2018 guo et al 2022 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 both the nature and content of active sites can simultaneously govern the reactivity of carbon materials it was reported that a rise of defective level leaded to a greater ozonation catalytic activity song et al 2019 wang et al 2018 because the structural defects can break the homogeneity of graphitic carbon network to induce high chemical potentials and unpaired electrons giving rise to the promoted surface reactivities of carbons jiang et al 2015 it was also reported that the decrease in the concentration of oxygen functional groups in cnts made the zeta potential less negative which was conducive to the adsorption of pds and the formation of cnt activated pds complexes that oxidize organics via electron transfer route ren et al 2020 although these points have been generally accepted active sites that contribute to the enhancement of pm oxidation by carbon materials remain to be ascertained therefore the identification and regulation of active sites are critical for exploring the key factors of carbon materials in pm activation and the origin of activation pathway in this respect model catalysts with controllable active sites are of great significance for revealing these mysteries considering that high dimensional carbocatalysts e g activated carbon biochar possess more complicated structures this study explores carbocatalysis through simplified configurations low dimensional carbons therefore reduced graphene oxide rgo with tuned defective degree and quantity of oxygen groups can be an ideal model carbocatalyst to probe the active sites of carbon materials for enhancing pm oxidation the aim of this study is to deeply investigate the mechanism of carbon materials boosted pm oxidation by analyzing the role of active sites oxygen functional groups and structural defects the reactivities of diverse carbon materials fullerene graphite graphene oxide rgo carbon nanofiber carbon nanotube to enhance pm oxidation were firstly compared and rgo was then selected as model carbocatalyst based on its excellent performance several modification methods were used to regulate the physicochemical properties of rgo such as regulating the content of oxygen oxygen containing groups and structural defects these rgo derivatives were used to unveil the role of oxygen functional groups and structural defects for boosting pm oxidation experimental results showed that oxygen containing groups can act as electron donors to induce the decomposition of pm into rmns while defects can mediate electron transfer from pollutant to pm which was further verified by density functional theory dft calculations the approach of carbon materials boosted pm oxidation can change from electron donating to electron mediating by regulating the active sites of carbocatalysts therefore this study can promote the practical application of carbon materials enhanced pm oxidation for environmental remediation by deeply understanding carbon catalysis in enhanced pm oxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1

rgo was prepared by heat treatment of go under nitrogen gas in order to explore the effect of oxygen content of rgo a series of rgo derivatives were obtained through nitric acid heat treatment functionalized rgo derivatives with higher concentrations of hydroxyl oh carboxyl cooh or carbonyl groups c o were prepared and referred to as rgo oh rgo cooh or rgo c o respectively several rgo

temperature 25 2 c with magnetic stirring 400 rpm in a typical experiment reactions were initiated by simultaneously adding desired dosages of pm organic pollutants and carbon materials to 100 ml ultrapure water reaction aliquots were periodically collected and filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane 0 22 μm for subsequently analyzing the concentrations of organics and pm more detailed information about experimental procedures is provided in text s2 high performance liquid chromatography analysis hplc agilent usa equipped with an eclipse xdb c18 5 μm 4 6 250 mm column was performed to detect the concentrations of dcf and other compounds table s2 the concentration of pm and the valence status of manganese were measured by a uv vis spectrometer uv 1800 daojin china at

electrode as working electrode pt wire as counter electrode and ag agcl electrode as reference electrode galvanic oxidation process gop was performed according to the procedure in the literature peng et al 2021 dcf and pm solution were separately present in two half cells which were connected by an agar salt bridge text s3 2 5 characterization the average surface areas of original and residual rgo

photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis ultra dld uk and fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir nicolet 5700 china raman spectra were performed on a raman spectrometer with a green laser at 532 nm labram hr france 2 6 theoretical calculation methods the density functional theory dft calculations were performed using the gaussian 16 version c 01 package to investigate the chemisorption of pm on rgo surface to investigate the interaction between pm molecules and particular positions within rgo vacancy edge and oxygen containing groups simplified graphene sheets 4 7 were employed to simulate the real rgo the spin polarized dft calculations of molecular orbital mo were performed with the dmol3 module to accurately calculate the mo of rgo a graphene model 7 8 with basal plane vacancy and oxygen containing groups hydroxyl carboxylic and carbonyl group was taken as intact rgo the detailed description of dft calculation is provided in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivities of carbon materials for enhancing pm oxidation to evaluate the reactivity of carbon materials for enhancing pm oxidation a variety of sp 2 or sp 2 s 0 s 1 hybrid carbon materials were coupled with pm to degrade dcf including fullerene fe graphene gp graphene oxide go reduced graphene oxide rgo carbon nanofiber cnf and carbon nanotubes cnt fig 1 a and s1 show that only 30 0 of dcf was degraded at 30 min in the pm system at ph 6 5 however the dcf removal ratios increase to 36 1 48 4 56 6 63 2 64 8 and 100 in fe go gp cnt cnf and rgo assisted pm systems respectively among these carbon materials rgo exhibits the superior catalytic ability for boosting pm oxidation the apparent rate constant k obs of dcf removal in the rgo pm system increases sharply to 0 113 min 1 which was obviously higher than that in the rgo system 0 009 min 1 and the pm system 0 010 min 1 fig s2 moreover the rgo pm system exhibits excellent performance for enhancing pm oxidation towards a variety of organic contaminants fig s3 s5 and text s5 meanwhile the rgo pm system also attains 100 dcf removal in real water matrices fig s6 table s3 and text s5 active sites mainly oxygen containing groups and structural defects in the conjugated π system of the graphitic carbon networks are crucial to impact the interactions between organic contaminants and the oxidants in advanced oxidation processes zhang et al 2021 such as the activation of peroxymonosulfate duan et al 2016b peroxydisulfate cheng et al 2019b periodate xiao et al 2022 xps and raman analysis fig 1b and table s4 were performed to investigate the relationship between these potential active sites of carbocatalysts and catalytic activities which reveals that carbocatalysts with extremely high oxygen content go low oxygen content cnt and low defect degree gp and cnf are not beneficial to boost the pm oxidation moreover the poor catalytic performance of fe may be related to the stable c60 cage liked structure and highly conjugated electron system which lead to the weak electron donating ability and electron conductivity as well as poor adsorption capacity goldshleger and nataliya 2001 in particular the relationship between the physicochemical properties and reactivities of gp go and rgo deserve noteworthy gp is a typical 2d sp 2 hybridized carbon material and is regarded as basic unit for graphene based materials go is obtained by grafting with various oxygen functional groups onto gp using the modified hummers method hummers and offeman 1958 rgo is fabricated by reducing go and its tuned surface has a certain amount of retained oxygen functional groups and structural defects yu et al 2020a these three types of carbon materials with different oxygen content and defect degree exhibit obvious differences in boosting pm oxidation therefore we speculate that oxygen functional groups and structural defects may play an important role in enhancing pm oxidation considering high reactivity of rgo with controllable oxygen functional groups and structural defects rgo was selected as a typical carbocatalyst in this study to clarify the mechanism of enhanced pm oxidation by carbon materials many previous literatures reported that the electron rich sites in carbon materials can donate electrons to directly decompose pm to produce rmns shi et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 our recent study proposed that carbon materials e g graphite can mediate electron transfer from organic pollutions to pm wang et al 2021 therefore the decomposition of pm in different systems was monitored to find out the activation mechanism in the rgo pm system as displayed in fig 2 a the decomposition ratio of pm in the rgo pm system without dcf is 41 9 which reveals the electron donating groups of rgo can significantly accelerate the decomposition of pm moreover the addition of dcf can strongly promote the decomposition of pm in the rgo pm system the decomposition ratio of pm in the rgo pm dcf system is obviously higher than that of the sum of the dcf system and the rgo system these results demonstrates that rgo can mediate electron transfer from dcf to pm to promote the oxidation of dcf results above implies that rgo plays as both electron donor and electron mediator to enhance pm oxidation for further identifying the active sites of rgo to induce these routes of organics oxidation the roles of oxygen functional groups and structural defects were deeply analyzed by tuning the surface properties of rgo and dft calculations 3 2 oxygen containing groups induced pm decomposition as electron donors to verify the role of the electron donating groups of rgo for boosting pm oxidation rgo and pm were premixed in solution to oxidize the electron donating groups of rgo and dcf was subsequently added at predetermined time intervals 1 4 8 and 12 h as depicted in fig 2b with the increase of premix time the degradation efficiencies of dcf gradually decreases indicating that dcf degradation was closely related to the electron donating groups of rgo in addition pre oxidized rgo treated by ozone for 2 h to oxidize electron donating groups of rgo was also comparatively studied to verify whether rgo can directly promote the decomposition of pm peng et al 2021 compared with the rgo pm system both the degradation efficiency of dcf and the decomposition capacity of pm in pre oxidized rgo pm system decrease significantly fig s7 the above phenomena confirm that electron donating groups of rgo play an important role in pm decomposition compared to the feeble decomposition of pm by graphite low oxygen content the remarkable decomposition of pm by rgo suggests that oxygen functional groups may be the main electron donor fig 2a therefore it is meaningful to probe the relationship between the oxygen functional groups and the catalytic performance of rgo a series of rgo derivatives with different oxygen contents were obtained by a nitric acid treated method li et al 2020 as shown in table s4 and fig s8 s9 the oxygen content of these derivatives gradually increases from 5 02 to 15 96 while the nitric acid treated time increases from 0 h to 24 h interestingly the performance of the rgo pm system for dcf degradation obviously increases with the increase of oxygen content of rgo from 5 02 to 8 97 whereas its performance obviously decreases with the further growth of oxygen content from 8 97 to 15 96 fig 2c d when oxygen content 8 97 or 8 97 good positive linear relationship r2 0 977 and negative linear relationship r2 0 834 between lnk obs and oxygen content were established respectively similar linear relations between three types of surface oxygen containing groups were also observed including hydroxyl group c oh carboxyl group cooh and carbonyl group c o fig s10 results above confirm that an appropriate low oxygen content 8 97 of rgo is conductive to boost pm oxidation while excessive oxygen content 8 97 is adverse this may be due to the excessive surface oxygen groups can not only occupy the active sites through the stereo hindrance effect but also can destroy the conductivity of carbon duan et al 2016b moreover the decomposition amount of pm also increases first and then decreases with the increase of oxygen content and a good positive linear relationship was established between the decomposition amount of pm and the k obs of dcf degradation fig s11 r2 0 978 the above phenomena indicate that the content of oxygen functional groups is the key factor affecting the catalytic activity of rgo by donating electrons to decompose pm in addition based on the results of ftir and xps analysis fig s12 and table s5 the oxygen content of rgo increases obviously after the oxidation reaction which may cause the decrease of the reactivity of used rgo with the exorbitant oxygen content xps analysis of raw and used rgo fig s13 shows that the intensity of hydroxyl and carboxyl group decreases and the intensity of carbonyl group increases during the cycling tests the depletion of hydroxyl and carboxyl group indicates they may play a critical role in pm activation therefore functionalized rgo derivates with higher contents of hydroxyl carboxyl or carbonyl groups denoted to as rgo oh rgo cooh or rgo c o were prepared to investigate the possible influence of oxygen containing groups on the catalytic performance of rgo the xps spectra fig s14 of these functionalized rgo derivates show the enhanced intensities of the bands assigned to the hydroxyl carboxyl or carbonyl groups respectively as shown in fig 2e the reactivities of rgo oh rgo cooh and rgo c o to enhance pm oxidation are significantly higher than that of rgo and the apparent rate constants k obs of dcf removal follow an order of k rgo oh pm k rgo cooh pm k rgo c o pm k rgo pm among these rgo derivatives rgo oh exhibits better catalytic performance than rgo cooh and rgo c o which may be due to the fact that hydroxyl group possesses stronger electron donating capacity and negative adsorption energy than carboxyl group and carbonyl group bernat quesada et al 2019 wang et al 2018 moreover dft calculation was carried out to further figure out the roles of oxygen containing groups of rgo to boost pm oxidation herein simplified pristine graphene models were employed to simulate the interaction between pm and carbon skeleton of rgo fig s15 previous studies reported the oxygen groups located on the edges of the graphene network are more active than those at the base plane deng et al 2011 therefore we modelled three oxygen containing groups hydroxyl group carboxylic group and carbonyl group on the edges of graphene to analyze their reactivities with pm molecules fig s15 as seen in table 1 the adsorption energies of pm on hydroxyl group carboxylic group and carbonyl group of graphene models were calculated as 3 18 ev 2 48 ev and 1 93 ev respectively which were lower than that on graphene basal plane 1 09 ev in addition the manganese oxygen bond length imn o of pm was slightly longer when pm molecule was in contact with the oxygen containing groups than contact with graphene basal plane the mn o bond length follows the order hydroxyl group imn o 1 79 å carboxylic group imn o 1 73 å carbonyl group imn o 1 62 å graphene basal plane imn o 1 61 å the stronger adsorption energy and longer imn o bond length indicate that these three types of oxygen containing groups are active sites of rgo for enhanced pm oxidation it is in agreement with the experimental result that the active sequence of oxygen containing groups is in the order of hydroxyl group carboxyl group carbonyl group resulting from that hydroxyl group can act as lewis acid site for oxidant adsorption and decomposition and c o bonds carboxyl and carbonyl group with lone pair electrons can also exhibit high electron donating reactivities bing et al 2015 wang et al 2018 integrated with above experimental and theoretical results hydroxyl carboxyl and carbonyl groups can act as electron donors to promote pm decomposition resulting in the enhancement of dcf oxidation hence possible rmns involve mn iii mn iv mn vi and mn v yu et al 2020b zhu et al 2019 that may be produced during pm decomposition were further investigated high valence mn species mn vi and mn v as rmns that may be formed and boost contaminants oxidation gao et al 2019 herein the existence of mn vi and mn v were detected first using uv vis spectra and the characteristic peaks of mn vi and mn v at 606 nm and 667 nm respectively simandi et al 1984 fig s16 depicts no absorption peaks appear at the corresponding position in the rgo pm system which might be resulted from the instability of mn vi and mn v at near neutral ph shi et al 2020 moreover methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was used as a probe compound to further identify the presence of mn vi and mn v pmso can be converted to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 by high valence mn with a stoichiometric ratio of 1 1 chen et al 2020 as displayed in fig 2f and s17 the yield of pmso2 η pmso2 were approaching 100 with different dosages of pmso solution 50 500 μm meanwhile the addition of pmso can influence the dcf degradation in the rgo pm system fig s17 with the increase of pmso concentration more significant inhibition of dcf degradation was observed it indicates that rmns are largely formed in both the pm alone system and the rgo pm system and contribute primarily to the degradation of dcf in addition mno2 may be formed in reaction process which could promote the elimination of organics via adsorption and oxidation wang et al 2021 therefore the role of in situ formed mno2 for dcf removal were also investigated the results of xps and uv vis analysis show that mno2 was formed on the surface of rgo after reaction in the rgo pm system fig s16 and s18 however the contribution of mno2 to dcf removal is negligible fig s19a mno2 may be the final reduction product of pm rather than the active manganese species furthermore the low inhibition effect of pyrophosphate fig s19b on dcf removal and the absent of the specific peak of mn iii pyrophosphate complex in the uv vis spectra obtained from the rgo pm system fig s20 demonstrate the low contribution of mn iii for dcf removal text s6 the possible contribution of free radicals was excluded through quenching experiments fig s21 and text s6 based on the above results it can be concluded that high valence mn species mn vi and mn v are formed to contribute to dcf removal while mno2 appears as the final reduction product of pm noteworthily the analysis of rgo derivatives treated by nitric acid fig s22 depicts that a well fitted linear relationship r2 0 912 between pm decomposition rate and oxygen content of rgo derivatives was observed the correlation of k obs of dcf degradation to that of pm decomposition shows a relatively poor positive linear relationship r2 0 687 indicating that there may be other dominant activation pathways except for rgo mediated direct decomposition of pm to produce rmns 3 3 structural defects mediated electron transfer from dcf to pm as mentioned above rgo mediated electron transfer from dcf to pm may also contribute to dcf oxidation therefore the galvanic oxidation process gop was utilized to quantitatively analyze the rgo mediated electron transfer between pm and dcf the gop device consists of two half cells connected by an agarose bridge in which graphite electrodes coated with rgo are connected by an ammeter to monitor the relative current during the reaction fig 3 a two half cells were used to hold pm and dcf solutions respectively so that dcf can only be oxidized via electron transfer route instead of oxidized by rmns in the gop system peng et al 2021 as shown in fig 3b no obvious current was detected in two contrasting systems without pm or without dcf however when pm was coupled with dcf in the gop system the current value increased sharply and reached the maximum value 24 4 μa at 3 min then gradually decreased and maintained at 1 4 μa in the final stage moreover pm decomposition and dcf degradation were also monitored in the gop system fig 3c it can be seen that in the presence of pm and dcf about 76 of dcf was eventually removed in the reaction meanwhile the pm decomposition rate in the gop system reaches almost 100 in the presence of dcf while the pm decomposition rate is only 26 in the absence of dcf it suggests that rgo mediated electron transfer occurs only when pm and dcf are present together the above phenomena indicate that rgo can mediate the electron transfer from dcf to pm in the rgo pm system chronoamperometry tests were performed to further explore rgo mediated electron transfer between pm and dcf as displayed in fig 3d when 200 μm pm and 50 μm dcf were successively added the output current of glassy carbon electrode with rgo coating decreased markedly which is direct evidence that rgo mediated electron transfer process occurred between pm and dcf noteworthily the output current was significantly impacted by the first addition of pm indicating that pm can react directly with rgo which is consistent with the experimental results that oxygen containing groups can induce the decomposition of pm however adding dcf first has no effect on the current which indicates that rgo cannot oxidize directly dcf the electrochemical tests confirm that dcf can be oxidized by rgo mediated electron transfer to further analyze rgo induced electron transfer pathway for dcf oxidation in the rgo pm system the molecular orbital mo energy of rgo dcf and pm were investigated by dft calculation as displayed in fig 4 and table s6 the homo of dcf 4 96 ev is more negative than that of the lumo of rgo 3 95 ev the electrons localized at the homo of dcf could migrate to the lumo of rgo and induce the oxidation of dcf due to the narrowest energy gap 0 327 ev electron transfer from the lumo to the homo of rgo can be easily achieved subsequently electrons at homo of rgo 4 28 ev could be injected into the lumo of pm 2 99 ev resulting in pm decomposition shao et al 2020 wang et al 2021 dft study indicates that rgo mediated electron transfer from dcf to pm was driven by energy gaps therefore integrated with the above electrochemical analysis and theoretical results we conclude that rgo can act as electron mediator to accelerate electron transfer from dcf to pm and thus lead to the oxidation of dcf and the decomposition of pm defect sites in carbon networks were reported to be active centers by binding with peroxides e g peroxydisulfate and peroxymonosulfate to form highly reactive carbon peroxide complexes duan et al 2016a generally rgo is inherently produced with structural defects such as edge sites and vacancies which can break the homogeneity of graphene lattice and conjugated π network to produce unpaired electrons and delocalized π electrons the unpaired electrons can improve the surface reactivity of rgo and facilitate interaction between rgo and pm and the delocalized π electrons can significantly improve the electron mobility in the redox reactions wang et al 2020 to explore the influence of structural defects on the catalytic activity of rgo a series of rgo derivatives were prepared by thermal annealing at different temperatures 800 1200 c raman spectra were conducted to characterize the defective degree of these derivatives fig s23a the intensity ratio of the d band and g band id ig an indicator of defective degree zhang et al 2019 increases from 0 89 to 1 52 with the temperature increasing from 700 to 1000 c whereas it drops to 1 33 when the temperature rises to 1200 c noteworthily the performance of the rgo derivative pm system for dcf removal obviously increases with the increase of defective degree fig s23b as id ig value increasing from 0 89 to 1 52 the k obs of dcf removal increases from 0 113 to 0 229 min 1 fig 3e depicts a positive linear relationship r2 0 827 between lnk obs of dcf removal and id ig ratio implying that higher defect degree is conducive to dcf oxidation in addition in order to further investigate the role of structural defects for electron transfer route of dcf oxidation the pm decomposition caused only by electron transfer and id ig ratio were linearly fitted pm decomposition caused by electron transfer is obtained by subtracting the pm decomposition in the rgo pm system without dcf from the pm decomposition in the rgo pm dcf system as shown in fig 3f a well fitted and positive linear relationship r2 0 940 was established between lnk obs of pm decomposition and id ig which is sufficient evidence that the high defect degree is favorable to rgo mediated electron transfer between dcf and pm and the defect sites are the active sites for inducing electron transfer therefore it can be expected that the decrease in defect abundance of rgo will reduce its catalytic activity raman analysis suggest that the structural defects and graphitization of rgo after 5 cycles were remarkably deteriorated resulting in the regression of rgo performance during cycling tests as it severely limited the rgo mediated electron transfer pathway as shown in fig s24 the k obs of dcf removal sharply reduced from 0 113 to 0 036 min 1 after 5 cycles the deterioration of defects of rgo was ameliorated by heat treatment and as expected its catalytic performance was also obviously restored fig s24 the k obs of dcf removal recovered to 0 093 min 1 after heat treatment suggesting heat treatment is an effective way to recover the reactivity of rgo moreover dft calculation was performed to further confirm the role of structural defects herein the interaction between pm and particular positions of rgo models basal plane basal plane vacancy armchair edge and zigzag edge were investigated fig s25 the vacancy defects were simulated by base plane vacancy which was obtained by removing one carbon atom from the graphene the edge defects were modeled by armchair edge and zigzag edge all edged carbon atoms were saturated with hydrogen atoms to eliminate the dangling bonds as shown in table 1 the adsorption energies of pm on the basal plane vacancy armchair edge and zigzag edge were calculated as 1 09 ev 2 14 ev 1 78 ev and 1 43 ev respectively among different configurations vacancy defects and edge defects exhibit stronger adsorption energies compared to basal plane thus structural defects possess higher activity to react with pm therefore structural defects are the primarily active sites for rgo mediated electron transfer between organic contaminants and pm 3 4 regulating active sites of rgo for controllable pm oxidation pathway based on the above discussions rgo can boost pm oxidation towards organic contaminants via two approaches scheme 1 1 oxygen containing groups hydroxyl carboxyl and carbonyl of rgo can donate electrons to decompose pm and produce rmns mn vi and mn v eqs 1 2 resulting in fast oxidation of organic contaminants eqs 3 4 2 the structural defects of rgo mediate electron transfer from organic contaminants to pm resulting in strong acceleration of pm induced direct oxidation of organic contaminants eq 5 noteworthily both type and content of oxygen containing groups will affect the reactivity of rgo for enhancing pm oxidation the active sequence of oxygen containing groups for pm activation follows the order of hydroxyl group carboxyl group carbonyl group besides rgo with an appropriate low oxygen content 8 97 is conductive to boost pm oxidation while excessive oxygen content 8 97 results in poor pm activation structural defects especially vacancy and edge defects are the active centers where rgo mediated electron transfer occurs between pm and dcf rgo with high defect degree exhibits excellent catalytic performance for boosting pm oxidation in summary rgo can simultaneously act as electron donor oxygen containing groups and electron mediator vacancy and edge defects to enhance pm oxidation towards a variety of organic contaminants the abundance of two categories of active sites oxygen containing groups and structural defects will affect catalytic activity and pathway of rgo for boosting pm oxidation 1 mn vii aq e mn vi aq 2 mn vii aq 2e mn v aq 3 mn vi aq dcf mn iv s dcfox 4 mn v aq dcf mn iv s dcfox 5 dcf e rgo e pm dc f ox rgo mn iv s based on above mechanism discussion oxidation pathways of the rgo pm system can be designed by regulating oxygen functional groups and structural defects on rgo fig s26 displays the relationship between oxygen content and defect degree of rgo derivatives it can be seen that high oxygen content can destroy structural defects of rgo as excessive oxygen containing groups will occupy the defective sites vacancy and edge defects besides high oxygen content leads to the declined conjugated c c bonds and aromaticity chen et al 2018 therefore excessive oxygen will deteriorate the electron transfer capability resulting in obstruction of rgo mediated electron transfer pathway in view of the role of active sites in the catalytic pathway the changeover of rgo from electron donor to electron mediator can be achieved by regulating the type of active sites herein oxygen content and defect abundance of rgo were regulated by annealing rgo at different temperatures 800 1200 c it can be found that with the increase of annealing temperature the pm decomposition directly caused by rgo decreases gradually corresponding to the reduction of rmns generated by the electron donating groups to decompose pm while the pm decomposition caused by rgo mediated electron transfer increases gradually fig 5 noteworthily the pm decomposition caused by rgo mediated electron transfer is closely related to the change of defect degree id ig fig 3f in particular rgo 1200 was prepared by annealing in ultra pure nitrogen atmosphere at 1200 c for 3 h with plentiful structure defects id ig 1 33 but low oxygen content 1 65 dissimilar to rgo obtained at 700 c premixing rgo 1200 and pm shows no significant impact on dcf oxidation at premixing time ranging from 1 h to 12 h fig 2b it demonstrates that rgo 1200 serves as electron mediator between dcf and pm rather than electron donor to directly decompose pm therefore the dominant oxidation pathway can be controlled by adjusting the surface physicochemistry of rgo via thermal reduction process e g pyrolysis at high temperature under inert atmosphere or chemical oxidation process e g acid treatment the changeover in the role of rgo electron donor or electron mediator gives different characteristics to the rgo pm system the rgo pm system via electron donating pathway produce more active rmns which can decompose a wider range of organic pollutants while rgo as electron mediator enables the rgo pm system to exhibit higher pm utilization efficiency and long lasting reactivity of rgo peng et al 2021 4 conclusions in this work the activation mechanism and active sites of metal free carbocatalysts for enhancing pm oxidation were investigated oxygen containing groups and structural defects were identified as the primary active sites which can greatly affect the reactivity of carbocatalysts among various carbon materials rgo with tuned defective degree and quantity of oxygen functional groups exhibits excellent performance for enhancing pm oxidation towards a variety of organic contaminants two synergetic reaction pathways for oxidizing dcf in the rgo pm system was justified on the one hand rgo can act as electron donor to provide electrons to decompose pm inducing the formation of rmns mn vi and mn v which can further oxidize dcf and its intermediates on the other hand rgo mediated electron transfer from dcf to pm can also lead to the oxidation of dcf surface oxygen containing groups hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were justified as electron donating groups while structural defects vacancy and edge defects were shown to be

15945,reports that the exploitation of metal free carbon materials to enhance permanganate pm oxidation to abate organic pollution in water have emerged in recent publications however the activation mechanism and active sites involved are ambiguous because of the intricate physicochemical properties of carbon in this study reduced graphene oxide rgo as a typical carbon material exhibits excellent capability to boost permanganate oxidation for removing a wide array of organic contaminants the simultaneous two reaction pathways in the rgo pm system were justified i rgo donates to electrons to decompose pm and produce highly reactive intermediate mn species for oxidizing organic contaminants ii rgo mediates electron transfer from organics to pm oxygen containing groups hydroxyl carboxyl and carbonyl were justified as electron donating groups while structural defects vacancy and edge defects were shown to be critical for rgo mediated electron transfer therefore the oxidation pathway of the rgo pm system can be controlled by regulating oxygen functional groups and structural defects the changeover from electron donor to electron mediator by decorating surface active sites of carbon materials will be of great help to the design and application of carbocatalysts graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon catalysis permanganate oxygen containing groups structural defects electron transfer 1 introduction permanganate pm kmno4 is a relatively stable low cost and high efficiency chemical oxidant which has been widely used in environmental remediation liu et al 2009 dissimilar to ozone 2 07 v hydroxyl radical 2 7 v and sulfate radical 2 5 3 1 v the lower oxidation potential of pm 1 68 v limits its application lee et al 2020 song et al 2021 wang et al 2020 hence many efforts focusing on enhancing the oxidation capacity of pm have been made to broaden its practical application various classes of approaches such as ligands jiang et al 2010 bisulfite cheng et al 2019a electricity zhu et al 2019 ultraviolet irradiation hu et al 2018 were attempted to promote pm oxidation by producing highly reactive intermediate manganese species rmns however these methods require continuous addition of chemicals and result in secondary pollution or involve intensive energy input which strongly impede the scientific progress of enhanced pm oxidation towards practical application recently metal free carbon materials have emerged as attractive alternatives to boost pm oxidation in an environmentally benign manner for example in the presence of biochar organics degradation by pm can be strongly enhanced because biochar can interact with pm to produce rmns tian et al 2019 in addition carbon nanotubes cnts and graphite have also been reported to activate pm to enhance pollutants oxidation peng et al 2021 zhao et al 2016 however the underlying mechanism of carbon catalysis in enhanced pm oxidation is still controversial some literatures suggested that the redox active moieties e g phenolic hydroxyl on carbon materials enable them as electron donors to provide electrons to decomposing pm and producing rmns which contributes to the enhanced oxidation of organic pollutants tian et al 2020 on the other hand other literatures revealed that carbon materials e g graphite and cnts can mediate direct electron transfer from organics to pm leading to the oxidative degradation of organic pollutants rather than reductive sites of carbon induced conversion from pm to rmns peng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the active sites on the surface of carbon materials influence the catalytic pathway significantly li et al 2021 therefore the difference of catalytic pathway of carbon materials in pm activation may be caused by their differences in active sites however due to the intricate physicochemical properties and network structure of carbon materials the active sites involved remain obscure the catalytic performances of carbon materials are closely linked to their surface chemistry such as structural defects and oxygen containing groups duan et al 2018 guo et al 2022 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 both the nature and content of active sites can simultaneously govern the reactivity of carbon materials it was reported that a rise of defective level leaded to a greater ozonation catalytic activity song et al 2019 wang et al 2018 because the structural defects can break the homogeneity of graphitic carbon network to induce high chemical potentials and unpaired electrons giving rise to the promoted surface reactivities of carbons jiang et al 2015 it was also reported that the decrease in the concentration of oxygen functional groups in cnts made the zeta potential less negative which was conducive to the adsorption of pds and the formation of cnt activated pds complexes that oxidize organics via electron transfer route ren et al 2020 although these points have been generally accepted active sites that contribute to the enhancement of pm oxidation by carbon materials remain to be ascertained therefore the identification and regulation of active sites are critical for exploring the key factors of carbon materials in pm activation and the origin of activation pathway in this respect model catalysts with controllable active sites are of great significance for revealing these mysteries considering that high dimensional carbocatalysts e g activated carbon biochar possess more complicated structures this study explores carbocatalysis through simplified configurations low dimensional carbons therefore reduced graphene oxide rgo with tuned defective degree and quantity of oxygen groups can be an ideal model carbocatalyst to probe the active sites of carbon materials for enhancing pm oxidation the aim of this study is to deeply investigate the mechanism of carbon materials boosted pm oxidation by analyzing the role of active sites oxygen functional groups and structural defects the reactivities of diverse carbon materials fullerene graphite graphene oxide rgo carbon nanofiber carbon nanotube to enhance pm oxidation were firstly compared and rgo was then selected as model carbocatalyst based on its excellent performance several modification methods were used to regulate the physicochemical properties of rgo such as regulating the content of oxygen oxygen containing groups and structural defects these rgo derivatives were used to unveil the role of oxygen functional groups and structural defects for boosting pm oxidation experimental results showed that oxygen containing groups can act as electron donors to induce the decomposition of pm into rmns while defects can mediate electron transfer from pollutant to pm which was further verified by density functional theory dft calculations the approach of carbon materials boosted pm oxidation can change from electron donating to electron mediating by regulating the active sites of carbocatalysts therefore this study can promote the practical application of carbon materials enhanced pm oxidation for environmental remediation by deeply understanding carbon catalysis in enhanced pm oxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1

rgo was prepared by heat treatment of go under nitrogen gas in order to explore the effect of oxygen content of rgo a series of rgo derivatives were obtained through nitric acid heat treatment functionalized rgo derivatives with higher concentrations of hydroxyl oh carboxyl cooh or carbonyl groups c o were prepared and referred to as rgo oh rgo cooh or rgo c o respectively several rgo

temperature 25 2 c with magnetic stirring 400 rpm in a typical experiment reactions were initiated by simultaneously adding desired dosages of pm organic pollutants and carbon materials to 100 ml ultrapure water reaction aliquots were periodically collected and filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane 0 22 μm for subsequently analyzing the concentrations of organics and pm more detailed information about experimental procedures is provided in text s2 high performance liquid chromatography analysis hplc agilent usa equipped with an eclipse xdb c18 5 μm 4 6 250 mm column was performed to detect the concentrations of dcf and other compounds table s2 the concentration of pm and the valence status of manganese were measured by a uv vis spectrometer uv 1800 daojin china at

electrode as working electrode pt wire as counter electrode and ag agcl electrode as reference electrode galvanic oxidation process gop was performed according to the procedure in the literature peng et al 2021 dcf and pm solution were separately present in two half cells which were connected by an agar salt bridge text s3 2 5 characterization the average surface areas of original and residual rgo

photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis ultra dld uk and fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir nicolet 5700 china raman spectra were performed on a raman spectrometer with a green laser at 532 nm labram hr france 2 6 theoretical calculation methods the density functional theory dft calculations were performed using the gaussian 16 version c 01 package to investigate the chemisorption of pm on rgo surface to investigate the interaction between pm molecules and particular positions within rgo vacancy edge and oxygen containing groups simplified graphene sheets 4 7 were employed to simulate the real rgo the spin polarized dft calculations of molecular orbital mo were performed with the dmol3 module to accurately calculate the mo of rgo a graphene model 7 8 with basal plane vacancy and oxygen containing groups hydroxyl carboxylic and carbonyl group was taken as intact rgo the detailed description of dft calculation is provided in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivities of carbon materials for enhancing pm oxidation to evaluate the reactivity of carbon materials for enhancing pm oxidation a variety of sp 2 or sp 2 s 0 s 1 hybrid carbon materials were coupled with pm to degrade dcf including fullerene fe graphene gp graphene oxide go reduced graphene oxide rgo carbon nanofiber cnf and carbon nanotubes cnt fig 1 a and s1 show that only 30 0 of dcf was degraded at 30 min in the pm system at ph 6 5 however the dcf removal ratios increase to 36 1 48 4 56 6 63 2 64 8 and 100 in fe go gp cnt cnf and rgo assisted pm systems respectively among these carbon materials rgo exhibits the superior catalytic ability for boosting pm oxidation the apparent rate constant k obs of dcf removal in the rgo pm system increases sharply to 0 113 min 1 which was obviously higher than that in the rgo system 0 009 min 1 and the pm system 0 010 min 1 fig s2 moreover the rgo pm system exhibits excellent performance for enhancing pm oxidation towards a variety of organic contaminants fig s3 s5 and text s5 meanwhile the rgo pm system also attains 100 dcf removal in real water matrices fig s6 table s3 and text s5 active sites mainly oxygen containing groups and structural defects in the conjugated π system of the graphitic carbon networks are crucial to impact the interactions between organic contaminants and the oxidants in advanced oxidation processes zhang et al 2021 such as the activation of peroxymonosulfate duan et al 2016b peroxydisulfate cheng et al 2019b periodate xiao et al 2022 xps and raman analysis fig 1b and table s4 were performed to investigate the relationship between these potential active sites of carbocatalysts and catalytic activities which reveals that carbocatalysts with extremely high oxygen content go low oxygen content cnt and low defect degree gp and cnf are not beneficial to boost the pm oxidation moreover the poor catalytic performance of fe may be related to the stable c60 cage liked structure and highly conjugated electron system which lead to the weak electron donating ability and electron conductivity as well as poor adsorption capacity goldshleger and nataliya 2001 in particular the relationship between the physicochemical properties and reactivities of gp go and rgo deserve noteworthy gp is a typical 2d sp 2 hybridized carbon material and is regarded as basic unit for graphene based materials go is obtained by grafting with various oxygen functional groups onto gp using the modified hummers method hummers and offeman 1958 rgo is fabricated by reducing go and its tuned surface has a certain amount of retained oxygen functional groups and structural defects yu et al 2020a these three types of carbon materials with different oxygen content and defect degree exhibit obvious differences in boosting pm oxidation therefore we speculate that oxygen functional groups and structural defects may play an important role in enhancing pm oxidation considering high reactivity of rgo with controllable oxygen functional groups and structural defects rgo was selected as a typical carbocatalyst in this study to clarify the mechanism of enhanced pm oxidation by carbon materials many previous literatures reported that the electron rich sites in carbon materials can donate electrons to directly decompose pm to produce rmns shi et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 our recent study proposed that carbon materials e g graphite can mediate electron transfer from organic pollutions to pm wang et al 2021 therefore the decomposition of pm in different systems was monitored to find out the activation mechanism in the rgo pm system as displayed in fig 2 a the decomposition ratio of pm in the rgo pm system without dcf is 41 9 which reveals the electron donating groups of rgo can significantly accelerate the decomposition of pm moreover the addition of dcf can strongly promote the decomposition of pm in the rgo pm system the decomposition ratio of pm in the rgo pm dcf system is obviously higher than that of the sum of the dcf system and the rgo system these results demonstrates that rgo can mediate electron transfer from dcf to pm to promote the oxidation of dcf results above implies that rgo plays as both electron donor and electron mediator to enhance pm oxidation for further identifying the active sites of rgo to induce these routes of organics oxidation the roles of oxygen functional groups and structural defects were deeply analyzed by tuning the surface properties of rgo and dft calculations 3 2 oxygen containing groups induced pm decomposition as electron donors to verify the role of the electron donating groups of rgo for boosting pm oxidation rgo and pm were premixed in solution to oxidize the electron donating groups of rgo and dcf was subsequently added at predetermined time intervals 1 4 8 and 12 h as depicted in fig 2b with the increase of premix time the degradation efficiencies of dcf gradually decreases indicating that dcf degradation was closely related to the electron donating groups of rgo in addition pre oxidized rgo treated by ozone for 2 h to oxidize electron donating groups of rgo was also comparatively studied to verify whether rgo can directly promote the decomposition of pm peng et al 2021 compared with the rgo pm system both the degradation efficiency of dcf and the decomposition capacity of pm in pre oxidized rgo pm system decrease significantly fig s7 the above phenomena confirm that electron donating groups of rgo play an important role in pm decomposition compared to the feeble decomposition of pm by graphite low oxygen content the remarkable decomposition of pm by rgo suggests that oxygen functional groups may be the main electron donor fig 2a therefore it is meaningful to probe the relationship between the oxygen functional groups and the catalytic performance of rgo a series of rgo derivatives with different oxygen contents were obtained by a nitric acid treated method li et al 2020 as shown in table s4 and fig s8 s9 the oxygen content of these derivatives gradually increases from 5 02 to 15 96 while the nitric acid treated time increases from 0 h to 24 h interestingly the performance of the rgo pm system for dcf degradation obviously increases with the increase of oxygen content of rgo from 5 02 to 8 97 whereas its performance obviously decreases with the further growth of oxygen content from 8 97 to 15 96 fig 2c d when oxygen content 8 97 or 8 97 good positive linear relationship r2 0 977 and negative linear relationship r2 0 834 between lnk obs and oxygen content were established respectively similar linear relations between three types of surface oxygen containing groups were also observed including hydroxyl group c oh carboxyl group cooh and carbonyl group c o fig s10 results above confirm that an appropriate low oxygen content 8 97 of rgo is conductive to boost pm oxidation while excessive oxygen content 8 97 is adverse this may be due to the excessive surface oxygen groups can not only occupy the active sites through the stereo hindrance effect but also can destroy the conductivity of carbon duan et al 2016b moreover the decomposition amount of pm also increases first and then decreases with the increase of oxygen content and a good positive linear relationship was established between the decomposition amount of pm and the k obs of dcf degradation fig s11 r2 0 978 the above phenomena indicate that the content of oxygen functional groups is the key factor affecting the catalytic activity of rgo by donating electrons to decompose pm in addition based on the results of ftir and xps analysis fig s12 and table s5 the oxygen content of rgo increases obviously after the oxidation reaction which may cause the decrease of the reactivity of used rgo with the exorbitant oxygen content xps analysis of raw and used rgo fig s13 shows that the intensity of hydroxyl and carboxyl group decreases and the intensity of carbonyl group increases during the cycling tests the depletion of hydroxyl and carboxyl group indicates they may play a critical role in pm activation therefore functionalized rgo derivates with higher contents of hydroxyl carboxyl or carbonyl groups denoted to as rgo oh rgo cooh or rgo c o were prepared to investigate the possible influence of oxygen containing groups on the catalytic performance of rgo the xps spectra fig s14 of these functionalized rgo derivates show the enhanced intensities of the bands assigned to the hydroxyl carboxyl or carbonyl groups respectively as shown in fig 2e the reactivities of rgo oh rgo cooh and rgo c o to enhance pm oxidation are significantly higher than that of rgo and the apparent rate constants k obs of dcf removal follow an order of k rgo oh pm k rgo cooh pm k rgo c o pm k rgo pm among these rgo derivatives rgo oh exhibits better catalytic performance than rgo cooh and rgo c o which may be due to the fact that hydroxyl group possesses stronger electron donating capacity and negative adsorption energy than carboxyl group and carbonyl group bernat quesada et al 2019 wang et al 2018 moreover dft calculation was carried out to further figure out the roles of oxygen containing groups of rgo to boost pm oxidation herein simplified pristine graphene models were employed to simulate the interaction between pm and carbon skeleton of rgo fig s15 previous studies reported the oxygen groups located on the edges of the graphene network are more active than those at the base plane deng et al 2011 therefore we modelled three oxygen containing groups hydroxyl group carboxylic group and carbonyl group on the edges of graphene to analyze their reactivities with pm molecules fig s15 as seen in table 1 the adsorption energies of pm on hydroxyl group carboxylic group and carbonyl group of graphene models were calculated as 3 18 ev 2 48 ev and 1 93 ev respectively which were lower than that on graphene basal plane 1 09 ev in addition the manganese oxygen bond length imn o of pm was slightly longer when pm molecule was in contact with the oxygen containing groups than contact with graphene basal plane the mn o bond length follows the order hydroxyl group imn o 1 79 å carboxylic group imn o 1 73 å carbonyl group imn o 1 62 å graphene basal plane imn o 1 61 å the stronger adsorption energy and longer imn o bond length indicate that these three types of oxygen containing groups are active sites of rgo for enhanced pm oxidation it is in agreement with the experimental result that the active sequence of oxygen containing groups is in the order of hydroxyl group carboxyl group carbonyl group resulting from that hydroxyl group can act as lewis acid site for oxidant adsorption and decomposition and c o bonds carboxyl and carbonyl group with lone pair electrons can also exhibit high electron donating reactivities bing et al 2015 wang et al 2018 integrated with above experimental and theoretical results hydroxyl carboxyl and carbonyl groups can act as electron donors to promote pm decomposition resulting in the enhancement of dcf oxidation hence possible rmns involve mn iii mn iv mn vi and mn v yu et al 2020b zhu et al 2019 that may be produced during pm decomposition were further investigated high valence mn species mn vi and mn v as rmns that may be formed and boost contaminants oxidation gao et al 2019 herein the existence of mn vi and mn v were detected first using uv vis spectra and the characteristic peaks of mn vi and mn v at 606 nm and 667 nm respectively simandi et al 1984 fig s16 depicts no absorption peaks appear at the corresponding position in the rgo pm system which might be resulted from the instability of mn vi and mn v at near neutral ph shi et al 2020 moreover methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was used as a probe compound to further identify the presence of mn vi and mn v pmso can be converted to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 by high valence mn with a stoichiometric ratio of 1 1 chen et al 2020 as displayed in fig 2f and s17 the yield of pmso2 η pmso2 were approaching 100 with different dosages of pmso solution 50 500 μm meanwhile the addition of pmso can influence the dcf degradation in the rgo pm system fig s17 with the increase of pmso concentration more significant inhibition of dcf degradation was observed it indicates that rmns are largely formed in both the pm alone system and the rgo pm system and contribute primarily to the degradation of dcf in addition mno2 may be formed in reaction process which could promote the elimination of organics via adsorption and oxidation wang et al 2021 therefore the role of in situ formed mno2 for dcf removal were also investigated the results of xps and uv vis analysis show that mno2 was formed on the surface of rgo after reaction in the rgo pm system fig s16 and s18 however the contribution of mno2 to dcf removal is negligible fig s19a mno2 may be the final reduction product of pm rather than the active manganese species furthermore the low inhibition effect of pyrophosphate fig s19b on dcf removal and the absent of the specific peak of mn iii pyrophosphate complex in the uv vis spectra obtained from the rgo pm system fig s20 demonstrate the low contribution of mn iii for dcf removal text s6 the possible contribution of free radicals was excluded through quenching experiments fig s21 and text s6 based on the above results it can be concluded that high valence mn species mn vi and mn v are formed to contribute to dcf removal while mno2 appears as the final reduction product of pm noteworthily the analysis of rgo derivatives treated by nitric acid fig s22 depicts that a well fitted linear relationship r2 0 912 between pm decomposition rate and oxygen content of rgo derivatives was observed the correlation of k obs of dcf degradation to that of pm decomposition shows a relatively poor positive linear relationship r2 0 687 indicating that there may be other dominant activation pathways except for rgo mediated direct decomposition of pm to produce rmns 3 3 structural defects mediated electron transfer from dcf to pm as mentioned above rgo mediated electron transfer from dcf to pm may also contribute to dcf oxidation therefore the galvanic oxidation process gop was utilized to quantitatively analyze the rgo mediated electron transfer between pm and dcf the gop device consists of two half cells connected by an agarose bridge in which graphite electrodes coated with rgo are connected by an ammeter to monitor the relative current during the reaction fig 3 a two half cells were used to hold pm and dcf solutions respectively so that dcf can only be oxidized via electron transfer route instead of oxidized by rmns in the gop system peng et al 2021 as shown in fig 3b no obvious current was detected in two contrasting systems without pm or without dcf however when pm was coupled with dcf in the gop system the current value increased sharply and reached the maximum value 24 4 μa at 3 min then gradually decreased and maintained at 1 4 μa in the final stage moreover pm decomposition and dcf degradation were also monitored in the gop system fig 3c it can be seen that in the presence of pm and dcf about 76 of dcf was eventually removed in the reaction meanwhile the pm decomposition rate in the gop system reaches almost 100 in the presence of dcf while the pm decomposition rate is only 26 in the absence of dcf it suggests that rgo mediated electron transfer occurs only when pm and dcf are present together the above phenomena indicate that rgo can mediate the electron transfer from dcf to pm in the rgo pm system chronoamperometry tests were performed to further explore rgo mediated electron transfer between pm and dcf as displayed in fig 3d when 200 μm pm and 50 μm dcf were successively added the output current of glassy carbon electrode with rgo coating decreased markedly which is direct evidence that rgo mediated electron transfer process occurred between pm and dcf noteworthily the output current was significantly impacted by the first addition of pm indicating that pm can react directly with rgo which is consistent with the experimental results that oxygen containing groups can induce the decomposition of pm however adding dcf first has no effect on the current which indicates that rgo cannot oxidize directly dcf the electrochemical tests confirm that dcf can be oxidized by rgo mediated electron transfer to further analyze rgo induced electron transfer pathway for dcf oxidation in the rgo pm system the molecular orbital mo energy of rgo dcf and pm were investigated by dft calculation as displayed in fig 4 and table s6 the homo of dcf 4 96 ev is more negative than that of the lumo of rgo 3 95 ev the electrons localized at the homo of dcf could migrate to the lumo of rgo and induce the oxidation of dcf due to the narrowest energy gap 0 327 ev electron transfer from the lumo to the homo of rgo can be easily achieved subsequently electrons at homo of rgo 4 28 ev could be injected into the lumo of pm 2 99 ev resulting in pm decomposition shao et al 2020 wang et al 2021 dft study indicates that rgo mediated electron transfer from dcf to pm was driven by energy gaps therefore integrated with the above electrochemical analysis and theoretical results we conclude that rgo can act as electron mediator to accelerate electron transfer from dcf to pm and thus lead to the oxidation of dcf and the decomposition of pm defect sites in carbon networks were reported to be active centers by binding with peroxides e g peroxydisulfate and peroxymonosulfate to form highly reactive carbon peroxide complexes duan et al 2016a generally rgo is inherently produced with structural defects such as edge sites and vacancies which can break the homogeneity of graphene lattice and conjugated π network to produce unpaired electrons and delocalized π electrons the unpaired electrons can improve the surface reactivity of rgo and facilitate interaction between rgo and pm and the delocalized π electrons can significantly improve the electron mobility in the redox reactions wang et al 2020 to explore the influence of structural defects on the catalytic activity of rgo a series of rgo derivatives were prepared by thermal annealing at different temperatures 800 1200 c raman spectra were conducted to characterize the defective degree of these derivatives fig s23a the intensity ratio of the d band and g band id ig an indicator of defective degree zhang et al 2019 increases from 0 89 to 1 52 with the temperature increasing from 700 to 1000 c whereas it drops to 1 33 when the temperature rises to 1200 c noteworthily the performance of the rgo derivative pm system for dcf removal obviously increases with the increase of defective degree fig s23b as id ig value increasing from 0 89 to 1 52 the k obs of dcf removal increases from 0 113 to 0 229 min 1 fig 3e depicts a positive linear relationship r2 0 827 between lnk obs of dcf removal and id ig ratio implying that higher defect degree is conducive to dcf oxidation in addition in order to further investigate the role of structural defects for electron transfer route of dcf oxidation the pm decomposition caused only by electron transfer and id ig ratio were linearly fitted pm decomposition caused by electron transfer is obtained by subtracting the pm decomposition in the rgo pm system without dcf from the pm decomposition in the rgo pm dcf system as shown in fig 3f a well fitted and positive linear relationship r2 0 940 was established between lnk obs of pm decomposition and id ig which is sufficient evidence that the high defect degree is favorable to rgo mediated electron transfer between dcf and pm and the defect sites are the active sites for inducing electron transfer therefore it can be expected that the decrease in defect abundance of rgo will reduce its catalytic activity raman analysis suggest that the structural defects and graphitization of rgo after 5 cycles were remarkably deteriorated resulting in the regression of rgo performance during cycling tests as it severely limited the rgo mediated electron transfer pathway as shown in fig s24 the k obs of dcf removal sharply reduced from 0 113 to 0 036 min 1 after 5 cycles the deterioration of defects of rgo was ameliorated by heat treatment and as expected its catalytic performance was also obviously restored fig s24 the k obs of dcf removal recovered to 0 093 min 1 after heat treatment suggesting heat treatment is an effective way to recover the reactivity of rgo moreover dft calculation was performed to further confirm the role of structural defects herein the interaction between pm and particular positions of rgo models basal plane basal plane vacancy armchair edge and zigzag edge were investigated fig s25 the vacancy defects were simulated by base plane vacancy which was obtained by removing one carbon atom from the graphene the edge defects were modeled by armchair edge and zigzag edge all edged carbon atoms were saturated with hydrogen atoms to eliminate the dangling bonds as shown in table 1 the adsorption energies of pm on the basal plane vacancy armchair edge and zigzag edge were calculated as 1 09 ev 2 14 ev 1 78 ev and 1 43 ev respectively among different configurations vacancy defects and edge defects exhibit stronger adsorption energies compared to basal plane thus structural defects possess higher activity to react with pm therefore structural defects are the primarily active sites for rgo mediated electron transfer between organic contaminants and pm 3 4 regulating active sites of rgo for controllable pm oxidation pathway based on the above discussions rgo can boost pm oxidation towards organic contaminants via two approaches scheme 1 1 oxygen containing groups hydroxyl carboxyl and carbonyl of rgo can donate electrons to decompose pm and produce rmns mn vi and mn v eqs 1 2 resulting in fast oxidation of organic contaminants eqs 3 4 2 the structural defects of rgo mediate electron transfer from organic contaminants to pm resulting in strong acceleration of pm induced direct oxidation of organic contaminants eq 5 noteworthily both type and content of oxygen containing groups will affect the reactivity of rgo for enhancing pm oxidation the active sequence of oxygen containing groups for pm activation follows the order of hydroxyl group carboxyl group carbonyl group besides rgo with an appropriate low oxygen content 8 97 is conductive to boost pm oxidation while excessive oxygen content 8 97 results in poor pm activation structural defects especially vacancy and edge defects are the active centers where rgo mediated electron transfer occurs between pm and dcf rgo with high defect degree exhibits excellent catalytic performance for boosting pm oxidation in summary rgo can simultaneously act as electron donor oxygen containing groups and electron mediator vacancy and edge defects to enhance pm oxidation towards a variety of organic contaminants the abundance of two categories of active sites oxygen containing groups and structural defects will affect catalytic activity and pathway of rgo for boosting pm oxidation 1 mn vii aq e mn vi aq 2 mn vii aq 2e mn v aq 3 mn vi aq dcf mn iv s dcfox 4 mn v aq dcf mn iv s dcfox 5 dcf e rgo e pm dc f ox rgo mn iv s based on above mechanism discussion oxidation pathways of the rgo pm system can be designed by regulating oxygen functional groups and structural defects on rgo fig s26 displays the relationship between oxygen content and defect degree of rgo derivatives it can be seen that high oxygen content can destroy structural defects of rgo as excessive oxygen containing groups will occupy the defective sites vacancy and edge defects besides high oxygen content leads to the declined conjugated c c bonds and aromaticity chen et al 2018 therefore excessive oxygen will deteriorate the electron transfer capability resulting in obstruction of rgo mediated electron transfer pathway in view of the role of active sites in the catalytic pathway the changeover of rgo from electron donor to electron mediator can be achieved by regulating the type of active sites herein oxygen content and defect abundance of rgo were regulated by annealing rgo at different temperatures 800 1200 c it can be found that with the increase of annealing temperature the pm decomposition directly caused by rgo decreases gradually corresponding to the reduction of rmns generated by the electron donating groups to decompose pm while the pm decomposition caused by rgo mediated electron transfer increases gradually fig 5 noteworthily the pm decomposition caused by rgo mediated electron transfer is closely related to the change of defect degree id ig fig 3f in particular rgo 1200 was prepared by annealing in ultra pure nitrogen atmosphere at 1200 c for 3 h with plentiful structure defects id ig 1 33 but low oxygen content 1 65 dissimilar to rgo obtained at 700 c premixing rgo 1200 and pm shows no significant impact on dcf oxidation at premixing time ranging from 1 h to 12 h fig 2b it demonstrates that rgo 1200 serves as electron mediator between dcf and pm rather than electron donor to directly decompose pm therefore the dominant oxidation pathway can be controlled by adjusting the surface physicochemistry of rgo via thermal reduction process e g pyrolysis at high temperature under inert atmosphere or chemical oxidation process e g acid treatment the changeover in the role of rgo electron donor or electron mediator gives different characteristics to the rgo pm system the rgo pm system via electron donating pathway produce more active rmns which can decompose a wider range of organic pollutants while rgo as electron mediator enables the rgo pm system to exhibit higher pm utilization efficiency and long lasting reactivity of rgo peng et al 2021 4 conclusions in this work the activation mechanism and active sites of metal free carbocatalysts for enhancing pm oxidation were investigated oxygen containing groups and structural defects were identified as the primary active sites which can greatly affect the reactivity of carbocatalysts among various carbon materials rgo with tuned defective degree and quantity of oxygen functional groups exhibits excellent performance for enhancing pm oxidation towards a variety of organic contaminants two synergetic reaction pathways for oxidizing dcf in the rgo pm system was justified on the one hand rgo can act as electron donor to provide electrons to decompose pm inducing the formation of rmns mn vi and mn v which can further oxidize dcf and its intermediates on the other hand rgo mediated electron transfer from dcf to pm can also lead to the oxidation of dcf surface oxygen containing groups hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were justified as electron donating groups while structural defects vacancy and edge defects were shown to be critical for rgo mediated electron transfer in addition the dominant catalytic pathway of rgo can be controlled by regulating its oxygen containing groups content and structural defects we believe that the identification of the active sites and key structures in this study can provide deep insights into the catalytic behavior of metal free carbon materials the changeover from electron donor to electron mediator by regulating the physicochemical properties of carbon materials will be of great help to the design and application of carbocatalysts declaration of competing interest the authors

15946,the ability to differentiate anthropogenic signatures from natural processes in complex hydrological systems is critical for environmental regulation perspectives especially to curb pollution and implement effective water management strategies here we report variations in the concentrations of 57 chemical variables including nutrients major trace and ultra trace elements as well as the concentrations of escherichia coli in different water masses along the st lawrence river estuary continuum the constant ratios among major elements indicate consistent carbonate and silicate weathering processes in the drainage basins we also suggest applying ce anomalies to trace waters of low alkalinity and low complexing capacity as the dominance of ce3 free ion could promote ce oxidation and thus negative ce anomalies furthermore the positive eu anomalies and elevated tl concentrations could highlight the cation exchange processes on clay particles in the fluvial and estuarine sections of the st lawrence system we demonstrate significant contributions of wastewater discharge and discuss the suitability of several wastewater tracers e g excess of b na k as well as rb sr and gd anomalies we also highlight the inputs of several minor and trace elements e g mn fe cu co ni from south shore tributaries to the st lawrence system however the complex anthropogenic activities in the watersheds did not allow clear source partitioning finally increased mixing of different river water masses upstream of quebec city together with the estuarine salt front and suspended sediments are also responsible for releasing these minor and trace elements into the aquatic media the results presented here help support further environmental actions to curb the emission of contaminants in the st lawrence system and provide more robust tracers of natural and anthropogenic processes in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords st lawrence river contamination emission sources tracers wastewater 1 introduction global environmental declines commonly reflected through climate changes pollution resource degradation and biodiversity loss result from unequal and resource intensive development models and now represent a planetary emergency united nations environment programme 2021 vitousek et al 1997 among those environmental issues the burden of environmental pollution makes achieving the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs particularly challenging by negatively affecting water quality sdg 6 biodiversity sdgs 14 and 15 human health and social environmental justice sdgs 3 10 16 but also the inclusiveness safety resiliency and sustainability of human s settlements sdg 11 therefore the ability to control and curb pollution especially anthropogenic emissions of chemicals into the environment is critical for shifting towards sustainable development and reversing global environmental declines 1 1 environmental tracers for anthropogenic emissions for effective environmental management and pollution prevention tracking emission sources is critical as identified in several national and international environmental programs e g canadian environmental protection act usepa pollution prevention act eu s national air pollution control programme environmental tracers specific for various anthropogenic activities have been extensively investigated to identify and quantify contaminant inputs into the environment e g chemical and microbial markers radioactive and stable isotopes elemental and chemical compositions e g andral et al 2004 dang et al 2015a b montiel león et al 2019 shelley et al 2015 smith et al 2021 nevertheless effective and readily applicable tracers must be specific and distinguishable from the natural background even after significant dilution smith et al 2021 other factors to be considered are costs and the requirement for sophisticated analytical facilities and expertise hyer 2007 for example isotopic ratios or chemical markers are specific and effective tracers but remain less accessible because of the need for complex sample preparation and advanced analytical facilities e g mass spectrometry cloquet et al 2006 dang et al 2018b montiel león et al 2019 among the primary point and non point contamination sources in aquatic systems e g agriculture industry urban pollution municipal wastewater carries a comprehensive list of chemical and biological contaminants nutrients organic and inorganic micro contaminants anthropogenic radioisotopes microplastics pathogens crew et al 2020 gagnon and saulnier 2003 gogoi et al 2018 kasonga et al 2021 smith et al 2021 tran et al 2018 because of the large variability in removal efficiency not all are entirely removed by wastewater treatment plants wwtps before discharge into natural streams tran et al 2018 furthermore abnormal discharge events related to a malfunction or by pass also release untreated wastewater into aquatic ecosystems gagnon et al 2017 oursel et al 2013 therefore the ability to trace river water vs wastewater is critical to evaluate the potential impacts of the latter on the environment conventional and novel tracers have been developed and calibrated for this purpose including conductivity or chloride chemical and biological markers stable isotopes and elements commonly enriched in wastewater e g b rb sr gd anomaly dang et al 2022 2018a glassmeyer et al 2005 hatje et al 2016 kim et al 2020 smith et al 2021 to be effective in the decision making process an environmental tracer should be able to distinguish anthropogenic signatures from the natural background microbial indicators are known for their lack of specificity as they do not discriminate between human or animal sources glassmeyer et al 2005 alternately rb sr has been used as a wwtp tracer because the enrichment of rb relative to sr in biological matrices yields a significantly higher rb to sr ratio in wastewater than in receiving water media this tracer has been applied to the calcareous regions of geneva nirel and revaclier 1999 and the tidal fresh potomac river smith et al 2021 because of low rb sr backgrounds the second requirement of a good tracer is its conservative persistence in the receiving water bodies physical chemical and biological processes e g sorption photodegradation hydrolysis and biodegradation could degrade organic micropollutants in the wwtp and receiving media tran et al 2018 which alter the accurate quantification of tracers emission rates finally the appropriateness of a tracer for a given ecosystem and or urban population is crucial the gadolinium anomaly gd gd recently became a powerful tracer for municipal sewage because of its specificity for wastewater and hospital discharge and high persistence through wwtp treatment and environmental processes dang et al 2022 hatje et al 2016 kulaksiz and bau 2007 kümmerer and helmers 2000 pedreira et al 2018 the premise of this application is the successful gd based contrasting agents gbcas for medical resonance imaging 50 tons of gd are administered annually at the global scale wahsner et al 2019 however the extent of gd gd measured in wwtp effluents is largely variable e g 3 2 in montréal wwtp effluent dang et al 2022 297 along the han river song et al 2017 and up to 2 000 in berlin knappe et al 2005 this discrepancy could be related to wwtp treatment technologies the biogeochemistry of gd and or other factors intrinsic to the local population such as access to medical imaging and health care recommendations for the use of gbcas in fact because of suspected health risks associated with the injection of gbcas such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis novel gd free contrasting agents are gradually replacing gbcas erstad et al 2019 wahsner et al 2019 1 2 the st lawrence river and estuary the st lawrence river slr links the great lakes to the atlantic ocean slr waters travel from the lake ontario outlet at kingston to the ocean a distance of over 1 600 km figure 1 the system drains over 25 of the global freshwater supply and ranks thirteenth among the world s drainage basins i e 1 6 106 km2 environment canada 1996 the watershed is also home to one of the largest populations in the north american continent 45 106 inhabitants and hosts several major cities and industrial centers working group on the state of the st lawrence monitoring 2019 the st lawrence system is distinct from other large rivers due to its unique hydrological and geochemical features of lake runoff rather than that of free running streams yang et al 1996 furthermore the river flow is unidirectional with little friction between the tributary rivers this results in the absence of mixing and thus longitudinal stratification of the water masses environment canada 1996 in other words the tributary waters retain their physical chemical properties all the way to portneuf or ca 60 km upstream of québec city fig 1b these longitudinally stratified water masses are commonly referred to as north shore middle traverse and south shore because of the unique hydrology and morphology of the slr the system has been divided into five distinct sections fluvial section fluvial estuary upper estuary lower estuary and the gulf of st lawrence fig 1b see supporting text 1 for a detailed description of these segments extensive and long term characterization of water quality of the st lawrence system identified five main and nine secondary water masses environment canada 1996 yang et al 1996 table s1 this classification is based mainly on water chemistry driven by the geology and anthropogenic activities in the watersheds briefly the northern lakes e g lake superior and rivers e g ottawa river st maurice river drain the precambrian shield with low population density and anthropogenic activities consequently these waters are relatively dilute having low concentrations of total dissolved solids tds but enriched in si total dissolved fe and dissolved organic matter in contrast the southern shore water tributaries e g richelieu and st françois rivers drain the canadian appalachians and the st lawrence lowlands where calcareous phyllosilicate and paleozoic carbonates dominate the geology thus the dissolution of carbonate and evaporites leads to tds increases in those rivers on the other hand the watersheds of a few southern shore tributaries e g yamaska and richelieu rivers are home to several industries specializing in agri food chemical metal processing and intensive agriculture laliberte 2015 the water quality signature is thus characterized by elevated concentrations of nutrients as well as legacy and emerging chemicals hudon and carignan 2008 montiel león et al 2019 yang et al 1996 finally the discharge of the montréal wwtp represents a significant volume of treated water into the slr i e 3 5 106 m3 of treated water daily which appears as a distinctive water mass of dark blue colour marcogliese et al 2015 given the complex hydrology and geology of the slr system combined with intense anthropogenic activities extensive environmental management efforts have been in place since the 1980s e g the st lawrence action plan since 1988 concrete objectives are to quantify the chemical inputs from major sources reduce toxic effluents conserve and develop natural habitats and other socio economic and knowledge transfer objectives melcc and eccc 2021 quémerais et al 1996 nevertheless the slr is currently deemed poor quality because of elevated nutrient and chemical concentrations environment and climate change canada 2021 the ability to distinguish anthropogenic emissions from complex hydrological and geochemical processes in the watershed is essential for preserving the water quality of this important hydrological system this study therefore aims to distinguish anthropogenic emissions from natural processes in the st lawrence river and estuary by assessing 57 chemical variables and the concentrations of e coli 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and treatment during a research expedition mission annuelle du lampsilis mal 2020 on the r v lampsilis from july 20th to august 19th 2020 a total of 52 surface water samples were collected from 24 stations located along the slr i e from lake st louis upstream of montréal to the confluence of the slr with the saguenay fjord fig 1 at each station water samples were collected along a transect across the river e g closer to the northern shore in the middle of the river channel and or along the southern shore and filtered 0 45 µm into prewashed ldpe bottles see dang et al 2022 and supporting text 2 for further information although the sampling regime was not strictly related to the river water masses identified in section 1 2 and table s1 overall stations 1 to 14 correspond to the fluvial section stations 16 18 are within the fluvial estuary while stations 19 24 are in the upper estuary fig 1 according to the hydrology of the slr the longitudinal stratification of river water masses occurs until portneuf which lies between stations 16 and 17

trace elements e g mn fe rare earth elements against a nobias pre concentration method for both river and seawater dang et al 2022 2 3 principal component analysis pca the dataset of 58 variables in all 52 water samples was used as the input for a pca using a matlab algorithm more details are provided in previous publications dang et al 2018b 2015a however because of the different nature of freshwater vs seawater samples e g overwhelming effects of salt concentrations as well as conservative vs non conservative behaviours of the elements during the estuarine transition we also performed

are sharply elevated concentrations of elements comprising pca groups 2 3 4 fig 5 and fig s5 the following discussion will focus on distinguishing anthropogenic emission sources from natural processes and the applicability of using different tracers for wwtp discharge 4 1 natural geochemical processes and signatures of tributary rivers 4 1 1 conventional elemental tracers of natural fluvial processes the occurrence of several freshwater masses in the slr system table s1 results in distinctive concentrations of major elements in different tributary rivers the middle traverse and southern channel waters are significantly enriched in tds and major elements compared to the northern tributaries fig 4b and fig 5 while the latter are characterized by high doc but low ph and dic fig 2 b d e these features have been well characterized by previous hydrological and geochemical studies of the st lawrence system environment canada 1996 rondeau et al 2005 yang et al 1996 despite the large variability in elemental concentrations observed along the slr system the relative concentrations of major elements ca mg na k sr and dic fig 3 and fig s6 are consistent for natural waters first the dic to ca ratio of all the river samples is approximately 2 28 fig 3a which is in agreement with the value of 2 21 reported by gaillardet et al 1999 for the st lawrence river and confirms that carbonate weathering is one of the major processes in the drainage basin similarly we also observed significant correlations between mg na k fig 3 sr fig s6 and ca concentrations indicative of consistent geochemical sources of major elements in the slr waters however there is a positive deviation of na k and sr from the regression line red arrow in fig 3 c and d and fig s6a at station 5 as well as a lack of correlation between rb and ca fig s6b while precipitation of secondary carbonate minerals could remove ca ions from the water thus leading to the increase in cations ca ratios gaillardet et al 2019 thermodynamic calculations predict undersaturation states of calcium carbonate minerals in the slr waters lavoie et al 2021 therefore the increase in na k and sr concentrations relative to calcium could be related to anthropogenic emissions further discussed in section 4 2 furthermore we observed an increase in the concentrations of minor and trace elements near the mouth of the southern tributaries stations 11 and 13 in lake st pierre water collected along the southern shore of station 11 reflects the water mass from the richelieu river secondary water mass d table s1 while station 13 toward the centre of the lake would mainly be receive waters from the yamaska and st françois rivers interestingly there is an increase in the concentrations of all elements of pca group 2 e g al group 3 e g fe and group 4 e g mn in the sample collected from the south shore of station 13 whereas only mn cu ni co concentrations increased group 4 fig 5 in the sample collected from the south shore of station 11 this discrepancy would suggest distinct sources of contamination from those two south shore tributaries in fact after normalizing fe and mn to al concentrations figure s7 the enrichment of mn and other group 4 elements is observed only at the richelieu river station 11 making this river a significant source of mn cu ni and co to the slr it is however important to note that this trend was not reported in previous studies the concentrations of dissolved and particulate heavy metals in the richelieu river mouth have always been lower than those of the st françois and yamaska rivers quémerais et al 1996 rondeau et al 2005 lastly the gradual increase in the concentrations of elements from pca groups 2 3 and 4 in the pre mtz stations 16 18 and the mtz stations 19 and 20 could be associated with the gradual mixing of different river water masses until portneuf followed by complex processes in the mtz including desorption from suspended particles these processes have been extensively documented in the upper estuary of the st lawrence system silverberg and sundby 1979 takayanagi and gobeil 2000 briefly the sediment texture at stations 19 and 20 mtz is dominated mainly by clay and silt silverberg and sundby 1979 the desorption of elements from resuspended particles and the sediment porewater contribution are chiefly responsible for the increase in the dissolved elements of pca groups 2 3 and 4 fig 5 at the seaward side of the mtz stations 21 22 the removal of minor and trace elements is attributed mainly to three removal mechanisms i e flocculation or salt induced coagulation authigenic formation of aluminosilicates and sorption dang et al 2022 takayanagi and gobeil 2000 4 1 2 ree patterns and anomalies rees have been used extensively as powerful tracers for various biogeochemical processes e g sorption redox water mass transport and oceanic mixing e g dang et al 2022 de baar et al 2018 garcia solsona and jeandel 2020 pourret and tuduri 2017 rousseau et al 2015 here we calculate the anomalies of ce and eu e g ce ce and eu eu fig 6 a and b as these elements are distinct from other rees in aquatic ecosystems because of the occurrence of one additional redox valence ceiv and euii to the conventional reeiii the cerium anomaly is commonly used as a redox tracer because the oxidation of dissolved ceiii into particulate ceiv selectively fractionates this element from other neighbouring rees this oxidative transformation is commonly observed either in the river water or during the estuarine transition dang et al 2022 lawrence and kamber 2006 nozaki et al 2000 sholkovitz 1995 in the st lawrence river and estuary ce ce varies within a narrow range from 0 7 to 1 2 fig 6a nevertheless the north channel waters have ce ce values 0 85 0 06 n 17 significantly lower than the middle traverse 0 92 0 05 n 20 p 0 0005 and the south shore waters 0 93 0 12 n 15 p 0 02 inconsistent ce anomalies have been reported in different river systems worldwide e g no ce anomaly ce ce 1 was seen in the amazon and chao phraya rivers but significant ce anomalies ce ce 0 37 were observed in the mississippi and connecticut rivers nozaki et al 2000 sholkovitz 1995 oxidative processes promoting ce anomalies include surface reactions especially on the colloidal fraction and biologically mediated oxidation sholkovitz 1995 among the primary and secondary water masses of the st lawrence system lower ce ce values in the north shore waters compared to the middle traverse and southern shore are associated with lower ph and dic in the former fig 2b and fig 7 a these water quality features may directly affect the chemical speciation of ce and thus its oxidation among dissolved inorganic complexes of ce carbonate appears to be the most dominant luo and byrne 2004 therefore in north shore waters with low concentrations of dic and other ions dissolved inorganic ce would exist mainly as ce3 free ions thus favouring the oxidative transformation into particulate ceiv therefore the lower ce ce values constitute a specific natural signature reflecting the chemistry of the north shore waters of the st lawrence system i e low alkalinity and low complexing capacity the europium anomaly is another important feature of ree patterns as the suspended loads especially the clay fraction in major rivers are characterized by positive eu anomalies bayon et al 2015 goldstein and jacobsen 1988 the positive eu anomalies in river samples were subsequently associated with dissolution from suspended particles and higher stability in solution by forming dissolved complexes nozaki et al 2000 in the slr samples we observed an increase in eu eu in the fluvial section up to 7 followed by a decrease to 1 2 0 1 no anomaly in the upper estuary section fig 6b it is important to note that the eu anomalies in particle loads of the global river system are mainly associated with plagioclase and clay minerals where eu2 substitutes for ca2 bayon et al 2015 song et al 2017 thus the high eu eu could be associated with these fine particles occurring in the landward side of the slr fluvial section furthermore we observed a significant correlation between eu eu and ca al in the fluvial water r2 0 86 fig 7b this finding suggests that the surface competition of dissolved major cations e g ca mg for eu2 on clay particles is responsible for releasing eu back into the water the eu displacement from clay particles is further corroborated by the gradual decrease in tl in the same section of the slr fig 5f in the earth s critical zone thallium occurs mainly as tli especially tl with a similar ionic radius as k rb and cs shannon 1976 consequently tl substitutes for these monovalent cations in several clay minerals giving the latter a pivotal role in the transport of tl given the exchangeable and reversible interactions between tl and the reactive sites tl could be readily mobilized back to the dissolved fraction with changing conditions in the aquatic media e g increasing ionic strengths or concentrations of monovalent cations martin et al 2018 in fact the variations in tl and eu eu along the slr fig s8 are somewhat similar although there are more variations in eu eu therefore the eu anomaly and tl could indicate the occurrence of clay particles carried into the slr and cation exchange processes on these particles releasing eu and tl back into the dissolved fraction finally despite the consistent physical and chemical properties of the rees the relative concentrations of different rees depending upon their absolute molar mass could also indicate environmental fractionation processes ree fractionation in the section from the upper estuary toward the gulf of st lawrence has been extensively discussed emphasizing the oxygen minimum zone dang et al 2022 briefly the concentration ratios between the non lanthanide y and ho a lanthanide with a similar ionic radius as well as between a heavy ree e g er and a light ree e g nd could indicate a trend in ree patterns and associated geochemical reactions occurring in different water masses the results here are consistent with those reported by dang et al 2022 there is no ree fractionation in freshwaters of the slr as the measured molar y ho and er nd ratios across the fluvial section stations 1 18 n 41 fig 6 d and e i e 52 2 8 8 and 0 06 0 01 are consistent with the particulate values 51 2 3 9 and 0 05 0 01 n 79 dang et al 2022 and with the upper continental crust y houcc 46 9 and er nducc 0 073 rudnick and gao 2003 this suggests that no other geochemical processes affect the geochemistry of the rees in the fluvial section of the slr in other words as previously discussed any ce and eu anomalies observed are specific to oxidative fractionation and exchange on reactive surfaces 4 2 tracers of wwtp given the significant contribution of wastewater treated or untreated to the slr environment and climate change canada 2017 gagnon and saulnier 2003 marcogliese et al 2015 the ability to determine a set of tracers that is specific for wastewater and also appropriate for the complex hydrological and geochemical processes of the slr is critical here we evaluate a series of conventional and emerging tracers for wwtp discharge e g b na k rb sr and gd gd both the pca section 3 2 and the assessment of major element ratios section 4 1 1 point toward a specific group of five elements i e b na k mo and sb or group 1b table 1 and fig 4a that could be used to complement nutrient and e coli abundance in tracing the wwtp discharge this is particularly apparent at station 5 where a positive deviation from the correlation of these elements with ca is noticeable red arrow fig 3 three elements in pca group 1b are indeed known to be enriched in wastewater i e na and k arienzo et al 2009 and b guinoiseau et al 2018 for the two others mo and sb traditional wastewater treatment methods are not very effective verbinnen et al 2013 therefore we calculated the excess concentrations of pca group 1b elements x i e xexcess as the difference between the measured concentrations xmeas and the calculated concentrations based on the regression line with ca i e xcalc according to the following equation eq 4 x e x c e s s x m e a s x c a l c x m e a s c a m e a s s x c a i x c a where sx ca and ix ca refer to the slope and intercept of the regression line between x and ca after excluding wwtp impacted water samples see the green regression line in fig 3 subsequently we calculated the excess of these elements in percentage xexcess by dividing the excess concentrations xexcess by the measured concentration xmeas and multipling by 100 overall the percentages of k and na excesses are consistent fig 8 a showing depletion kexcess of 11 1 9 n 6 from stations 1 to 4 then surging to 53 64 at station 5 indicating a significant contribution from wastewater discharge the excesses gradually decrease before gradually rising to 7 6 in the pre mtz area stations 17 18 this increase in the pre mtz area can be associated with natural processes i e water mixing and desorption from particles see section 4 1 that release a small yet detectable 10 fraction of na and k back into the water there is also a significant decrease in naexcess and kexcess in the st maurice river 14 and 11 respectively see the triangle pointing down in fig 8a the distinct chemical signature of the st maurice river high doc low ph and dic significantly depletes ca and other group 1a elements relative to na and k given the local and distinctive features of the pre mtz zone and st maurice river the calculation of naexcess and kexcess based on the regression with ca seems to be an appropriate tracer for the significant contribution of treated wastewater discharge ca 60 at the outlet i e station 5 the bexcess pattern is similar to that of na and k except for a positive b excess 11 n 6 at stations 1 4 where negative naexcess and kexcess values were observed fig 8b samples from stations 1 4 also have the highest tl and eu eu values fig s8 that we previously associated with desorption from clay particles and competition by monovalent cations na and k see section 4 1 2 interestingly b is also known to be enriched in clay rich sediments butterwick et al 1989 furthermore in the samples at stations 1 4 we observed a slight negative deviation of k from the regression line with ca whereas there was a positive deviation for b red symbols fig s9 this observation corroborates the previous hypothesis of displacement from clay particles based on tl and eu eu in other words the positive bexcess in these pre wwtp water samples is driven by a natural process in lake st pierre bexcess remains close to zero unlike na and k where there was more significant variations at station 13 and a gradual increase in the pre mtz area this finding suggests that bexcess would be a more specific tracer for wwtp discharge than k and na in the st lawrence river this observation is somewhat different to the recommendation of the canadian environmental quality guidelines stating that municipal wastewater effluent in canada is less likely to be a source of b because the low b concentrations measured in treated effluents from two wwtps 10 16 7 µm would be overwhelmed by the geochemical background ccme 2009 however the b concentrations 4 4 µm measured at station 5 outlet of the montréal s wwtp remain distinguishable from background concentrations ca 1 6 µm figure s1g we also evaluated rb sr as a potential tracer for wwtp nirel and revaclier 1999 smith et al 2021 while this ratio is higher at station 5 0 014 than the background value 0 005 it is significantly lower than a few north shore rivers e g 0 047 at the mouth of st maurice river or 0 028 in l assomption river fig 8c there is a significant increase in rb concentrations in the wwtp outlet station 5 and in the middle of lake st pierre station 13 figure s3b which could be interpreted as either a potential increase in wastewater discharge or natural weathering processes nirel and revaclier 1999 however sr is significantly depleted in the low ph and low dic water of the north shore tributaries figure s1d due to the weathering of silicate dominated and shield terrains yang et al 1996 this sr depletion is translated into an increase in rb sr ratios that can not be solely associated with anthropogenic emissions in other words the understanding of geochemical processes within the watershed and water bodies is critical for using rb sr to trace wwtp discharge finally gd gd has been associated with wastewater discharge especially from hospitals and urban areas where the population has access to medical resonance imaging hatje et al 2016 kümmerer and helmers 2000 tepe et al 2014 gadolinium anomalies in the estuarine water of the slr in winter 2020 and at the two wwtp discharges of this study were discussed by dang et al 2022 here we elaborate on gd gd of the whole fluvial and estuarine sections in summer 2020 fig 6c most of the river samples do not have an anthropogenic gd anomaly signature i e gd gd is below the 1 4 threshold of the natural gd anomaly dang et al 2022 de baar et al 2018 only the two water samples collected at stations 5 and 6 have elevated gd gd ratios 2 8 and 3 3 respectively although the gd gd values are not as high as in other major cities e g hundreds to thousands in the han river or main rivers in berlin knappe et al 2005 song et al 2017 they indicate the signature of anthropogenic gd from the wwtp and confirm the results of other more conventional tracers e g b na k excess and rb sr 5 conclusion we applied multivariate analysis to a large number of variables 58 and specific elemental ratios to investigate the geochemistry of multiple water masses in the st lawrence system the results allow an in depth understanding of weathering and aquatic geochemical processes and facilitate new tracer applications for these processes we suggest that negative ce anomalies in river waters could be used as a tracer of waters of low alkalinity and low complexing capacity the dominance of ce3 as a free ion promotes ce oxidation and thus ce anomalies furthermore eu anomalies and tl concentrations can also indicate the occurrence of clay particles because cation exchange processes could displace eu and tl from these particles leading to higher dissolved tl concentrations and positive eu anomalies the results highlight the ability to distinguish anthropogenic signatures from natural processes this is particularly important for conventional tracers such as na k and b as these elements tend to be less specific for a single source or process however consistent weathering processes leading to a constant relationship with ca allow the determination of the excess of these elements which could be compared to rb sr and gd anomalies in general b excess seems to be a more specific tracer than na and k as the latter are involved in cation exchange processes however rb sr is not applicable for the slr at least for the low ph and low carbonate waters on the st lawrence northern shore in the slr system the discharge of wastewater is the primary source of e coli nutrients and a cocktail of inorganic elements classified by pca as group 1b b na k mo sb group 3 fe rb cs and group 4 mn co ni cu we also observed the significant discharge of these elements from two south shore tributaries i e the richelieu river group 4 elements and the yamaska st françois rivers elements of groups 2 3 and 4 because the watersheds of these rivers host complex anthropogenic activities e g municipal agriculture and industrial more in depth characterization of the tracers is required to assign specific emission sources finally we observed a gradual increase in the concentrations of minor and trace elements in the pre mtz followed by a spike in the mtz these are more likely associated with natural processes resulting from river water mixing in the pre mtz and the estuarine processes at the mtz this clear distinction between anthropogenic emissions and natural processes is critical for quantifying contamination release rates thus curbing pollution and effective water resource management of the st lawrence and other riverine systems declaration of competing

15946,the ability to differentiate anthropogenic signatures from natural processes in complex hydrological systems is critical for environmental regulation perspectives especially to curb pollution and implement effective water management strategies here we report variations in the concentrations of 57 chemical variables including nutrients major trace and ultra trace elements as well as the concentrations of escherichia coli in different water masses along the st lawrence river estuary continuum the constant ratios among major elements indicate consistent carbonate and silicate weathering processes in the drainage basins we also suggest applying ce anomalies to trace waters of low alkalinity and low complexing capacity as the dominance of ce3 free ion could promote ce oxidation and thus negative ce anomalies furthermore the positive eu anomalies and elevated tl concentrations could highlight the cation exchange processes on clay particles in the fluvial and estuarine sections of the st lawrence system we demonstrate significant contributions of wastewater discharge and discuss the suitability of several wastewater tracers e g excess of b na k as well as rb sr and gd anomalies we also highlight the inputs of several minor and trace elements e g mn fe cu co ni from south shore tributaries to the st lawrence system however the complex anthropogenic activities in the watersheds did not allow clear source partitioning finally increased mixing of different river water masses upstream of quebec city together with the estuarine salt front and suspended sediments are also responsible for releasing these minor and trace elements into the aquatic media the results presented here help support further environmental actions to curb the emission of contaminants in the st lawrence system and provide more robust tracers of natural and anthropogenic processes in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords st lawrence river contamination emission sources tracers wastewater 1 introduction global environmental declines commonly reflected through climate changes pollution resource degradation and biodiversity loss result from unequal and resource intensive development models and now represent a planetary emergency united nations environment programme 2021 vitousek et al 1997 among those environmental issues the burden of environmental pollution makes achieving the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs particularly challenging by negatively affecting water quality sdg 6 biodiversity sdgs 14 and 15 human health and social environmental justice sdgs 3 10 16 but also the inclusiveness safety resiliency and sustainability of human s settlements sdg 11 therefore the ability to control and curb pollution especially anthropogenic emissions of chemicals into the environment is critical for shifting towards sustainable development and reversing global environmental declines 1 1 environmental tracers for anthropogenic emissions for effective environmental management and pollution prevention tracking emission sources is critical as identified in several national and international environmental programs e g canadian environmental protection act usepa pollution prevention act eu s national air pollution control programme environmental tracers specific for various anthropogenic activities have been extensively investigated to identify and quantify contaminant inputs into the environment e g chemical and microbial markers radioactive and stable isotopes elemental and chemical compositions e g andral et al 2004 dang et al 2015a b montiel león et al 2019 shelley et al 2015 smith et al 2021 nevertheless effective and readily applicable tracers must be specific and distinguishable from the natural background even after significant dilution smith et al 2021 other factors to be considered are costs and the requirement for sophisticated analytical facilities and expertise hyer 2007 for example isotopic ratios or chemical markers are specific and effective tracers but remain less accessible because of the need for complex sample preparation and advanced analytical facilities e g mass spectrometry cloquet et al 2006 dang et al 2018b montiel león et al 2019 among the primary point and non point contamination sources in aquatic systems e g agriculture industry urban pollution municipal wastewater carries a comprehensive list of chemical and biological contaminants nutrients organic and inorganic micro contaminants anthropogenic radioisotopes microplastics pathogens crew et al 2020 gagnon and saulnier 2003 gogoi et al 2018 kasonga et al 2021 smith et al 2021 tran et al 2018 because of the large variability in removal efficiency not all are entirely removed by wastewater treatment plants wwtps before discharge into natural streams tran et al 2018 furthermore abnormal discharge events related to a malfunction or by pass also release untreated wastewater into aquatic ecosystems gagnon et al 2017 oursel et al 2013 therefore the ability to trace river water vs wastewater is critical to evaluate the potential impacts of the latter on the environment conventional and novel tracers have been developed and calibrated for this purpose including conductivity or chloride chemical and biological markers stable isotopes and elements commonly enriched in wastewater e g b rb sr gd anomaly dang et al 2022 2018a glassmeyer et al 2005 hatje et al 2016 kim et al 2020 smith et al 2021 to be effective in the decision making process an environmental tracer should be able to distinguish anthropogenic signatures from the natural background microbial indicators are known for their lack of specificity as they do not discriminate between human or animal sources glassmeyer et al 2005 alternately rb sr has been used as a wwtp tracer because the enrichment of rb relative to sr in biological matrices yields a significantly higher rb to sr ratio in wastewater than in receiving water media this tracer has been applied to the calcareous regions of geneva nirel and revaclier 1999 and the tidal fresh potomac river smith et al 2021 because of low rb sr backgrounds the second requirement of a good tracer is its conservative persistence in the receiving water bodies physical chemical and biological processes e g sorption photodegradation hydrolysis and biodegradation could degrade organic micropollutants in the wwtp and receiving media tran et al 2018 which alter the accurate quantification of tracers emission rates finally the appropriateness of a tracer for a given ecosystem and or urban population is crucial the gadolinium anomaly gd gd recently became a powerful tracer for municipal sewage because of its specificity for wastewater and hospital discharge and high persistence through wwtp treatment and environmental processes dang et al 2022 hatje et al 2016 kulaksiz and bau 2007 kümmerer and helmers 2000 pedreira et al 2018 the premise of this application is the successful gd based contrasting agents gbcas for medical resonance imaging 50 tons of gd are administered annually at the global scale wahsner et al 2019 however the extent of gd gd measured in wwtp effluents is largely variable e g 3 2 in montréal wwtp effluent dang et al 2022 297 along the han river song et al 2017 and up to 2 000 in berlin knappe et al 2005 this discrepancy could be related to wwtp treatment technologies the biogeochemistry of gd and or other factors intrinsic to the local population such as access to medical imaging and health care recommendations for the use of gbcas in fact because of suspected health risks associated with the injection of gbcas such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis novel gd free contrasting agents are gradually replacing gbcas erstad et al 2019 wahsner et al 2019 1 2 the st lawrence river and estuary the st lawrence river slr links the great lakes to the atlantic ocean slr waters travel from the lake ontario outlet at kingston to the ocean a distance of over 1 600 km figure 1 the system drains over 25 of the global freshwater supply and ranks thirteenth among the world s drainage basins i e 1 6 106 km2 environment canada 1996 the watershed is also home to one of the largest populations in the north american continent 45 106 inhabitants and hosts several major cities and industrial centers working group on the state of the st lawrence monitoring 2019 the st lawrence system is distinct from other large rivers due to its unique hydrological and geochemical features of lake runoff rather than that of free running streams yang et al 1996 furthermore the river flow is unidirectional with little friction between the tributary rivers this results in the absence of mixing and thus longitudinal stratification of the water masses environment canada 1996 in other words the tributary waters retain their physical chemical properties all the way to portneuf or ca 60 km upstream of québec city fig 1b these longitudinally stratified water masses are commonly referred to as north shore middle traverse and south shore because of the unique hydrology and morphology of the slr the system has been divided into five distinct sections fluvial section fluvial estuary upper estuary lower estuary and the gulf of st lawrence fig 1b see supporting text 1 for a detailed description of these segments extensive and long term characterization of water quality of the st lawrence system identified five main and nine secondary water masses environment canada 1996 yang et al 1996 table s1 this classification is based mainly on water chemistry driven by the geology and anthropogenic activities in the watersheds briefly the northern lakes e g lake superior and rivers e g ottawa river st maurice river drain the precambrian shield with low population density and anthropogenic activities consequently these waters are relatively dilute having low concentrations of total dissolved solids tds but enriched in si total dissolved fe and dissolved organic matter in contrast the southern shore water tributaries e g richelieu and st françois rivers drain the canadian appalachians and the st lawrence lowlands where calcareous phyllosilicate and paleozoic carbonates dominate the geology thus the dissolution of carbonate and evaporites leads to tds increases in those rivers on the other hand the watersheds of a few southern shore tributaries e g yamaska and richelieu rivers are home to several industries specializing in agri food chemical metal processing and intensive agriculture laliberte 2015 the water quality signature is thus characterized by elevated concentrations of nutrients as well as legacy and emerging chemicals hudon and carignan 2008 montiel león et al 2019 yang et al 1996 finally the discharge of the montréal wwtp represents a significant volume of treated water into the slr i e 3 5 106 m3 of treated water daily which appears as a distinctive water mass of dark blue colour marcogliese et al 2015 given the complex hydrology and geology of the slr system combined with intense anthropogenic activities extensive environmental management efforts have been in place since the 1980s e g the st lawrence action plan since 1988 concrete objectives are to quantify the chemical inputs from major sources reduce toxic effluents conserve and develop natural habitats and other socio economic and knowledge transfer objectives melcc and eccc 2021 quémerais et al 1996 nevertheless the slr is currently deemed poor quality because of elevated nutrient and chemical concentrations environment and climate change canada 2021 the ability to distinguish anthropogenic emissions from complex hydrological and geochemical processes in the watershed is essential for preserving the water quality of this important hydrological system this study therefore aims to distinguish anthropogenic emissions from natural processes in the st lawrence river and estuary by assessing 57 chemical variables and the concentrations of e coli 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and treatment during a research expedition mission annuelle du lampsilis mal 2020 on the r v lampsilis from july 20th to august 19th 2020 a total of 52 surface water samples were collected from 24 stations located along the slr i e from lake st louis upstream of montréal to the confluence of the slr with the saguenay fjord fig 1 at each station water samples were collected along a transect across the river e g closer to the northern shore in the middle of the river channel and or along the southern shore and filtered 0 45 µm into prewashed ldpe bottles see dang et al 2022 and supporting text 2 for further information although the sampling regime was not strictly related to the river water masses identified in section 1 2 and table s1 overall stations 1 to 14 correspond to the fluvial section stations 16 18 are within the fluvial estuary while stations 19 24 are in the upper estuary fig 1 according to the hydrology of the slr the longitudinal stratification of river water masses occurs until portneuf which lies between stations 16 and 17

are sharply elevated concentrations of elements comprising pca groups 2 3 4 fig 5 and fig s5 the following discussion will focus on distinguishing anthropogenic emission sources from natural processes and the applicability of using different tracers for wwtp discharge 4 1 natural geochemical processes and signatures of tributary rivers 4 1 1 conventional elemental tracers of natural fluvial processes the occurrence of several freshwater masses in the slr system table s1 results in distinctive concentrations of major elements in different tributary rivers the middle traverse and southern channel waters are significantly enriched in tds and major elements compared to the northern tributaries fig 4b and fig 5 while the latter are characterized by high doc but low ph and dic fig 2 b d e these features have been well characterized by previous hydrological and geochemical studies of the st lawrence system environment canada 1996 rondeau et al 2005 yang et al 1996 despite the large variability in elemental concentrations observed along the slr system the relative concentrations of major elements ca mg na k sr and dic fig 3 and fig s6 are consistent for natural waters first the dic to ca ratio of all the river samples is approximately 2 28 fig 3a which is in agreement with the value of 2 21 reported by gaillardet et al 1999 for the st lawrence river and confirms that carbonate weathering is one of the major processes in the drainage basin similarly we also observed significant correlations between mg na k fig 3 sr fig s6 and ca concentrations indicative of consistent geochemical sources of major elements in the slr waters however there is a positive deviation of na k and sr from the regression line red arrow in fig 3 c and d and fig s6a at station 5 as well as a lack of correlation between rb and ca fig s6b while precipitation of secondary carbonate minerals could remove ca ions from the water thus leading to the increase in cations ca ratios gaillardet et al 2019 thermodynamic calculations predict undersaturation states of calcium carbonate minerals in the slr waters lavoie et al 2021 therefore the increase in na k and sr concentrations relative to calcium could be related to anthropogenic emissions further discussed in section 4 2 furthermore we observed an increase in the concentrations of minor and trace elements near the mouth of the southern tributaries stations 11 and 13 in lake st pierre water collected along the southern shore of station 11 reflects the water mass from the richelieu river secondary water mass d table s1 while station 13 toward the centre of the lake would mainly be receive waters from the yamaska and st françois rivers interestingly there is an increase in the concentrations of all elements of pca group 2 e g al group 3 e g fe and group 4 e g mn in the sample collected from the south shore of station 13 whereas only mn cu ni co concentrations increased group 4 fig 5 in the sample collected from the south shore of station 11 this discrepancy would suggest distinct sources of contamination from those two south shore tributaries in fact after normalizing fe and mn to al concentrations figure s7 the enrichment of mn and other group 4 elements is observed only at the richelieu river station 11 making this river a significant source of mn cu ni and co to the slr it is however important to note that this trend was not reported in previous studies the concentrations of dissolved and particulate heavy metals in the richelieu river mouth have always been lower than those of the st françois and yamaska rivers quémerais et al 1996 rondeau et al 2005 lastly the gradual increase in the concentrations of elements from pca groups 2 3 and 4 in the pre mtz stations 16 18 and the mtz stations 19 and 20 could be associated with the gradual mixing of different river water masses until portneuf followed by complex processes in the mtz including desorption from suspended particles these processes have been extensively documented in the upper estuary of the st lawrence system silverberg and sundby 1979 takayanagi and gobeil 2000 briefly the sediment texture at stations 19 and 20 mtz is dominated mainly by clay and silt silverberg and sundby 1979 the desorption of elements from resuspended particles and the sediment porewater contribution are chiefly responsible for the increase in the dissolved elements of pca groups 2 3 and 4 fig 5 at the seaward side of the mtz stations 21 22 the removal of minor and trace elements is attributed mainly to three removal mechanisms i e flocculation or salt induced coagulation authigenic formation of aluminosilicates and sorption dang et al 2022 takayanagi and gobeil 2000 4 1 2 ree patterns and anomalies rees have been used extensively as powerful tracers for various biogeochemical processes e g sorption redox water mass transport and oceanic mixing e g dang et al 2022 de baar et al 2018 garcia solsona and jeandel 2020 pourret and tuduri 2017 rousseau et al 2015 here we calculate the anomalies of ce and eu e g ce ce and eu eu fig 6 a and b as these elements are distinct from other rees in aquatic ecosystems because of the occurrence of one additional redox valence ceiv and euii to the conventional reeiii the cerium anomaly is commonly used as a redox tracer because the oxidation of dissolved ceiii into particulate ceiv selectively fractionates this element from other neighbouring rees this oxidative transformation is commonly observed either in the river water or during the estuarine transition dang et al 2022 lawrence and kamber 2006 nozaki et al 2000 sholkovitz 1995 in the st lawrence river and estuary ce ce varies within a narrow range from 0 7 to 1 2 fig 6a nevertheless the north channel waters have ce ce values 0 85 0 06 n 17 significantly lower than the middle traverse 0 92 0 05 n 20 p 0 0005 and the south shore waters 0 93 0 12 n 15 p 0 02 inconsistent ce anomalies have been reported in different river systems worldwide e g no ce anomaly ce ce 1 was seen in the amazon and chao phraya rivers but significant ce anomalies ce ce 0 37 were observed in the mississippi and connecticut rivers nozaki et al 2000 sholkovitz 1995 oxidative processes promoting ce anomalies include surface reactions especially on the colloidal fraction and biologically mediated oxidation sholkovitz 1995 among the primary and secondary water masses of the st lawrence system lower ce ce values in the north shore waters compared to the middle traverse and southern shore are associated with lower ph and dic in the former fig 2b and fig 7 a these water quality features may directly affect the chemical speciation of ce and thus its oxidation among dissolved inorganic complexes of ce carbonate appears to be the most dominant luo and byrne 2004 therefore in north shore waters with low concentrations of dic and other ions dissolved inorganic ce would exist mainly as ce3 free ions thus favouring the oxidative transformation into particulate ceiv therefore the lower ce ce values constitute a specific natural signature reflecting the chemistry of the north shore waters of the st lawrence system i e low alkalinity and low complexing capacity the europium anomaly is another important feature of ree patterns as the suspended loads especially the clay fraction in major rivers are characterized by positive eu anomalies bayon et al 2015 goldstein and jacobsen 1988 the positive eu anomalies in river samples were subsequently associated with dissolution from suspended particles and higher stability in solution by forming dissolved complexes nozaki et al 2000 in the slr samples we observed an increase in eu eu in the fluvial section up to 7 followed by a decrease to 1 2 0 1 no anomaly in the upper estuary section fig 6b it is important to note that the eu anomalies in particle loads of the global river system are mainly associated with plagioclase and clay minerals where eu2 substitutes for ca2 bayon et al 2015 song et al 2017 thus the high eu eu could be associated with these fine particles occurring in the landward side of the slr fluvial section furthermore we observed a significant correlation between eu eu and ca al in the fluvial water r2 0 86 fig 7b this finding suggests that the surface competition of dissolved major cations e g ca mg for eu2 on clay particles is responsible for releasing eu back into the water the eu displacement from clay particles is further corroborated by the gradual decrease in tl in the same section of the slr fig 5f in the earth s critical zone thallium occurs mainly as tli especially tl with a similar ionic radius as k rb and cs shannon 1976 consequently tl substitutes for these monovalent cations in several clay minerals giving the latter a pivotal role in the transport of tl given the exchangeable and reversible interactions between tl and the reactive sites tl could be readily mobilized back to the dissolved fraction with changing conditions in the aquatic media e g increasing ionic strengths or concentrations of monovalent cations martin et al 2018 in fact the variations in tl and eu eu along the slr fig s8 are somewhat similar although there are more variations in eu eu therefore the eu anomaly and tl could indicate the occurrence of clay particles carried into the slr and cation exchange processes on these particles releasing eu and tl back into the dissolved fraction finally despite the consistent physical and chemical properties of the rees the relative concentrations of different rees depending upon their absolute molar mass could also indicate environmental fractionation processes ree fractionation in the section from the upper estuary toward the gulf of st lawrence has been extensively discussed emphasizing the oxygen minimum zone dang et al 2022 briefly the concentration ratios between the non lanthanide y and ho a lanthanide with a similar ionic radius as well as between a heavy ree e g er and a light ree e g nd could indicate a trend in ree patterns and associated geochemical reactions occurring in different water masses the results here are consistent with those reported by dang et al 2022 there is no ree fractionation in freshwaters of the slr as the measured molar y ho and er nd ratios across the fluvial section stations 1 18 n 41 fig 6 d and e i e 52 2 8 8 and 0 06 0 01 are consistent with the particulate values 51 2 3 9 and 0 05 0 01 n 79 dang et al 2022 and with the upper continental crust y houcc 46 9 and er nducc 0 073 rudnick and gao 2003 this suggests that no other geochemical processes affect the geochemistry of the rees in the fluvial section of the slr in other words as previously discussed any ce and eu anomalies observed are specific to oxidative fractionation and exchange on reactive surfaces 4 2 tracers of wwtp given the significant contribution of wastewater treated or untreated to the slr environment and climate change canada 2017 gagnon and saulnier 2003 marcogliese et al 2015 the ability to determine a set of tracers that is specific for wastewater and also appropriate for the complex hydrological and geochemical processes of the slr is critical here we evaluate a series of conventional and emerging tracers for wwtp discharge e g b na k rb sr and gd gd both the pca section 3 2 and the assessment of major element ratios section 4 1 1 point toward a specific group of five elements i e b na k mo and sb or group 1b table 1 and fig 4a that could be used to complement nutrient and e coli abundance in tracing the wwtp discharge this is particularly apparent at station 5 where a positive deviation from the correlation of these elements with ca is noticeable red arrow fig 3 three elements in pca group 1b are indeed known to be enriched in wastewater i e na and k arienzo et al 2009 and b guinoiseau et al 2018 for the two others mo and sb traditional wastewater treatment methods are not very effective verbinnen et al 2013 therefore we calculated the excess concentrations of pca group 1b elements x i e xexcess as the difference between the measured concentrations xmeas and the calculated concentrations based on the regression line with ca i e xcalc according to the following equation eq 4 x e x c e s s x m e a s x c a l c x m e a s c a m e a s s x c a i x c a where sx ca and ix ca refer to the slope and intercept of the regression line between x and ca after excluding wwtp impacted water samples see the green regression line in fig 3 subsequently we calculated the excess of these elements in percentage xexcess by dividing the excess concentrations xexcess by the measured concentration xmeas and multipling by 100 overall the percentages of k and na excesses are consistent fig 8 a showing depletion kexcess of 11 1 9 n 6 from stations 1 to 4 then surging to 53 64 at station 5 indicating a significant contribution from wastewater discharge the excesses gradually decrease before gradually rising to 7 6 in the pre mtz area stations 17 18 this increase in the pre mtz area can be associated with natural processes i e water mixing and desorption from particles see section 4 1 that release a small yet detectable 10 fraction of na and k back into the water there is also a significant decrease in naexcess and kexcess in the st maurice river 14 and 11 respectively see the triangle pointing down in fig 8a the distinct chemical signature of the st maurice river high doc low ph and dic significantly depletes ca and other group 1a elements relative to na and k given the local and distinctive features of the pre mtz zone and st maurice river the calculation of naexcess and kexcess based on the regression with ca seems to be an appropriate tracer for the significant contribution of treated wastewater discharge ca 60 at the outlet i e station 5 the bexcess pattern is similar to that of na and k except for a positive b excess 11 n 6 at stations 1 4 where negative naexcess and kexcess values were observed fig 8b samples from stations 1 4 also have the highest tl and eu eu values fig s8 that we previously associated with desorption from clay particles and competition by monovalent cations na and k see section 4 1 2 interestingly b is also known to be enriched in clay rich sediments butterwick et al 1989 furthermore in the samples at stations 1 4 we observed a slight negative deviation of k from the regression line with ca whereas there was a positive deviation for b red symbols fig s9 this observation corroborates the previous hypothesis of displacement from clay particles based on tl and eu eu in other words the positive bexcess in these pre wwtp water samples is driven by a natural process in lake st pierre bexcess remains close to zero unlike na and k where there was more significant variations at station 13 and a gradual increase in the pre mtz area this finding suggests that bexcess would be a more specific tracer for wwtp discharge than k and na in the st lawrence river this observation is somewhat different to the recommendation of the canadian environmental quality guidelines stating that municipal wastewater effluent in canada is less likely to be a source of b because the low b concentrations measured in treated effluents from two wwtps 10 16 7 µm would be overwhelmed by the geochemical background ccme 2009 however the b concentrations 4 4 µm measured at station 5 outlet of the montréal s wwtp remain distinguishable from background concentrations ca 1 6 µm figure s1g we also evaluated rb sr as a potential tracer for wwtp nirel and revaclier 1999 smith et al 2021 while this ratio is higher at station 5 0 014 than the background value 0 005 it is significantly lower than a few north shore rivers e g 0 047 at the mouth of st maurice river or 0 028 in l assomption river fig 8c there is a significant increase in rb concentrations in the wwtp outlet station 5 and in the middle of lake st pierre station 13 figure s3b which could be interpreted as either a potential increase in wastewater discharge or natural weathering processes nirel and revaclier 1999 however sr is significantly depleted in the low ph and low dic water of the north shore tributaries figure s1d due to the weathering of silicate dominated and shield terrains yang et al 1996 this sr depletion is translated into an increase in rb sr ratios that can not be solely associated with anthropogenic emissions in other words the understanding of geochemical processes within the watershed and water bodies is critical for using rb sr to trace wwtp discharge finally gd gd has been associated with wastewater discharge especially from hospitals and urban areas where the population has access to medical resonance imaging hatje et al 2016 kümmerer and helmers 2000 tepe et al 2014 gadolinium anomalies in the estuarine water of the slr in winter 2020 and at the two wwtp discharges of this study were discussed by dang et al 2022 here we elaborate on gd gd of the whole fluvial and estuarine sections in summer 2020 fig 6c most of the river samples do not have an anthropogenic gd anomaly signature i e gd gd is below the 1 4 threshold of the natural gd anomaly dang et al 2022 de baar et al 2018 only the two water samples collected at stations 5 and 6 have elevated gd gd ratios 2 8 and 3 3 respectively although the gd gd values are not as high as in other major cities e g hundreds to thousands in the han river or main rivers in berlin knappe et al 2005 song et al 2017 they indicate the signature of anthropogenic gd from the wwtp and confirm the results of other more conventional tracers e g b na k excess and rb sr 5 conclusion we applied multivariate analysis to a large number of variables 58 and specific elemental ratios to investigate the geochemistry of multiple water masses in the st lawrence system the results allow an in depth understanding of weathering and aquatic geochemical processes and facilitate new tracer applications for these processes we suggest that negative ce anomalies in river waters could be used as a tracer of waters of low alkalinity and low complexing capacity the dominance of ce3 as a free ion promotes ce oxidation and thus ce anomalies furthermore eu anomalies and tl concentrations can also indicate the occurrence of clay particles because cation exchange processes could displace eu and tl from these particles leading to higher dissolved tl concentrations and positive eu anomalies the results highlight the ability to distinguish anthropogenic signatures from natural processes this is particularly important for conventional tracers such as na k and b as these elements tend to be less specific for a single source or process however consistent weathering processes leading to a constant relationship with ca allow the determination of the excess of these elements which could be compared to rb sr and gd anomalies in general b excess seems to be a more specific tracer than na and k as the latter are involved in cation exchange processes however rb sr is not applicable for the slr at least for the low ph and low carbonate waters on the st lawrence northern shore in the slr system the discharge of wastewater is the primary source of e coli nutrients and a cocktail of inorganic elements classified by pca as group 1b b na k mo sb group 3 fe rb cs and group 4 mn co ni cu we also observed the significant discharge of these elements from two south shore tributaries i e the richelieu river group 4 elements and the yamaska st françois rivers elements of groups 2 3 and 4 because the watersheds of these rivers host complex anthropogenic activities e g municipal agriculture and industrial more in depth characterization of the tracers is required to assign specific emission sources finally we observed a gradual increase in the concentrations of minor and trace elements in the pre mtz followed by a spike in the mtz these are more likely associated with natural processes resulting from river water mixing in the pre mtz and the estuarine processes at the mtz this clear distinction between anthropogenic emissions and natural processes is critical for quantifying contamination release rates thus curbing pollution and effective water resource management of the st lawrence and other riverine systems declaration of competing

15947,organic pollutants such as di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp interact with nanoplastics nps and change their bioavailability and toxicity to aquatic organisms this study aims to assess the ecotoxicological impacts of nps in the presence and absence of dehp on juvenile largemouth bass lmb micropterus salmoides therefore lmb was fed with diets containing various concentrations 0 2 10 and 40 mg g of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps by the weight of diets after a 21 day of psnps dietary exposure lmb was treated with dehp at 450 μg l through waterborne exposure for three days our results showed that psnps were accumulated in the intestinal tissues which significantly decreased the feeding and growth rates in lmb the histopathological analysis showed the intestine and liver of lmb were subjected to various degrees of structural damage caused by psnps and dehp psnp co exposure enhanced those histopathological damages in both tissues additionally the co exposure induced oxidative stress in terms of increased activities of glutathione s transferase catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes in the liver intestine spleen and serum furthermore the co exposure significantly changed the intestinal microbial composition i e the decrease in the abundance of probiotics bacteroidetes and proteobacteria and the increase in pathogenic bacteria firmicutes posed a great threat to fish metabolism and health therefore this study highlights that the presence of dehp enhances the toxicity of nps on lmb in freshwater and suggests the regulated use of plastic and its additives for improving the health status of aquaculture fish for food safety in humans graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate micropterus salmoides histopathology oxidative stress intestinal microbiota 1 introduction nanoplastics nps have been increasingly studied as emerging pollutants due to their ubiquitous presence and interactions with other biochemical entities in the aquatic environment junaid and wang 2021 with the growth of the human population the production and consumption of plastic and its additives have shown a significant increase during recent decades hou et al 2021 moreover the degradation of macroplastics into micro nano plastics mnps also increases the levels of plastic particles in the environment thus amplifying the associated ecotoxicological hazards peters et al 2017 pitt et al 2018 since the mnps ultimately remain in rivers lakes or oceans they pose a great challenge to the survival of aquatic organisms primarily fish ahrendt et al 2020 alomar et al 2021 therefore a great deal of research has been conducted on the ecotoxicological implications of mnps to aquatic organisms according to the previous studies polystyrene nanoplastics psnps accumulation in tissues disturbed energy metabolism and induced oxidative stress in zebrafish sarasamma et al 2020 numerous histopathological phenomena such as detachment hyperplasia shortening swelling of intestinal mucosa epithelium and vacuolization of enterocytes have been reported in the intestine of fish ingested mnps ahrendt et al 2020 it has also been found that nps are able to cross membranes core resulting in membrane structure alterations reduction of molecular diffusion and membrane softness thus severely affecting cell function gonzález fernández et al 2021 additionally xu et al 2021 and jin et al 2018 found that exposure to ps particles induced the intestinal microbiota dysbiosis of zebrafish in terms of a decrease in the abundance of probiotics and the increase in pathogenic bacteria as well as the change of the shannon index and richness posed a great threat to fish metabolism and health further the accumulation of mnps can considerably affect lipid metabolism food preference and behavior of the top consumers through food chain which interferes with the natural development of aquatic animals bianchi et al 2020 chae and an 2020 cedervall et al 2012 the polydisperse and heterogenic nature of environmental nps limits the development of toxicological research methods and the optimization of experimental conditions barria et al 2020 as nps below 0 1 µm in size cannot be visualized by photon microscopy therefore fluorescent treatment of nps for scientific research is becoming prevalent chae et al 2018 identifying the presence and concentration of nps by fluorescence intensity has become an accepted method by researchers for the semi quantitative detection of nps in organismal tissues gagné et al 2019 furthermore the fluorescence intensity is positively related to the concentration of nps for example the fluorescence ps np chronic exposure to adult zebrafish mainly accumulated and distributed in gonads intestine liver and brain by fluorescent intensity determination which caused abnormalities of locomotion activity aggressiveness and predator avoidance behavior sarasamma et al 2020 besides fluorescent nps were found in both fish and their offspring following the consumption of zooplankton containing nps which suggests that it affects fish reproduction and induce transgenerational toxicity yin et al 2018 therefore to conveniently trace the transfer of nps in fish fluorescent nps were selected as plastic particles of interest in this study in natural environment the coexistence of nps and other contaminants is unavoidable so there are more and more concerns regarding the conjunctive effects of nps and other pollutants nps may have interactions with contaminants and act as carriers for chemicals transfer into the aquatic organisms thus affecting the bioavailability and toxicity of these contaminants liu et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 had confirmed that co exposure of psnps and tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate tdcipp modified the bioavailability of tdcipp and the transgenerational thyroid disruption in zebrafish another study on d rerio zebrafish exposed to plastic particles and phenanthrene in mixture treatment caused oxidative stress and altered the expression of oxidative stress related genes xu et al 2021 additionally the characteristics of mnps such as size charge and shape can affect their interaction with contaminants and hence the associated toxicity when ingested by aquatic organisms can be altered xiong et al 2020 similarly di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp is extensively used as a plasticizer for softening polyvinyl chloride pvc products and exhibited widespread other applications husoy et al 2020 as a result of plastics degradation plastic products usually release additives such as dehp which can alter the physicochemical properties of plastic particles cormier et al 2021 further dehp has been extensively detected in the aquatic environment around the world particularly in north america europe and asia zolfaghari et al 2014 magdouli et al 2013 junaid et al 2018 moreover dehp itself exhibits multifaceted ecotoxicological implications e g it caused alterations in the locomotion patterns accompanied with elevated oxidative stress neurotoxicity and activation of the apoptosis pathways in o latipes medaka fish after 2 days of continuous exposure at 20 100 and 200 μg l yang et al 2018 cui et al 2021 found dehp exposure to hepatocytes partially activated the nod2 rip2 nf κb signal pathway then caused inflammatory response and hepatocytes apoptosis in grass carp similarly dehp exposure can induce ferroptosis iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation as well as massive pericardial edema and cardiac circulatory disturbances yin et al 2021 sun et al 2021 therefore the contamination of dehp can cause risks to the survival of aquatic organisms hence it is essential to investigate whether and how dehp and np combination affects aquatic species with economic importance from the perspective of their survival and health this study aims to investigated the impact of ps nps single and dehp psnp combined exposures on the growth oxidative stress histopathology as well as responses of the intestinal microbiota of micropterus salmoides lmb after ps nps dietary exposure for 21 days following dehp waterborne exposure for 3 days we highlighted the toxicity of psnps and dehp on one of the favorite aquatic food products lmb not only in terms of its yield and market value but also as a threat to human health and food safety it also appeals to control the use of plastics and dehp and search for ways to deal with their negative environmental consequences 2 materials and methods 2 1 ethical statement in this study we acclimated and cultivated the fish under standard laboratory conditions such as water and food requirements syxk 2013 100 all procedures were conducted in accordance with the guiding principles in the care and use of animals china and were approved by the laboratory animal ethics committee of the guangdong academy of agricultural science 2020g010 we tried our best to reduce fish suffering and ensure animal welfare 2 2 largemouth bass a commercial aquatic food product largemouth bass lmb micropterus salmoides is a freshwater fish native to north america and it rapidly became a very popular cultural species after its introduction to china habte tsion et al 2020 wu et al 2021 the production of lmb in china has sustained at about 200 000 tons every year of which guangdong province is the main breeding ground accounting for over 60 of the total domestic production jiang et al 2018 zebrafish is the most frequently used model fish in toxicological studies on fluorescent nps bhagat et al 2020 albeit only a few studies are available on lmb furthermore as lmb occupies a substantial position in the fish consumer market it is more meaningful to speed up the research on it for human health and food safety so we selected the lmb as the research object to conduct this study and fish were purchased from liang s aquatic seed industry company guangdong china and acclimatized in our laboratory as mention in the later section 2 3 chemicals green fluorescent polystyrene nanoplastics psnps spherical 500 nm diameter 1 w v were obtained from baseline technology

reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from guangzhou chemical reagent factory guangzhou china 2 4 experimental design fifty grams of the lmb commercial diet purchase from guangdong hengxing feed co ltd guangzhou approximate composition protein 60 lipid 15 moisture 4 were soaked in 200 ml of ammonia free water with 0 2 10 and 40 mg g n c control n l nps low level exposure 2 mg g n m nps medium level exposure 10 mg g n h nps high level exposure 40 mg g concentrations of green fluorescent psnps respectively the concentration of psnps was referenced to previous researches such as cedervall et al 2012 that highlighted the exposure of fluorescent psnps at 100 mg g to a food chain containing alga daphnia magna and crucian carp carassius carassius inducing the lipid metabolism and abnormal fish behavior pitt et al 2018 reported the exposure to fluorescent psnps at 0 1 1 and 10 mg g which affected physiology and behavior of zebrafish larvae and then the diet was swollen and stirred for five minutes to accelerate the absorption of psnps in the diet then the treated diet was dried and returned to its initial state and a fluorescence microscope was used to analyze if the psnps were properly absorbed on the surface or inside the diet as shown in fig 1 a a total of 180 healthy juvenile lmb initial body weight 2 44 0 05 g were acclimated with base commercial diet at 25 c 14 10 light dark photoperiod for two weeks in the aquatic laboratory south china agriculture of university guangdong china after acclimation fish were divided into four groups with triplicates 15 fish each tank for exposure experiment in a total of 12 glass tanks 5 l per tank with continuous aeration fish were fed regularly with apparent satiety at 9 00 and 18 00 and renewed the water every day the feeding experiment lasted for 21 days with dissolved oxygen above 6 20 mg l water temperature 25 8 27 2 c and ph 6 85 7 35 determined by ysi professional plus multiparameter instrument xylem inc usa then sampled the fish after the first sampling fish were acclimated in clean water for three days six fish from each group were randomly selected from the remaining fish and transferred to the other 12 tanks which were added with deph at 450 μg l dehp was dissolved in 10 ml dimethylsulfoxide solution with water 1 9 and then stirred in the tank the concentration of dehp was designed according to the results obtained by junaid et al 2018 using 7 days of dehp exposure at 100 800 µg l to zebrafish that activated the pi3k akt mtor pathway yang et al 2018 employing 21 days waterborne exposure to dehp 20 100 200 μg l for medaka fish oryzias latipes that altered the growth and locomotion and jia et al 2021 reported 21 days of dehp exposure 0 100 μg l to zebrafish that changed the expressions of genes related to intestinal metabolites and critical immune functions for ease of differentiation we have named the experimental subgroup co exposed to dehp and nps as d c 0 mg g nps 450 μg l dehp d l 2 mg g np 450 μg l dehp d m 10 mg g nps 450 μg l dehp and d h 40 mg g nps 450 μg l dehp the fish were exposed to dehp for three days then sampled again to assess the impact of combined exposure the sampling procedures was the same as the first sampling 2 5 fish sampling and growth assessment the total number and weight of the fish in each tank were recorded before sampling the growth assessment

accordance with the guiding principles in the care and use of animals china firstly six fish were randomly selected from each tank and swam freely for five minutes to clean the psnps or dehp from the surface of the fish then we tried to collect as much blood as possible by syringe and injected it into a 200 μl ep eppendorf tube from the fish serum was extracted from blood samples by centrifugation at 4000 r min for 10 min at 4 after keeping at room temperature for four hours afterwards we performed dissection to collect whole liver and intestine from three fish for the detection of nps accumulation through fluorescent intensity measurement another three fish were sampled to extract liver spleen intestine and intestinal contents for enzymatic activity determination and sequencing of 16s rrna and stored at 80 another portion of the liver and intestine were fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde for paraffin sections 2 6 microscopic detection of fluorescent intensity all whole livers and intestines freshly collected were placed in glass culverts for fluorescence observation captured images of the whole liver and intestine to assay fluorescence intensity using a fluorescence microscope leica dm400 b leica microsystems company shanghai china the intensity of fluorescence was determined by the image j software media cybernetics america each image was randomly determined in six areas and the average value of fluorescence intensity was counted for quantitative analysis 2 7 microscopic detection of histopathology after fish livers and intestines fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde for 24 hours dehydrated in anhydrous ethanol and cleaned in toluene sectioned the embedded liver in paraffin with a rotating microtome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin h e observed the histological lesions of hepatocyte and intestinal villi with a biological microscope e200mv nanjing nikon optical instruments co ltd and the image acquisition was performed using the standard software of minmus microscope digital system 2 8 measurement of enzymatic activity the livers intestines and spleens from all groups were homogenized and diluted homogenate 10 with 0 9 physiological saline protein concentrations in each tissue homogenate were determined by the coomassie brilliant blue method serum samples were diluted or undiluted as appropriate oxidative stress indicators including glutathione s transferase gst catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod were measured by using assay kits nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china following the manufacturer s protocols the superoxide dismutase sod activity was assayed the 50 inhibition of reduction rate of nitrite by the superoxide radical at 550 nm one unit of sod activity is the amount that resulted in a 50 inhibition of nitrite in per ml reaction solution of per mg tissue protein according to the method of goth 1991 the cat activity was assayed the absorbance of residual h2o2 and ammonium molybdate producing a yellowish compound at 405 nm one unit of cat activity corresponds to the ability to hydrolyse 1 µmol of h2o2 per second from per mg of tissue protein using 1 chloor 2 4 dinitrobenzeen cdn as a reagent assayed the concentration of glutathione gsh at 412 nm the decrease of gsh reflected the activity of gst one unit of cat activity corresponds to the ability of reducing by 1 μmol l gsh concentration per ml of tissue homogenate reacted at 37 c for 1 minute the above indicators were calculated based on the total protein tp determined by the bradford method 2 9 intestinal microorganism analysis the intestinal contents were sent to biozeron technology co ltd shanghai china for sequencing of 16s rrna gene in the region v3 v4 primer sequences 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 and 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 the base sequence was compared as well as analyzed with the national center for biotechnology information ncbi genbank database based on the data of species abundance in the samples the species composition of intestinal microorganisms was counted using the r language the composition and diversity of intestinal microorganisms in each group were statistically analyzed at the phylum and genus levels heatmap were drawn to analyze the similarity and difference of community composition of intestinal microorganisms of each group alpha diversity and lefse difference were analyzed for the impacts of psnps and dehp to intestinal microorganisms of lmb 2 10 data analysis all the data of this study were presented as means se the significant differences of values were analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova through spss 25 0 software package spss inc chicago il usa tukey s method was used for multiple comparisons as a statistical significance level of p 0 05 3 result 3 1 growth assessment after a 21 day feeding treatment lmb from four groups were measured for growth assessment and results are shown in fig 1 compared with the control group n c 0 mg g of psnps the final fish body weight in the n h group 40 mg g of psnps was significantly decreased p 0 05 while the decrease of that in the n l group 2 mg g of psnps and n m group 10 mg g of psnps did not reach a significant level p 0 05 in the meantime the weight gain rates among n l and n h groups were significantly lowered p 0 05 however the survival rates didn t show any significant difference among various psnps treatment groups the food conversion rate in n m and n h were significantly increased p 0 05 while the special growth rates in all the treatment groups n l n m and n h were significantly decreased by 10 4 10 0 11 3 p 0 05 these results clearly indicated that ingestion of psnps has a significant negative impact on lmb growth p 0 05 3 2 fluorescence intensity the fluorescence intensity in the histology of fish was measured after psnps single exposure and dehp psnps combined exposure and the results are shown in fig 2 according to the experimental design after absorption of psnps on diet we found that the fluorescence intensity in the diet increased significantly in a concentration dependent manner p 0 05 the fish intestinal fluorescence intensities of n l n m and n h were significantly higher than n c after the ingestion of psnps p 0 05 and the same result was observed after dehp psnps combined exposure nonetheless there was no significant difference was found in the fluorescence intensity in the fish liver from the ps np single exposure or dehp psnp co exposure group p 0 05 and compared with the ingestion of psnps during a single exposure the fluorescence intensity of the intestine didn t decrease after co exposure to the dehp psnps these results may demonstrate that the psnps were retained in the intestine after co exposure and failed to discharge spontaneously 3 3 histopathological analysis the photomicrographs of damage in intestinal and liver tissues of the ingestion of psnps a b and exposure to dehp psnps c d were respectively presented in fig 3 the abrasion of intestinal villi cells was observed in fish exposed to individual psnps treatment after co exposure to dehp psnps abrasion of the intestinal villi became more serious as for the liver we found swelling of the hepatocyte nucleus in n l n m and n h groups due to inflammation after ingestion of psnps even the nucleus in hepatocytes was disrupted and aggregated in n m and n h groups unlike in psnps single exposure the hepatocytes of the fish in n l n m and n h groups from the co exposure group showed atrophy and liver tissue erosion also occurred in the d h group these photomicrographs suggest that psnps can cause damage to fish intestinal and liver and that co exposure may worsen this damage 3 4 enzymatic activity analysis fig 4 showed the results of enzymatic activities in the intestine liver spleen and serum in single the ps np exposure and dehp psnp co exposure after the ingestion of psnps gst activity in the liver intestine and spleen of n l and n m groups were significantly higher than that in the control and n h groups p 0 05 and the gst activity in the serum of the control group was significantly higher than of the n l n m and n h groups p 0 05 compared with the control group cat activity in the liver of n m and n h groups was significantly increased as well as the spleen of the n m group p 0 05 there were no significant changes in the sod activity of the four groups p 0 05 after co exposure to the dehp psnps gst activity in liver and serum of n m and n h groups were significantly higher than that in control and n l groups p 0 05 gst activity in the spleen of n l and n h groups showed significant increases p 0 05 significant increases in cat activity were found in the spleen of the n l n m and n h groups p 0 05 additionally the sod activity in the liver of the n m group was lower than that of the control group p 0 05 the sod activity in the spleen of the n l n m and n h groups was significantly higher compared to the control group p 0 05 compared with the ingestion of psnps the gst activity in serum the cat and sod activity in liver intestine spleen and serum were increased after co exposure to dehp psnps these results demonstrated that the ingestion of psnps can cause oxidative stress in lmb and the intensity of oxidative stress would increase further after dehp psnps co exposure 3 5 microbiological composition analysis as shown in figs 5 and 6 the composition of lmb intestinal microorganisms changed after ps np single exposure and dehp psnp co exposure at the phylum level all the ps np treatment groups decreased 62 3 65 0 and 41 8 in n l n m and n h groups respectively and increased the abundance of proteobacteria 46 0 21 9 and 67 9 in n l n m and n h groups respectively and after co exposure to the dehp psnps the abundance of bacteroidota decreased 48 5 and the abundance of proteobacteria increased 74 9 in the control group as the same trend of change in n l n m and n h groups compared with the control group the shannon index showed an increasing trend while the simpson index showed a decreasing trend in the abundance of the intestinal microorganisms after both ps np single exposure and dehp psnp co exposure at the genus level the abundance of vibrionimonas decreased in the single psnps exposure in addition the abundance of aeromonas and rhodanobacter increased after co exposure to dehp psnps compared with ps np single exposure according to the differential analysis of relative abundance at the otu levels planococcaceae caulobacteraceae caulobacterales ferrovibrionaceae ferrovibrionales alcaligenaccae burkholderiales and verrucomicrobiae were found with significant differences in all treatment groups after ps np single exposure while tsukamurellaceae armatimonadaceae armatimonadales armatimnonadia caulobacteraceae and caulobacterales between d c and d m in dehp psnp co exposure correspondingly compared with the single exposure enterococcaceae caulobacteraceae caulobacterales ferrovibronaceae ferrovibrionales aeromonadaceae gammaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobiae were found with significant different otu levels between d c and n c n l n m groups 4 discussion with the ubiquitous presence of mnps in the environment and their transfer to organisms research on harmful impacts of plastic particles on various organisms such as bacteria algae rotifers and arthropods has continued to extend ferreira et al 2019 mnps have been found in all these aquatic organisms and caused various degrees of damage to them as for fish research has principally been limited to readily accessible and manipulated model organisms such as zebrafish and there has been a lack of research on common edible fish jiang et al 2020 therefore this study employed lmb fish to highlight the toxicity of psnps in single and combined exposure with dehp our growth assessment results revealed anorexia and reduced growth in lmb albeit failed of affect its survival rate xia et al 2020 obtained the same results that chronic exposure to a 10 concentration of pvc to cyprinus carpio using food limited diets significantly inhibited weight gain and growth further the filtration rate in mussels was considerably reduced after exposure to mps fiber concentrations of up to 30 fibers ml 1 woods et al 2018 likewise we found that the ingestion of psnps increased the food conversion rate of lmb in other words slowed down the growth of fish as confirmed by specific growth rates previously mp exposure to d rerio lei et al 2018 and a dussumieri naidoo and glassom 2019 caused a significant reduction in survival rate it was noteworthy that the ingestion of psnps didn t affect the survival of lmb in this study consistent with the findings of pitt et al 2018 who also found no change in the survival rate of zebrafish larvae after exposure to psnps these findings indicated that psnps may not be sufficient to kill the fish at current exposure levels but would affect the feeding and growth of lmb li et al 2020 demonstrated that various organs could be indirectly contacted with nps during exposure nevertheless nps are much more likely to accumulate in the gills intestine and stomach than in other tissues in this study higher fluorescence intensity was detected in the intestine of lmb due to the oral administration of psnps demonstrating that the ingested psnps predominantly lingered in the intestine similarly a previous study showed that c reinhardtii diets attached with green psnps were transferred to d magna and a clear green fluorescence was observed in its intestine chae et al 2018 as auto fluorescence of the lmb liver was higher than the previous studies reported by zhang et al 2020 which exposed zebrafish embryos and larvae to psnps there was no significant difference was found in the fluorescence intensity in the fish liver it has been reported that rainbow trout o mykiss dietary exposure of two week to fluorescent pe microspheres increased plastic particles accumulation in the intestines livers fillets and gonads and most of the mps were excreted from the intestines after 24 hour of depuration in the present study the fluorescence intensity in the intestine and liver of the fish after co exposure was comparable to the ps np single exposure this demonstrated that dehp may associate with psnps to the extent that the fish were unable to excrete them in other words dehp had the potential to cause secondary damage to fish based on the ingestion of psnps fluorescence intensity results have shown that psnps are stalled in the intestine and the main histopathological phenomena we found in this study was abrasion damage of intestinal villi in ps np single exposure and such damage was worsen after co exposure to dehp psnps likewise lei et al 2018 reported intestinal damage including cracking of villi and splitting of enterocytes in zebrafish exposed to various mp polymers pa pp pe pvc ps it has been reported that the main reason of dehp interaction with nps own to the hydrogen bonding positive charge and chemical heterogeneity among them yasir et al 2022 in addition the lower concentrations of nps 20 μg ml can reduce the toxicity of dehp to human lung epithelial a549 cells due to the greater adsorption capacity of dehp to nps however higher concentrations of nps 200 μg ml increased the cytotoxicity of dehp because of the dominant role of nps during co exposure shi et al 2021 the concentration of psnps in this experiment is 4 40 mg g which is much higher than the concentration mentioned above and the oral administration effects were more direct the combination of dehp and psnps made the fish less able to excrete psnps leading to the erosion of intestinal villi it was reported that in the actual environment the liver of fish exposed to nps or with other chemical pollutants may exhibit severe glycogen depletion fat vacuolization cell necrosis and lesions hu et al 2022 sarasamma et al 2020 and brandts et al 2018 demonstrated that exposure to nps can induce liver damage and inflammatory responses in zebrafish in the current study although the results of fluorescence intensity in the liver didn t reach a significant level the hepatocyte nucleus was deviated and aggregated with swelling after psnps single exposure then showed atrophy and even erosion after exposure to dehp psnp exposure then hepatocyte nuclei were deviating towards the blood vessels to facilitate the transport of detoxifying or energetic substances this leads to the clustering of hepatocyte nuclei around the blood vessels after combination exposure of psnps and dehp the above mentioned phenomenon was inhibited it has been reported that ingestion of dehp can disturb fat metabolism in fish yin et al 2021 meng et al 2018 therefore the atrophy and discrete hepatocytes of the fish after being exposed to dehp may be corrected to the fat metabolism in the liver these structural intestinal damages reduced the digestibility of lmb which affected the growth all histopathological results indicated that psnps had serious damaging effects and dehp exacerbated the effects of psnps on the intestine and liver of lmb which is detrimental to the growth and health of the fish there is increasing scientific evidence to support that nps can cause excessive production of ros and induce oxidative stress in exposed organisms capo et al 2021 various endogenous antioxidants such as sod gst and cat play a key role in maintaining fish health through scavenging neutralizing and or detoxifying effects xia et al 2020 kim et al 2010 it was reported that exposure to nps and tetracycline to grass carp c idella significantly increased the cat and sod activity liu et al 2022 capo et al 2021 recently highlighted that gilthead seabream s aurata fed with a diet enriched with virgin and low density pe mps significantly causing an increase in cat and gst levels in the current study the enzymatic activity in the intestine and liver could change because of the tissue lesions caused by the retention of psnps lmb fed diets with psnps increased the gst and cat activity levels in the intestine liver and spleen indicating oxidative stress the results were in agreement with those found in other species as they were fed with diets enriched with mps to red tilapia for 14 days ding et al 2018 gilthead seabream for 90 days capo et al 2021 and european sea bass d labrax for 96 hours barboza et al 2018 in the meantime the gst and cat activities in the intestine liver and spleen were decreased after co exposure to dehp psnps compared to single ps np feeding treatment as the opposite results in serum the previous research reported that dehp inhibited the nrf2 trafficking pathway in the mouse kidney leading to gsh depletion and oxidative stress amara et al 2020 therefore the transport of gst to the liver intestine and spleen pathway was obstructed and accumulated in the serum in this study sod is a key component of the primary defense system against oxidative stress induced damage and can spearhead the decomposition of ros generating superoxide anion o2 which plays a detoxifying role in preventing peroxidation of the body babaei et al 2022 in this study the sod activity didn t reach a significant level after ingesting the psnps but increased after co exposure in the spleen compared with the control group in total the sod activity of fish co exposure to dehp psnps was higher than fish ingested psnps indicating dehp exacerbated the toxicity of psnps to lmb numerous studies have confirmed that the intestinal microorganisms of vertebrates play a key role in host nutrition development and immunity wang et al 2018 jin et al 2018 it has been reported that there were interactions between mps and environmental microorganisms jia et al 2021 microorganisms can catalyze metabolic reactions that contribute to the catabolism of mps while mps can serve as sites for colonization by certain microorganisms thus affecting the ecological balance of the resident microbiota wang et al 2018 harrison et al 2014 further dehp biodegradation has been reported to link with five representing bacteria including genus brevundimona genus singulisphaera genus dyella class spartobacteria and class ktedonobacteria song et al 2019 for example xu et al 2021 identified that zebrafish exposed to mps induced an increase in the bacteroidetes and firmicutes in the intestine which may signal impaired metabolic function of fish additionally zebrafish exposure to ps mnps for 14 days significantly decreased the abundance of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria and increased the abundance of firmicutes as well as affected the shannon and richness index jin et al 2018 at the phylum level the ingestion of psnps significantly decreased the abundance of bacteroidota and increased the abundance of proteobacteria as the same trend of change in the four groups after exposure to dehp the bacteroides are mainly related to carbohydrate metabolism cholesterol metabolism and bile acid synthesis while the proteobacteria is the most abundant phylum in ecosystems and includes many well known pathogens jin et al 2018 buijs et al 2019 firmicutes proteobacteria and actinobacteria belong to pathogenic bacteria easy to lead the growth and disease resistance of fishes teame et al 2020 as histopathological results suggested that the ingestion of psnps caused damage to the intestine of fish and that pathogenic bacteria took the opportunity to proliferate and antagonize the growth of beneficial bacteria resulting in a serious imbalance in the intestinal microecology of fish at the genus level the abundance of vibrionimonas which was the dominant species decreased with the ingestion of psnps while the abundance of aeromonas and rhodanobacter increased after co exposure to dehp psnps compared with ps np single exposure however jia et al 2021 reported that zebrafish exposure to dehp increased the abundance of aeromonas and decreased the abundance of rhodanobacter these results also verified the combination of psnps and dehp caused more adverse changes in intestinal microorganisms by increasing the abundance of pathogenic bacteria similarly oral administration of mnps to mice resulted in a deterioration of intestinal barrier function and a reduction in the abundance of beneficial microorganisms suggesting that the toxic effects of mnps on the intestine may indirectly cause microbiota dysbiosis qiao et al 2021 further mps exposure significantly increased the gut microbial diversity which had negative effects on microorganisms balance li et al 2021 the shannon index revealed the diversity and the simpson index revealed the evenness of intestinal microorganisms hu et al 2022 we found similar results in terms of the decrease in simpson index and increase in diversity index suggesting that the balance of intestinal microorganisms was disordered verrucomicrobia was associated with the immediate amelioration of glucose metabolism derrien et al 2017 compared to the control group the abundance of verrucomicrobia significantly lowered after ingestion of psnps and co exposure to dehp psnps in short ingestion of psnps or co exposure to dehp psnps can affect the intestine microorganisms and can indirectly cause negative impacts on the health and development in the breeding of lmb fish which may exhibit extended food safety implications for humans as shown in the fig 7 we have concluded that the toxicological mechanism of the 21 day psnps single exposure and 3 day dehp psnps combined exposure to lmb firstly nps ingested by the lmb accumulated mainly in the intestine and were even transferred to the liver where they could not be detoxified or excreted nps were recognized as xenobiotics thereby inducing antioxidant responses in lmb mainly reflecting in the increases of cat and gst activity the immune response of lmb is not effective against nps which are oxidation resistant polymers thus these led to intestinal abrasion and swelling of hepatocyte nucleus at the same time the nps adsorbed to the intestinal villi resulted the multiplication of pathogenic bacteria such as enterococcus mycobacterium vibrionimonas methylovirgula and plesiomonas which causing the intestinal microbiota dysbiosis dehp is a toxic exogenous substance that is adsorbed to nps by various chemotactic forces and enhances the pathology of the lmb dehp activates the nod2 rip2 nf κb signalling pathway causing an inflammatory response and apoptosis of hepatocytes and lipid peroxidation cui et al 2021 thus co exposure dehp nps directly enhanced the histopathological and antioxidant responses of nps exposed to lmb it appeared that intestinal abrasion erosion infection and hepatocytes atrophy and erosion as well as increases in cat gst sod activity in addition the toxicity of dehp on probiotic bacteria in the intestine leads to the increase of pathogenic bacteria such as vibrionimonas rhodanobacter mycobacterium aeromonas methylovirgula enterobacter and rhodopseudomonas it was of these negative effects that the lmb needed more energy to resist these chemicals that ultimately resulted in slower growth and unhealthy in lmb our results revealed the hazards of dehp and nps to aquatic organisms and call for an effective way to address their contamination in the environment 5 conclusion the current study confirmed that polystyrene nanoplastics psnps ingested by largemouth bass mainly accumulated in the intestine and liver and caused histological damage thereby affecting the feeding and growth rates in the meantime psnps caused the histological damage oxidative stress and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis of largemouth bass furthermore the co exposure of psnps and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp exacerbated those toxic impacts our results provide new information concerning psnps and dehp induced toxicity in different tissues of the economic fish suggesting the rationale use of plastic and its additives for the health of fish and food safety then more studies should be focused on evaluating the adverse impacts mediated by plastics for flesh

15947,organic pollutants such as di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp interact with nanoplastics nps and change their bioavailability and toxicity to aquatic organisms this study aims to assess the ecotoxicological impacts of nps in the presence and absence of dehp on juvenile largemouth bass lmb micropterus salmoides therefore lmb was fed with diets containing various concentrations 0 2 10 and 40 mg g of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps by the weight of diets after a 21 day of psnps dietary exposure lmb was treated with dehp at 450 μg l through waterborne exposure for three days our results showed that psnps were accumulated in the intestinal tissues which significantly decreased the feeding and growth rates in lmb the histopathological analysis showed the intestine and liver of lmb were subjected to various degrees of structural damage caused by psnps and dehp psnp co exposure enhanced those histopathological damages in both tissues additionally the co exposure induced oxidative stress in terms of increased activities of glutathione s transferase catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes in the liver intestine spleen and serum furthermore the co exposure significantly changed the intestinal microbial composition i e the decrease in the abundance of probiotics bacteroidetes and proteobacteria and the increase in pathogenic bacteria firmicutes posed a great threat to fish metabolism and health therefore this study highlights that the presence of dehp enhances the toxicity of nps on lmb in freshwater and suggests the regulated use of plastic and its additives for improving the health status of aquaculture fish for food safety in humans graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate micropterus salmoides histopathology oxidative stress intestinal microbiota 1 introduction nanoplastics nps have been increasingly studied as emerging pollutants due to their ubiquitous presence and interactions with other biochemical entities in the aquatic environment junaid and wang 2021 with the growth of the human population the production and consumption of plastic and its additives have shown a significant increase during recent decades hou et al 2021 moreover the degradation of macroplastics into micro nano plastics mnps also increases the levels of plastic particles in the environment thus amplifying the associated ecotoxicological hazards peters et al 2017 pitt et al 2018 since the mnps ultimately remain in rivers lakes or oceans they pose a great challenge to the survival of aquatic organisms primarily fish ahrendt et al 2020 alomar et al 2021 therefore a great deal of research has been conducted on the ecotoxicological implications of mnps to aquatic organisms according to the previous studies polystyrene nanoplastics psnps accumulation in tissues disturbed energy metabolism and induced oxidative stress in zebrafish sarasamma et al 2020 numerous histopathological phenomena such as detachment hyperplasia shortening swelling of intestinal mucosa epithelium and vacuolization of enterocytes have been reported in the intestine of fish ingested mnps ahrendt et al 2020 it has also been found that nps are able to cross membranes core resulting in membrane structure alterations reduction of molecular diffusion and membrane softness thus severely affecting cell function gonzález fernández et al 2021 additionally xu et al 2021 and jin et al 2018 found that exposure to ps particles induced the intestinal microbiota dysbiosis of zebrafish in terms of a decrease in the abundance of probiotics and the increase in pathogenic bacteria as well as the change of the shannon index and richness posed a great threat to fish metabolism and health further the accumulation of mnps can considerably affect lipid metabolism food preference and behavior of the top consumers through food chain which interferes with the natural development of aquatic animals bianchi et al 2020 chae and an 2020 cedervall et al 2012 the polydisperse and heterogenic nature of environmental nps limits the development of toxicological research methods and the optimization of experimental conditions barria et al 2020 as nps below 0 1 µm in size cannot be visualized by photon microscopy therefore fluorescent treatment of nps for scientific research is becoming prevalent chae et al 2018 identifying the presence and concentration of nps by fluorescence intensity has become an accepted method by researchers for the semi quantitative detection of nps in organismal tissues gagné et al 2019 furthermore the fluorescence intensity is positively related to the concentration of nps for example the fluorescence ps np chronic exposure to adult zebrafish mainly accumulated and distributed in gonads intestine liver and brain by fluorescent intensity determination which caused abnormalities of locomotion activity aggressiveness and predator avoidance behavior sarasamma et al 2020 besides fluorescent nps were found in both fish and their offspring following the consumption of zooplankton containing nps which suggests that it affects fish reproduction and induce transgenerational toxicity yin et al 2018 therefore to conveniently trace the transfer of nps in fish fluorescent nps were selected as plastic particles of interest in this study in natural environment the coexistence of nps and other contaminants is unavoidable so there are more and more concerns regarding the conjunctive effects of nps and other pollutants nps may have interactions with contaminants and act as carriers for chemicals transfer into the aquatic organisms thus affecting the bioavailability and toxicity of these contaminants liu et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 had confirmed that co exposure of psnps and tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate tdcipp modified the bioavailability of tdcipp and the transgenerational thyroid disruption in zebrafish another study on d rerio zebrafish exposed to plastic particles and phenanthrene in mixture treatment caused oxidative stress and altered the expression of oxidative stress related genes xu et al 2021 additionally the characteristics of mnps such as size charge and shape can affect their interaction with contaminants and hence the associated toxicity when ingested by aquatic organisms can be altered xiong et al 2020 similarly di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp is extensively used as a plasticizer for softening polyvinyl chloride pvc products and exhibited widespread other applications husoy et al 2020 as a result of plastics degradation plastic products usually release additives such as dehp which can alter the physicochemical properties of plastic particles cormier et al 2021 further dehp has been extensively detected in the aquatic environment around the world particularly in north america europe and asia zolfaghari et al 2014 magdouli et al 2013 junaid et al 2018 moreover dehp itself exhibits multifaceted ecotoxicological implications e g it caused alterations in the locomotion patterns accompanied with elevated oxidative stress neurotoxicity and activation of the apoptosis pathways in o latipes medaka fish after 2 days of continuous exposure at 20 100 and 200 μg l yang et al 2018 cui et al 2021 found dehp exposure to hepatocytes partially activated the nod2 rip2 nf κb signal pathway then caused inflammatory response and hepatocytes apoptosis in grass carp similarly dehp exposure can induce ferroptosis iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation as well as massive pericardial edema and cardiac circulatory disturbances yin et al 2021 sun et al 2021 therefore the contamination of dehp can cause risks to the survival of aquatic organisms hence it is essential to investigate whether and how dehp and np combination affects aquatic species with economic importance from the perspective of their survival and health this study aims to investigated the impact of ps nps single and dehp psnp combined exposures on the growth oxidative stress histopathology as well as responses of the intestinal microbiota of micropterus salmoides lmb after ps nps dietary exposure for 21 days following dehp waterborne exposure for 3 days we highlighted the toxicity of psnps and dehp on one of the favorite aquatic food products lmb not only in terms of its yield and market value but also as a threat to human health and food safety it also appeals to control the use of plastics and dehp and search for ways to deal with their negative environmental consequences 2 materials and methods 2 1 ethical statement in this study we acclimated and cultivated the fish under standard laboratory conditions such as water and food requirements syxk 2013 100 all procedures were conducted in accordance with the guiding principles in the care and use of animals china and were approved by the laboratory animal ethics committee of the guangdong academy of agricultural science 2020g010 we tried our best to reduce fish suffering and ensure animal welfare 2 2 largemouth bass a commercial aquatic food product largemouth bass lmb micropterus salmoides is a freshwater fish native to north america and it rapidly became a very popular cultural species after its introduction to china habte tsion et al 2020 wu et al 2021 the production of lmb in china has sustained at about 200 000 tons every year of which guangdong province is the main breeding ground accounting for over 60 of the total domestic production jiang et al 2018 zebrafish is the most frequently used model fish in toxicological studies on fluorescent nps bhagat et al 2020 albeit only a few studies are available on lmb furthermore as lmb occupies a substantial position in the fish consumer market it is more meaningful to speed up the research on it for human health and food safety so we selected the lmb as the research object to conduct this study and fish were purchased from liang s aquatic seed industry company guangdong china and acclimatized in our laboratory as mention in the later section 2 3 chemicals green fluorescent polystyrene nanoplastics psnps spherical 500 nm diameter 1 w v were obtained from baseline technology co ltd tianjin china the concentration polystyrene nanoplastics is 1 46 1010 particles mg di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp was obtained from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china the other necessary reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from guangzhou chemical reagent factory guangzhou china 2 4 experimental design fifty grams of the lmb commercial diet purchase from guangdong hengxing feed co ltd guangzhou approximate composition protein 60 lipid 15 moisture 4 were soaked in 200 ml of ammonia free water with 0 2 10 and 40 mg g n c control n l nps low level exposure 2 mg g n m nps medium level exposure 10 mg g n h nps high level exposure 40 mg g concentrations of green fluorescent psnps respectively the concentration of psnps was referenced to previous researches such as cedervall et al 2012 that highlighted the exposure of fluorescent psnps at 100 mg g to a food chain containing alga daphnia magna and crucian carp carassius carassius inducing the lipid metabolism and abnormal fish behavior pitt et al 2018 reported the exposure to fluorescent psnps at 0 1 1 and 10 mg g which affected physiology and behavior of zebrafish larvae and then the diet was swollen and stirred for five minutes to accelerate the absorption of psnps in the diet then the treated diet was dried and returned to its initial state and a fluorescence microscope was used to analyze if the psnps were properly absorbed on the surface or inside the diet as shown in fig 1 a a total of 180 healthy juvenile lmb initial body weight 2 44 0 05 g were acclimated with base commercial diet at 25 c 14 10 light dark photoperiod for two weeks in the aquatic laboratory south china agriculture of university guangdong china after acclimation fish were divided into four groups with triplicates 15 fish each tank for exposure experiment in a total of 12 glass tanks 5 l per tank with continuous aeration fish were fed regularly with apparent satiety at 9 00 and 18 00 and renewed the water every day the feeding experiment lasted for 21 days with dissolved oxygen above 6 20 mg l water temperature 25 8 27 2 c and ph 6 85 7 35 determined by ysi professional plus multiparameter instrument xylem inc usa then sampled the fish after the first sampling fish were acclimated in clean water for three days six fish from each group were randomly selected from the remaining fish and transferred to the other 12 tanks which were added with deph at 450 μg l dehp was dissolved in 10 ml dimethylsulfoxide solution with water 1 9 and then stirred in the tank the concentration of dehp was designed according to the results obtained by junaid et al 2018 using 7 days of dehp exposure at 100 800 µg l to zebrafish that activated the pi3k akt mtor pathway yang et al 2018 employing 21 days waterborne exposure to dehp 20 100 200 μg l for medaka fish oryzias latipes that altered the growth and locomotion and jia et al 2021 reported 21 days of dehp exposure 0 100 μg l to zebrafish that changed the expressions of genes related to intestinal metabolites and critical immune functions for ease of differentiation we have named the experimental subgroup co exposed to dehp and nps as d c 0 mg g nps 450 μg l dehp d l 2 mg g np 450 μg l dehp d m 10 mg g nps 450 μg l dehp and d h 40 mg g nps 450 μg l dehp the fish were exposed to dehp for three days then sampled again to assess the impact of combined exposure the sampling procedures was the same as the first sampling 2 5 fish sampling and growth assessment the total number and weight of the fish in each tank were recorded before sampling the growth assessment

accordance with the guiding principles in the care and use of animals china firstly six fish were randomly selected from each tank and swam freely for five minutes to clean the psnps or dehp from the surface of the fish then we tried to collect as much blood as possible by syringe and injected it into a 200 μl ep eppendorf tube from the fish serum was extracted from blood samples by centrifugation at 4000 r min for 10 min at 4 after keeping at room temperature for four hours afterwards we performed dissection to collect whole liver and intestine from three fish for the detection of nps accumulation through fluorescent intensity measurement another three fish were sampled to extract liver spleen intestine and intestinal contents for enzymatic activity determination and sequencing of 16s rrna and stored at 80 another portion of the liver and intestine were fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde for paraffin sections 2 6 microscopic detection of fluorescent intensity all whole livers and intestines freshly collected were placed in glass culverts for fluorescence observation captured images of the whole liver and intestine to assay fluorescence intensity using a fluorescence microscope leica dm400 b leica microsystems company shanghai china the intensity of fluorescence was determined by the image j software media cybernetics america each image was randomly determined in six areas and the average value of fluorescence intensity was counted for quantitative analysis 2 7 microscopic detection of histopathology after fish livers and intestines fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde for 24

microscope digital system 2 8 measurement of enzymatic activity the livers intestines and spleens from all groups were homogenized and diluted homogenate 10 with 0 9 physiological saline protein concentrations in each tissue homogenate were determined by the coomassie brilliant blue method serum samples were diluted or undiluted as appropriate oxidative stress indicators including glutathione s transferase gst catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod were measured by using assay kits nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china following the manufacturer s protocols the superoxide dismutase sod activity was assayed the 50 inhibition of reduction rate of nitrite by the superoxide radical at 550 nm one unit of sod activity is the amount that resulted in a 50 inhibition of nitrite in per ml reaction solution of per mg tissue protein according to the method of goth 1991 the cat activity was assayed the absorbance of residual h2o2 and ammonium molybdate producing a yellowish

21 day feeding treatment lmb from four groups were measured for growth assessment and results are shown in fig 1 compared with the control group n c 0 mg g of psnps the final fish body weight in the n h group 40 mg g of psnps was significantly decreased p 0 05 while the decrease of that in the n l group 2 mg g of psnps and n m group 10 mg g of psnps did not reach a significant level p 0 05 in the meantime the weight gain rates among n l and n h groups were significantly lowered p 0 05 however the survival rates didn t show any significant difference among various psnps treatment groups the food conversion rate in n m and n h were significantly increased p 0 05 while the special growth rates in all the treatment groups n l n m and n h were significantly decreased by 10 4 10 0 11 3 p 0 05 these results clearly indicated that ingestion of psnps has a significant negative impact on lmb growth p 0 05 3 2 fluorescence intensity the fluorescence intensity in the histology of fish was measured after psnps single exposure and dehp psnps combined exposure and the results are shown in fig 2 according to the experimental design after absorption of psnps on diet we found that the fluorescence intensity in the diet increased significantly in a concentration dependent manner p 0 05 the fish intestinal fluorescence intensities of n l n m and n h were significantly higher than n c after the ingestion of psnps p 0 05 and the same result was observed after dehp psnps combined exposure nonetheless there was no significant difference was found in the fluorescence intensity in the fish liver from the ps np single exposure or dehp psnp co exposure group p 0 05 and compared with the ingestion of psnps during a single exposure the fluorescence intensity of the intestine didn t decrease after co exposure to the dehp psnps these results may demonstrate that the psnps were retained in the intestine after co exposure and failed to discharge spontaneously 3 3 histopathological analysis the photomicrographs of damage in intestinal and liver tissues of the ingestion of psnps a b and exposure to dehp psnps c d were respectively presented in fig 3 the abrasion of intestinal villi cells was observed in fish exposed to individual psnps treatment after co exposure to dehp psnps abrasion of the intestinal villi became more serious as for the liver we found swelling of the hepatocyte nucleus in n l n m and n h groups due to inflammation after ingestion of psnps even the nucleus in hepatocytes was disrupted and aggregated in n m and n h groups unlike in psnps single exposure the hepatocytes of the fish in n l n m and n h groups from the co exposure group showed atrophy and liver tissue erosion also occurred in the d h group these photomicrographs suggest that psnps can cause damage to fish intestinal and liver and that co exposure may worsen this damage 3 4 enzymatic activity analysis fig 4 showed the results of enzymatic activities in the intestine liver spleen and serum in single the ps np exposure and dehp psnp co exposure after the ingestion of psnps gst activity in the liver intestine and spleen of n l and n m groups were significantly higher than that in the control and n h groups p 0 05 and the gst activity in the serum of the control group was significantly higher than of the n l n m and n h groups p 0 05 compared with the control group cat activity in the liver of n m and n h groups was significantly increased as well as the spleen of the n m group p 0 05 there were no significant changes in the sod activity of the four groups p 0 05 after co exposure to the dehp psnps gst activity in liver and serum of n m and n h groups were significantly higher than that in control and n l groups p 0 05 gst activity in the spleen of n l and n h groups showed significant increases p 0 05 significant increases in cat activity were found in the spleen of the n l n m and n h groups p 0 05 additionally the sod activity in the liver of the n m group was lower than that of the control group p 0 05 the sod activity in the spleen of the n l n m and n h groups was significantly higher compared to the control group p 0 05 compared with the ingestion of psnps the gst activity in serum the cat and sod activity in liver intestine spleen and serum were increased after co exposure to dehp psnps these results demonstrated that the ingestion of psnps can cause oxidative stress in lmb and the intensity of oxidative stress would increase further after dehp psnps co exposure 3 5 microbiological composition analysis as shown in figs 5 and 6 the composition of lmb intestinal microorganisms changed after ps np single exposure and dehp psnp co exposure at the phylum level all the ps np treatment groups decreased 62 3 65 0 and 41 8 in n l n m and n h groups respectively and increased the abundance of proteobacteria 46 0 21 9 and 67 9 in n l n m and n h groups respectively and after co exposure to the dehp psnps the abundance of bacteroidota decreased 48 5 and the abundance of proteobacteria increased 74 9 in the control group as the same trend of change in n l n m and n h groups compared with the control group the shannon index showed an increasing trend while the simpson index showed a decreasing trend in the abundance of the intestinal microorganisms after both ps np single exposure and dehp psnp co exposure at the genus level the abundance of vibrionimonas decreased in the single psnps exposure in addition the abundance of aeromonas and rhodanobacter increased after co exposure to dehp psnps compared with ps np single exposure according to the differential analysis of relative abundance at the otu levels planococcaceae caulobacteraceae caulobacterales ferrovibrionaceae ferrovibrionales alcaligenaccae burkholderiales and verrucomicrobiae were found with significant differences in all treatment groups after ps np single exposure while tsukamurellaceae armatimonadaceae armatimonadales armatimnonadia caulobacteraceae and caulobacterales between d c and d m in dehp psnp co exposure correspondingly compared with the single exposure enterococcaceae caulobacteraceae caulobacterales ferrovibronaceae ferrovibrionales aeromonadaceae gammaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobiae were found with significant different otu levels between d c and n c n l n m groups 4 discussion with the ubiquitous presence of mnps in the environment and their transfer to organisms research on harmful impacts of plastic particles on various organisms such as bacteria algae rotifers and arthropods has continued to extend ferreira et al 2019 mnps have been found in all these aquatic organisms and caused various degrees of damage to them as for fish research has principally been limited to readily accessible and manipulated model organisms such as zebrafish and there has been a lack of research on common edible fish jiang et al 2020 therefore this study employed lmb fish to highlight the toxicity of psnps in single and combined exposure with dehp our growth assessment results revealed anorexia and reduced growth in lmb albeit failed of affect its survival rate xia et al 2020 obtained the same results that chronic exposure to a 10 concentration of pvc to cyprinus carpio using food limited diets significantly inhibited weight gain and growth further the filtration rate in mussels was considerably reduced after exposure to mps fiber concentrations of up to 30 fibers ml 1 woods et al 2018 likewise we found that the ingestion of psnps increased the food conversion rate of lmb in other words slowed down the growth of fish as confirmed by specific growth rates previously mp exposure to d rerio lei et al 2018 and a dussumieri naidoo and glassom 2019 caused a significant reduction in survival rate it was noteworthy that the ingestion of psnps didn t affect the survival of lmb in this study consistent with the findings of pitt et al 2018 who also found no change in the survival rate of zebrafish larvae after exposure to psnps these findings indicated that psnps may not be sufficient to kill the fish at current exposure levels but would affect the feeding and growth of lmb li et al 2020 demonstrated that various organs could be indirectly contacted with nps during exposure nevertheless nps are much more likely to accumulate in the gills intestine and stomach than in other tissues in this study higher fluorescence intensity was detected in the intestine of lmb due to the oral administration of psnps demonstrating that the ingested psnps predominantly lingered in the intestine similarly a previous study showed that c reinhardtii diets attached with green psnps were transferred to d magna and a clear green fluorescence was observed in its intestine chae et al 2018 as auto fluorescence of the lmb liver was higher than the previous studies reported by zhang et al 2020 which exposed zebrafish embryos and larvae to psnps there was no significant difference was found in the fluorescence intensity in the fish liver it has been reported that rainbow trout o mykiss dietary exposure of two week to fluorescent pe microspheres increased plastic particles accumulation in the intestines livers fillets and gonads and most of the mps were excreted from the intestines after 24 hour of depuration in the present study the fluorescence intensity in the intestine and liver of the fish after co exposure was comparable to the ps np single exposure this demonstrated that dehp may associate with psnps to the extent that the fish were unable to excrete them in other words dehp had the potential to cause secondary damage to fish based on the ingestion of psnps fluorescence intensity results have shown that psnps are stalled in the intestine and the main histopathological phenomena we found in this study was abrasion damage of intestinal villi in ps np single exposure and such damage was worsen after co exposure to dehp psnps likewise lei et al 2018 reported intestinal damage including cracking of villi and splitting of enterocytes in zebrafish exposed to various mp polymers pa pp pe pvc ps it has been reported that the main reason of dehp interaction with nps own to the hydrogen bonding positive charge and chemical heterogeneity among them yasir et al 2022 in addition the lower concentrations of nps 20 μg ml can reduce the toxicity of dehp to human lung epithelial a549 cells due to the greater adsorption capacity of dehp to nps however higher concentrations of nps 200 μg ml increased the cytotoxicity of dehp because of the dominant role of nps during co exposure shi et al 2021 the concentration of psnps in this experiment is 4 40 mg g which is much higher than the concentration mentioned above and the oral administration effects were more direct the combination of dehp and psnps made the fish less able to excrete psnps leading to the erosion of intestinal villi it was reported that in the actual environment the liver of fish exposed to nps or with other chemical pollutants may exhibit severe glycogen depletion fat vacuolization cell necrosis and lesions hu et al 2022 sarasamma et al 2020 and brandts et al 2018 demonstrated that exposure to nps can induce liver damage and inflammatory responses in zebrafish in the current study although the results of fluorescence intensity in the liver didn t reach a significant level the hepatocyte nucleus was deviated and aggregated with swelling after psnps single exposure then showed atrophy and even erosion after exposure to dehp psnp exposure then hepatocyte nuclei were deviating towards the blood vessels to facilitate the transport of detoxifying or energetic substances this leads to the clustering of hepatocyte nuclei around the blood vessels after combination exposure of psnps and dehp the above mentioned phenomenon was inhibited it has been reported that ingestion of dehp can disturb fat metabolism in fish yin et al 2021 meng et al 2018 therefore the atrophy and discrete hepatocytes of the fish after being exposed to dehp may be corrected to the fat metabolism in the liver these structural intestinal damages reduced the digestibility of lmb which affected the growth all histopathological results indicated that psnps had serious damaging effects and dehp exacerbated the effects of psnps on the intestine and liver of lmb which is detrimental to the growth and health of the fish there is increasing scientific evidence to support that nps can cause excessive production of ros and induce oxidative stress in exposed organisms capo et al 2021 various endogenous antioxidants such as sod gst and cat play a key role in maintaining fish health through scavenging neutralizing and or detoxifying effects xia et al 2020 kim et al 2010 it was reported that exposure to nps and tetracycline to grass carp c idella significantly increased the cat and sod activity liu et al 2022 capo et al 2021 recently highlighted that gilthead seabream s aurata fed with a diet enriched with virgin and low density pe mps significantly causing an increase in cat and gst levels in the current study the enzymatic activity in the intestine and liver could change because of the tissue lesions caused by the retention of psnps lmb fed diets with psnps increased the gst and cat activity levels in the intestine liver and spleen indicating oxidative stress the results were in agreement with those found in other species as they were fed with diets enriched with mps to red tilapia for 14 days ding et al 2018 gilthead seabream for 90 days capo et al 2021 and european sea bass d labrax for 96 hours barboza et al 2018 in the meantime the gst and cat activities in the intestine liver and spleen were decreased after co exposure to dehp psnps compared to single ps np feeding treatment as the opposite results in serum the previous research reported that dehp inhibited the nrf2 trafficking pathway in the mouse kidney leading to gsh depletion and oxidative stress amara et al 2020 therefore the transport of gst to the liver intestine and spleen pathway was obstructed and accumulated in the serum in this study sod is a key component of the primary defense system against oxidative stress induced damage and can spearhead the decomposition of ros generating superoxide anion o2 which plays a detoxifying role in preventing peroxidation of the body babaei et al 2022 in this study the sod activity didn t reach a significant level after ingesting the psnps but increased after co exposure in the spleen compared with the control group in total the sod activity of fish co exposure to dehp psnps was higher than fish ingested psnps indicating dehp exacerbated the toxicity of psnps to lmb numerous studies have confirmed that the intestinal microorganisms of vertebrates play a key role in host nutrition development and immunity wang et al 2018 jin et al 2018 it has been reported that there were interactions between mps and environmental microorganisms jia et al 2021 microorganisms can catalyze metabolic reactions that contribute to the catabolism of mps while mps can serve as sites for colonization by certain microorganisms thus affecting the ecological balance of the resident microbiota wang et al 2018 harrison et al 2014 further dehp biodegradation has been reported to link with five representing bacteria including genus brevundimona genus singulisphaera genus dyella class spartobacteria and class ktedonobacteria song et al 2019 for example xu et al 2021 identified that zebrafish exposed to mps induced an increase in the bacteroidetes and firmicutes in the intestine which may signal impaired metabolic function of fish additionally zebrafish exposure to ps mnps for 14 days significantly decreased the abundance of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria and increased the abundance of firmicutes as well as affected the shannon and richness index jin et al 2018 at the phylum level the ingestion of psnps significantly decreased the abundance of bacteroidota and increased the abundance of proteobacteria as the same trend of change in the four groups after exposure to dehp the bacteroides are mainly related to carbohydrate metabolism cholesterol metabolism and bile acid synthesis while the proteobacteria is the most abundant phylum in ecosystems and includes many well known pathogens jin et al 2018 buijs et al 2019 firmicutes proteobacteria and actinobacteria belong to pathogenic bacteria easy to lead the growth and disease resistance of fishes teame et al 2020 as histopathological results suggested that the ingestion of psnps caused damage to the intestine of fish and that pathogenic bacteria took the opportunity to proliferate and antagonize the growth of beneficial bacteria resulting in a serious imbalance in the intestinal microecology of fish at the genus level the abundance of vibrionimonas which was the dominant species decreased with the ingestion of psnps while the abundance of aeromonas and rhodanobacter increased after co exposure to dehp psnps compared with ps np single exposure however jia et al 2021 reported that zebrafish exposure to dehp increased the abundance of aeromonas and decreased the abundance of rhodanobacter these results also verified the combination of psnps and dehp caused more adverse changes in intestinal microorganisms by increasing the abundance of pathogenic bacteria similarly oral administration of mnps to mice resulted in a deterioration of intestinal barrier function and a reduction in the abundance of beneficial microorganisms suggesting that the toxic effects of mnps on the intestine may indirectly cause microbiota dysbiosis qiao et al 2021 further mps exposure significantly increased the gut microbial diversity which had negative effects on microorganisms balance li et al 2021 the shannon index revealed the diversity and the simpson index revealed the evenness of intestinal microorganisms hu et al 2022 we found similar results in terms of the decrease in simpson index and increase in diversity index suggesting that the balance of intestinal microorganisms was disordered verrucomicrobia was associated with the immediate amelioration of glucose metabolism derrien et al 2017 compared to the control group the abundance of verrucomicrobia significantly lowered after ingestion of psnps and co exposure to dehp psnps in short ingestion of psnps or co exposure to dehp psnps can affect the intestine microorganisms and can indirectly cause negative impacts on the health and development in the breeding of lmb fish which may exhibit extended food safety implications for humans as shown in the fig 7 we have concluded that the toxicological mechanism of the 21 day psnps single exposure and 3 day dehp psnps combined exposure to lmb firstly nps ingested by the lmb accumulated mainly in the intestine and were even transferred to the liver where they could not be detoxified or excreted nps were recognized as xenobiotics thereby inducing antioxidant responses in lmb mainly reflecting in the increases of cat and gst activity the immune response of lmb is not effective against nps which are oxidation resistant polymers thus these led to intestinal abrasion and swelling of hepatocyte nucleus at the same time the nps adsorbed to the intestinal villi resulted the multiplication of pathogenic bacteria such as enterococcus mycobacterium vibrionimonas methylovirgula and plesiomonas which causing the intestinal microbiota dysbiosis dehp is a toxic exogenous substance that is adsorbed to nps by various chemotactic forces and enhances the pathology of the lmb dehp activates the nod2 rip2 nf κb signalling pathway causing an inflammatory response and apoptosis of hepatocytes and lipid peroxidation cui et al 2021 thus co exposure dehp nps directly enhanced the histopathological and antioxidant responses of nps exposed to lmb it appeared that intestinal abrasion erosion infection and hepatocytes atrophy and erosion as well as increases in cat gst sod activity in addition the toxicity of dehp on probiotic bacteria in the intestine leads to the increase of pathogenic bacteria such as vibrionimonas rhodanobacter mycobacterium aeromonas methylovirgula enterobacter and rhodopseudomonas it was of these negative effects that the lmb needed more energy to resist these chemicals that ultimately resulted in slower growth and unhealthy in lmb our results revealed the hazards of dehp and nps to aquatic organisms and call for an effective way to address their contamination in the environment 5 conclusion the current study confirmed that polystyrene nanoplastics psnps ingested by largemouth bass mainly accumulated in the intestine and liver and caused histological damage thereby affecting the feeding and growth rates in the meantime psnps caused the histological damage oxidative stress and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis of largemouth bass furthermore the co exposure of psnps and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp exacerbated those toxic impacts our results provide new information concerning psnps and dehp induced toxicity in different tissues of the economic fish suggesting the rationale use of plastic and its additives for the health of fish and food safety then more studies should be focused on evaluating the adverse impacts mediated by plastics for flesh

15948,fe ii redox chemistry is a pivotal process of biogeochemical fe cycle and the transformation of organic pollutants in subsurface aquifers while its interfacial reactivity on iron oxides with varying surface chemistries remains largely unexplored in this study the redox processes of fe ii on two hematite with highly exposed 001 and 110 facets and their impacts on the transformation of nitrobenzene were investigated results suggest that fe ii adsorption is the rate limiting step of the redox chain reactions controlling the reduction potential e h nitrobenzene activates the facet electron transfer on hematite leading to nitrobenzene reduction and fe ii oxidation moreover 001 facet exhibits a higher reactivity and electron transport efficiency than 110 facet which is attributed to a lower site density 0 809 fe nm2 and a lower e h of hematite 001 facet than that of 110 facet it is worth noting that the facet dependent reduction activity is more intense at low ph or high fe ii activity a slight dissolution of 110 facet was observed indicating hematite 001 facet exhibits higher thermodynamic stability than 110 facet this study confirms the facet dependent reducing activity of surface bound fe ii on hematite providing a new perspective for in depth understanding of the interfacial reactions on hematite the findings of this work broaden the biogeochemical process of fe cycle in subsurface environments and its impact on the fate of organic pollutants in groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords redox chemistry facet dependence fe ii activity organic pollutants subsurface environments 1 introduction hematite α fe2o3 is the most thermodynamically stable iron oxide mineral and widely distributed in actual anoxic aquatic and terrestrial systems wu et al 2021 the hematite s surface is one of the most common redox active interfaces in subsurface aquifers huang et al 2016a 2016b the reductive dissolution of hematite the adsorption of fe ii ions by hematite and fe ii catalyzed hematite recrystallization are important processes of iron cycling playing an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of subsurface pollutants in groundwater hu et al 2021a 2021b subsurface pollutants are susceptible to abiotic reduction under anaerobic conditions electrons are typically transferred to pollutants from redox facile carbonaceous or ferruginous soil constituents and the abiotic reduction can be rapid cárdenas hernández et al 2020 as we all know high reductive activity can be observed from low reduction potential e h it can be explained thermodynamically that dissolved fe ii ion binds to fe iii oxyhydroxides with negative gibbs free energies forming thermodynamically stable crystalline oxides and resulting in a lower e h chen et al 2018 gorski et al 2016 since the dissolved fe ii does not exhibit reducibility the surface bound fe ii species are likely to predominantly determine the reductive activity huang et al 2016b the interactions between fe ii ions and iron oxides can be described with the interfacial electron transfer iet model hydroxyl ligands serve as electron donors and the confining fe ii ions on the hematite surfaces form amorphous ferric oxides e g feiiofeiiioh and feiiofeiii that have higher electron densities than aqueous fe ii huang et al 2016b joshi et al 2017 however the intrinsic reasons for the high reductive activity of fe ii ions confined on iron oxides are still unclear hematite particles exhibit different crystal structures under different subsurface conditions eggleston et al 2003 resulting in different proportion of exposed facets such as the 001 110 and 012 venema et al 1998 given that the fe reductive dissolution process generally occurs on the surfaces of iron oxides the differences in exposed facets likely have dramatic effects on the reducing activity of hematite fe ii couple hu et al 2021b the exposed facets and their surface active site density can strongly influence the reactivity of the hematite interfaces in many processes such as heavy metal adsorption catalytic performance and interfacial electron transfer wu et al 2021 therefore some specific exposed facets with higher surface energy have higher reactivity in recent years the adsorption process on metal oxides has been observed to be facet dependent such as heavy metals huang et al 2016a organics lv et al 2018 and proteins qi et al 2020 however it remains unknown whether the hematite mediated reduction of pollutants is facet dependent due to the diverse exposed facets of hematite and its wide distribution in nature it is necessary to understand the interfacial reduction reactions on different exposed facets of hematite a feasible solution to tackle these challenges is to quantitatively evaluate the binding capacity of fe ii ions on different exposed facets of hematite and verify the reduction efficiency of model pollutant on different exposed facets in past decade the reductive transformation of organic pollutants such as nitrobenzene on the surface of iron oxide minerals e g hematite or goethite has gained great attentions particularly in reaction kinetics and thermodynamics cárdenas hernández et al 2020 numerous studies have reported that pollutant reduction rates by fe ii ions are substantially enhanced in the presence of an iron oxyhydr oxide mineral recent studies have demonstrated that e h values for hematite and goethite bound fe ii can be accurately calculated using gibbs free energy values stewart et al 2018 cárdenas hernández et al 2020 and the electron transfer rate of nitrobenzene reduction is affected by fe ii activity and ph cárdenas hernández et al 2020 to reveal the facet dependent fe ii redox chemistry on iron oxide for organic pollutant transformation two types of well defined hematite with predominantly exposed facets of 001 and 110 were prepared and the interaction between different exposed facets of hematite and fe ii ions was investigated the hematite 001 and 110 facets are selected because they are the most commonly and naturally growing exposed facets to investigate the facet dependent reduction activity of hematite fe ii couple the nitrobenzene was used as a typical pollutant with a well defined reduction mechanism hofstetter et al 2003 klausen et al 1995 simultaneously the reduction kinetics of nitrobenzene by hematite 001 and 110 facets with varying concentrations of dissolved fe ii concentrations or at different ph were investigated finally the changes in the crystal structure of hematite were revealed and the underlying mechanisms of facet dependent fe ii redox chemistry on iron oxide were elucidated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all the chemicals were of analytical grade or

hematite and previous studies hu et al 2021b based on the above analysis hnps are of about 85 5 001 and 14 5 102 facets suggesting hnps are mainly exposed with 001 facet hnrs are of about 94 110 and 6 120 210 facets suggesting hnrs are mainly exposed with 110 facet the xrd pattern and raman spectra fig 1i j confirm that all the samples are pure hematite with a rhombohedral hexagonal phase the obtained powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns fig 1i of hematite nanoparticles matched α fe2o3 jcpds no 99 0060 no peaks for other phases were observed confirming that the prepared hematite 001 and 110 samples are pure and highly crystalline it should be noted that the strongest peaks of hnrs and hnps are 104 and 110 peaks respectively the mean crystallite dimension 104 and 110 peaks are used to represent the crystal size along the c axis and the a b plane respectively wu et al 2021 based on xrd patterns the hnrs exhibits better crystal development in the c direction and the hnps exhibits better crystal development in the a b direction these characteristics are in well accordance with previous studies hu et al 2021c huang et al 2016a suggesting the successful preparation of hematite with different exposed facets for raman spectra fig 1j the bands centered at 219 0 and 492 7 cm 1 are assigned to the ag vibration mode 286 7 401 7 and 603 3 cm 1 are assigned to the eg vibration mode qu et al 2013 for α fe2o3 the ag peaks are the antisymmetric stretching and bending vibrations of the o fe o and the eg peaks are the symmetric stretching vibrations of the o fe o yan et al 2020 due to the difference in the o fe o atomic structures the relative intensity of the ag peak is higher for hnrs while the relative intensity of the eg peak is higher for hnps fig 1j specifically hnrs 110 facet possesses five coordinated surface sites while hnps 001 facet has six coordinated surface sites huang et al 2016b 3 2 the interaction of hematite facets with fe ii ions the interaction of different hematite facets with fe ii ions was investigated by comparing the fe ii sorption kinetics and isotherms at ph 7 0 in an anaerobic glovebox the detailed fitting results are provided in supplementary material for hnps and hnrs fe ii ions sorption reveals a rapid rate in first 2 min and reaches equilibrium about 15 min and hnps demonstrates higher fe ii adsorption capacities q e than hnrs fig 2 a the pseudo second order kinetic model provides better fitting r 2 0 998 for hnps r 2 1 000 for hnrs than the pseudo first order model r 2 0 503 for hnps r 2 0 758 for hnrs fig 2b fig s1c table s1 langmuir r 2 0 984 for hnps r 2 0 983 for hnrs and freundlich r 2 0 988 for hnps r 2 0 987 for hnrs isotherm models well fit the sorption data fig 2c fig s1a b table s2 these indicate the interaction between hematite facets and fe ii ions can be described as monolayer chemisorption on the heterogeneous surfaces ho et al 2002 huang et al 2019b 2019c compared with 110 facet the 001 facet exhibits higher q m and n and lower constants of k l and k f these indicate that the binding ability between 001 facet and fe ii ions is stronger than 110 facet to investigate the effect of different exposed facets on fe ii adsorption at different ph the adsorption of fe ii ions by hnps and hnrs were carried out under acidic ph 5 5 neutral ph 7 0 and alkaline ph 8 5 conditions respectively fig 2d f fig s2 fe ii ions were rapidly bound to the hematite surface about 2 min at ph 5 5 8 5 two exposed facets exhibited similar kinetic constants i e k 2 k sa and h 2 fig 3 d f and the different k sa under acidic conditions ph 5 5 can be attributed to the different specific surface areas these results are consistent with previously reported studies gorski et al 2016 it is well known that ph can affect the binding between fe ii and hematite by changing the surface charge of hematite stewart et al 2018 the increase of ph can reduce the surface zeta potential of hematite particles which promotes the electrostatic attraction between hematite and fe ii ions cárdenas hernández et al 2020 this can be used to explain why fe ii ions were more easily adsorbed by hematite under alkaline conditions in this study it is worth noting that the 001 facet is more sensitive to ph changes than 110 facet fig s2 specifically as the ph increased from 5 5 to 8 5 the fe ii adsorption capacity of hnps increased from 0 68 to 6 25 mg g while for hnrs it increased from 0 50 to 4 03 mg g as revealed by table 1 hematite nanoplates hnps and nanorods hnrs are mainly exposed with 85 8 001 and 94 0 110 facets respectively hnps demonstrates a larger specific surface area ssa than hnrs 34 3 m2 g vs 8 50 m2 g but the maximum adsorption capacities q m of fe ii ions by hnps and hnrs are similar 2 58 mg g vs 2 08 mg g this indicates that the ssa contributes little to the fe ii adsorption as a result the ssa normalized site density was calculated to be 2 53 fe nm2 for hnrs which was 3 13 times that of hnps 0 809 fe nm2 3 3 facet dependent reduction potential of hematite fe ii couple previous studies have confirmed the reducing activity of the hematite fe ii couple is always affected by ph and bound fe ii species gorski et al 2016 however the effects of different exposed facets remain unknown to clarify this confusion we monitored the real time changes of e h and residual fe ii ions during sorption kinetics fig 3a b as shown in fig 3a compared with hematite 110 facet more fe ii ions bound to 001 facet resulting in a lower e h at equilibrium i e 360 mv for hnps fe ii r 2 0 987 and 320 mv for hnrs fe ii r 2 0 997 the e h value of the system exhibited an excellent correlation with the residual fe ii ions fig 3b which confirms that the bound fe ii can directly affect the e h value the intercept represents the theoretical e h values when the remaining fe ii ions is zero i e dissolved fe ii ions are completely adsorbed by hematite which are as low as 1451 mv for 001 facet and 1388 mv for 110 facet respectively subsequently we examined the reducing activity of hematite fe ii couple under varying ph or initial fe ii concentrations as shown in fig 3c d for hematite fe ii couples both ph r 2 0 970 0 975 and initial fe ii concentrations r 2 0 981 0 979 had excellent correlations with e h as expected the hematite 001 and 110 facets demonstrated differences at low ph or high initial fe ii concentrations specifically for hematite 001 and 110 facets their e h values were almost equivalent at ph 8 5 or 2 mg l fe ii but quite different at ph 5 5 192 mv vs 37 mv or 20 mg l fe ii 398 mv vs 321 mv fig 3c d previous studies have confirmed that fe ii ions can promote hematite recrystallization exchange of fe atoms through hematite bulk electron conduction frierdich et al 2015 as the electron transfer is favorable only until monolayer coverage of hematite by fe ii ions larese casanova and scherer 2007 which is controlled by surface potential differences yanina and rosso 2008 and the recrystallization is inhibited at low ph or high dissolved fe ii concentration frierdich et al 2015 these can explain the results in this study specifically at low ph or high fe ii concentration the dominant interfacial reaction on hematite facet was adsorption rather than fe ii catalyzed recrystallization it is well known that only hematite bound fe ii ions have reducing activity compared to free fe ii ions klausen et al 1995 and the different fe ii adsorption capacities of hematite 001 and 110 facets are the determining factors for reduction activity it has been confirmed that e h values of suspensions containing hematite α fe2o3 s and aqueous fe2 fe aq 2 are consistent with the following half reaction and corresponding nernst equation gorski et al 2016 stewart et al 2018 1 1 2 α f e 2 o 3 s e 3 h fe aq 2 3 2 h 2 o 2 e h e h 0 r t f ln fe aq 2 3 r t f ln h where r is the ideal gas constant t is absolute temperature f is the faraday constant and brackets denote activity at 25 c eq 2 simplifies to 3 e h e h 0 0 059 log fe aq 2 0 177 v ph as shown in fig 3c d the different slopes suggest that e h is influenced by the exposed facets as the intercept is related to e h 0 and ph the ph of 7 0 in fig 3d is substituted into eq 3 to obtain e h 0 of 0 964 mv and 0 945 mv for the hematite 001 and 110 facets respectively it indicates that in the absence of dissolved fe ii ions the hematite facets does not have reducibility 3 4 reduction of nitrobenzene by fe ii hematite and hematite fe ii couple in control experiment with only fe ii ions or hematite nitrobenzene concentrations remained almost constant suggesting that nitrobenzene cannot be directly reduced adsorbed by fe ii ions or hematite fig 4 a this can also be observed from the e h value in fig 3 specifically high values of e h are observed when the fe ii ions are not adsorbed by hematite fig 3a t 0 min and low values of e h are observed when the adsorption of fe ii reaches equilibrium fig 3a t 30 min in the treatment with hematite fe ii couple the nitrobenzene concentrations decreased quickly especially the first 15 min this indicates that the nitrobenzene can be rapidly reduced only in the coexistence of hematite and fe ii ions rather than dissolved fe ii species and these are in agreement with previous study huang et al 2019a 2016b hematite 001 facet exhibits higher nitrobenzene reduction ability than 110 facet specifically the hematite 001 facet mediates a faster equilibration time 15 min and higher reduction rate 61 while the 110 facet takes about 30 min with only 49 reduction rate fig 4a to further evaluate the reduction ability of hematite 001 and 110 facets we monitored the real time changes of the e h during nitrobenzene reduction fig 4b since the adsorption of fe ii ions by hematite had reached equilibrium before nitrobenzene was added the initial e h value was low i e 320 mv for hnrs fe ii and 360 mv for hnps fe ii respectively interestingly for both hematite fe ii couples the e h increased rapidly in the initial 15 min once the nitrobenzene was added which corresponded to the reduction kinetics of nitrobenzene it indicates that the reduction of nitrobenzene promotes the consumption of hematite bound fe ii and the fe ii adsorption process and the e h change for 001 facet was larger than that for 110 facet indicating 001 facet has higher reactivity to verify the above conjecture we measured the fe ii concentration during the nitrobenzene reduction fig 4c the concentration of fe ii ions decreased sharply in the first 2 min the hematite bound fe ii ion was oxidized by nitrobenzene and then decreased slowly until it reached equilibrium after 30 min the rapid oxidative deposition of fe ii ions on hematite facets likely provides more binding sites for fe ii adsorption therefore in the initial stage of nitrobenzene reduction the fe ii adsorption by hematite is promoted and new active fe ii species are produced note that nitrobenzene was added after the fe ii reached adsorption equilibrium therefore the reduction of nitrobenzene activates the rapid adsorption oxidation process of fe ii ions on hematite surface the reaction is not terminated until the dissolved fe ii ions are depleted i e after 60 min about 99 fe ii ions were consumed and the consumption of fe ii ions on hematite 001 facet was faster than that on 110 facet it is worth noting that when the nitrobenzene reduction reaches equilibrium the fe ii adsorption capacities of the two hematites are similar fe ii ions are almost depleted but the residual nitrobenzene concentrations are different fig 4a and c this indicates that the fe ii ions bound to 001 facet have higher reactivity than the 110 facet which is likely attributed to the different fe ii site densities of the two hematites specifically the low site density means that the active fe ii species are more uniformly distributed which may favor the transport of bulk electrons on the hematite surface 3 5 the ph response of facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction nitrobenzene cannot be adsorbed or reduced by dissolved fe ii ions or hematite under neutral ph 7 0 or alkaline ph 8 5 conditions fig 4a fig s3b but a weak adsorption was observed at acidic conditions ph 5 5 fig s3a these are consistent with previous findings cárdenas hernández et al 2020 stewart et al 2018 the reductive removal of nitrobenzene was clearly observed in the coexistence of hematite and fe ii ions under acidic conditions ph 5 5 the low removal of nitrobenzene is mainly due to the weak adsorption of fe ii ions fig 5 a b fig s2 s3 positive e h were even observed at initial 2 min fig 5c which is unfavorable for nitrobenzene reduction it is worth noting that the e h of the hematite fe ii couple at ph 5 5 decreased subsequently with the reduction of nitrobenzene fig 5c this indicates that the reduction of nitrobenzene can facilitate the combination between dissolved fe ii ions and hematite exposed facets more active fe ii species were produced fig 5a although there were few hematite bound fe ii species 10 under acidic conditions ph 5 5 fig s2 the facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction was observed at ph 5 5 i e 001 facet exhibits higher nitrobenzene removal shorter equilibrium time and larger kinetic fitting parameters k 2 k sa and h 2 than 110 facet fig 5d f these can be attributed to the difference in e h and the amount of active fe ii species i e hematite 001 facet has lower e h and higher fe ii adsorption capacity than 110 facet see section 3 3 with the increase of ph the reduction process of nitrobenzene was promoted with a low e h value fig 5a c indicating there are more active reduction sites on hematite facets since the active reduction sites mainly depends on the adsorption capacities of fe ii ions by hematite see section 3 2 the hematite 001 facet exhibits stronger nitrobenzene reduction ability than 110 facet we have proven in section 3 4 that the reduction of nitrobenzene and the depletion of active fe ii ions on the hematite facets are simultaneous and mutually reinforcing and the process is not terminated until one of them is depleted this is also the reason why the removal of nitrobenzene mediated by the hematite 001 facet is similar at ph 7 0 and 8 5 i e the active fe ii ions are almost consumed fig 5a however for hnrs although the fe ii ions were almost completely adsorbed on hematite surface at ph 7 0 see section 3 4 the nitrobenzene removal was further improved with the ph increased from 7 0 to 8 5 fig 5b these results indicate that not all bound fe ii ions on 110 facet are active species and some fe ii ions exhibit activity only under alkaline conditions it can be attributed to the small exposed facet hindering the bulk electron conduction between the dissolved fe ii ions and hematite facets hofstetter et al 2003 wu et al 2021 3 6 the fe ii activity of facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction we have confirmed that both fe ii adsorption and nitrobenzene reduction are facet dependent therefore it can be speculated that the fe ii activity on different exposed facets is also different to confirm this conjecture different initial concentrations of fe ii 2 20 mg l and nitrobenzene 5 20 mg l were investigated fig 6 as expected although nitrobenzene removal was promoted with increasing dissolved fe ii ions the hematite 001 facet always demonstrated higher nitrobenzene removal than 110 facet fig 6a and d specifically for hnps fe ii there was a lower equilibrium concentration of nitrobenzene with a shorter equilibration time in this study the reduction of nitrobenzene is controlled by e h and the e h is controlled by ph and fe ii activity these results are consistent with previous studies and the redox process involves proton transfer steps hofstetter et al 2003 stewart et al 2018 a recent study showed that the kinetics of nitrobenzene reduction can be described as the following second order reaction stewart et al 2018 4 log k sa e h 0 0 059 v log fe aq 2 2 ph where k sa is the surface area normalized reaction rate constant l m2 h based on eq 4 the reduction of nitrobenzene is positively correlated with fe ii activity and ph value and negatively correlated with e h value it is consistent with the results in this study however the effect of exposed facets is difficult to quantify pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to simulate the nitrobenzene reduction kinetic data fig 6b c e f the resultant fitting parameters are summarized in table s3 and table s4 pseudo first order kinetic model is based on the theory of membrane diffusion huang et al 2019c vetenskapsakademien 1898 pseudo second order kinetic model is established on the reaction rate limiting step involving electron sharing or electron transfer representing chemical process ho and mckay 2000 huang et al 2019c in this study the pseudo second order kinetic model provides better fitting r 2 0 990 1 000 for hnps r 2 0 999 1 000 for hnrs than the pseudo first order model r 2 0 681 0 826 for hnps r 2 0 592 0 994 for hnrs suggesting that the reaction kinetics are governed by electron transport efficiency although the nitrobenzene removal rate on 001 facet is consistently higher than that on 110 facet the reduction capacity q e of nitrobenzene are similar at high initial fe ii concentration specifically as the initial fe ii concentration increased from 2 to 20 mg l the q e of nitrobenzene on 001 and 110 facets increased by 7 05 and 7 41 mg g respectively table s4 these indicate that the final reduction rate of nitrobenzene mainly depends on the hematite bound fe ii species which have lower gibbs free energy than free fe ii ions wu et al 2021 the effect of fe ii activity on facet reduction activity can be observed from the kinetic parameters firstly the 001 facet exhibits higher and more stable reducibility than 110 facet at varying initial fe ii concentrations i e as the initial fe ii concentration increased from 2 to 20 mg l the 001 facet exhibited a relatively stable k 2 from 0 35 to 0 20 while for 110 facet the k 2 value gradually decreased from 0 91 to 0 03 fig 6b and e interestingly the values of k sa are close and the difference does not exceed 0 1 g2 mg min m2 fig 6c secondly the difference in the initial reduction rates of nitrobenzene on 001 and 110 facets is greater at high initial fe ii concentrations i e when the initial fe ii concentration was 20 mg l the values of h 2 are 13 89 mg g min for 001 facet and 1 77 mg g min for 110 facet respectively fig 6f in addition the effect of nitrobenzene concentrations 5 20 mg l was verified fig s4 the pseudo second order kinetic model provides better fitting r 2 0 999 1 000 for hnps r 2 0 998 1 000 for hnrs than the pseudo first order model r 2 0 634 0 999 for hnps r 2 0 370 0 940 for hnrs fig s4b c e f the chemical reaction process of nitrobenzene through electron transfer at hematite facet is confirmed again the facet dependence of nitrobenzene reduction by hematite was observed at low initial nitrobenzene concentrations i e hematite 001 facet demonstrated larger q e and higher h 2 than that on 110 facet when the concentration of nitrobenzene was less than 10 mg l table s5 table s6 3 7 changes in crystal structure and morphology to investigate the mechanisms of facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction the solid phase crystal structure and morphology after nitrobenzene reduction 120 min were characterized by xrd tem and eds mapping fig 7 as shown in xrd pattern fig 7a no new diffraction peaks appear and no original diffraction peaks disappear indicating that the composition of the hematite benzene does not change significantly and there is no formation of secondary minerals this can be due to the thermodynamic stability of hematite hu et al 2021b it is worth noting that the xrd peak intensity of hnrs become lower than hnps after reaction this can be explained based on the tem results fig 10b c i e after nitrobenzene reduction the morphological changes of hnps are small it is still a uniform regular hexagonal lamellar crystal while the main exposed facet of hnrs is recessed inward the change in morphology can be due to the dissolution which is likely related to the recrystallization frierdich et al 2015 wu et al 2021 the adsorption of fe ii ions can promote the hematite recrystallization exchange of fe atoms through hematite bulk electron conduction frierdich et al 2015 and this process is inhibited until monolayer coverage of hematite by fe ii ions larese casanova and scherer 2007 therefore the underlying transfer pathways of fe ii ions during the nitrobenzene reduction are as follows in the initial stage the adsorption of fe ii ions on hematite surface had not yet reached saturation fe atom exchange occurred fe ii oxidation and nitrobenzene reduction increased gradually then the adsorption of fe ii ions reached saturation the consumption and replenishment of bound fe ii ions maintained a balance the exchange of fe atoms was inhibited and the adsorbed fe ii ions were oxidized and deposited on the surface of hematite in the final stage the adsorption of fe ii ions reverted to an unsaturated state and fe atomic exchange occurred again in this study the dissolution of hematite is more obvious at the 110 facet than 001 facet indicating that the thermodynamic stability of the hematite 001 facet is better than that of the 110 facet the eds mapping characterization results fig 10d i demonstrate that n fe and o elements are uniformly distributed on the surface of both hematite indicating that the reduction products of nitrobenzene are uniformly adsorbed on the surface of hematite in addition the change of uv absorption peak during the degradation of nitrobenzene confirms that nitrobenzene is reduced by the hematite fe ii couple fig s5 which is consistent with the previous studies cárdenas hernández et al 2020 hofstetter et al 2003 stewart et al 2018 3 8 mechanisms of facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction based on the above results the underlying mechanisms of facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction are elucidated in fig 8 the reaction processes are as follows 1 fe ii ions are adsorbed on the exposed facets of hematite and the bound fe ii ions become active sites resulting in a low reduction potential 2 nitrobenzene activates the electron transfer and oxidation of hematite bound fe ii electrons are transferred to nitrobenzene through hematite facets and nitrobenzene is reduced 3 with the consumption of bound fe ii the dissolved fe ii ions are replenished to the hematite surface until exhausted the rate limiting step of the above chain reactions is the fe ii adsorption which controls the reduction potential compared with 110 facet 001 facet exhibits a larger fe ii adsorption capacity a lower reduction potential and a faster electron transfer efficiency resulting in a stronger reducibility it is worth noting that the facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction is intense at low ph or high fe ii activity this study provides an in depth understanding of the interfacial interactions between organic pollutants and exposed hematite facets in an anaerobic subsurface environments and contributes to a further understanding of the intrinsic reasons for the enhanced reactivity of hematite bound fe ii ions this study also provides insights into electron transfer process at hematite facets that control the biogeochemical cycling of solid phase fe with different exposed facets and the transformation of organic pollutants in subsurface aquifer 4 conclusions the results of the present study demonstrated the facet dependent reduction activity of hematite fe ii couple compared with hnrs hexagonal nanorods mainly exposed with 110 facet hnps hexagonal nanoplates mainly exposed with 001 facet had a larger specific surface area larger fe ii adsorption capacity and faster fe ii adsorption rate which led to more active fe ii species lower reduction potential and lower site density 0 809 fe nm2 the facet dependent reducing abilities of hematite fe ii couple was further confirmed by nitrobenzene reduction experiments nitrobenzene activated the electron release from hematite bound fe ii resulting in nitrobenzene reduction and fe ii oxidation compared with the hematite 110 facet the nitrobenzene reduction efficiency was higher on the hematite 001 facet which was attributed to the higher electron transport efficiency and lower reduction potential the facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction was more obviously observed at low ph 5 5 or high initial fe ii 20 mg l this can be confirmed from the differences in kinetic parameters and reduction potentials in addition the 001 facet exhibited better thermodynamic stability than 110 facet i e less dissolution under anaerobic conditions many legacy and emerging organic pollutants are susceptible to abiotic reduction this often occurs through electron transfer to ferruginous soil constituents the abiotic reduction can be rapid under favorable geochemical conditions and likely represent an important fate process for organic pollutants including nitrobenzene iron minerals are ubiquitous in the subsurface and play an important role in contaminant transformation in particular ferric oxyhydr oxides in the presence of aqueous fe2 have been shown to reductively transform organic compounds this study confirmed that the hematite exposed facets can be an important predictor of pollutant fate in subsurface aquifers it

15948,fe ii redox chemistry is a pivotal process of biogeochemical fe cycle and the transformation of organic pollutants in subsurface aquifers while its interfacial reactivity on iron oxides with varying surface chemistries remains largely unexplored in this study the redox processes of fe ii on two hematite with highly exposed 001 and 110 facets and their impacts on the transformation of nitrobenzene were investigated results suggest that fe ii adsorption is the rate limiting step of the redox chain reactions controlling the reduction potential e h nitrobenzene activates the facet electron transfer on hematite leading to nitrobenzene reduction and fe ii oxidation moreover 001 facet exhibits a higher reactivity and electron transport efficiency than 110 facet which is attributed to a lower site density 0 809 fe nm2 and a lower e h of hematite 001 facet than that of 110 facet it is worth noting that the facet dependent reduction activity is more intense at low ph or high fe ii activity a slight dissolution of 110 facet was observed indicating hematite 001 facet exhibits higher thermodynamic stability than 110 facet this study confirms the facet dependent reducing activity of surface bound fe ii on hematite providing a new perspective for in depth understanding of the interfacial reactions on hematite the findings of this work broaden the biogeochemical process of fe cycle in subsurface environments and its impact on the fate of organic pollutants in groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords redox chemistry facet dependence fe ii activity organic pollutants subsurface environments 1 introduction hematite α fe2o3 is the most thermodynamically stable iron oxide mineral and widely distributed in actual anoxic aquatic and terrestrial systems wu et al 2021 the hematite s surface is one of the most common redox active interfaces in subsurface aquifers huang et al 2016a 2016b the reductive dissolution of hematite the adsorption of fe ii ions by hematite and fe ii catalyzed hematite recrystallization are important processes of iron cycling playing an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of subsurface pollutants in groundwater hu et al 2021a 2021b subsurface pollutants are susceptible to abiotic reduction under anaerobic conditions electrons are typically transferred to pollutants from redox facile carbonaceous or ferruginous soil constituents and the abiotic reduction can be rapid cárdenas hernández et al 2020 as we all know high reductive activity can be observed from low reduction potential e h it can be explained thermodynamically that dissolved fe ii ion binds to fe iii oxyhydroxides with negative gibbs free energies forming thermodynamically stable crystalline oxides and resulting in a lower e h chen et al 2018 gorski et al 2016 since the dissolved fe ii does not exhibit reducibility the surface bound fe ii species are likely to predominantly determine the reductive activity huang et al 2016b the interactions between fe ii ions and iron oxides can be described with the interfacial electron transfer iet model hydroxyl ligands serve as electron donors and the confining fe ii ions on the hematite surfaces form amorphous ferric oxides e g feiiofeiiioh and feiiofeiii that have higher electron densities than aqueous fe ii huang et al 2016b joshi et al 2017 however the intrinsic reasons for the high reductive activity of fe ii ions confined on iron oxides are still unclear hematite particles exhibit different crystal structures under different subsurface conditions eggleston et al 2003 resulting in different proportion of exposed facets such as the 001 110 and 012 venema et al 1998 given that the fe reductive dissolution process generally occurs on the surfaces of iron oxides the differences in exposed facets likely have dramatic effects on the reducing activity of hematite fe ii couple hu et al 2021b the exposed facets and their surface active site density can strongly influence the reactivity of the hematite interfaces in many processes such as heavy metal adsorption catalytic performance and interfacial electron transfer wu et al 2021 therefore some specific exposed facets with higher surface energy have higher reactivity in recent years the adsorption process on metal oxides has been observed to be facet dependent such as heavy metals huang et al 2016a organics lv et al 2018 and proteins qi et al 2020 however it remains unknown whether the hematite mediated reduction of pollutants is facet dependent due to the diverse exposed facets of hematite and its wide distribution in nature it is necessary to understand the interfacial reduction reactions on different exposed facets of hematite a feasible solution to tackle these challenges is to quantitatively evaluate the binding capacity of fe ii ions on different exposed facets of hematite and verify the reduction efficiency of model pollutant on different exposed facets in past decade the reductive transformation of organic pollutants such as nitrobenzene on the surface of iron oxide minerals e g hematite or goethite has gained great attentions particularly in reaction kinetics and thermodynamics cárdenas hernández et al 2020 numerous studies have reported that pollutant reduction rates by fe ii ions are substantially enhanced in the presence of an iron oxyhydr oxide mineral recent studies have demonstrated that e h values for hematite and goethite bound fe ii can be accurately calculated using gibbs free energy values stewart et al 2018 cárdenas hernández et al 2020 and the electron transfer rate of nitrobenzene reduction is affected by fe ii activity and ph cárdenas hernández et al 2020 to reveal the facet dependent fe ii redox chemistry on iron oxide for organic pollutant transformation two types of well defined hematite with predominantly exposed facets of 001 and 110 were prepared and the interaction between different exposed facets of hematite and fe ii ions was investigated the hematite 001 and 110 facets are selected because they are the most commonly and naturally growing exposed facets to investigate the facet dependent reduction activity of hematite fe ii couple the nitrobenzene was used as a typical pollutant with a well defined reduction mechanism hofstetter et al 2003 klausen et al 1995 simultaneously the reduction kinetics of nitrobenzene by hematite 001 and 110 facets with varying concentrations of dissolved fe ii concentrations or at different ph were investigated finally the changes in the crystal structure of hematite were revealed and the underlying mechanisms of facet dependent fe ii redox chemistry on iron oxide were elucidated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all the chemicals were of analytical grade or

reactions the initial hematite concentration was constant at 1 g l 2 5 analytical methods ph and e h values were measured using a ph e h meter fe 28 mettler toledo switzerland the concentrations of dissolved fe ii in filtrates were immediately analyzed using the 1 10 phenanthroline method hu et al 2021b briefly 1 ml of the sample filtrate was added to 0 5 ml of chromogenic reagent 25 mm 1 10 phenanthroline 500 mm glycine 100 mm nitrilotriacetic acid volume ratio 5 5 1 after 10 min the solution was tested on a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2700i shimadzu japan with a detection wavelength of

morphologies and structures of the synthesized hnps and hnrs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem transmission electron microscopy tem and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem coupled with selected area electron diffraction saed fig 1 sem and tem images reveal that hnps and hnrs are of well defined shape which is consistent with previously reported results hu et al 2021b huang et al 2016a the structure of hnps hexagonal nanoplates can be simplified as two symmetrical hexagonal 001 facets and six equivalent 102 facets on the sides the mean width and average thickness are 103 and 7 85 nm respectively fig 1a b hnrs hexagonal nanorods can be simplified as six equivalent 110 facets and 120 210 facets at both ends the average width is 50 nm with a mean length of 450 nm fig 1e f the hrtem image demonstrates that the measured lattice spacing of the hnps edge is 0 25 nm and the angle between two non parallel crystal planes is 60 fig 1c for hnrs the edge lattice spacings are 0 25 nm and 0 44 nm with an intersection angle of 90 fig 1g the diffraction planes obtained by saed fig 1d and h are consistent with the lattice planes of standard hematite and previous studies hu et al 2021b based on the above analysis hnps are of about 85 5 001 and 14 5 102 facets suggesting hnps are mainly exposed with 001 facet hnrs are of about 94 110 and 6 120 210 facets suggesting hnrs are mainly exposed with 110 facet the xrd pattern and raman spectra fig 1i j confirm that all the samples are pure hematite with a rhombohedral hexagonal phase the obtained powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns fig 1i of hematite nanoparticles matched α fe2o3 jcpds no 99 0060 no peaks for other phases were observed confirming that the prepared hematite 001 and 110 samples are pure and highly crystalline it should be noted that the strongest peaks of hnrs and hnps are 104 and 110 peaks respectively the mean crystallite dimension 104 and 110 peaks are used to represent the crystal size along the c axis and the a b plane respectively wu et al 2021 based on xrd patterns the hnrs exhibits better crystal development in the c direction and the hnps exhibits better crystal development in the a b direction these characteristics are in well accordance with previous studies hu et al 2021c huang et al 2016a suggesting the successful preparation of hematite with different exposed facets for raman spectra fig 1j the bands centered at 219 0 and 492 7 cm 1 are assigned to the ag vibration mode 286 7 401 7 and 603 3 cm 1 are assigned to the eg vibration mode qu et al 2013 for α fe2o3 the ag peaks are the antisymmetric stretching and bending vibrations of the o fe o and the eg peaks are the symmetric stretching vibrations of the o fe o yan et al 2020 due to the difference in the o fe o atomic structures the relative intensity of the ag peak is higher for hnrs while the relative intensity of the eg peak is higher for hnps fig 1j specifically hnrs 110 facet possesses five coordinated surface sites while hnps 001 facet has six coordinated surface sites huang et al 2016b 3 2 the interaction of hematite facets with fe ii ions the interaction of different hematite facets with fe ii ions was investigated by comparing the fe ii sorption kinetics and isotherms at ph 7 0 in an anaerobic glovebox the detailed fitting results are provided in supplementary material for hnps and hnrs fe ii ions sorption reveals a rapid rate in first 2 min and reaches equilibrium about 15 min and hnps demonstrates higher fe ii adsorption capacities q e than hnrs fig 2 a the pseudo second order kinetic model provides better fitting r 2 0 998 for hnps r 2 1 000 for hnrs than the pseudo first order model r 2 0 503 for hnps r 2 0 758 for hnrs fig 2b fig s1c table s1 langmuir r 2 0 984 for hnps r 2 0 983 for hnrs and freundlich r 2 0 988 for hnps r 2 0 987 for hnrs isotherm models well fit the sorption data fig 2c fig s1a b table s2 these indicate the interaction between hematite facets and fe ii ions can be described as monolayer chemisorption on the heterogeneous surfaces ho et al 2002 huang et al 2019b 2019c compared with 110 facet the 001 facet exhibits higher q m and n and lower constants of k l and k f these indicate that the binding ability between 001 facet and fe ii ions is stronger than 110 facet to investigate the effect of different exposed facets on fe ii adsorption at different ph the adsorption of fe ii ions by hnps and hnrs were carried out under acidic ph 5 5 neutral ph 7 0 and alkaline ph 8 5 conditions respectively fig 2d f fig s2 fe ii ions were rapidly bound to the hematite surface about 2 min at ph 5 5 8 5 two exposed facets exhibited similar kinetic constants i e k 2 k sa and h 2 fig 3 d f and the different k sa under acidic conditions ph 5 5 can be attributed to the different specific surface areas these results are consistent with previously reported studies gorski et al 2016 it is well known that ph can affect the binding between fe ii and hematite by changing the surface charge of hematite stewart et al 2018 the increase of ph can reduce the surface zeta potential of hematite particles which promotes the electrostatic attraction between hematite and fe ii ions cárdenas hernández et al 2020 this can be used to explain why fe ii ions were more easily adsorbed by hematite under alkaline conditions in this study it is worth noting that the 001 facet is more sensitive to ph changes than 110 facet fig s2 specifically as the ph increased from 5 5 to 8 5 the fe ii adsorption capacity of hnps increased from 0 68 to 6 25 mg g while for hnrs it increased from 0 50 to 4 03 mg g as revealed by table 1 hematite nanoplates hnps and nanorods hnrs are mainly exposed with 85 8 001 and 94 0 110 facets respectively hnps demonstrates a larger specific surface area ssa than hnrs 34 3 m2 g vs 8 50 m2 g but the maximum adsorption capacities q m of fe ii ions by hnps and hnrs are similar 2 58 mg g vs 2 08 mg g this indicates that the ssa contributes little to the fe ii adsorption as a result the ssa normalized site density was calculated to be 2 53 fe nm2 for hnrs which was 3 13 times that of hnps 0 809 fe nm2 3 3 facet dependent reduction potential of hematite fe ii couple previous studies have confirmed the reducing activity of the hematite fe ii couple is always affected by ph and bound fe ii species gorski et al 2016 however the effects of different exposed facets remain unknown to clarify this confusion we monitored the real time changes of e h and residual fe ii ions during sorption kinetics fig 3a b as shown in fig 3a compared with hematite 110 facet more fe ii ions bound to 001 facet resulting in a lower e h at equilibrium i e 360 mv for hnps fe ii r 2 0 987 and 320 mv for hnrs fe ii r 2 0 997 the e h value of the system exhibited an excellent correlation with the residual fe ii ions fig 3b which confirms that the bound fe ii can directly affect the e h value the intercept represents the theoretical e h values when the remaining fe ii ions is zero i e dissolved fe ii ions are completely adsorbed by hematite which are as low as 1451 mv for 001 facet and 1388 mv for 110 facet respectively subsequently we examined the reducing activity of hematite fe ii couple under varying ph or initial fe ii concentrations as shown in fig 3c d for hematite fe ii couples both ph r 2 0 970 0 975 and initial fe ii concentrations r 2 0 981 0 979 had excellent correlations with e h as expected the hematite 001 and 110 facets demonstrated differences at low ph or high initial fe ii concentrations specifically for hematite 001 and 110 facets their e h values were almost equivalent at ph 8 5 or 2 mg l fe ii but quite different at ph 5 5 192 mv vs 37 mv or 20 mg l fe ii 398 mv vs 321 mv fig 3c d previous studies have confirmed that fe ii ions can promote hematite recrystallization exchange of fe atoms through hematite bulk electron conduction frierdich et al 2015 as the electron transfer is favorable only until monolayer coverage of hematite by fe ii ions larese casanova and scherer 2007 which is controlled by surface potential differences yanina and rosso 2008 and the recrystallization is inhibited at low ph or high dissolved fe ii concentration frierdich et al 2015 these can explain the results in this study specifically at low ph or high fe ii concentration the dominant interfacial reaction on hematite facet was adsorption rather than fe ii catalyzed recrystallization it is well known that only hematite bound fe ii ions have reducing activity compared to free fe ii ions klausen et al 1995 and the different fe ii adsorption capacities of hematite 001 and 110 facets are the determining factors for reduction activity it has been confirmed that e h values of suspensions containing hematite α fe2o3 s and aqueous fe2 fe aq 2 are consistent with the following half reaction and corresponding nernst equation gorski et al 2016 stewart et al 2018 1 1 2 α f e 2 o 3 s e 3 h fe aq 2 3 2 h 2 o 2 e h e h 0 r t f ln fe aq 2 3 r t f ln h where r is the ideal gas constant t is absolute temperature f is the faraday constant and brackets denote activity at 25 c eq 2 simplifies to 3 e h e h 0 0 059 log fe aq 2 0 177 v ph as shown in fig 3c d the different slopes suggest that e h is influenced by the exposed facets as the intercept is related to e h 0 and ph the ph of 7 0 in fig 3d is substituted into eq 3 to obtain e h 0 of 0 964 mv and 0 945 mv for the hematite 001 and 110 facets respectively it indicates that in the absence of dissolved fe ii ions the hematite facets does not have reducibility 3 4 reduction of nitrobenzene by fe ii hematite and hematite fe ii couple in control experiment with only fe ii ions or hematite nitrobenzene concentrations remained almost constant suggesting that nitrobenzene cannot be directly reduced adsorbed by fe ii ions or hematite fig 4 a this can also be observed from the e h value in fig 3 specifically high values of e h are observed when the fe ii ions are not adsorbed by hematite fig 3a t 0 min and low values of e h are observed when the adsorption of fe ii reaches equilibrium fig 3a t 30 min in the treatment with hematite fe ii couple the nitrobenzene concentrations decreased quickly especially the first 15 min this indicates that the nitrobenzene can be rapidly reduced only in the coexistence of hematite and fe ii ions rather than dissolved fe ii species and these are in agreement with previous study huang et al 2019a 2016b hematite 001 facet exhibits higher nitrobenzene reduction ability than 110 facet specifically the hematite 001 facet mediates a faster equilibration time 15 min and higher reduction rate 61 while the 110 facet takes about 30 min with only 49 reduction rate fig 4a to further evaluate the reduction ability of hematite 001 and 110 facets we monitored the real time changes of the e h during nitrobenzene reduction fig 4b since the adsorption of fe ii ions by hematite had reached equilibrium before nitrobenzene was added the initial e h value was low i e 320 mv for hnrs fe ii and 360 mv for hnps fe ii respectively interestingly for both hematite fe ii couples the e h increased rapidly in the initial 15 min once the nitrobenzene was added which corresponded to the reduction kinetics of nitrobenzene it indicates that the reduction of nitrobenzene promotes the consumption of hematite bound fe ii and the fe ii adsorption process and the e h change for 001 facet was larger than that for 110 facet indicating 001 facet has higher reactivity to verify the above conjecture we measured the fe ii concentration during the nitrobenzene reduction fig 4c the concentration of fe ii ions decreased sharply in the first 2 min the hematite bound fe ii ion was oxidized by nitrobenzene and then decreased slowly until it reached equilibrium after 30 min the rapid oxidative deposition of fe ii ions on hematite facets likely provides more binding sites for fe ii adsorption therefore in the initial stage of nitrobenzene reduction the fe ii adsorption by hematite is promoted and new active fe ii species are produced note that nitrobenzene was added after the fe ii reached adsorption equilibrium therefore the reduction of nitrobenzene activates the rapid adsorption oxidation process of fe ii ions on hematite surface the reaction is not terminated until the dissolved fe ii ions are depleted i e after 60 min about 99 fe ii ions were consumed and the consumption of fe ii ions on hematite 001 facet was faster than that on 110 facet it is worth noting that when the nitrobenzene reduction reaches equilibrium the fe ii adsorption capacities of the two hematites are similar fe ii ions are almost depleted but the residual nitrobenzene concentrations are different fig 4a and c this indicates that the fe ii ions bound to 001 facet have higher reactivity than the 110 facet which is likely attributed to the different fe ii site densities of the two hematites specifically the low site density means that the active fe ii species are more uniformly distributed which may favor the transport of bulk electrons on the hematite surface 3 5 the ph response of facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction nitrobenzene cannot be adsorbed or reduced by dissolved fe ii ions or hematite under neutral ph 7 0 or alkaline ph 8 5 conditions fig 4a fig s3b but a weak adsorption was observed at acidic conditions ph 5 5 fig s3a these are consistent with previous findings cárdenas hernández et al 2020 stewart et al 2018 the reductive removal of nitrobenzene was clearly observed in the coexistence of hematite and fe ii ions under acidic conditions ph 5 5 the low removal of nitrobenzene is mainly due to the weak adsorption of fe ii ions fig 5 a b fig s2 s3 positive e h were even observed at initial 2 min fig 5c which is unfavorable for nitrobenzene reduction it is worth noting that the e h of the hematite fe ii couple at ph 5 5 decreased subsequently with the reduction of nitrobenzene fig 5c this indicates that the reduction of nitrobenzene can facilitate the combination between dissolved fe ii ions and hematite exposed facets more active fe ii species were produced fig 5a although there were few hematite bound fe ii species 10 under acidic conditions ph 5 5 fig s2 the facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction was observed at ph 5 5 i e 001 facet exhibits higher nitrobenzene removal shorter equilibrium time and larger kinetic fitting parameters k 2 k sa and h 2 than 110 facet fig 5d f these can be attributed to the difference in e h and the amount of active fe ii species i e hematite 001 facet has lower e h and higher fe ii adsorption capacity than 110 facet see section 3 3 with the increase of ph the reduction process of nitrobenzene was promoted with a low e h value fig 5a c indicating there are more active reduction sites on hematite facets since the active reduction sites mainly depends on the adsorption capacities of fe ii ions by hematite see section 3 2 the hematite 001 facet exhibits stronger nitrobenzene reduction ability than 110 facet we have proven in section 3 4 that the reduction of nitrobenzene and the depletion of active fe ii ions on the hematite facets are simultaneous and mutually reinforcing and the process is not terminated until one of them is depleted this is also the reason why the removal of nitrobenzene mediated by the hematite 001 facet is similar at ph 7 0 and 8 5 i e the active fe ii ions are almost consumed fig 5a however for hnrs although the fe ii ions were almost completely adsorbed on hematite surface at ph 7 0 see section 3 4 the nitrobenzene removal was further improved with the ph increased from 7 0 to 8 5 fig 5b these results indicate that not all bound fe ii ions on 110 facet are active species and some fe ii ions exhibit activity only under alkaline conditions it can be attributed to the small exposed facet hindering the bulk electron conduction between the dissolved fe ii ions and hematite facets hofstetter et al 2003 wu et al 2021 3 6 the fe ii activity of facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction we have confirmed that both fe ii adsorption and nitrobenzene reduction are facet dependent therefore it can be speculated that the fe ii activity on different exposed facets is also different to confirm this conjecture different initial concentrations of fe ii 2 20 mg l and nitrobenzene 5 20 mg l were investigated fig 6 as expected although nitrobenzene removal was promoted with increasing dissolved fe ii ions the hematite 001 facet always demonstrated higher nitrobenzene removal than 110 facet fig 6a and d specifically for hnps fe ii there was a lower equilibrium concentration of nitrobenzene with a shorter equilibration time in this study the reduction of nitrobenzene is controlled by e h and the e h is controlled by ph and fe ii activity these results are consistent with previous studies and the redox process involves proton transfer steps hofstetter et al 2003 stewart et al 2018 a recent study showed that the kinetics of nitrobenzene reduction can be described as the following second order reaction stewart et al 2018 4 log k sa e h 0 0 059 v log fe aq 2 2 ph where k sa is the surface area normalized reaction rate constant l m2 h based on eq 4 the reduction of nitrobenzene is positively correlated with fe ii activity and ph value and negatively correlated with e h value it is consistent with the results in this study however the effect of exposed facets is difficult to quantify pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to simulate the nitrobenzene reduction kinetic data fig 6b c e f the resultant fitting parameters are summarized in table s3 and table s4 pseudo first order kinetic model is based on the theory of membrane diffusion huang et al 2019c vetenskapsakademien 1898 pseudo second order kinetic model is established on the reaction rate limiting step involving electron sharing or electron transfer representing chemical process ho and mckay 2000 huang et al 2019c in this study the pseudo second order kinetic model provides better fitting r 2 0 990 1 000 for hnps r 2 0 999 1 000 for hnrs than the pseudo first order model r 2 0 681 0 826 for hnps r 2 0 592 0 994 for hnrs suggesting that the reaction kinetics are governed by electron transport efficiency although the nitrobenzene removal rate on 001 facet is consistently higher than that on 110 facet the reduction capacity q e of nitrobenzene are similar at high initial fe ii concentration specifically as the initial fe ii concentration increased from 2 to 20 mg l the q e of nitrobenzene on 001 and 110 facets increased by 7 05 and 7 41 mg g respectively table s4 these indicate that the final reduction rate of nitrobenzene mainly depends on the hematite bound fe ii species which have lower gibbs free energy than free fe ii ions wu et al 2021 the effect of fe ii activity on facet reduction activity can be observed from the kinetic parameters firstly the 001 facet exhibits higher and more stable reducibility than 110 facet at varying initial fe ii concentrations i e as the initial fe ii concentration increased from 2 to 20 mg l the 001 facet exhibited a relatively stable k 2 from 0 35 to 0 20 while for 110 facet the k 2 value gradually decreased from 0 91 to 0 03 fig 6b and e interestingly the values of k sa are close and the difference does not exceed 0 1 g2 mg min m2 fig 6c secondly the difference in the initial reduction rates of nitrobenzene on 001 and 110 facets is greater at high initial fe ii concentrations i e when the initial fe ii concentration was 20 mg l the values of h 2 are 13 89 mg g min for 001 facet and 1 77 mg g min for 110 facet respectively fig 6f in addition the effect of nitrobenzene concentrations 5 20 mg l was verified fig s4 the pseudo second order kinetic model provides better fitting r 2 0 999 1 000 for hnps r 2 0 998 1 000 for hnrs than the pseudo first order model r 2 0 634 0 999 for hnps r 2 0 370 0 940 for hnrs fig s4b c e f the chemical reaction process of nitrobenzene through electron transfer at hematite facet is confirmed again the facet dependence of nitrobenzene reduction by hematite was observed at low initial nitrobenzene concentrations i e hematite 001 facet demonstrated larger q e and higher h 2 than that on 110 facet when the concentration of nitrobenzene was less than 10 mg l table s5 table s6 3 7 changes in crystal structure and morphology to investigate the mechanisms of facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction the solid phase crystal structure and morphology after nitrobenzene reduction 120 min were characterized by xrd tem and eds mapping fig 7 as shown in xrd pattern fig 7a no new diffraction peaks appear and no original diffraction peaks disappear indicating that the composition of the hematite benzene does not change significantly and there is no formation of secondary minerals this can be due to the thermodynamic stability of hematite hu et al 2021b it is worth noting that the xrd peak intensity of hnrs become lower than hnps after reaction this can be explained based on the tem results fig 10b c i e after nitrobenzene reduction the morphological changes of hnps are small it is still a uniform regular hexagonal lamellar crystal while the main exposed facet of hnrs is recessed inward the change in morphology can be due to the dissolution which is likely related to the recrystallization frierdich et al 2015 wu et al 2021 the adsorption of fe ii ions can promote the hematite recrystallization exchange of fe atoms through hematite bulk electron conduction frierdich et al 2015 and this process is inhibited until monolayer coverage of hematite by fe ii ions larese casanova and scherer 2007 therefore the underlying transfer pathways of fe ii ions during the nitrobenzene reduction are as follows in the initial stage the adsorption of fe ii ions on hematite surface had not yet reached saturation fe atom exchange occurred fe ii oxidation and nitrobenzene reduction increased gradually then the adsorption of fe ii ions reached saturation the consumption and replenishment of bound fe ii ions maintained a balance the exchange of fe atoms was inhibited and the adsorbed fe ii ions were oxidized and deposited on the surface of hematite in the final stage the adsorption of fe ii ions reverted to an unsaturated state and fe atomic exchange occurred again in this study the dissolution of hematite is more obvious at the 110 facet than 001 facet indicating that the thermodynamic stability of the hematite 001 facet is better than that of the 110 facet the eds mapping characterization results fig 10d i demonstrate that n fe and o elements are uniformly distributed on the surface of both hematite indicating that the reduction products of nitrobenzene are uniformly adsorbed on the surface of hematite in addition the change of uv absorption peak during the degradation of nitrobenzene confirms that nitrobenzene is reduced by the hematite fe ii couple fig s5 which is consistent with the previous studies cárdenas hernández et al 2020 hofstetter et al 2003 stewart et al 2018 3 8 mechanisms of facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction based on the above results the underlying mechanisms of facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction are elucidated in fig 8 the reaction processes are as follows 1 fe ii ions are adsorbed on the exposed facets of hematite and the bound fe ii ions become active sites resulting in a low reduction potential 2 nitrobenzene activates the electron transfer and oxidation of hematite bound fe ii electrons are transferred to nitrobenzene through hematite facets and nitrobenzene is reduced 3 with the consumption of bound fe ii the dissolved fe ii ions are replenished to the hematite surface until exhausted the rate limiting step of the above chain reactions is the fe ii adsorption which controls the reduction potential compared with 110 facet 001 facet exhibits a larger fe ii adsorption capacity a lower reduction potential and a faster electron transfer efficiency resulting in a stronger reducibility it is worth noting that the facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction is intense at low ph or high fe ii activity this study provides an in depth understanding of the interfacial interactions between organic pollutants and exposed hematite facets in an anaerobic subsurface environments and contributes to a further understanding of the intrinsic reasons for the enhanced reactivity of hematite bound fe ii ions this study also provides insights into electron transfer process at hematite facets that control the biogeochemical cycling of solid phase fe with different exposed facets and the transformation of organic pollutants in subsurface aquifer 4 conclusions the results of the present study demonstrated the facet dependent reduction activity of hematite fe ii couple compared with hnrs hexagonal nanorods mainly exposed with 110 facet hnps hexagonal nanoplates mainly exposed with 001 facet had a larger specific surface area larger fe ii adsorption capacity and faster fe ii adsorption rate which led to more active fe ii species lower reduction potential and lower site density 0 809 fe nm2 the facet dependent reducing abilities of hematite fe ii couple was further confirmed by nitrobenzene reduction experiments nitrobenzene activated the electron release from hematite bound fe ii resulting in nitrobenzene reduction and fe ii oxidation compared with the hematite 110 facet the nitrobenzene reduction efficiency was higher on the hematite 001 facet which was attributed to the higher electron transport efficiency and lower reduction potential the facet dependent nitrobenzene reduction was more obviously observed at low ph 5 5 or high initial fe ii 20 mg l this can be confirmed from the differences in kinetic parameters and reduction potentials in addition the 001 facet exhibited better thermodynamic stability than 110 facet i e less dissolution under anaerobic conditions many legacy and emerging organic pollutants are susceptible to abiotic reduction this often occurs through electron transfer to ferruginous soil constituents the abiotic reduction can be rapid under favorable geochemical conditions and likely represent an important fate process for organic pollutants including nitrobenzene iron minerals are ubiquitous in the subsurface and play an important role in contaminant transformation in particular ferric oxyhydr oxides in the presence of aqueous fe2 have been shown to reductively transform organic compounds this study confirmed that the hematite exposed facets can be an important predictor of pollutant fate in subsurface aquifers it

15949,entropy is a concept defined by the second law of thermodynamics applying this concept to the world we live in entropy production must be minimized and negentropy negative entropy production should be accelerated in order to produce a healthy and stable ecological system the present wastewater treatment however contributes to entropy production this means that conventional wastewater

limited the need to develop sustainable wastewater treatment in order to delay entropy production and accelerate negentropy becomes urgent resource and energy recovery from wastewater should be the first priority as they can contribute significantly towards minimizing entropy production and accelerating negentropy sustainable wastewater treatment must focus on recovering recyclable high value added organic chemicals from wastewater and or excess sludge to minimize entropy production caused by methane ch4 once combusted is converted into co2 an even higher substance in entropy via anaerobic digestion instead of ch4 thermal energy present in the effluent can be utilized for heating cooling buildings and also for drying excess sludge towards incineration to recover more energy overall this can lead to a carbon neutral operation and even creating a carbon sink could be possible for wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords entropy production negentropy natural entropy cycle conventional wastewater treatment cwwt sustainable wastewater treatment swwt resource and energy recovery 1 introduction entropy a concept derived from the study of thermodynamics describes the tendency of any closed system to increasingly descend into disorder or chaos leading to the collapse of the system marchettini et al 2008 but thanks for the solar energy there is also a reverse process known as negative entropy or negentropy in the earth ecosystem this can occur in various forms of material regeneration such as photosynthesis mineral enrichment sedimentation and mineralization etc schrödinger 1944 clearly a stable ecological system requires the recycling or neutrality of entropy production and the promotion of negentropy as shown in fig 1 a the green cycle in recent years the concept of entropy has been applied to environmental quality assessment diaz mendez et al 2013 luo et al 2017 microbiology nijman 2020 todhunter et al 2018 novel materials albedwawi et al 2021 biswas et al 2020 machine design yu et al 2021 ziya sogut 2021 and a range of other areas in the environment related fields negentropy is applied as an indicator of sustainability artuzo et al 2021 pelorosso et al 2017 saraswat and digalwar 2021 while civilization has developed to a degree that brings comfortable and elevated lifestyles to many it has also brought abnormal dissipation of resource and energy and this in turn has resulted in accelerated entropy production which inevitably leads to the destruction of the ecological balance as a pollutant discharged by human beings wastewater inevitably leads to entropy production wastewater and its treatment therefore can and should be analyzed from the perspective of entropy to search for more sustainable approaches wastewater treatment is a form of biomimicry including both anaerobic and aerobic processes which enhances the self cleaning capacity of a river in an engineered system by increase in aeration mixing and biomass this leads to extra entropy production due to consumption of energy and chemicals which often leads to the phenomena of destroying energy with energy and pollution transfer conventional wastewater treatment cwwt for example focuses on removing organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus as a result potential organic energy and nutrients are often destroyed or wasted which accelerates entropy production and leads to unsustainable use of resources and energy artuzo et al 2021 thus cwwt is actually a process that both accelerates entropy production of natural substances material element decay and delays negentropy material element regeneration as shown in fig 1a the red cycle this increase in entropy inevitably results in both environmental degradation and resource depletion marchettini et al 2008 to lower the risk of entropy production in managing wastewater sustainable wastewater treatment swwt will need to be developed how can this be achieved perhaps through the study of entropy itself 2 wastewater treatment and entropy as mentioned above wastewater treatment is a process of entropy production mainly reflected in the material energy conversion during treatment which can be summarized as follows i at the material level most organic substances low entropy substances such as carbohydrates proteins fats etc in the influent are gradually decompose into a large number of small disorganized inorganic often gaseous substances including high entropy substances such as co2 and h2o by microbial metabolisms rapf and kranert 2021 ii at the energy level the high grade energy in the organic substances is converted into the low grade energy by microorganisms which greatly reduces material availability rapf and kranert 2021 macroscopically this is a metabolic process in which microorganisms continuously dissipate energy in order to form new biomass and to maintain the complex cell system enhanced microbial activities transform many of low entropy pollutants that are discharged with wastewater into relatively stable high entropy substances the result of this process is accelerated entropy production and retarding negentropy due to the fact that resource and energy recovery are not involved both of them result in the system gradually deviating from the natural entropy cycle the red cycle illustrated in fig 1a if additional materials and or energy are used to achieve pollutant degradation entropy production would be accelerated further which can cause a much wider range of material and energy imbalances this would deepen the deviation of the natural entropy cycle until the natural ecological system begins to collapse eventually for this reason wastewater treatment should aim to follow the natural entropy cycle avoiding entropy production as much as possible and creating opportunities for negentropy to occur in order to achieve this approaches to developing synthetic and nondegradable materials for removing pollutants should be abandoned as such materials tend to produce entropy in significant quantities and it is difficult to recycle them clearly recyclable materials should be developed and applied to achieve negentropy 3 resource energy recovery and negentropy in the pre modern agricultural era human beings grew and fertilized crops with their own excreta and waste wastewater was purified by natural processes during these processes which invisibly conformed to the natural cycle of entropy nutrients c n p k etc and energy were recycled in exchanges between people and farmlands thus an ecological balance was maintained not unlike the balance of the naturally occurring system this state produced a harmonious coexistence between people and nature which is now referred to as the original ecological civilization and is illustrated fig 1b the green curve regrettably since the beginnings of the industrial revolution in europe humans have deviated more and more from this course gradually replacing it with a more modern lifestyle to the detriment of the environment the urbanization that accompanied the industrial revolution produced a mass system of modern toilet and sewer systems in modern cities which resulted in the original ecological system being almost completely demolished as a result the nature based habit of excreta returning to farmlands came to an abrupt halt especially after the introduction of the haber bosch process under the new systems both domestic and industrial wastewater began to flow into rivers lakes and oceans accelerating entropy production with the flushed away nutrients and energy delaying the process of negentropy modern wastewater treatments have been able to improve both the hygiene and environmental health of cities but they have also had the effect of intensifying entropy production clearly both accelerated entropy production and delayed negentropy caused by the treatment of wastewater as well as wastewater itself endanger the balance of the ecological system it is therefore necessary for cwwt to be converted into swwt in order to facilitate the effects of negentropy resource and energy recovery from wastewater treatment will contribute effectively to this process 4 sustainable wastewater treatment swwt in context in order to achieve swwt enhancing the input output ratio of wastewater treatment would be the crux of wastewater treatment in this way delaying entropy production and accelerating negentropy could be associated with saving carbon and energy and recovering resource and energy from wastewater treatment respectively it is worth noting that the latter must be a priority in developing sustainable wastewater treatment swwt progress in this regard has already begun and some global activities like phosphate organic recovery net zero carbon operation carbon neutrality etc are already being implemented 4 1 approach to delaying entropy production due to the growth of human population self cleaning bodies of water are becoming less and less available near city s areas thus both carbon and energy saving have become a major driving factor in developing sustainable wastewater treatment swwt for this reason anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox and aerobic granular sludge ags have been defined as the main technologies of wastewater treatment for the next generation van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 however both anammox and ags are limited in their ability to alleviate entropy production because of this accelerating negentropy is of the utmost importance in swwt with resource and energy recovery playing a key role 4 2 accelerating negentropy by resource and energy recovery both resource recovery and energy capture from wastewater treatment can contribute significantly to negentropy the former can directly improve the sustainability of substances and reduce waste contaminating the natural environment and the latter can make use of the potential energy present in wastewater phosphate recovery for example is of considerable importance in creating negentropy as phosphate is an essential compound for p fertilizer production chrispim et al 2019 the recovery and reuse of organic compounds can strongly contribute to decreases in entropy production except for the anaerobic digestion of excess sludge which will be discussed below for this reason recovery should be oriented to explore the recycling of high value added chemicals like pha eps alginate etc which would create a sustainable approach and also aid in developing a blue circular economy van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 indeed environmental sustainability can be strengthened by the continuous recycling and reuse of recovered resources and energy ghisellini et al 2016 however there is one important issue here that needs to be addressed the prioritizing of resource and energy recovery regarding energy recovery the conversion of chemical energy from excess sludge via anaerobic digestion ad is the most commonly used technology however this process results in high entropy production as organic substances are converted into ch4 and then once combusted into co2 an even higher substance in entropy moreover ch4 leakages also increase the greenhouse gas ghg effect as ch4 is 28 times more potent than co2 chen et al 2021 clearly the conversion of organics into ch4 via ad is not a sustainable approach to swwt from the viewpoint of negentropy theoretically there is 9 10 higher chemical energy in wastewater than electricity demand for aerobic treatment shizas et al 2004 in practice however only about 13 of the theoretical chemical energy could be converted to electricity and heat by ad with combined heat and power hao et al 2019a on the other hand there is a large amount of residual thermal energy in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants wwtps about 9 times higher in practice than converted chemical energy hao et al 2019a which can be used as an effective way to delay entropy production due to the high coefficient of performance cop 3 5 for water source heat pump wshp more thermal energy can be obtained than input electricity demand which has been extensively applied for heating cooling buildings in europe and also defined as a main approach to carbon neutral operation of wwtps pokhrel et al 2022 spriet et al 2020 it is worth noting that thermal energy might be the most effective substitute for a low temperature drying process of excess sludge prior to incineration hao et al 2020 in most cases thermal energy is able to meet the needs of carbon neutral or net zero carbon operation of wwtps in full and can also form a significant carbon sink for carbon emissions trading hao et al 2019b also the effluent that remains after thermal energy has been extracted can reduce ecological risks when discharged into receiving waters during the winter season although other thermochemical processes like gasification pyrolysis and even carbonization have also been studied and evaluated as potential approaches to handling excess sludge syed hassan et al 2017 incineration is relatively mature and has been practiced for decades in europe and is also being applied in china when gasification pyrolysis and carbonization can become a higher potential in negentropy than incineration in practice they should be proposed to substitute incineration in the future back to a state of the art in both research and engineering low grade thermal energy can be transformed into high grade heat for electricity generation via drying and incineration reaching the maximal exploitation of chemical energy last but not least the hazardous air pollutants e g nox so2 heavy metals and pcdds pcdfs produced in incinerated sewage sludge ash issa can be effectively controlled through staged air combustion ca based additive cl base additive and n containing compounds respectively liang et al 2021 after incineration most phosphate from the inflow up to 90 accumulates in issa about 8 dry weight which is comparable to that of low grade phosphate rocks and can be fully recovered more easily than by other approaches fahimi et al 2021 hao et al 2013 ma and rosen 2021 for this reason it has become a consensus on recovering phosphorus from issa egle et al 2016 moreover p recovery from issa has a high efficiency up to 95 which can substitute the conventional production of monocalcium phosphate to improve the performance on lca faragò et al 2021 some lca results revealed that the ashdec process the acidic wet chemical leaching process leachphos and also direct integration into the fertilizer industry with wet chemical extraction all indicated only a low change in cumulative energy demand as the additional demand for chemicals and energy can be offset by the p fertilizer credits amann et al 2018 moreover heavy metals removed from p recovery have also a potential to be recovered with some applied technologies such as wet chemical phosphorus recovery liang et al 2019 petzet et al 2012 fe and al recovery for producing coagulants by phos4life morf et al 2019 and ash2 phos cohen et al 2018 based on the p recovery technology catalog of european sustainable phosphorus platform espp espp 2019 there have been already some full scale plants of p and metals recovery from issa in europe and easymining s ash2phos technology with the high recovery efficiencies on p al and fe 90 95 60 80 and 10 20 respectively has been applied in a plant in helsingborg sweden which has a low energy consumption and a favorable mass balance anyway recovering phosphorus and metals from issa are being practiced in europe especially in the netherlands switzerland and germany finally the remaining ash after the recovery of phosphate and heavy metals can be utilized in building materials comprehensive utilization of thermal energy and sludge resources would reduce entropy production and enhance negentropy creating an ideal approach to swwt in summary the changes caused by modern civilization beginning in and based upon the industrial revolution have had the effect of making human civilization deviate from the natural entropy cycle natural purification is becoming less effective and it has become necessary to treat wastewater and to develop and apply cwwt as a result entropy production has become an undoubtedly real phenomenon as shown by the red curve in fig 1b under these circumstances developing swwt that emphasizes resource and energy recovery must be our top priority in order to delay entropy production and or accelerate negentropy 5 conclusions based on the above discussion and analysis some conclusions can be drawn as follows water self purification can help preserve the natural cycle of entropy but is becoming less available now as more and more wastewater is being produced and water self purification capacity becomes increasingly limited in an urbanized world wastewater can cause entropy production in the environment and conventional wastewater treatment cwwt can even intensify the process of entropy production it is necessary to develop sustainable wastewater treatment swwt capable of reducing entropy production and accelerating negentropy among others resource and energy recovery during wastewater treatment can help negentropy organics in wastewater should be recycled between high value added organic chemicals instead of being converted into ch4 thermal energy contained in the effluent should be fully utilized to realize carbon neutral operation and even carbon sink of wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

15949,entropy is a concept defined by the second law of thermodynamics applying this concept to the world we live in entropy production must be minimized and negentropy negative entropy production should be accelerated in order to produce a healthy and stable ecological system the present wastewater treatment however contributes to entropy production this means that conventional wastewater
