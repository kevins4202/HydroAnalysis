3780,cosmic ray neutron sensing crns is a newly developed method for continuously measuring soil water content swc at the hectometer horizontal scale however it is unknown whether crns based swc could be used for soil moisture prediction at field scale in this study we try to predict field scale swc using the crns combined with the temporal stability analysis in a karst watershed the crns was installed in a karst watershed as well as capacitance based swc sensors located in five land uses the crns was calibrated by eighteen manual sampling procedures a weather station was established about 200 m away from the crns for monitoring basic meteorological variables the mean footprint radius and effective depth of the crns were 311 51 m and 11 98 cm respectively the crns can accurately estimate intermediate scale soil moisture with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 89 significant correlations p 0 01 were observed between swc measured by the crns and em 50 instruments though the swc derived from the crns was significantly lower than that from em 50 instruments in different land uses the swcs at field scale can be predicted accurately the influences of landforms and land uses on prediction accuracy were not obvious from our data the crns has great potential to improve water resources management in areas with greater heterogeneity keywords soil moisture prediction cosmic ray neutron sensing temporal stability eco hydrology karst ecosystems 1 introduction surface soil water content swc is a crucial variable in hydrological processes at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales huisman et al 2001 li et al 2015 2019a it plays an important role in the exchange of matter and energy between the earth and the atmosphere zreda et al 2012 an accurate representation of swc could improve weather and climate forecasting and improve agricultural practices and water resources planning koster et al 2004 available techniques to assess variation of swc are either suited to measure point scale or large scale huisman et al 2002 however methods for point scale measurements are not representative of areas with high spatial heterogeneity area average swc of a desired precision is attainable through performing a large number of measurements over an area nevertheless these point scale measurement techniques are invasive labor intensive and often impractical western et al 2002 remote sensing is a promising technique for areal estimates of swc at large scales famiglietti et al 1999 but suffers from many limitations such as shallow penetration depth low frequency retrievals and sensitivity to surface roughness zreda et al 2012 there is a scale gap between point measurements and large scale remote sensing measurements cosmic ray neutron sensing crns is a recently developed method to bridge this gap at the intermediate scale the crns is a novel non invasive method shuttleworth et al 2010 that estimates area average swc of an effective depth on the order of decimeters within a radial footprint on the order of hectometers zreda et al 2008 2012 cosmic rays are high energy subatomic particles that were initially discovered by victor hess 1912 when cosmic rays penetrate the atmosphere fast neutrons are generated by the interactions of the cosmic rays with the atmospheric nuclei dong et al 2014 fast neutrons travel through the air and soil and can be moderated mainly by hydrogen in comparison with other elements the dominance of hydrogen in moderating fast neutrons provides the theoretical basis for swc measurement by fast neutron detection zreda et al 2012 the intensity of neutrons is inversely correlated with swc which is the major operating principle of crns zhu et al 2016 the horizontal footprint diameter decreases with increasing atmospheric pressure or atmospheric water vapor desilets and zreda 2013 rosolem et al 2013 the effective depth of crns significantly depends on the soil moisture status and ranges from 76 cm completely dry soil to 12 cm saturated soil zreda et al 2008 there have been a range of studies that have used crns in recent years among these studies the crns was calibrated by impedance probes and oven dried soil in intensive grasslands peterson et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 forests lv et al 2014 farmland han et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 and mixed vegetation lands franz et al 2012 dong et al 2014 mapped swc at spatial scales with a small root mean squared difference using the crns rover demonstrating the crns had excellent potential for evaluating satellite based swc estimates franz et al 2013b presented a universal calibration function by coupling with the neutron transport code monte carlo n particle extended mcnpx and observed soil chemistries and pore water distribution zreda et al 2012 systematically introduced the cosmic ray swc observing system and recommended applications under three different climatic conditions franz et al 2012 found that the daily evapotranspiration et values inferred from the cosmic ray neutron method agreed with the eddy covariance measured values indicating that the crns can provide flux measurements of the near surface at intermediate scales rivera villarreyes et al 2015 used inverse modelling techniques and swc measured by the crns to estimate root zone soil hydraulic properties at the field scale rosolem et al 2013 found that atmospheric water vapor near the surface can affect the neutron intensity signal by up to 12 corresponding to swc differences on the order of 0 10 m3 m 3 the crns provides an opportunity to advance our understanding of hydrological and water resource issues china s karst area is approximately 3 44 106 km2 china s karst area accounts for 15 6 of the global karst areas zhou et al 2015 and has important role in water supply for human society hartmann et al 2014 the appearance storage and circulation of water in karst aquifers often have distinct characteristics from the non karst region li et al 2017 because the karst landscapes display highly complex hydrological processes due to the high permeability of fractures and karst features jiang et al 2014 nie et al 2012 the unique karst features can often lead to seasonal drought events which are harmful to ecosystem stability cai et al 2014 li et al 2017 thus knowledge of soil moisture dynamics at various scales is crucial for water resource management furthermore the thin soils and high spatial variation of vegetation and rock fragment cover restrict the use of traditional techniques for swc measurements in karst landscape though the non invasive crns has been applied under a variety of environmental conditions zhu et al 2016 hawdon et al 2014 mcjannet et al 2014 rosolem et al 2013 franz et al 2013a b there is no report about the performance of the crns in karst areas with unique characteristics of karst aquifers in addition there are a variety of land uses in the karst area of southwest china due to the subtropical monsoon climate li et al 2019b different vegetation characteristics could result in complex hydrological processes and increase the difficulty of water management at field scale thus it is still a great challenge to link the soil moisture at the intermediate scale and field scale the temporal stability analysis however is a well known method which provides a profound opportunity to predict the areal mean swc by the representative location li et al 2016 unfortunately the identification of representative location is time consuming and labor intensive during the temporal stability analysis because the soil moisture of a large amount of sampling locations should be measured for several times in advance to calculate the areal mean swc in this study we hypothesize that the intermediate scale swc directly measured by the crns can be linked with the field scale swc from each land use using the temporal stability method this study used swc data derived from the crns and five land uses in a karst landscape the overall and location scale temporal stability were identified using spearman s rank correlation and relative difference analyses the main objective of this study was to try to predict field scale swc using intermediate scale swc data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was performed at the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems of the chinese academy of sciences in guangxi province china fig 1 the watershed is a typical peak cluster depression area with a relatively flat depression flanked by steep hills the climate is subtropical mountainous monsoon with mean annual temperature of 18 5 and mean annual precipitation of 1389 mm mostly falling from may to september the soil is calcareous developed from a dolostone base and rich in exchangeable ca2 this area experienced severe deforestation from 1958 to mid 1980s and then was abandoned for natural restoration the dominant vegetation includes clerodendrum serratum alangium chinese lour harms zenia insigins chun and pennisetum americanum p purpureum 2 2 ground based observation 2 2 1 the cosmic ray soil moisture observing system the cosmic ray soil moisture observing system crs1000b hydroinnova llc usa was placed at the junction of sloping land and a depression on 6 june 2017 fig 1 this system includes a moderated fast neutron detector a datalogger and a deep cycle battery linked to a solar panel the neutron detector was installed at a height of 1 5 m above the ground the datalogger and the battery were housed in an outdoor rated aluminum enclosure the battery provided the power for the system and maintained a relatively constant voltage of 12 v the time interval for data collection was set to 1 h and the data were stored on the removable sd card in both ascii and binary data files there were 319 days of data in total from 1 january to 15 november 2018 which were used for analyses in this study a cs 215 sensor was installed to measure the air temperature and relative humidity 2 2 2 manual sampling procedure for the calibration procedure twenty five sample locations were distributed evenly in five directions at 25 50 100 150 and 200 m apart from the crns this pattern was chosen so that each sample location is given equal weight in the cosmic ray neutron probe sensitivity the disturbed soil samples were collected at depths of 10 20 and 30 cm by a soil auger and the undisturbed soil cores 100 cm3 at the same soil depth were collected using cutting rings during a sampling campaign these soil samples were oven dried at 105 for 24 h for the determination of gravimetric swc and soil bulk density the volumetric swc was determined from bulk density multiplied by gravimetric swc there were eighteen campaigns over the entire sampling period 2 2 3 em 50 instruments five types of land use were selected for swc measurements the forest land brushland and grassland are located in the slope area and the abandoned land and farmland are located in the depression area the surface soil properties of the five land uses are presented in table 1 em 50 s equipped with five 5tm swc and temperature sensors decagon devices inc washington usa were installed vertically at depths of 10 20 30 40 and 50 cm in each land use type the data collection interval was consistent with the crns the swc data was collected using the em 50 instruments from 25 april to 7 november 2018 2 2 4 meteorological data a standard weather station was established approximately 200 m away from the crns in the depression area the meteorological data consisted of air temperature precipitation relative humidity atmospheric pressure solar radiation and wind speed the air temperature vapor density and atmospheric pressure were used to correct the raw neutron intensity 2 3 correction and calibration the neutron detector monitored the raw neutron density over a long time sequence however the variation of several factors such as atmospheric pressure water vapor and solar activity can affect the neutron intensity thus the raw neutron density should be corrected before converting it to swc the correction factor fp for air pressure is expressed as zreda et al 2012 1 f p exp p p 0 l where l is the mass attenuation length for high energy neutrons g cm 2 which varies progressively by 128 g cm 2 at high latitudes and 142 g cm 2 at the equator zreda et al 2012 p is the local air pressure and p0 is the mean air pressure during the measurement period the measured neutron intensity is affected by absolute atmospheric water vapor content rosolem et al 2013 the atmospheric water vapor correction factor fwv is shown as 2 f wv 1 0 0054 ρ v ρ v ref where ρv is the absolute vapor density g cm 3 and ρ v ref is the vapor density under reference conditions solar activity can affect the incoming neutrons so the fluctuations in the incoming neutron intensity should be removed the incoming neutron intensity correction factor fi is defined as 3 f i n m n avg where nm is the measured neutron intensity and navg is the mean neutron intensity during the measurement period eventually the corrected equation is given as follows 4 n cor n raw f p f wv f i where ncor is the fast neutron intensity after correction for water vapor air pressure and solar activity and nraw is the measured neutron intensity by the cosmic ray probe the crns can only measure cosmic ray neutron intensity then the measured neutron intensity must be converted to swc using a neutron particle transport model desilets et al 2010 developed a nonlinear calibration function that related mean swc to moderated neutron counts 5 θ n 0 0808 n cor n 0 0 372 0 115 where θ m3 m 3 is the mean volumetric swc cm3 cm 3 ncor is the corrected neutron intensity count h 1 cph and n0 is the neutron intensity over dry soil under the same reference conditions the value of n0 for a given site is determined through field calibration the specific procedure for the determination of volumetric swc is presented in 2 2 2 section the volumetric swc and the corresponding ncor can be introduced in equation 5 to calculate the value of n0 in this study there were eighteen sampling campaigns over the entire sampling period the mean value of n0 was 370 92 count h 1 2 4 footprint and measuring depth of the crns the footprint of the crns is defined as the area around the probe from which 86 of counted neutrons arise based on the mcnpx simulations the radius of the footprint is about 330 m at sea level zreda et al 2008 the footprint is mainly affected by the air properties regardless of the surface swc the footprint radius is calculated as desilets and zreda 2013 6 r r 0 p 0 p where r m is the footprint radius at air pressure p hpa and r0 is the reference radius 300 m at the reference air pressure p0 at sea level 1013 hpa the effective measuring depth is defined as the thickness of soil from which 86 of the neutrons are detected and is inversely correlated with swc the measuring depth was calculated as franz et al 2012 7 z 5 8 ρ bd τ θ 0 0829 where z is effective depth cm ρbd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 τ is the lattice water content in the mineral grains and bound water very small ignored in this study and θ is volumetric swc cm3 cm 3 equations 5 and 7 were developed for silica soils and may introduce error in karst area 2 5 methodology 2 5 1 spearman s rank correlation analysis the non parametric spearman s rank correlation test can be used to evaluate the similarity of the overall spatial or temporal soil moisture patterns the spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs is expressed as 8 r s 1 6 i 1 n r ij r i j 2 n n 2 1 where rij and rij are the ranks of the swc measured at time i in land uses j and j respectively n is the number of observations a value of rs closer to 1 indicates a stronger tendency of time stability for swc 2 5 2 temporal stability analysis temporal stability was evaluated using the relative difference rd which was initially introduced by vachaud et al 1985 in this study the rd between individual measurements of swc at location i at time j and the areal mean swc at the same time was calculated as 9 δ ij θ ij θ j θ j the temporal mean relative difference and its standard deviation for each sampling location were computed as 10 δ i 1 m j 1 m δ ij 11 ς δ i 1 m j 1 m δ ij δ i 2 where m is the number of measurement campaigns θij is the swc at location i for time j and θ j is the areal mean swc at time j the mrd value can determine whether a location underestimates or overestimates the field mean swc which has a zero mean rd the smaller sdrd of a location indicates a greater tendency of that location being temporally stable the mrd method can directly predict the mean swc on the condition of both mrd and sdrd values are lower than 5 however usually the mrd and sdrd would not satisfy the criteria simultaneously grayson and western 1998 thus proposed an indirect method that the location with the smallest sdrd value was identified as the most time stable location mtsl the mean swc can be expressed by considering the offset between the swc at the mtsl and the mean value as follows 12 θ θ mstl 1 δ mstl to predict field scale swc of different land uses based on the swc data at the intermediate scale crns the temporal stability analysis needed to be further extended in this study the swc derived from the crns and different land uses were rearranged into a new dataset therefore the mean swc of the new dataset can be predicted by the swc derived from the crns and different land uses the mean swc of the new dataset can also be defined in terms of the swc from the crns and different land uses by considering their corresponding offset because each time series of swc data was temporally stable to some extent 13 θ n θ crns 1 δ crns 14 θ n θ lu 1 δ lu where θ n is the mean swc of the new dataset θ crns and δ crns are swc measured by the crns and its associated mrd respectively and θ lu and δ lu are swc of one land use and its associated mrd respectively according to eqs 13 and 14 the swc of one land use could be expressed as 15 θ lu θ crns 1 δ lu 1 δ crns in this study the 197 days of soil moisture data derived from the em 50 instruments was divided into two subdatasets one subdataset includes the first 100 days of soil moisture data which was used to identify the mrd and the associated sdrd the other subdataset includes the rest 97 days of soil moisture data for validating the prediction accuracy the root mean square error rmse was selected to evaluate the strength of the statistical relationships between the measured and predicted swc as follows 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n sw c p s w c m 2 where n is the number of predicted swc values swcm and swcp are the measured and predicted values of swc respectively 2 6 statistical analysis exploratory analysis was conducted by microsoft office excel 2016 microsoft corporation inc redmond usa spearman s rank correlation analysis and duncan s multiple range test was performed to identify the relationships and the statistically significant differences p 0 05 among the mean swcs derived from the crns and different land uses respectively linear fitting analysis was carried out between the measured and predicted mean swcs with the coefficient of determination r 2 as a measure of the goodness of fit the statistical analyses of the swc data were performed with spss 22 0 software spss inc chicago usa 3 results 3 1 footprint radius and measuring depth it is important to determine the value of n0 in advance for soil moisture conversion the n0 was calibrated by eighteen manual sampling campaigns in this study the n0 ranged from 362 87 to 376 61 count h 1 with the mean value of 370 92 count h 1 table 2 fig 2 presented the evolution of the horizontal footprint radius measuring depth and their associated influencing factors over the entire sampling period the mean values of air pressure air temperature and swc were 975 62 hpa 26 27 and 0 41 cm3 cm 3 respectively tables 2 and 3 the footprint radius and measuring depth showed fluctuations that were inverse to air pressure and swc respectively the footprint radius averaged 311 51 m ranging from 307 69 to 315 01 m and the measuring depth averaged 11 98 cm ranging from 10 25 to 15 70 cm table 2 3 2 comparison of swcs derived from the crns oven drying method and em 50 instruments fig 3 shows the temporal changes of intermediate scale swc measured by the crns and manual sampling campaigns field scale swc of five land uses measured by the em 50 instruments and the corresponding precipitation the manual sampling campaigns were conducted at eighteen dates during the sampling period the swcs derived from the oven drying method were closest to the swcs measured by the crns fig 3 the crns measured swc was significantly correlated p 0 001 with the swc measured by oven drying with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 89 fig 4 the swcs derived from the crns and em 50 instruments fluctuated with precipitation during the growing season the variation of swc was sensitive to precipitation for example several swc peaks could be observed after high rainfall fig 4 the swc measured by the crns ranged from 0 29 to 0 48 cm3 cm 3 with a mean value of 0 41 cm3 cm 3 the mean swc of 0 20 cm soil depth for abandoned land forest land brushland farmland and grassland were 0 44 0 51 0 44 0 44 and 0 53 cm3 cm 3 respectively table 3 the mean swc of grassland was the highest followed by the forest land the mean swc for abandoned land brushland and farmland were the same however the mean swc of different land uses were significantly p 0 05 higher than that of crns the standard deviation of swc ranged from 0 03 to 0 06 cm3 cm 3 for the crns and different land uses and the cv ranged from 7 52 to 11 55 table 3 though the swc measured by the crns was significantly lower than the swc derived from the em 50 instruments in the different land uses the temporal swc patterns at an intermediate scale were similar to those at a field scale table 4 displayed the rs values between swcs at intermediate and field scales all the rs values were significant p 0 01 the rs values ranged from 0 411 between forest and grassland swc to 0 896 between abandoned land and brushland swc table 4 the significant correlation of overall temporal swc patterns suggest that temporal stability analysis may be a way to link soil moisture prediction at different scales 3 3 prediction of surface swc for different land uses the measuring depth of the crns ranged from 10 25 to 15 70 cm in this study therefore we chose soil moisture data from 0 to 20 cm soil depth at the field scale for further analysis the mrd ranged from 25 18 to 16 57 and the sdrd ranged from 3 48 to 7 74 for the crns and different land uses for 0 10 cm depth table 5 similarly the mrd and the corresponding sdrd ranged from 15 11 to 11 83 and from 3 95 to 6 25 for 10 20 cm depth respectively table 5 when sdrd is lower than 10 this suggests relatively accurate prediction figs 5 and 6 displayed the regression curve between swc predicted by the crns and the measured swc of different land uses for 0 10 and 10 20 cm depth respectively the rmse were used to evaluate the performance of the extended temporal stability method all the measured swcs at different land uses can be predicted accurately by the swc derived from the crns the values of rmse were 0 04 0 03 0 04 0 06 and 0 06 cm3 cm 3 for farmland abandoned land brushland forest land and grassland respectively fig 5 for 0 10 cm depth the values of rmse changed relatively little ranging from 0 04 to 0 06 cm3 cm 3 for 10 20 cm depth the values of rmse of all land were 0 04 and 0 05 cm3 cm 3 for 0 10 and 10 20 cm depths respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the performance of the crns for measuring intermediate scale swc in karst area the footprint radius showed little change ranging from 307 69 to 315 01 m this result can be attributed to the low coefficient of variation of air pressure table 2 the mean radius was 311 51 m in this study which was slightly higher than the radius at sea level 300 m however the radius was identified to be 580 m in an alpine meadow observed by zhu et al 2016 due to the high altitude desilets and zreda 2013 the horizontal footprint mainly relies on atmospheric density and humidity the footprint radius increases with decreasing air density and thus also with elevation zreda et al 2012 the effective depth of measurement depends strongly on soil water status the mean measuring depth was 11 98 cm which was relatively smaller compared to other studies schreiner mcgraw et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 due to the high swc table 3 the crns here was assessed to retrieve soil moisture dynamics within a heterogeneous karst watershed however use of crns is mainly recommended in relatively flat areas han et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 2017 peterson et al 2016 in this study the eighteen weighted means derived from the oven drying method agreed well with the swc measured by the crns figs 3 and 4 the results indicated that accurate measurements of swc at an intermediate scale can be obtained using crns in a non invasive way in karst areas where the watershed consists of peak cluster depression landforms 4 2 field scale surface swc prediction using extended temporal stability analysis the intermediate scale swc measured by the crns was significantly lower than the field scale swc in different land uses the overall temporal pattern of swc measured by the crns correlated significantly with the swc derived from the em 50 instruments table 4 significant correlations between swcs in spatial or temporal series have been previously reported biswas and si 2011a b li et al 2015 2017 for example biswas and si 2011a found that the rs values between any two depths for any date were statistically significant p 0 001 in a hummocky landscape li et al 2017 observed that the rs values ranged from 0 929 to 0 980 for farmland and from 0 540 to 0 952 for grassland in a karst depression this result provides a solid foundation for predicting field scale soil moisture from intermediate scale measurements according to nielsen and bouma 1985 swc spatial distribution shows weak variability if the cv is 10 moderate variability if the cv is between 10 and 100 and strong variability if the cv is larger than 100 in this study the temporal swcs derived from the crns and em 50 instruments demonstrated weak variability around 10 which is lower than the spatial swcs cv reported in other studies gao and shao 2012a xu et al 2017 this indicates that the swc showed a temporal stability the range of mrd were smaller compared with previous studies jia et al 2013 gao and shao 2012a b liu et al 2014 for instance jia et al 2013 found that over various soil depths the range of mrd in soil water storage ranged from 85 8 and 86 3 to 178 9 and 143 9 for two hillslopes respectively this is because the evolution of swc in spatial series is controlled mainly by static factors such as soil texture and topography mohanty and skaggs 2001 starks et al 2006 cosh et al 2008 while the change of swc in the temporal dimension is mainly determined by the dynamic factors such as precipitation li et al 2017 in this study we made an attempt to predict swc at the field scale using the swc measurements at an intermediate scale figs 5 and 6 showed that all of the swcs of each land use were accurately predicted by the swc data based on the crns p 0 001 the forest land brushland and grassland are located on the hillslope and the abandoned land and farmland are located in the depression the prediction accuracy was comparable on the hillslope in comparison to the depression there were no obvious influence of soil depth and spatial location on the prediction accuracy there were significant p 0 01 differences in swcs measured by the crns and the em 50 instruments but the sdrd values for swc were small around 5 these results indicated that the temporal stability of swc may be more important than the soil moisture status during swc prediction this study supports the hypothesis that intermediate scale swc can be successfully linked with field scale swc in different land uses using the temporal stability method in a karst landscape 5 conclusions above ground cosmic ray neutron measurements can infer swc at the intermediate scale in this study we first evaluated the application of crns in a karst watershed with high heterogeneity we tried to predict swcs at field scale based on the swc measurements from crns combined with the extended temporal stability analysis we found that the mean footprint radius and effective depth of the crns were 311 51 m and 11 98 cm respectively the crns can accurately estimate swc at an intermediate scale p 0 001 with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 89 the overall temporal swc pattern measured by the crns correlated significantly with the swc derived from the em 50 instruments providing a scientific basis for trans scale soil moisture prediction though the swc derived from the crns was significantly lower than that from em 50 instruments in different land uses the swcs at the field scale can be accurately predicted the prediction accuracy of swc was irrelevant to landform and land use type it can be concluded that the crns is a robust method for measuring swc at an intermediate scale the results also provide a promising feasibility of the crns in predicting field scale swc

3780,cosmic ray neutron sensing crns is a newly developed method for continuously measuring soil water content swc at the hectometer horizontal scale however it is unknown whether crns based swc could be used for soil moisture prediction at field scale in this study we try to predict field scale swc using the crns combined with the temporal stability analysis in a karst watershed the crns was installed in a karst watershed as well as capacitance based swc sensors located in five land uses the crns was calibrated by eighteen manual sampling procedures a weather station was established about 200 m away from the crns for monitoring basic meteorological variables the mean footprint radius and effective depth of the crns were 311 51 m and 11 98 cm respectively the crns can accurately estimate intermediate scale soil moisture with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 89 significant correlations p 0 01 were observed between swc measured by the crns and em 50 instruments though the swc derived from the crns was significantly lower than that from em 50 instruments in different land uses the swcs at field scale can be predicted accurately the influences of landforms and land

cosmic ray neutron sensing temporal stability eco hydrology karst ecosystems 1 introduction surface soil water content swc is a crucial variable in hydrological processes at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales huisman et al 2001 li et al 2015 2019a it plays an important role in the exchange of matter and energy between the earth and the atmosphere zreda et al 2012 an accurate representation of swc could improve weather and climate forecasting and improve agricultural practices and water resources planning koster et al 2004 available techniques to assess variation of swc are either suited to measure point scale or large scale huisman et al 2002 however methods for point scale measurements are not representative of areas with high spatial heterogeneity area average swc of a desired precision is attainable through performing a large number of measurements over an area nevertheless these point scale measurement techniques are invasive labor intensive and often impractical western et al 2002 remote sensing is a promising technique for areal estimates of swc at large scales famiglietti et al 1999 but suffers from many limitations such as shallow penetration depth low frequency retrievals and sensitivity to surface roughness zreda et al 2012 there is a scale gap between point measurements and large scale remote sensing measurements cosmic ray neutron sensing crns is a recently developed method to bridge this gap at the intermediate scale the crns is a novel non invasive method shuttleworth et al 2010 that estimates area average swc of an effective depth on the order of decimeters within a radial footprint on the order of hectometers zreda et al 2008 2012 cosmic rays are high energy subatomic particles that were initially discovered by victor hess 1912 when cosmic rays penetrate the atmosphere fast neutrons are generated by the interactions of the cosmic rays with the atmospheric nuclei dong et al 2014 fast neutrons travel through the air

al 2012 systematically introduced the cosmic ray swc observing system and recommended applications under three different climatic conditions franz et al 2012 found that the daily evapotranspiration et values inferred from the cosmic ray neutron method agreed with the eddy covariance measured values indicating that the crns can provide flux measurements of the near surface at intermediate scales rivera villarreyes et al 2015 used inverse modelling techniques and swc measured by the crns to estimate root zone soil hydraulic properties at the field scale rosolem et al 2013 found that atmospheric water vapor near the surface can affect the neutron intensity signal by up to 12 corresponding to swc differences on the order of 0 10 m3 m 3 the crns provides an opportunity to advance our understanding of hydrological and water resource issues china s karst area is approximately 3 44 106 km2 china s karst area accounts for 15 6 of the global karst areas zhou et al 2015 and has important role in water supply for human society hartmann et al 2014 the appearance storage and circulation of water in karst aquifers often have distinct characteristics from the non karst region li et al 2017 because the karst landscapes display highly complex hydrological processes due to the high permeability of fractures and karst features jiang et al 2014 nie et al 2012 the unique karst features can often lead to seasonal drought events which are harmful to ecosystem stability cai et al 2014 li et al 2017 thus knowledge of soil moisture dynamics at various scales is crucial for water resource management furthermore the thin soils and high spatial variation of vegetation and rock fragment cover restrict the use of traditional techniques for swc measurements in karst landscape though the non invasive crns has been applied under a variety of environmental conditions zhu et al 2016 hawdon et al 2014 mcjannet et al 2014 rosolem et al 2013 franz et al 2013a b there is no report about the performance of the crns in karst areas with unique characteristics of karst aquifers in addition there are a variety of land uses in the karst area of southwest china due to the subtropical monsoon climate li et al 2019b different vegetation characteristics could result in complex hydrological processes and increase the difficulty of water management at field scale thus it is still a great challenge to link the soil moisture at the intermediate scale and field scale the temporal stability analysis however is a well known method which provides a profound opportunity to predict the areal mean swc by the representative location li et al 2016 unfortunately the identification of representative location is time consuming and labor intensive during the temporal stability analysis because the soil moisture of a large amount of sampling locations should be measured for several times in advance to calculate the areal mean swc in this study we hypothesize that the intermediate scale swc directly measured by the crns can be linked with the field scale swc from each land use using the temporal stability method this study used swc data derived from the crns and five land uses in a karst landscape the overall and location scale temporal stability were identified using spearman s rank correlation and relative difference analyses the main objective of this study was to try to predict field scale swc using intermediate scale swc data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was performed at the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems of the chinese academy of sciences in guangxi province china fig 1 the watershed is a typical peak cluster depression area with a relatively flat depression flanked by steep hills the climate is subtropical mountainous monsoon with mean annual temperature of 18 5 and mean annual precipitation of 1389 mm mostly falling from may to september the soil is calcareous developed from a dolostone base and rich in exchangeable ca2 this area experienced severe deforestation from 1958 to mid 1980s and then was abandoned for natural restoration the dominant vegetation includes clerodendrum serratum alangium chinese lour harms zenia insigins chun and pennisetum americanum p purpureum 2 2 ground based observation 2 2 1 the cosmic ray soil moisture observing system the cosmic ray soil moisture observing system crs1000b hydroinnova llc usa was placed at the junction of sloping land and a depression on 6 june 2017 fig 1 this system includes a moderated fast neutron detector a datalogger and a deep cycle battery linked to a solar panel the neutron detector was installed at a height of 1 5 m above the ground the datalogger and the battery were housed in an outdoor rated aluminum enclosure the battery provided the power for the system and maintained a relatively constant voltage of 12 v the time interval for data collection was set to 1 h and the data were stored on the removable sd card in both ascii and binary data files there were 319 days of data in total from 1 january to 15 november 2018 which were used for analyses in this study a cs 215 sensor was installed to measure the air temperature and relative humidity 2 2 2 manual sampling procedure for the calibration procedure twenty five sample locations were distributed evenly in five directions at 25 50 100 150 and 200 m apart from the crns this pattern was chosen so that each sample location is given equal weight in the cosmic ray neutron probe sensitivity the disturbed soil samples were collected at depths of 10 20 and 30 cm by a soil auger and the undisturbed soil cores 100 cm3 at the same soil depth were collected using cutting rings during a sampling campaign these soil samples were oven dried at 105 for 24 h for the determination of gravimetric swc and soil bulk density the volumetric swc was determined from bulk density multiplied by gravimetric swc there were eighteen campaigns over the entire sampling period 2 2 3 em 50 instruments five types of land use were selected for swc measurements the forest land brushland and grassland are located in the slope area and the abandoned land and farmland are located in the depression area the surface soil properties of the five land uses are presented in table 1 em 50 s equipped with five 5tm swc and temperature sensors decagon devices inc washington usa were installed vertically at depths of 10 20 30 40 and 50 cm in each land use type the data collection interval was consistent with the crns the swc data was collected using the em 50 instruments from 25 april to 7 november 2018 2 2 4 meteorological data a standard weather station was established approximately 200 m away from the crns in the depression area the meteorological data consisted of air temperature precipitation relative humidity atmospheric pressure solar radiation and wind speed the air temperature vapor density and atmospheric pressure were used to correct the raw neutron intensity 2 3 correction and calibration the neutron detector monitored the raw neutron density over a long time sequence however the variation of several factors such as atmospheric pressure water vapor and solar activity can affect the neutron intensity thus the raw neutron density should be corrected before converting it to swc the correction factor fp for air pressure is expressed as zreda et al 2012 1 f p exp p p 0 l where l is the mass attenuation length for high energy neutrons g cm 2 which varies progressively by 128 g cm 2 at high latitudes and 142 g cm 2 at the equator zreda et al 2012 p is the local air pressure and p0 is the mean air pressure during the measurement period the measured neutron intensity is affected by absolute atmospheric water vapor content rosolem et al 2013 the atmospheric water vapor correction factor fwv is shown as 2 f wv 1 0 0054 ρ v ρ v ref where ρv is the absolute vapor density g cm 3 and ρ v ref is the vapor density under reference conditions solar activity can affect the incoming neutrons so the fluctuations in the incoming neutron intensity should be removed the incoming neutron intensity correction factor fi is defined as 3 f i n m n avg where nm is the measured neutron intensity and navg is the mean neutron intensity during the measurement period eventually the corrected equation is given as follows 4 n cor n raw f p f wv f i where ncor is the fast neutron intensity after correction for water vapor air pressure and solar activity and nraw is the measured neutron intensity by the cosmic ray probe the crns can only measure cosmic ray neutron intensity then the measured neutron intensity must be converted to swc using a neutron particle transport model desilets et al 2010 developed a nonlinear calibration function that related mean swc to moderated neutron counts 5 θ n 0 0808 n cor n 0 0 372 0 115 where θ m3 m 3 is the mean volumetric swc cm3 cm 3 ncor is the corrected neutron intensity count h 1 cph and n0 is the neutron intensity over dry soil under the same reference conditions the value of n0 for a given site is determined through field calibration the specific procedure for the determination of volumetric swc is presented in 2 2 2 section the volumetric swc and the corresponding ncor can be introduced in equation 5 to calculate the value of n0 in this study there were eighteen sampling campaigns over the entire sampling period the mean value of n0 was 370 92 count h 1 2 4 footprint and measuring depth of the crns the footprint of the crns is defined as the area around the probe from which 86 of counted neutrons arise based on the mcnpx simulations the radius of the footprint is about 330 m at sea level zreda et al 2008 the footprint is mainly affected by the air properties regardless of the surface swc the footprint radius is calculated as desilets and zreda 2013 6 r r 0 p 0 p where r m is the footprint radius at air pressure p hpa and r0 is the reference radius 300 m at the reference air pressure p0 at sea level 1013 hpa the effective measuring depth is defined as the thickness of soil from which 86 of the neutrons are detected and is inversely correlated with swc the measuring depth was calculated as franz et al 2012 7 z 5 8 ρ bd τ θ 0 0829 where z is effective depth cm ρbd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 τ is the lattice water content in the mineral grains and bound water very small ignored in this study and θ is volumetric swc cm3 cm 3 equations 5 and 7 were developed for silica soils and may introduce error in karst area 2 5 methodology 2 5 1 spearman s rank correlation analysis the non parametric spearman s rank correlation test can be used to evaluate the similarity of the overall spatial or temporal soil moisture patterns the spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs is expressed as 8 r s 1 6 i 1 n r ij r i j 2 n n 2 1 where rij and rij are the ranks of the swc measured at time i in land uses j and j respectively n is the number of observations a value of rs closer to 1 indicates a stronger tendency of time stability for swc 2 5 2 temporal stability analysis temporal stability was evaluated using the relative difference rd which was initially introduced by vachaud et al 1985 in this study the rd between individual measurements of swc at location i at time j and the areal mean swc at the same time was calculated as 9 δ ij θ ij θ j θ j the temporal mean relative difference and its standard deviation for each sampling location were computed as 10 δ i 1 m j 1 m δ ij 11 ς δ i 1 m j 1 m δ ij δ i 2 where m is the number of measurement campaigns θij is the swc at location i for time j and θ j is the areal mean swc at time j the mrd value can determine whether a location underestimates or overestimates the field mean swc which has a zero mean rd the smaller sdrd of a location indicates a greater tendency of that location being temporally stable the mrd method can directly predict the mean swc on the condition of both mrd and sdrd values are lower than 5 however usually the mrd and sdrd would not satisfy the criteria simultaneously grayson and western 1998 thus proposed an indirect method that the location with the smallest sdrd value was identified as the most time stable location mtsl the mean swc can be expressed by considering the offset between the swc at the mtsl and the mean value as follows 12 θ θ mstl 1 δ mstl to predict field scale swc of different land uses based on the swc data at the intermediate scale crns the temporal stability analysis needed to be further extended in this study the swc derived from the crns and different land uses were rearranged into a new dataset therefore the mean swc of the new dataset can be predicted by the swc derived from the crns and different land uses the mean swc of the new dataset can also be defined in terms of the swc from the crns and different land uses by considering their corresponding offset because each time series of swc data was temporally stable to some extent 13 θ n θ crns 1 δ crns 14 θ n θ lu 1 δ lu where θ n is the mean swc of the new dataset θ crns and δ crns are swc measured by the crns and its associated mrd respectively and θ lu and δ lu are swc of one land use and its associated mrd respectively according to eqs 13 and 14 the swc of one land use could be expressed as 15 θ lu θ crns 1 δ lu 1 δ crns in this study the 197 days of soil moisture data derived from the em 50 instruments was divided into two subdatasets one subdataset includes the first 100 days of soil moisture data which was used to identify the mrd and the associated sdrd the other subdataset includes the rest 97 days of soil moisture data for validating the prediction accuracy the root mean square error rmse was selected to evaluate the strength of the statistical relationships between the measured and predicted swc as follows 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n sw c p s w c m 2 where n is the number of predicted swc values swcm and swcp are the measured and predicted values of swc respectively 2 6 statistical analysis exploratory analysis was conducted by microsoft office excel 2016 microsoft corporation inc redmond usa spearman s rank correlation analysis and duncan s multiple range test was performed to identify the relationships and the statistically significant differences p 0 05 among the mean swcs derived from the crns and different land uses respectively linear fitting analysis was carried out between the measured and predicted mean swcs with the coefficient of determination r 2 as a measure of the goodness of fit the statistical analyses of the swc data were performed with spss 22 0 software spss inc chicago usa 3 results 3 1 footprint radius and measuring depth it is important to determine the value of n0 in advance for soil moisture conversion the n0 was calibrated by eighteen manual sampling campaigns in this study the n0 ranged from 362 87 to 376 61 count h 1 with the mean value of 370 92 count h 1 table 2 fig 2 presented the evolution of the horizontal footprint radius measuring depth and their associated influencing factors over the entire sampling period the mean values of air pressure air temperature and swc were 975 62 hpa 26 27 and 0 41 cm3 cm 3 respectively tables 2 and 3 the footprint radius and measuring depth showed fluctuations that were inverse to air pressure and swc respectively the footprint radius averaged 311 51 m ranging from 307 69 to 315 01 m and the measuring depth averaged 11 98 cm ranging from 10 25 to 15 70 cm table 2 3 2 comparison of swcs derived from the crns oven drying method and em 50 instruments fig 3 shows the temporal changes of intermediate scale swc measured by the crns and manual sampling campaigns field scale swc of five land uses measured by the em 50 instruments and the corresponding precipitation the manual sampling campaigns were conducted at eighteen dates during the sampling period the swcs derived from the oven drying method were closest to the swcs measured by the crns fig 3 the crns measured swc was significantly correlated p 0 001 with the swc measured by oven drying with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 89 fig 4 the swcs derived from the crns and em 50 instruments fluctuated with precipitation during the growing season the variation of swc was sensitive to precipitation for example several swc peaks could be observed after high rainfall fig 4 the swc measured by the crns ranged from 0 29 to 0 48 cm3 cm 3 with a mean value of 0 41 cm3 cm 3 the mean swc of 0 20 cm soil depth for abandoned land forest land brushland farmland and grassland were 0 44 0 51 0 44 0 44 and 0 53 cm3 cm 3 respectively table 3 the mean swc of grassland was the highest followed by the forest land the mean swc for abandoned land brushland and farmland were the same however the mean swc of different land uses were significantly p 0 05 higher than that of crns the standard deviation of swc ranged from 0 03 to 0 06 cm3 cm 3 for the crns and different land uses and the cv ranged from 7 52 to 11 55 table 3 though the swc measured by the crns was significantly lower than the swc derived from the em 50 instruments in the different land uses the temporal swc patterns at an intermediate scale were similar to those at a field scale table 4 displayed the rs values between swcs at intermediate and field scales all the rs values were significant p 0 01 the rs values ranged from 0 411 between forest and grassland swc to 0 896 between abandoned land and brushland swc table 4 the significant correlation of overall temporal swc patterns suggest that temporal stability analysis may be a way to link soil moisture prediction at different scales 3 3 prediction of surface swc for different land uses the measuring depth of the crns ranged from 10 25 to 15 70 cm in this study therefore we chose soil moisture data from 0 to 20 cm soil depth at the field scale for further analysis the mrd ranged from 25 18 to 16 57 and the sdrd ranged from 3 48 to 7 74 for the crns and different land uses for 0 10 cm depth table 5 similarly the mrd and the corresponding sdrd ranged from 15 11 to 11 83 and from 3 95 to 6 25 for 10 20 cm depth respectively table 5 when sdrd is lower than 10 this suggests relatively accurate prediction figs 5 and 6 displayed the regression curve between swc predicted by the crns and the measured swc of different land uses for 0 10 and 10 20 cm depth respectively the rmse were used to evaluate the performance of the extended temporal stability method all the measured swcs at different land uses can be predicted accurately by the swc derived from the crns the values of rmse were 0 04 0 03 0 04 0 06 and 0 06 cm3 cm 3 for farmland abandoned land brushland forest land and grassland respectively fig 5 for 0 10 cm depth the values of rmse changed relatively little ranging from 0 04 to 0 06 cm3 cm 3 for 10 20 cm depth the values of rmse of all land were 0 04 and 0 05 cm3 cm 3 for 0 10 and 10 20 cm depths respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the performance of the crns for measuring intermediate scale swc in karst area the footprint radius showed little change ranging from 307 69 to 315 01 m this result can be attributed to the low coefficient of variation of air pressure table 2 the mean radius was 311 51 m in this study which was slightly higher than the radius at sea level 300 m however the radius was identified to be 580 m in an alpine meadow observed by zhu et al 2016 due to the high altitude desilets and zreda 2013 the horizontal footprint mainly relies on atmospheric density and humidity the footprint radius increases with decreasing air density and thus also with elevation zreda et al 2012 the effective depth of measurement depends strongly on soil water status the mean measuring depth was 11 98 cm which was relatively smaller compared to other studies schreiner mcgraw et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 due to the high swc table 3 the crns here was assessed to retrieve soil moisture dynamics within a heterogeneous karst watershed however use of crns is mainly recommended in relatively flat areas han et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 2017 peterson et al 2016 in this study the eighteen weighted means derived from the oven drying method agreed well with the swc measured by the crns figs 3 and 4 the results indicated that accurate measurements of swc at an intermediate scale can be obtained using crns in a non invasive way in karst areas where the watershed consists of peak cluster depression landforms 4 2 field scale surface swc prediction using extended temporal stability analysis the intermediate scale swc measured by the crns was significantly lower than the field scale swc in different land uses the overall temporal pattern of swc measured by the crns correlated significantly with the swc derived from the em 50 instruments table 4 significant correlations between swcs in spatial or temporal series have been previously reported biswas and si 2011a b li et al 2015 2017 for example biswas and si 2011a found that the rs values between any two depths for any date were statistically significant p 0 001 in a hummocky landscape li et al 2017 observed that the rs values ranged from 0 929 to 0 980 for farmland and from 0 540 to 0 952 for grassland in a karst depression this result provides a solid foundation for predicting field scale soil moisture from intermediate scale measurements according to nielsen and bouma 1985 swc spatial distribution shows weak variability if the cv is 10 moderate variability if the cv is between 10 and 100 and strong variability if the cv is larger than 100 in this study the temporal swcs derived from the crns and em 50 instruments demonstrated weak variability around 10 which is lower than the spatial swcs cv reported in other studies gao and shao 2012a xu et al 2017 this indicates that the swc showed a temporal stability the range of mrd were smaller compared with previous studies jia et al 2013 gao and shao 2012a b liu et al 2014 for instance jia et al 2013 found that over various soil depths the range of mrd in soil water storage ranged from 85 8 and 86 3 to 178 9 and 143 9 for two hillslopes respectively this is because the evolution of swc in spatial series is controlled mainly by static factors such as soil texture and topography mohanty and skaggs 2001 starks et al 2006 cosh et al 2008 while the change of swc in the temporal dimension is mainly determined by the dynamic factors such as precipitation li et al 2017 in this study we made an attempt to predict swc at the field scale using the swc measurements at an intermediate scale figs 5 and 6 showed that all of the swcs of each land use were accurately predicted by the swc data based on the crns p 0 001 the forest land brushland and grassland are located on the hillslope and the abandoned land and farmland are located in the depression the prediction accuracy was comparable on the hillslope in comparison to the depression there were no obvious influence of soil depth and spatial location on the prediction accuracy there were significant p 0 01 differences in swcs measured by the crns and the em 50 instruments but the sdrd values for swc were small around 5 these results indicated that the temporal stability of swc may be more important than the soil moisture status during swc prediction this study supports the hypothesis that intermediate scale swc can be successfully linked with field scale swc in different land uses using the temporal stability method in a karst landscape 5 conclusions above ground cosmic ray neutron measurements can infer swc at the intermediate scale in this study we first evaluated the application of crns in a karst watershed with high heterogeneity we tried to predict swcs at field scale based on the swc measurements from crns combined with the extended temporal stability analysis we found that the mean footprint radius and effective depth of the crns were 311 51 m and 11 98 cm respectively the crns can accurately estimate swc at an intermediate scale p 0 001 with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 89 the overall temporal swc pattern measured by the crns correlated significantly with the swc derived from the em 50 instruments providing a scientific basis for trans scale soil moisture prediction though the swc derived from the crns was significantly lower than that from em 50 instruments in different land uses the swcs at the field scale can be accurately predicted the prediction accuracy of swc was irrelevant to landform and land use type it can be concluded that the crns is a robust method for measuring swc at an intermediate scale the results also provide a promising feasibility of the crns in predicting field scale swc

3781,here we review methods used for probabilistic analysis of extreme events in hydroclimatology we focus on streamflow precipitation and temperature extremes at regional and global scales the review has four thematic sections 1 probability distributions used to describe hydroclimatic extremes 2 comparative studies of parameter estimation methods 3 non stationarity approaches and 4 model selection tools synthesis of the literature shows that 1 recent studies in general agree that precipitation and streamflow extremes should be described by heavy tailed distributions 2 the method of moments mom is typically the first choice in estimating distribution parameters but it is outperformed by methods such as l moments lm maximum likelihood ml least squares ls and bayesian markov chain monte carlo bmcmc 3 there are less popular parameter estimation techniques such as the maximum product of spacings mps the elemental percentile ep and the minimum density power divergence estimator mdpde that have shown competitive performance in fitting extreme value distributions and 4 non stationary analyses of extreme events are gaining popularity the ml is the typically used method yet literature suggests that the generalized maximum likelihood gml and the weighted least squares wls may be better alternatives the review offers a synthesis of past and contemporary methods used in the analysis of hydroclimatic extremes aiming to highlight their strengths and weaknesses finally the comparative studies summary helps the reader identify the most suitable modeling framework for their analyses based on the extreme hydroclimatic variables sample sizes locations and evaluation metrics reviewed keywords extremes streamflow precipitation temperature non stationarity probabilistic parameter estimation 1 introduction hydroclimatology studies the influence of climate upon the waters of the land langbein and fairbridge 1967 it also encompasses hydrometeorology and the study of surface or near surface water relations mather 1991 wendland 1998 extreme hydroclimatic events such as temperature rainfall and streamflow extremes pose threats locally regionally and globally stress from extremely warm temperatures is linked to excess human mortality drought forest fires tornadoes and decreased agricultural and livestock productivity smoyer tomic et al 2003 it is estimated that since the beginning of the century over 5 million extreme temperature related deaths occur per year zhao et al 2021 extreme temperatures affect the hydrological cycle markonis et al 2019 vargas godoy et al 2021 leading to more intense precipitation occurrences or causing earlier runoff in snowmelt dominated and transitional watersheds leading to more frequent extreme flood events clifton et al 2018 extreme precipitation is the driving force behind adverse phenomena with implications on both human and natural systems the most important impact of extreme precipitation is heavy flooding the amplification of precipitation e g papalexiou and montanari 2019 can alter the magnitude and frequency of flooding strain aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems economies and human societies tabari 2020 doocy et al 2013 reported over half a million fatalities and about 350 thousand injuries due to rain induced floods during the period 1980 2009 while the number of people affected by floods was almost 3 billion globally gumbel 1941 was among the first to recognize the need to better characterize and model hydroclimatic extremes and estimated flood return periods based on the extreme value theory evt fisher and tippett 1928 fréchet 1927 since then hydrologists climatologists and statisticians further advanced modeling of extremes and developed new approaches e g katz et al 2002 this review outlines the probabilistic methods used to analyze extreme events in ηydroclimatology the literature shows that certain approaches probability distributions and parameter estimation methods have been preferred over others we focus on distributions used to analyze extreme streamflow precipitation and temperature we review comparative studies on parameter estimation methods that have been used in analyses of extremes and summarize their results methods used in non stationary analyses are briefly reported finally we review tools used to select distributions for extreme observations and asses their fit the review concludes by attempting a synthesis of the results 2 the cornerstones block maxima bm and peaks over threshold pot in probabilistic methods the frequency and magnitude of extreme events of river discharge precipitation and temperature are described by the upper part of the distribution which is typically called the tail probability distributions can be generally categorized into heavy and light tailed based on their tail behavior the former predict extreme events of higher intensity and frequency e g papalexiou et al 2013 the main probabilistic methods are based on the extreme value theory evt which focuses on analyzing block maxima bm or annual maxima and peaks over threshold pot or partial duration series the former involves dividing the time series into subsets usually into years and considering the maximum value of each subset block maxima based on the fisher tippett gnedenko theorem fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 the maximum of a properly normalized sample converges to one of the following extreme value distributions type i extreme value distribution or the gumbel distribution g u gumbel 1941 1935 with distribution function df 1 f g u x exp exp x α β x ℝ where α r and β 0 are location and scale parameters type ii extreme value distribution or the fréchet f r fréchet 1927 with df 2 f f r x exp x α β 1 γ x α where β 0 and γ 0 are scale and shape parameters type iii extreme value distribution or reverse weibull r w with 3 f r w x exp x α β 1 γ x α where β 0 and γ 0 are scale and shape parameters the three limiting laws were unified by jenkinson 1955 into a single expression known as the generalized extreme value g e v distribution with df 4 f g e v x exp 1 γ x α β 1 γ 1 γ x α β 0 a n d γ 0 where α r β 0 and γ r are location scale and shape parameters respectively for γ 0 the g e v becomes the g u distribution for γ 0 represents the f r distribution with x α β γ and for γ 0 is the r w distribution with x α β γ the shape parameter γ is also known as the extreme value index evi the extreme value distributions are limiting laws emerging under specific assumptions i e the random variables must be independent and identically distributed iid and the sample size must tend to infinity since the length of observed samples is usually small the convergence to one of these asymptotic distributions is not guaranteed e g papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 the convergence rate of the extreme value distribution to each of the three limiting laws depends on the tail type of the parent distribution parent distributions that resemble the extreme value distribution converge the fastest e g makkonen 2008 for example an exponential e parent distribution converges to the g u distribution fast and therefore the assumption of infinite samples can be relaxed or neglected in other cases where the parent does not match the tail type of the extreme value distribution the convergence may be slow and a small sample size may be responsible for the poor success of methods applied to hydroclimatic extremes shortcomings in the bm method include loss of information as only the maximum of each year is considered and small sample sizes also estimation of the g e v parameters often leads to upper bounded distributions γ 0 r w however this interpretation is not justified as distributions bounded from above contradict the nature of hydrological variables and can lead to risk underestimation e g zaghloul et al 2020 moccia et al 2021 for example an upper bounded distribution assumes a maximum precipitation value which cannot be exceeded while even probable maximum precipitation estimates have been surpassed salas et al 2020 therefore the r w distribution should be used with extreme caution when analyzing extreme hydroclimatic variables cook and harris 2004 harris 2004 recently to tackle some of these challenges different approaches have been applied for example marani and ignaccolo 2015 used a non asymptotic approach called the metastatistical extreme value m e v based on superstatistics beck and cohen 2003 another term of the same framework is compound distributions dubey 1970 m e v utilizes the distribution of the statistical parameters describing ordinary daily rainfall occurrence i e the number of times a process is observed each year and intensity since a larger amount of information is used ordinary events vs extremes this approach might be more accurate for rare return levels marra et al 2018 m e v was applied to extreme rainfall in italy outperforming g e v in terms of mean and root mean square error marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 found that m e v reduces the uncertainty in high quantile extremes estimation by up to 50 compared to classical evt marra et al 2019 simplified the method s formulation simplified m e v or s m e v and applied it to daily precipitation data from eastern mediterranean stations the pot approach focuses on observations exceeding a certain threshold x p base or truncation level based on the balkema and de haan 1974 and pickands 1975 theorem the peaks over a high threshold x p of a time series converge asymptotically to the generalized pareto g p distribution as the threshold increases the df of the g p is 5 f g p x 1 1 γ x α β 1 γ for γ 0 1 exp x α β f o r γ 0 where γ x α when γ 0 and α x α β γ when γ 0 the parameter α corresponds to the threshold x p therefore if the threshold is predefined then the g p has only two parameters shape and scale this parametrization is a convention followed in several studies deidda 2010 2007 deidda and puliga 2009 2006 langousis et al 2016 mascaro 2018 the same convention may hold for the three parameter gamma g weibull w or lognormal l n distributions for γ 0 the g p has the type i tail and corresponds to e with mean β for γ 0 the type ii tail or the pareto distribution emerges for the special case of γ 1 the distribution is the uniform u α β finally for γ 0 we have a type iii tail which is upper bounded note also that only the shape parameter is common between eqs 4 and 5 in practice selecting a proper threshold x p is challenging it must be high enough to assure convergence to the g p but not too high to allow enough values in the pot sample for reliable estimations most authors have used conventional estimation methods for threshold selection considering a given sample thus disregarding the possibility that the sample changes with the threshold alternatively choulakian and stephens 2001 used tests based on the iterative application of the cramér von mises statistics for the g p following davison and smith 1990 initially a high number of exceedances is selected and the test is implemented upon failure of the test the smallest values are omitted one by one and the test is re implemented until acceptance of the g p this method was implemented by deidda and puliga 2006 but failed due to the presence of many rounding off values among sample data affecting the goodness of fit statistics therefore a monte carlo based approach was adopted to account for these discrete recordings the discretization of records is a typical problem in rainfall records see e g deidda 2007 affecting the performance of parameter estimators for the g p deidda 2010 deidda and puliga 2009 2006 langousis et al 2016 deidda 2010 re parametrized the g p to have three threshold invariant parameters he then introduced and tested the novel multiple threshold method mtm which deals with the uncertainties related to the assessment of a reasonable threshold the mtm was superior against the standard single threshold fit langousis et al 2016 revised representative methods for the g p threshold selection they found that the graphical methods and the goodness of fit metrics that rely on asymptotic properties of the g p distribution have the best performance apart from threshold selection methods another difficulty of the pot approach is the assumption of data series independence bezak et al 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 performed a detailed analysis on the effects of threshold selection in the shape parameter of the g p and later serinaldi and kilsby 2018 investigated pot hydrological extremes in the presence of spatial and temporal dependence using the pot or bm analysis several studies choose to fit different tail types instead of using the g p or g e v distributions usually numerous distributions are tested with pot or bm data and the most suitable one is selected based on goodness of fit criteria see also stedinger et al 1993 and grimaldi et al 2011 this approach is flexible since it does not assume convergence to the g p or g e v another option is the selection of a probability distribution which adequately describes both the extremes and the non zero values of the sample e g papalexiou et al 2018 after defining the evaluation approach for the maxima and selecting the statistical df the distribution parameters of the chosen df need to be estimated emphasis is given on the shape parameter or the evi which defines the heaviness of the right tail of the distribution a positive evi implies a heavy tail and a negative evi a light one see equations 4 5 this is the most commonly used convention in several papers however an opposite sign convention is assumed i e heavy tailed distributions are characterized by a negative shape parameter as in the works of hosking et al 1985 hosking and wallis 1997 hosking and wallis 1987 moharram et al 1993 madsen et al 1997 rasmussen 2001 ashoori et al 2017 de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 martins and stedinger 2001 2000 morrison and smith 2002 durocher et al 2019 and xu 2019 cited here 3 real world studies and most popular distributions 3 1 streamflow in the early 80s shen et al 1980 performed a country scale study to identify the extreme river flow distribution they used the maximum likelihood ml estimator and fitted the g u and the log pearson type iii l p i i i distributions on extreme hydrological data from 231 stations in the usa they compared the range of parameter values the range of the 1000 year flood and the range of 1000 to 10 year flood ratio suggesting that g u can underestimate extremes while the f r fits better during the 90s many more df s were tested on extreme flows for example the g e v in eastern us territory australian central victoria canadian new brunswick canadian new scotland and usa gingras and adamowski 1992 hosking and wallis 1997 pilon and adamowski 2011 vogel and wilson 1996 the g p in israel ben zvi and azmon 1997 and the l p i i i in australia along with the g e v g p and the three parameter lognormal l n 3 and the usa along with the two parametric lognormal l n 2 and g e v vogel et al 1993 the g e v and the l n 3 distributions were the most suitable for floods with return periods over 100 years in 13 streams in germany and scotland when compared to the l n 2 g u pearson type iii p i i i l p i i i log logistic l l and wakeby w a k distributions haktanir and horlacher 1993 the results were assessed by the chi squared test χ 2 pearson 1900 kolmogorov smirnov ks smirnov 1939 cramer von mises cvm criterion cramér 1928 and relative error re madsen et al 1997 compared the pot and the bm methods and used monte carlo simulations to assess flood data from 48 catchments in new zealand the g p was more efficient lowest standardized root mean square error rmse for the t year event in regions with a positive evi i e heavy tails whereas the g e v was better suited for regions with a negative evi later morrison and smith 2002 used the ml and l moments lm to estimate the location shape and scale parameters of the g e v distribution they extended the combined parameter estimation method for the two largest flood peaks in a year under the pot framework and applied their methods to 104 central appalachian basins the shape parameter values were larger than previously considered e g martins and stedinger 2000 indicating very heavy tails katz et al 2002 fitted the g e v distribution to annual peak flows of a time series longer than 100 years 1895 2000 at the potomac river usa using the ml they obtained a 0 191 evi which was supported by the comparison between the observed and theoretical distributions in a quantile quantile q q plot ashkar and mahdi 2003 focused on the performance of the l l distribution compared to the l n the two parameter w and the g u in estimating extreme flow data from 114 hydrometric stations in ontario canada the distribution parameters were estimated with the ml under the bm approach the l l generally performed better compared to the other three distributions as indicated by the anderson darling ad statistic chandra et al 1981 d agostino and stephens 1986 moisello 2007 estimated the peak discharge of 297 experimental samples from one african and four european countries under the bm framework tested the applicability of five different distributions e p g u g e v and g p using l diagrams and found that g e v is the most suitable calenda et al 2009 used bm and the ml to analyze the long flood time series of the river tiber in rome the g u typically used to describe the modern flood series of tiber was rejected for the complete sample extending back to 1872 in the 2010s haddad and rahman 2011 used the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 the akaike information criterion second order variant aicc and the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 for two parameter distributions and the ad statistic for three parameter distributions to select the most appropriate for extreme flows in 44 tasmanian sites the l n distribution offered the best fit compared to the normal n g u f r g e v p i i i and l p i i i gubareva 2011 examined thousands of stations from 5 countries with different climate conditions and used lm for annual maxima flows based on the χ 2 test and the w criterion vinogradov 1988 they demonstrated that g e v dominates over l n pearson type v p v and g p distributions in rivers of austria siberia and the far east the g p however was the most suitable for hawaiian islands extremes strupczewski et al 2011 used l moment ratio diagrams linearity test on log log plots and a two step model selection procedure el adlouni et al 2008 to conclude that annual peak flows in most of the 39 studied polish stations are better modeled using light tailed distributions like the three parameter inverse gaussian however nine stations were characterized by heavy tails rutkowska et al 2017 used lm to assess floods in poland including most of the regions examined in strupczewski et al 2011 based on lm ratio diagrams they showed that the homogenous clusters defined by 52 catchments are well described by the g p the generalized logistic g l o and the p i i i with the latter two fitting better to stations with higher and lower latitudes respectively murshed et al 2011 used the ks and ad tests with lm to examine the application of the g e v g u and beta κ b κ distributions on the annual maxima flow amounts of colorado streamflow data the g e v and b κ were better fitted than g u the authors claimed that using lm with the b κ distribution for small samples describes accurately heavy tails a disadvantage of the b κ distribution is the lack of a location parameter bowers et al 2012 analyzed daily discharge in nine usa rivers focusing on dry wet and transitional seasons the ks test showed that dry seasons can be described by l n and power law distributions while in wet seasons the l n distribution performed better only the salt river in arizona was better described by a power law with evi equal to 2 37 and 1 97 for the wet and dry season respectively similar results were found by anderson and meerschaert 1998 kochanek et al 2014 used the g e v for annual maxima flows in over 1000 stations in france and suggested that fitting should be based on local regional estimates rather than local ones they also indicated that the g u underestimates the extremes of mediterranean catchments salinas et al 2014 noted that a single statistical model i e the g e v cannot encompass the variation of flood processes at a pan european scale and each catchment should be investigated individually vivekanandan 2015 showed that the g u was more effectively fitted on floods in two gauging stations in india as indicated by the χ 2 and ks tests compared to the e f r g e v g p and n another study in india assessing floods in a monsoon dominated river showed that the l p i i i is better fitted than g u r w l n and l p i i i based on the ad ks and χ 2 tests bandyopadhyay et al 2016 ashkar and el adlouni 2015 analyzed four hydrometric stations 101 datasets in ontario canada and through ad tests assessed that 81 2 of them can be adequately fitted by a g p distribution more recently domma and condino 2017 proposed using two four parameter distributions for extreme hydrologic data analysis the beta dagum b d and the beta singh maddala b s m which are generalizations of a re parametrization of b κ and beta p b p distributions accordingly they applied them to the flow dataset used in murshed et al 2011 and proposed them as alternatives to classical models the b s m specifically as assessed by ml had the smallest parameter standard errors se and the best performance based on aic and ad ul hassan et al 2019 studied the extreme flow from five stations in sweden and tested the g e v l n 3 g l o p i i i and g u using a combination of goodness of fit tests ad mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape rmse root mean square percentage error rmspe they inferred that almost every station was best fitted by a different distribution smith et al 2018 examined the upper tail ratio i e the peak discharge divided by the 10 year flood magnitude of more than 8000 u s geological survey usgs stations they assumed that the upper tail ratio follows the g e v distribution being dependent on the shape parameter value independent of the basin properties and the sample size only the heavy tailed case could represent the upper tail ratio extremes another big dataset of annual flood peaks 1120 stations in china was analyzed by yang et al 2019 using g e v they inferred that the shape parameter is weakly dependent on the drainage area they also observed heavier tails of flood distributions in northern compared to southern china although the flood magnitudes and variability were smaller in the north finally they found that landfalling tropical cyclones greatly affect the characterization of flow tail properties leading to heavier flood distributions tails brunner et al 2020 assessed flood events in 671 catchments in the united using the pot approach based on simulations from the four parameter kappa k a 4 distribution zaghloul et al 2020 tested the g e v on 1088 streamflow stations across canada they detected that in 39 1 of the stations g e v predicts an upper limit for streamflow maxima which is inconsistent with the nature of streamflow they suggested burr type iii b r i i i and xii b r x i i as consistent alternatives 3 2 rainfall at the beginning of the 21st century katz et al 2002 analyzed the 100 year daily precipitation from a station in fort collins usa they fitted the g e v distribution by ml using both the bm and pot approaches yielding an evi equal to 0 174 and 0 182 respectively an indication of heavy tail both estimators were equivalent but the indication for a heavy tail was stronger with the pot due to higher data availability coles et al 2003 examined daily rainfall in the tropical zone of the north central coast of venezuela 1961 1999 they proposed using the g e v model instead of the g u to include uncertainty in the estimate yue hashino 2007 used the l moment ratio diagrams and the average weighted distance awd kroll and vogel 2002 to estimate the suitable distributions for annual seasonal and monthly precipitation in japan they concluded that the p i i i and l p i i i distributions are appropriate for describing extreme precipitation statistics with the l n 3 being a potential alternative aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 used several parametric and semiparametric evi estimators with g e v to effectively characterize long term daily rainfall tail behavior from 6 locations globally using the rmse and mae indices smith et al 2011 observed that central usa daily rainfall stations exhibit heavy tails with great spatial heterogeneity in the estimated g e v parameters the location and scale parameters are larger in the eastern part while the minimum values are observed west of the appalachian mountains nguyen and nguyen 2016 examined the annual maxima of 21 rainfall stations in ontario canada using a combination of q q plots rmse relative rmse rrmse and correlation coefficient cc they found that the g e v the generalized n and the p i i i were suitable distributions when fitting the g e v on 728 rainfall stations from all over china gu et al 2017 found that most tails are heavy and unbounded more recently mascaro 2020 analyzed a dataset of 240 gauges in central arizona and found that 1 the g e v well characterizes annual rainfall maxima at durations ranging from 30 min to 24 h 2 the shape parameter is positive across durations and has the largest value 0 12 on average for the 6 h duration and 3 the location and scale parameters vary with elevation and exhibit scaling properties across durations similar results were found by blanchet et al 2016 in a region in france in an alternative study mascaro 2018 used the g p distribution to analyze the annual and seasonal distributions of daily rainfall extremes in central arizona the distribution was found to be heavy tailed positive shape parameter during summer due to convective monsoonal thunderstorms and light tailed e during winter due to cold fronts the author proposed a hybrid model combining the two seasonal distributions for the description of the annual distribution and found a correlation of the g p scale parameter with elevation douka and karacostas 2018 used hourly precipitation records from a station in greece and ranked the performance of 61 theoretical distributions based on ks ad and χ 2 they proposed the g p and the johnson sb j s b and the log gamma l g and the l n as the best models for annual and seasonal extreme rainfall events respectively shahraki et al 2019 proposed the gamma generalized pareto approach a combination of the g p and the gamma density estimation method stacy 1962 for modeling extreme daily rainfall from five stations in iran tencaliec et al 2020 also presented a semiparametric distribution for the entire range of rainfall amount based on the extended g p e g p distribution family naveau et al 2016 they applied the distribution to the daily rainfall of 180 french stations it accurately estimated high quantiles and outperformed the classical g p and the parametric e g p in terms of rmse moccia et al 2021 applied the g e v over 13 247 daily gridded rainfall annual maxima samples in italy they found that in 44 9 of the cases g e v predicts an upper rainfall limit and suggested the use of g e v i e the g e v with shape parameters restricted to positive values and non extreme value distributions like the b r x i i instead moustakis et al 2021 investigated hourly precipitation in the united states using 3119 stations and simulations from the wrf climate model they used pot values and fitted the p i i and w tails to assess extremes and future changes extreme precipitation rainfall studies of global extent are common wilson and toumi 2005 used a global dataset and found that extreme daily precipitation can be represented by a stretched e form with a global shape parameter of 2 3 heavy tail papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 fitted the g e v and the g u distributions on 15 137 global records of daily rainfall 40 163 years with lm ratio plots to show that the f r law prevails over the g u they detected a relationship between record length and the g e v shape parameter which implied that only large samples can provide reliable estimates they also proposed an equation for the correction of the lm estimate of the g e v shape parameter which removes the bias due to small sample sizes papalexiou et al 2013 used a similar global dataset of 15 029 daily rainfall stations 50 172 years they tested the tails of pareto type ii p i i l n w and g covering a wide spectrum of tail heaviness from heavy tailed to light tailed they directly fitted the distributions to the empirical tails by numerically minimizing a modified mean square error mse norm 72 6 of the records were better described by sub exponential heavy tails serinaldi and kilsby 2014 used two worldwide data sets and performed a detailed investigation on how the threshold selection and record length affect the right tail behavior of pot observations they focused on the shape parameter of the g p distribution and identified two main effects 1 as the threshold decreases the g p shape parameter variance reduces converging to positive values yet the asymptotic g p hypothesis becomes less realistic tending to be replaced by weibull stretched exponential tails and 2 given a fixed high threshold and increasing record length the variance of the g p shape parameter decreases with its mean value converging to positive values later papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 examined approximately 170 000 global monthly daily precipitation records from more than 14 000 stations they utilized a combination of probability plots and lm and assessed that exponential tail light tailed distributions like the e mixed e or g can underestimate the magnitude of extreme events significantly also g w l n and p cannot universally represent daily precipitation the generalized gamma g g distribution is a suitable model for this purpose followed by b r x i i cavanaugh et al 2015 used a log likelihood ratio based test to find that the extremes of 22 000 global rainfall stations are better represented by a power law distribution rather than an exponential one papalexiou et al 2018 analyzed 4316 stations with more than 3000 nonzero hourly precipitation values after fitting distributions using the probability ratio mse and a novel bayesian adjustment approach they found that the w tail is more robust compared to the power type precipitation in mountainous areas was also fitted by heavier tails and a nonlinear increase of the tail s heaviness with elevation was observed nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 advanced the graphical mean excess function mef method to an algorithmic process applied it to 21 348 global stations with daily rainfall data and concluded that 75 8 of the records had sub exponential tails finally rajulapati et al 2020 assessed the tail heaviness using five global gridded precipitation products they fitted the p i i and w tails and found dissrepancies among the different products strong spatial variability in tail heaviness and singinficant differences in return levels for large return periods between the two tails 3 3 temperature the gaussian n df is frequently used for the analysis of large temperature datasets which are bell shaped most weather generators use the n distribution to simulate daily maximum and minimum temperature values harmel et al 2002 however studies have shown that it underestimates the probabilities of occurrence of extreme events for example harmel et al 2002 used temperature data from 15 sites in the usa and inferred that daily maximum and minimum air temperature are slightly skewed and not normally distributed in each month according to ruff and neelin 2012 the core of the observations from the national climatic data center may conform to the n but almost half of the stations present non gaussian tails of daily average maximum and minimum temperature garcía cueto et al 2014 used the g e v distribution to model the maximum and minimum temperature in four cities in north western mexico under the bm approach with the ml they also included temporal trends as covariates in the location parameter and used the likelihood ratio test to select the most appropriate model the likelihood test gave a negative shape parameter therefore the r w was well fitted on the extreme temperatures of the cities under study selvam 2014 suggested a universal inverse power law distribution for fractal fluctuations of temperature and rainfall for four stations in the uk vivekanandan 2018 compared the applicability of the g u f r l n 2 and l p i i i on the temperature extremes minimum and maximum of a station in india using the method of moments mom ml and the order statistics approach with the weibull plotting position the l p i i i with the ml was best suited for these extremes based on the ad and ks tests xu 2019 used the g e v distribution to model extreme temperature and wind in two locations in norway with the probability weighted moments pwm method the r w was ultimately fitted caissie et al 2020 commented on the advantage of the pot to describe air and water temperatures in magnitude duration and degree day accumulation when they applied it to a canadian case study 4 parameter estimation methods a parameter estimation method can be judged by its consistency bias and efficiency rice 2006 let θ n be an estimate of θ based on a sample of size n θ n is consistent if p θ n θ 0 0 as n thus a consistent estimator converges to the true parameter value as the sample size increases θ n is unbiased if the mean value of the estimation equals the parameter values that is e θ n θ finally an estimator is efficient if it has the lowest variance among all unbiased estimators parameter estimation methods thus can be evaluated in terms of bias variance or mse of the distribution parameters or the quantiles an unbiased quantile estimator though may lead to biased distribution parameter estimates and vice versa for example the quantiles and distribution parameters of l n or w have a nonlinear relationship pajari et al 2021 pajari et al 2021 propose the bin criterion makkonen et al 2013 to assess the quantile estimator s goodness of fit which considers the frequency interpretation of probability in this section we present parameter estimation methods that have been used for hydroclimatic extremes assessments and are included in comparative studies each method is shortly described along with the most important outcomes derived by the comparative studies analytical equations are not given the interested reader can consult the cited references since the focus is on their performance in real world applications the reviewed studies are summarized in table 1 which includes the references the variable s studied the sample length the location of the study area the distribution s tested the parameter estimation methods compared and the evaluation criteria used 4 1 method of moments mom the method of moments mom aims to match sample moments with the corresponding theoretical moments of the fitted distribution christopeit 1994 pearson 1902a b generally if a distribution has n parameters a system of n equations is formed and solved for the unknown parameters this is accomplished by equating the theoretical moments μ q or moment related quantities with the corresponding sample ones i e μ q μ q for q 1 2 n q is the moment order note that the theoretical moments are functions of the distribution s parameters for example we typically fit a two parameter distribution by equating the expressions of the theoretical mean and standard deviation with the corresponding sample ones i e μ μ σ σ a limitation of the method is that higher order moments may diverge in power type distributions depending on the tail heaviness specifically if the asymptotic behavior of the tail is pr x x x 1 γ then only moments for q γ exist the effects of such divergence can produce biased estimates also for moment orders lower but close to critical ones thus the applicability of mom depends on the considered distribution its tail and the order of moments used de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 note that the mom is simple to apply i e compared to the ml and ideal for computing initial estimates for parameter estimation methods such as the ml which is typically implemented numerically in some cases the mom offers comparable results to the ml e g it performed better for l n distributions with low skewness in terms of quantiles estimation rmse mean squared deviation and ratios thereof stedinger 1980 madsen et al 1997 compared mom ml and probability weighted moments pwm under pot and bm and suggested applying the mom with pot for positive evi corresponding to heavy tailed distributions for evis between 0 2 and 0 or evis lower than 0 2 and small samples the bm with mom is preferable they used monte carlo simulations the cunnane plotting position and the rmse ratio of the t year event for evaluation note that madsen et al 1997 use a different evi convention öztekin 2005 compared the performance of mom pwm ml the principle of maximum entropy pome and least squares ls with the g p distribution for the annual flood peaks of 50 rivers located in turkey scotland usa and canada they computed the average deviation the mean residual error mre the average relative percent error arpe and the coefficient of efficiency ce for quantiles using the cunnane plotting position the mom tended to provide high estimate values for the location parameter nevertheless it was superior followed by the ml holešovský et al 2016 recommended the mom with bootstrapping and found that it provides narrower confidence intervals compared to the ml and pwm approaches they used the χ 2 ks and ad test for evaluation along with visual inspection with histograms and q q plots murshed et al 2011 found that ml and lm were less sensitive and more precise than mom in fitting the b κ distribution when the parent df was unknown they tested the failure percentage of monte carlo simulations the relative bias rbias and rmse were used to test the discrepancy between empirical and modeled quantiles and the average scaled absolute error asae to evaluate the goodness of fit of the distribution lombardo et al 2014 suggest practitioners use higher order q 2 moments with caution when fitting distributions in geophysical time series rowinski et al 2002 noted that mom cannot be used for the l l and log gumbel l g u parameter estimation when they are applied to extreme hydrological data since the statistical moments exist for a very limited range of parameters finally vivekanandan 2017 found that mom was less accurate compared to ml when tested against rainfall data in india based on the ad and ks tests and using the weibull plotting position 4 2 probability weighted moments pwm and l moments lm the probability weighted moments pwm greenwood et al 1979 hosking et al 1985 sillitto 1951 are plotting position functions of observed data katz et al 2002 the method extracts information on both the magnitude and order of the sample values jing and rongfu 1988 the pwm are quite straightforward to compute and perform well for many distributions used in hydroclimatology in general pwm need analytical inverse df s to provide analytical solutions based on simulations the standard deviations of the pwm parameter estimators are comparable with those of ml for moderate g e v sample sizes n 50 100 and often significantly lower for small samples hosking et al 1985 they can perform very well for the g e v even if the sample size is not large and 0 e v i 0 5 castillo and hadi 1994 pwm for the g e v have no severe bias parameter or quantile and they compare favorably with ml hosking et al 1985 in general pwm exist for power type distributions with evi less than 1 for g p for example this method allows for the estimation of a wider range of tails compared to mom de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 although they are asymptotically inefficient compared to ml estimators for the g p they perform equally well for sizes of 100 or less furrer and naveau 2007 derived some properties of pwm for small g p samples pwm and mom have lower parameter and quantile bias and variance than the classical ml for small g p samples less than 500 hosking and wallis 1987 however the pwm and mom sometimes result in non feasible estimates dupuis 1996 for g u generated samples with sizes larger than 20 the pwm performed better in terms of bias for the location and scale parameters and the quantiles and efficiency compared to the biased and unbiased mom ml ls mode and interquartile range method mir and best linear combination of order statistics blocs raynal and salas 1986 the authors used the weibull plotting position and tested the mean bias mse variance and efficiency of the parameters and quantile estimators moharram et al 1993 compared the ml mom pwm and ls the latter appropriately adapted for the g p using monte carlo simulations and flood series of two rivers in the uk they used the cunnane plotting position and the rmse and bias for the evi and the quantiles for moderate and large sample sizes n 50 and positive negative according to the convention of moharram et al 1993 shape parameters the pwm was the superior method vivekanandan 2013 applied mom ml ls order statistics osa pome and pwm to two rainfall stations in india they used the se ks and rmse as evaluation criteria with the gringorten plotting position all methods were appropriate for fitting bm rainfall data with the pwm and ls performing slightly better curceac et al 2020 compared the performance of eight different g p parameter estimators with monte carlo analysis to model flood time series in the uk the ml the unbiased pwm the biased pwm the mom the penalized maximum likelihood estimator pml the hybrid likelihood moment estimator hlme zhang 2007 the pickands estimator and the maximum goodness of fit estimator mgf luceño 2006 they combined q q plots mse normalized rmse nrmse and the relative index of agreement willmott 1981 the unbiased pwm and biased pwm were the most unbiased and accurate in terms of parameter estimation being the least sensitive to sample size coles and dixon 1999 proposed a penalized maximum likelihood pml approach with e v i 1 which outperformed the pwm in terms of bias and mse for parameter and quantile estimations coles and dixon 1999 diebolt et al 2008 stressed that the method presents limitations for strongly heavy tailed distributions noting that the asymptotic properties of pwm cannot be derived for g e v shape parameter values higher than 0 5 the pwm may also have inflated sampling errors in samples with outliers for which case jing and rongfu 1988 have provided formulas engeland et al 2004 used the pwm and ml pml under the bm and the pot approaches on daily streamflow observations they noted that the pwm cannot incorporate non stationarities and therefore the ml and pml estimators can be more flexible the pwm along with mom and ml estimators had robust results for large threshold ranks but demonstrated inconsistency for small ranks aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 for short tailed distributions negative shape parameter the hybrid mom pwm method is recommended dupuis and tsao 1998 l moments lm are another popular method in hydroclimatology they have similar properties as pwm since they are defined as linear combinations of them hosking 1990 similar to pwm lm exist for heavy tailed distributions common in hydroclimatology and show low estimation bias for example lm present lower estimation bias and are less susceptible to sampling variability or outliers in extreme data compared to mom hosking 1990 the lm are more easily related to the distribution s shape and spread than pwm however the two methods lead to identical parameter estimates rasmussen 2001 hosking 1990 noted the benefits of standardized lm or l moment ratios over mom ratios in that the former are more robust in the presence of extreme values and do not have sample size related bounds l moment ratio diagrams have been suggested as a useful tool for discriminating between candidate distributions hosking 1990 hosking and wallis 1997 peel et al 2001 in the l moment ratio diagrams the sample l moment ratios are plotted as a scatterplot and compared with theoretical l moment ratio curves of candidate distributions the l skewness and l kurtosis are usually used to verify the type of the distribution law gubareva and gartsman 2010 hosking 1990 similar to pwm lm exist for power type distributions with evi less than 1 a generalization of the lm i e the lh moments wang 1997 can be used for estimating gp heavy tailed distributions de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 gubareva and gartsman 2010 provided algorithms for determining parameters by lm for some df s used in hydrology they also compared the lm with ml and the mom on three distributions widely used in hydrology the p i i i the g e v and the l n 3 the lm and the ml were superior with small parameter bias lm performed better than mom and ml in the study of bezak et al 2014 for the estimation of extreme floods in slovenia table 1 in particular the combination of lm with l p i i i provided the best estimation compared to the rest approaches and distributions based on several criteria focusing on the extreme quantiles vivekanandan 2015 analyzed flood discharges at two rivers in india and used mom and lm to determine the parameters of six probability distributions the g u estimated by lm was better suited for the studied locations based on various goodness of fit tests table 1 ul hassan et al 2019 studied the extreme flow of 5 stations in sweden and ranked each combination of distribution parameter estimation methods based on goodness of fit tests and accuracy measures table 1 for most sites the best fitted distributions were conducted with lm hu et al 2020 analyzed the flows in six hydrological regions in the united states using bm g e v l p i i i and pot g p and found that lm provides less uncertainty in flood frequency estimates than ml rowinski et al 2002 however claimed that lm are not sufficient in estimating the location scale and shape parameters of the l l and l g u distribution tails this limitation is because the estimates of the parameters from lm do not asymptotically converge to the statistical moments of l l and l g u samples as in the case of mom murshed et al 2011 used the mom the lm and the ml to estimate the parameters of the extreme flow and wave data in colorado the lm presented limitations for heavy tailed cases but the combination of lm with b κ distribution for small samples was precise in characterizing heavy tails bernardara et al 2008 used the pot approach with the hill and generalized hill estimators semiparametric and the ml and lm parametric all the estimators were consistent but for very high evi values lm systematically underestimated the shape parameter 4 3 generalized probability weighted moments gpwm rasmussen 2001 introduced the generalized probability weighted moments gpwm for the g p an extension of the pwm which does not impose integer and nonnegative restrictions on the exponents gpwm presented lower bias for all parameters for positive evis and small samples at the expense of computational simplicity compared to pwm and lm the mse in gwpm was reduced by 20 40 in most cases of practical interest i e for return periods of 50 and 100 years but not higher gpwm outperformed the mom in terms of mse ratio ashkar and mahdi 2003 examined the application of the gpwm and ml for the l l simulations showed that the gpwm had better performance lower rmse for parameter estimates only for very small sample sizes when estimating quantiles in asymmetrical distributions with this limitation and considering the restrictive conditions under which the gpwm performs better ashkar and mahdi 2003 recommended the use of the ml for the estimation of extreme quantiles of the l l 4 4 partial probability weighted moments ppwm wang 1990 introduced the partial probability weighted moments ppwm for the g e v parameter and quantile estimation ppwm censor some of the smaller observations in the left tail to estimate the upper quantiles of variables right tail the method tackles the undesirable effects of low outliers which frequently arise in semiarid and arid regions the author suggested using moderately high lower bound censoring thresholds for high quantile estimation moisello 2007 used ppwm and pwm to model peak discharge from 297 stations from one african and four european countries with bm they used the sample mean as a censoring threshold the ppwm quantile estimators had a smaller re for sample sizes larger than 50 for local analyses and performed equally well on a regional level monte carlo simulations showed that the re of the ppwm is higher than the classic pwm when estimating extreme quantiles with the g e v distribution with l n as the parent finally attention should be paid to the presence of outliers when applying the ppwm 4 5 generalized method of moments gmom in the generalized method of moments gmom hansen 1982 sargan 1959 1958 the number of moment conditions exceeds the number of the parameters under estimation an objective function is defined and minimized to estimate the parameters essentially it is the mom under a wider framework de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 the use of the gmom for estimating the evi of the g p is suggested for the range 0 e v i 0 4 de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 for heavy tailed light tailed distributions the gmom can weigh the large small observations more heavily for small g p samples it may be used as an alternative to the pwm for a restricted range of the shape parameter de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 the method has been tested for various distributions g g l p i i i g p by monte carlo simulations or real world flood data ashkar et al 1988 ashkar and bobée 1987 ashkar and ouarda 1996 bobee and ashkar 1988 ashkar and ouarda 1996 examined six versions of the gmom for fitting a modified version of the g p they found that the choice of the order of any two moments of g p to fit the distribution can lead to a reduction in the variance in comparison with the estimation by the mom which typically uses moments of order one and two 4 6 maximum likelihood estimation ml the maximum likelihood estimator fisher 1922 involves defining and maximizing a likelihood function so that the observed data are most probable under the assumed statistical model the estimates are the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function ml at least theoretically is the most prominent parametric estimation method due to its good theoretical properties unbiased consistent normally distributed and efficient for large samples ml can be safer to use in heavy tailed cases positive evi de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 although it was effective for light tailed samples b κ presenting low quantile and estimate errors murshed et al 2011 however ml estimators require numerical algorithms and can face convergence issues irrespectively of the sample size some studies argue that this is solely due to an incorrect choice of algorithms ashkar and nwentsa tatsambon 2007 de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 the hybrid likelihood moment estimator overcomes the limitations of the ml while keeping the desired properties zhang 2007 stedinger 1980 showed that the ml is better than mom for fitting l n 2 for samples larger than 25 in terms of quantile accuracy juárez and schucany 2004 found that ml is a desirable estimation procedure for g p due to its easy generalization to more complicated data structures convenient large sample properties and capability to incorporate trends covariates and multivariate extremes they tested the mse for the shape parameter and the frequency of convergence failure curceac et al 2020 demonstrated that ml was among the most unbiased and accurate estimators for flood samples in the uk although being negatively biased for small sample sizes and outperformed the rest of the estimators for large sample sizes ml was more accurate than mom when combined with g u f r l n 2 and l p i i i to model the extreme temperature data from an indian station vivekanandan 2017 the same distributions were used with mom ml and order statistics approach osa for the extreme value analysis of rainfall and temperature of an indian station vivekanandan 2018 the l p i i i with ml was the most suitable combination for all extreme variables öztekin 2005 provided suggestions for effective ml application proposing to use the golden section search kiefer and wolfowitz 1956 instead of the newton raphson process wallis 1685 to avoid convergence issues the ml though can provide absurd g e v shape parameter estimates for small samples martins and stedinger 2000 compared to pwm it does not perform well for small samples in terms of bias and rmse of estimated quantiles hosking et al 1985 madsen et al 1997 proposed using ml with pot for shape parameters lower than 0 2 but stressed that the ml is not ideal for small sample sizes instead they proposed the mom even for evis lower than 0 2 rowinski et al 2002 noted that the ml is not very sensitive to the upper tail shape but it provides asymptotic convergence beyond the domain of existence of the first two moments or lm ml provided a systematic overestimation of the shape parameter underestimation by lm for very high evi values due to its sensitivity to very large observations bernardara et al 2008 the poor performance of the ml is due to the noticeable positive skew of the estimator gubareva and gartsman 2010 found that the ml and lm is superior to the mom being consistent and with small parameter bias hosking and wallis 1987 showed that unless the g p sample size is 500 or more estimators derived by mom or the pwm are more reliable than the ml ashkar and tatsambon 2007 suggested the use of ml when the return period of the quantiles under estimation is smaller than the sample size finally ml demanded higher numerical effort than pwm for any probability distribution under assessment in haktanir and horlacher 1993 4 7 generalized or penalized maximum likelihood estimator gml pml the generalized or penalized maximum likelihood estimator gml or pml coles and dixon 1999 augments the maximum likelihood with a penalty function which may contain prior knowledge on the parameters or discourage undesirable estimates the penalty is full for evi larger than 1 no penalty is given for evi less than 0 and a continuous function is defined between 0 and 1 the penalty function is multiplied with the likelihood function and the pml estimator is obtained the approach resembles the bayesian inference see section 4 16 coles and dixon 1999 showed that the pml can outperform the pwm in small g p sample sizes keeping the good properties of the ml estimation for large samples they tested the pml performance by applying it to 58 uk sea level sets engeland et al 2004 noticed that for floods the difference between the estimators ml pml and pwm is minor contrary to droughts for which pwm is less sensitive to block size they also noted that the pml estimators along with the ml can incorporate non stationarities and therefore be more flexible than pwm curceac et al 2020 found the pml and ml to be among the most unbiased in terms of parameter estimation and accurate estimators although negatively biased for small sample sizes compared to the mom the pickands estimator and the maximum goodness of fit estimator mgf martins and stedinger 2001 2000 defined the generalized maximum likelihood gml following the reasoning of pml based on hydrologic experience they suggested a beta distribution b with an evi between 0 5 and 0 5 as a prior to restrict the estimated g e v shape parameter values to a physically reasonable range the gml applied for the g e v distribution is preferable to lm and mom estimators for flood like distributions which correspond to positive values of the tail index i e heavy tailed and particularly for shape parameters in the range of 0 to 0 4 martins and stedinger 2000 for e v i 0 another prior should be adopted martins and stedinger 2001 resolved the issue of possible adverse estimates of the g p shape parameter when using ml in small samples by adding another prior distribution on the shape parameter again for positive shape parameters the gml under both pot and bm performs better compared to mom and lm in terms of bias variance and rmse of the flood quantiles the estimator has also been widely used in studies of non stationary hydrologic and climate variables cannon 2010 el adlouni et al 2007 vasiliades et al 2015 xavier et al 2020 4 8 pickands estimator the pickands estimator pickands 1975 uses the excess above a threshold and the rank of the upper threshold k the estimator is shift and scale invariant since the estimator is a function of k it is quite volatile with large asymptotic variance pickands 1975 proved that the estimator is weakly consistent dekkers and haan 1989 showed consistency and asymptotical normality for all shape parameters expressing the tail many studies have aimed at improving the estimator since it is a linear combination of log spacings of order statistics segers 2005 the pickands estimator yielded large variability especially for small values of the upper threshold rank compared to other parametric estimators which were more consistent in the study of aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 4 9 two and three step estimators zhou 2008 proposed a two step estimator which resembles the ml as far as asymptotic behavior is concerned but is also explicitly given he used the pickands estimator for a first approximation of the evi other estimators can also be used i e the hill estimator for positive γ the second step involves performing an approximation to the likelihood function such that the difference between the two step estimator and the ml is approximately zero this approach has a small estimation error satisfies theoretical properties such as shift and scale invariance and is simple in application the result of the two step estimator can be considered as the first estimate to a three step estimator the latter is even more accurate zhou 2008 for the acquisition of the evi in the study of aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 the two and three step estimators exhibited similar performance with the ml these estimators and particularly the two step provided robust and consistent estimates and the approach was preferred over the semiparametric pickands and hill 4 10 hill estimator adapted hill estimator and moment estimator the hill estimator hill 1975 is the most commonly used technique for tail index estimation although it is restricted to e v i 0 the estimator is a result of the slope of the quantile plot it is based on the logarithms of the observed data therefore it is not shift invariant the estimator owes its wide use to the dominance of heavy tails in hydroclimatology the method is based on the concept of conditional ml moore and harter 1969 it has both weak and strong consistency and asymptotic normality assuming iid data as in the pickands estimator for high k values the variance of the parameter estimation increases and the bias increases for low values of k fedotenkov 2020 bernardara et al 2008 applied the ml and lm parametric estimators and the hill and generalized hill semiparametric estimators to a set of daily discharges from 173 stations in the rhone mediterranean region france although the hill estimator gave consistent results for the heavy tail it can be sensitive to shifts in the data thus inducing the hill horror plots a term used by resnick 1997 attention is needed with hill assumption based methods which utilize the asymptotic properties of the g p distribution not always applying under pre asymptotic conditions low values of the index in the range of 0 1 0 2 cause slow convergence of the log transformed g p quantiles to exponential ones therefore hill s estimations may lead to significant overestimation of g p shape parameters when applied to empirical finite length hydroclimatic records langousis et al 2016 dekkers et al 1989 presented an adaptation of hill s estimator which is consistent for e v i r called the moment estimator me the study of aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 showed that although the moment estimator along with pwm and ml estimators had robust results for large threshold ranks low variability the method demonstrated inconsistency for small ranks draisma et al 1999 presented a bootstrap based method to improve the evi for both moment and pickands estimators balancing parameter variance and bias components finally beirlant et al 1996 proposed the generalized quantile plot which is asymptotically linear and the slope of the plot corresponds to the evi assuming iid then they applied the hill estimator to the generalized quantile plot introducing the generalized hill estimator which is not restricted to heavy tails 4 11 least squares ls estimator the least square galton 1886 legendre 1805 estimator ls finds the parameter estimates which minimize the sum of squared deviations between the sample and the fitted order statistics usually the probability p m m n 1 the so called weibull plotting position is assigned to the ordered ranked values where m is the order and n is the sample size lloyd 1952 the method played a significant role in the work of gumbel gumbel 1958 the analysis with ls estimators has the longest history and various versions of the approach exist according to the plotting position apart from the weibull plotting position weibull 1939 others are also appropriate according to cunnane 1978 such as the gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 see also makkonen 2008 for a relevant review however many plotting positions have been optimized for specific probability distribution thus an optimal use would imply knowing the distribution a priori and this is rarely the case see also jordaan 2005 according to makkonen 2008 the choice of a proper fitting method has smaller uncertainty than the selection of the plotting position he states that only the weibull formula which provides the mean of the distribution of order ranked variables is an appropriate approach while the rest do not correspond to the true non exceedance probability see also makkonen and pajari 2014 when the data set is large the choice of plotting position has little effect on the results jordaan 2005 lloyd 1952 first formed the framework for obtaining linear unbiased estimators for location and scale parameters with ordered observations and least squares other studies which have dealt with linear combinations of order statistics are the ones of lieblein 1953 and downton 1966 among others see raynal and salas 1986 for more information several variations exist for the estimator like the ordinary ls ols legendre 1805 the weighted or generalized gls harris 1996 that adjusts the weight of each observation using the weighted arithmetic mean cotes 1768 alternating ls and partial ls wold 1982 in the comparative study of estimators by moharram et al 1993 the ls was generally better in terms of rmse followed by the mom in quantile estimation the ls method had also the best performance in terms of bias for negative positive according to the convention in the study of moharram et al 1993 shape parameter raynal and salas 1986 note that the ls and the mode interquartile range method should not be used for fitting the g u as they give the largest quantile biases öztekin 2005 provided some conditions which prevent the sensitivity of the ls method in the initial estimates of the location parameter 4 12 minimum density power divergence estimator mdpde the class of density power divergence was introduced by basu et al 1998 who designed the minimum density power divergence estimator mdpde the estimator has a single parameter α m d p d e which controls the interchange between robustness and efficiency when α m d p d e 0 the divergence is also known as the kullback leiber in this case the estimator has higher efficiency and less robustness against outliers while the opposite is true as α m d p d e increases τhe mdpde has been applied with various asymmetric models such as the g p juárez and schucany 2004 the f r kim and lee 2008 and the l n pak 2014 juárez and schucany 2004 compared the mdpde with ml dupuis optimally biased robust estimator obre and peng and welsh s medians estimator for the estimation of the shape and scale parameters of the g p distribution they applied them to the monthly rainfall of a station in mexico 1904 2003 the mdpde carries the good properties of ml which are the easy generalization the capability of incorporating trends covariates and multivariate extremes the asymptotic efficiency and normality and simplicity in producing ses it is also robust against gross errors making the approach more efficient for gross errors contaminated g p s for α m d p d e 0 2 the estimator maintains good asymptotic relative efficiencies above 90 however when the g p model is not contaminated the authors recommend the ml 4 13 dupuis optimally biased robust estimator obre hampel s optimally biased robust estimator obre hampel et al 1986 belongs to the class of m estimators which constitute a generalization of the ml huber 1964 the algorithm is convergent if the starting point is near the solution dupuis 1999 implemented obre to fit the g p on the exceedances over high thresholds of flow data at the river derwent uk obre along with mdpde was robust against gross errors in estimating the parameters of contaminated g p distributions however the authors observed a high rate of non convergence in the study of juárez and schucany 2004 obre and mdpde was more efficient than ml for the case of g p distributions contaminated with gross errors however the method has some convergence problems with short tail data the ml has higher efficiency for non contaminated g p models 4 14 peng and welsh s medians estimator peng and welsh 2001 derived their median estimator by equating the sample and population likelihood score medians an approach based on trimmed moments brazauskas et al 2009 the estimator is robust and asymptotically normal however it has shown high rates of non convergence and generally poor performance for extreme rainfall under all simulated models in the study of juárez and schucany 2004 4 15 principle of maximum entropy pome the shannon information entropy shannon 1948 quantifies the uncertainty of a random variable following a specific distribution jaynes 1982 formulated the principle of maximum entropy pome and mentioned that the minimally prejudiced assignment of probabilities is the one which maximizes the entropy subject to the given information the pome parameter estimation involves three steps i e the specification of constraints related to the data sample the derivation of the entropy function of the distribution which is maximized and the derivation of the relations between parameters and constraints singh 1998 the main parameter estimation method based on the concept of entropy is the ordinary entropy method a variant of the ordinary entropy method is the maximum entropy parameter space expansion both methods are analyzed in singh 1998 pome is considered an efficient parameter estimation method in the study of vivekanandan 2013 pome provides the smallest sampling variance compared to other approaches however in some cases it gives biased quantile estimates and often is not quite accurate as in the case of ml vivekanandan 2013 the ordinary entropy method was applied to wind extremes to successfully estimate the g e v parameters in the study of soukissian and tsalis 2015 giving the smallest values of evi bias and satisfactory mse and variance 4 16 bayesian inference bayesian markov chain monte carlo bmcmc the bayesian inference bayes and price 1763 requires a prior distribution on the parameters which represents prior knowledge or arbitrary distributions with a large variance if the former is not available through a likelihood function the prior information leads to a posterior distribution of the parameters the result of the method is a distribution and not a point estimate a summary statistic of the posterior distribution is used if a point estimate is needed coles et al 2003 markov chain monte carlo bmcmc methods are used to approximate a solution since integration over the parameter space is typically not possible coles 2001 hastings 1970 coles et al 2003 applied the bmcmc and the ml with the g u and g e v to analyze extreme daily rainfall from the tropical zone of the venezuelan north central coast 1961 1999 the bayesian analysis was preferred as it allowed for proper formalization of the uncertainty and modeling of seasonal heterogeneity reis and stedinger 2005 used the bmcmc for the evaluation of the posterior distributions in flood quantiles under the l n and l p i i i the bayesian inference approach has been used in flood frequency analysis with g e v seidou et al 2006 and extreme drought analysis with g e v and g p cindrić and pasarić 2018 haddad and rahman 2011 evaluated mom ml and bmcmc and found that the bmcmc gives the best parameter estimates for the l n in terms of smallest bias and se however bayesian methods can be very time consuming to implement and as noted by eugenia castellanos and cabras 2007 they can only be used for g p with e v i 0 5 4 17 elemental percentile method ep the elemental percentile ep method castillo and hadi 1995 equals the cumulative df evaluated at the ordered statistics of the observed data to the percentile values the resulting equations are used to obtain initial parameter estimates these are combined to give overall estimates which are substituted in the quantile function to obtain quantile estimates when assessing the parameters and quantiles of the g e v the ep estimators are well defined based on equations that involve only one variable and exist in cases where other classical estimators do not castillo and hadi 1995 the simulation results of castillo and hadi 1995 showed that ep was comparable to pwm for 0 5 evi 0 5 but it performed better outside this range castillo and hadi 1997 suggested that for the g p ml should be used if the sample size is large e g n 500 and evi is in the 0 5 0 5 range and pwm should be used if the sample size is small and evi is in the 0 5 0 range in every other case ep is the most suitable method based on the ses the asae and the biases of the parameter estimators ep was suggested for use under all cases when the ml has convergence issues since it exists for all evi values and has no convergence issues soukissian and tsalis 2015 examined several common and less known estimation methods for the g e v parameters under bm mom pwm lm ml the maximum product spacings method mps the quantile ls the ep and two methods based on the principle of maximum entropy the lesser known mps ep and ordinary entropy performed better in the description of extreme wind speed quantiles ashoori et al 2017 also used the g e v distribution and four parameter estimation methods i e ml pwm ep and quantile ls on precipitation data in iran and the ep performed almost as equally well as quantile ls based on quantile estimates comparison by the asae criterion 4 18 maximum product spacings mps method cheng and amin 1983 and ranneby 1984 first introduced the method of maximum product spacings mps for parameter estimation of continuous distributions the difference between the values of the cumulative df and the adjacent ordered points are called spacings the mps maximizes the logarithm of the geometric mean of these spacings mps estimators are solved numerically with nonlinear optimization methods the mps can be used as an alternative for the ml in cases where the latter fails to converge wong and li 2006 note that the mps method has been neglected in evt despite the restrictions of ml for small sample sizes the mps is stable in contrast to ml or even pwm 4 19 hybrid likelihood moment estimator hlme zhang 2007 presented the hybrid likelihood moment estimator hlme for the g p which merges likelihood and moment estimators these hybrid likelihood moment estimators always exist have high asymptotic efficiency are always feasible and are computationally simple mackay et al 2011 zhang 2007 demonstrated that the solution to their equations can be given by a newton raphson method within 4 6 iterations the hlme keeps the excellent properties of the ml without its limitations de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 in the study of curceac et al 2020 the hlme was one of the most efficient estimators in terms of parameter accuracy and bias except for the very short tails e v i 0 5 according to mackay et al 2011 the hlme for the g p has the best performance for small sample sizes of 200 or less low quantile bias and rmse for all evi values compared to mom gpwm ml ls and pml 4 20 variance weighted least squares vwls recently makkonen and tikanmäki 2019 developed a new parameter estimation method that combines minimization of the variance of order ranked observations v weibull plotting positions w and weighted least squares ls they called it the vwls method they used the g e v linking the weighing and the fitting to each other by solving their optimal selection iteratively they compared their method with ml pwm lm and lh moments wang 1997 by using monte carlo simulations and producing random data from g u f r and w type distributions representing environmental variables the bin criterion was used for evaluation pajari et al 2021 the vwls method predicted the highest and smallest value in the data set better the method does not require subjective methodological decisions by the user but the assumptions of iid and stationarity need to be held 5 non stationarity 5 1 non stationary approaches the methods described so far are implemented under the assumption of a stationary hydrological cycle however in light of the changes due to anthropogenic and climatic stressors which cause non stationary conditions the stationary assumption may not be viable coles 2001 salas et al 2018 yet nonstationarity should be used cautiously serinaldi and kilsby 2015 the use of traditional stationary methods for the description of non stationary processes may lead to poor design estimates meaning either expensive over designed or unsafe under designed infrastructure françois et al 2019 consequently new techniques and practices have been developed which perform under the framework of non stationarity salas et al 2018 provide an extensive review of such techniques therefore we will reduce this section to a brief reference to the basic parameter estimation techniques of non stationary extremes in hydroclimatology and the comparative studies performed for them the bm approach can be extended to model non stationary extremes assuming the same type of g e v distribution as in the stationary case and considering that the parameters vary with covariates i e time or explanatory variables which vary with time coles 2001 the non stationary df can be expressed as 6 f g e v x exp 1 γ t x α t β t 1 γ t where α t β t γ t location scale and shape parameters depending on time and 1 γ t β t x α t 0 various combinations exist regarding which parameters are functions of time and which are kept constant for example el adlouni et al 2007 have used both location and scale parameters as functions of covariates with a fixed shape parameter it is very rare for all three parameters to be functions of covariates coles 2001 likewise the pot approach can be extended to non stationary conditions smith 1989 the x p threshold the occurrence process i e the distribution of the number of exceedances and the exceedances can be considered as non stationary in many cases the threshold x p is modeled using quantile regression koenker 2005 roth et al 2014 roth et al 2012 in some studies both the occurrence and the g p parameters are considered non stationary parey et al 2007 a superposition of sinusoidal cycles may be used for the description of the seasonality in the occurrence process north 1980 prosdocimi et al 2015 compared the non stationary bm model with a point process characterization of threshold exceedances when the same covariates are considered for extreme hydrological data the point process approach was more effective than bm in identifying the effect of the urbanization levels increase on high flows wi et al 2016 found a great discrepancy between the estimates from pot and bm approaches under non stationarity agilan and umamahesh 2017 noted that pot estimated return levels under non stationarity are higher compared to bm estimated ones for short durations and small return periods while the opposite is true for long durations and high return periods other applications of non stationary pot models are the studies of razmi et al 2017 silva 2016 and silva et al 2014 5 2 parameter estimation methods for extremes under non stationarity and comparative studies maximum likelihood was introduced for the estimation of distribution parameters with covariates in davison and smith 1990 more recently the presence of time covariates in the flood frequency analysis is usually estimated by the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss rigby et al 2005 kochanek et al 2013 presented the hybrid two stage ts method which has a separate estimator of the time dependent mean and standard deviation based on which the shape parameter and quantiles are estimated in the first stage the weighted least squares wls estimate the mean and standard deviation which are time dependent to deal with the trend in the first two moments in the second stage after the distribution is chosen the shape parameter is estimated using the lm and the time dependent quantiles are determined demaria et al 2017 used a bayesian approach with monte carlo techniques on sub daily precipitation intensities they evaluated temporal trends and developed intensity duration frequency idf curves under both stationary and non stationary climatic conditions using both bm and pot ouarda and charron 2019 proposed an approach based on l moment ratio diagrams to estimate non stationarity in hydroclimatic extremes and identify relations between the extreme distribution shapes and the climate indices el adlouni et al 2007 developed the generalized maximum likelihood estimation gml method for the non stationary g e v model they compared the gml method to the ml method for the 1 stationary 2 non stationary with a linear dependence on covariates 3 non stationary with a quadratic dependence on covariates and 4 non stationary with linear dependence in both location and scale parameters cases the gml was superior to the ml based on the bias and rmse of the estimated quantiles el adlouni and ouarda 2008 proposed the generalization of the lm for the non stationary case of the g e v model the authors estimated that the lm is better than the ml in terms of bias and rmse of the estimated quantiles compared to the gml the lm gives equally good results especially for a weak skewness strupczewski et al 2016 utilized both ml and the two stage method ts their approach was applied to monte carlo mc simulation experiments assuming linear trends in the mean and standard deviation and to flow data of three polish rivers ts was superior in estimating the two first time dependent moments time invariant skewness and time dependent upper quantiles the estimates derived by the method were less sensitive to the choice of the probability distribution šraj et al 2016 examined two approaches under both stationary and non stationary frameworks i e the ml and the bayesian monte carlo markov chain bmcmc cheng et al 2014 they noted that the estimates given by ml can be unrealistic and this is the sole reason for preferring the bayesian approach over ml see also katz et al 2002 debele et al 2017 compared the application of three non stationary estimation methods on non stationary floods table 2 i e the ml the two stage method for wls with simultaneous assessment of trends in the mean and standard deviation wls ts and gamlss the gamlss was superior in terms of rbias and rmse in the estimates of the standard deviation trend and the constant shape parameter trend the wls ts was more accurate in the estimates of the mean value trend and was more appropriate for short non stationary time series chen et al 2017 compared the parametric weighted least squares wls estimation the non parametric discrete wavelet transform dwt and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd for the extreme precipitation analysis in taiwan all three methods were suitable for the identification of non stationarity and yielded similar trends although local variations in precipitation were magnified by dwt and eemd the authors suggest that a linear model is sufficient for the portrayal of time variance in the first or second moment and warn practitioners to carefully use parabolic trends which have rapid increases razmi et al 2017 observed no significant difference between ml and pml estimators applied on the maxima of a water level time series in manhattan under both pot and bm except for the case of pot under non stationarity they based their assessments only on visual inspection of the frequency analysis durocher et al 2019 compared the regression approach to the ml under pot and deduced that the former was less biased and more accurate in the parameter estimation for short time series with positive g p shape parameters i e heavy tailed distributions under non stationarity agilan et al 2021 stress that the threshold uncertainty increases under the non stationary condition and that it is higher for low probabilities 6 model selection tools the literature provides many goodness of fit gof tests or tools examining the suitability of theoretical distributions to describe extreme observations here we refer to comparative studies using gof tests to assess the fitting of distributions in hydroclimatic extremes the studies used monte carlo simulations to produce multiple samples from theoretical distributions and assessed the probabilities of correct selection based on gof tests the anderson darling test ad anderson and darling 1954 for extreme value distributions is powerful and easily applicable it is more sensitive and powerful than other commonly used gof tests especially for data with strong variations in the tail d agostino and stephens 1986 haddad and rahman 2011 claim that ad is more successful in identifying the parent distribution when it has three parameters compared to the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic however aic and bic are more suitable when the parent is a two parameter distribution the cramér von mises cvm family of tests is also popular because they are powerful and adaptable ashkar et al 2013 yet the ad test might perform better compared to the cvm in extreme value analysis because it weights more the tail observations and can detect outliers ashkar et al 2013 laio 2004 compared various tests and distributions commonly used in hydrology table 3 and suggested using probability plot tests when the hypothesized distribution is n or l n and ad in all other cases ashkar and aucoin 2012 reviewed the main tests used to discriminate between pairs of two parameter distributions used in hydrology with emphasis on the w and l l distributions they used the ratio of maximized likelihood rml the anderson darling ad the cramer von mises cvm the one sample kolmogorov smirnov ks1 the modified shapiro wilk msw the sample skewness coefficient and the sample l skewness monte carlo simulations coupled with ml parameter estimation indicated the rml the ad and msw as the most powerful tests with the latter performing well with small samples ashkar and ba 2017 tested various discrimination methods in fitting the three k a 3 and two parameter kappa k a 2 and g p distributions to flood pot datasets from 8 canadian stations among the ad the rml and a normality transformation followed by application of the sw statistic nt sw the latter was the most appropriate method for sample sizes usually encountered in hydrology recently krit et al 2019 compared and reviewed gof tests for the two parameter w and extreme value distributions they studied tests based on probability plots pp coles 1989 smith and bain 1976 shapiro wilk sw tests öztürk and korukoglu 1988 shapiro and brain 1987 tests based on the empirical distribution function including the kolmogorov smirnov statistics ks cramer von

korukoglu 1988 and the tiku singh test based on the normalized spacings performed the best 7 conclusions this review focused mainly on probability distributions used since the 1980s and parameter estimation methods used in analyses of hydroclimatic extremes a brief overview of non stationary approaches and model selection tools for extreme events was also provided the synthesis mainly resulted from the comparative studies cited the results of the studies differ depending on the distributions applied the case studies the temporal scales the sample sizes and the evaluation metrics although a unified framework for parameter estimation comparison and a global distribution for hydroclimatic extremes assessment do not exist synthesis of the results indicates peaks over threshold pot and block maxima bm prevail in the extreme flow analysis typically using the g p and g e v distributions respectively other distributions have also been used with these approaches l l l n l p i i i g l o p i i i b κ recently distributions not typically used in extremes such as b r i i i and b r x i i have been successfully applied for discharge extremes the g e v distribution is the most popular choice for extreme flow analysis with applications in many countries austria siberia far east switzerland italy ethiopia scotland england usa in many cases when g e v is applied to describe streamflow maxima it indicates an upper limit but according to many studies this contradicts the hydrological variables nature leading potentially to risk underestimation most studies indicate that heavy tailed distributions should describe streamflow extremes the g u for example has been shown to underestimate extremes in the usa and the mediterranean region topographical weather interactions such as landfalling tropical cyclones affect the tail heaviness significantly global studies on precipitation agree that precipitation extremes are better described by heavy tailed distributions including stretched exponential and power type apart from the typically used pot and bm with g p and g e v common distributions used for extreme daily rainfall are p i i i l p i i i l n 3 p i i l n w g g g as well as the b r x i i not typically used in extremes the l g l n and w distributions have been applied for hourly extreme precipitation semiparametric distributions for the entire range of rainfall amount have also been proposed based on the extended g p distribution family the gaussian distribution potentially underestimates extreme temperature events and during the last years there is a shift towards distributions with longer tails the method of moments mom although a popular choice in parameter estimation for extreme value distributions is outperformed by other methods most recent studies use the l moments lm method to estimate the parameters of the g e v distribution since lm is not sensitive to outliers and provides good estimates for small sample sizes the lesser known estimators maximum product of spacings mps elemental percentile ep minimum density power divergence estimator mdpde and the new vwls method showed promising results in comparative studies these estimators have attractive features and fewer limitations compared to popular methods more research and applications are needed to fully assess their performance in extreme value analyses other satisfactory less common estimators were the hybrid likelihood moment estimator hlme partial probability weighted moments ppwm penalized maximum likelihood pml 2 and 3 step estimators bayesian markov chain monte carlo bmcmc the classic anderson darling test is one of the top choices to assess goodness of fit or model selection the shapiro wilk test simple or modified or used in combination with a normality transformation is among the best when applied for the w e v 1 l l g p and k a 2 distributions non stationary extreme value distributions have become widely applicable mainly over the last 10 years to account for observed hydroclimatic changes typically attributed to global warming many methods have been developed to fit non stationary extreme value distribution a limited number of studies show that the generalized maximum likelihood gml the weighted least squares wls and the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss are outperforming the more standard non stationary ml

3781,here we review methods used for probabilistic analysis of extreme events in hydroclimatology we focus on streamflow precipitation and temperature extremes at regional and global scales the review has four thematic sections 1 probability distributions used to describe hydroclimatic extremes 2 comparative studies of parameter estimation methods 3 non stationarity approaches and 4 model selection tools synthesis of the literature shows that 1 recent studies in general agree that precipitation and streamflow extremes should be described by heavy tailed distributions 2 the method of moments mom is typically the first choice in estimating distribution parameters but it is outperformed by methods such as l moments lm maximum likelihood ml least squares ls and bayesian markov chain monte carlo bmcmc 3 there are less popular parameter estimation techniques such as the maximum product of spacings mps the elemental percentile ep and the minimum density power divergence estimator mdpde that have shown competitive performance in fitting extreme value distributions and 4 non stationary analyses of extreme events are gaining popularity the ml is the typically used method yet literature suggests that the generalized maximum likelihood gml and the weighted least squares wls may be better alternatives the review offers a synthesis of past and contemporary methods used in the analysis of hydroclimatic extremes aiming to highlight their strengths and weaknesses finally the comparative studies summary helps the reader identify the most suitable modeling framework for their analyses based on the extreme hydroclimatic variables sample sizes locations and evaluation metrics reviewed keywords extremes streamflow precipitation temperature non stationarity probabilistic parameter estimation 1 introduction hydroclimatology studies the influence of climate upon the waters of the land langbein and fairbridge 1967 it also encompasses hydrometeorology and the study of surface or near surface water relations mather 1991 wendland 1998 extreme hydroclimatic events such as temperature rainfall and streamflow extremes pose threats locally regionally and globally stress from extremely warm temperatures is linked to excess human mortality drought forest fires tornadoes and decreased agricultural and livestock productivity smoyer tomic et al 2003 it is estimated that since the beginning of the century over 5 million extreme temperature related deaths occur per year zhao et al 2021 extreme temperatures affect the hydrological cycle markonis et al 2019 vargas godoy et al 2021 leading to more intense precipitation occurrences or causing earlier runoff in snowmelt dominated and transitional watersheds leading to more frequent extreme flood events clifton et al 2018 extreme precipitation is the driving force behind adverse phenomena with implications on both human and natural systems the most important impact of extreme precipitation is heavy flooding the amplification of precipitation e g papalexiou and montanari 2019 can alter the magnitude and frequency of flooding strain aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems economies and human societies tabari 2020 doocy et al 2013 reported over half a million fatalities and about 350 thousand injuries due to rain induced floods during the period 1980 2009 while the number of people affected by floods was almost 3 billion globally gumbel 1941 was among the first to recognize the need to better characterize and model hydroclimatic extremes and estimated flood return periods based on the extreme value theory evt fisher and tippett 1928 fréchet 1927 since then hydrologists climatologists and statisticians further advanced modeling of extremes and developed new approaches e g katz et al 2002 this review outlines the probabilistic methods used to analyze extreme events in ηydroclimatology the literature shows that certain approaches probability distributions and parameter estimation methods have been preferred over others we focus on distributions used to analyze extreme streamflow precipitation and temperature we review comparative studies on parameter estimation methods that have been used in analyses of extremes and summarize their results methods used in non stationary analyses are briefly reported finally we review tools used to select distributions for extreme observations and asses their fit the review concludes by attempting a synthesis of the results 2 the cornerstones block maxima bm and peaks over threshold pot in probabilistic methods the frequency and magnitude of extreme events of river discharge precipitation and temperature are described by the upper part of the distribution which is typically called the tail probability distributions can be generally categorized into heavy and light tailed based on their tail behavior the former predict extreme events of higher intensity and frequency e g papalexiou et al 2013 the main probabilistic methods are based on the extreme value theory evt which focuses on analyzing block maxima bm or annual maxima and peaks over threshold pot or partial duration series the former involves dividing the time series into subsets usually into years and considering the maximum value of each subset block maxima based on the fisher tippett gnedenko theorem fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 the maximum of a properly normalized sample converges to one of the following extreme value distributions type i extreme value distribution or the gumbel distribution g u gumbel 1941 1935 with distribution function df 1 f g u x exp exp x α β x ℝ where α r and β 0 are location and scale parameters type ii extreme value distribution or the fréchet f r fréchet 1927 with df 2 f f r x exp x α β 1 γ x α where β 0 and γ 0 are scale and shape parameters type iii extreme value distribution or reverse weibull r w with 3 f r w x exp x α β 1 γ x α where β 0 and γ 0 are scale and shape parameters the three limiting laws were unified by jenkinson 1955 into a single expression known as the generalized extreme value g e v distribution with df 4 f g e v x exp 1 γ x α β 1 γ 1 γ x α β 0 a n d γ 0 where α r β 0 and γ r are location scale and shape parameters respectively for γ 0 the g e v becomes the g u distribution for γ 0 represents the f r distribution with x α β γ and for γ 0 is the r w distribution with x α β γ the shape parameter γ is also known as the extreme value index evi the extreme value distributions are limiting laws emerging under specific assumptions i e the random variables must be independent and identically distributed iid and the sample size must tend to infinity since the length of observed samples is usually small the convergence to one of these asymptotic distributions is not guaranteed e g papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 the convergence rate of the extreme value distribution to each of the three limiting laws depends on the tail type of the parent distribution parent distributions that resemble the extreme value distribution converge the fastest e g makkonen 2008 for example an exponential e parent distribution converges to the g u distribution fast and therefore the assumption of infinite samples can be relaxed or neglected in other cases where the parent does not match the tail type of the extreme value distribution the convergence may be slow and a small sample size may be responsible for the poor success of methods applied to hydroclimatic extremes shortcomings in the bm method include loss of information as only the maximum of each year is considered and small sample sizes also estimation of the g e v parameters often leads to upper bounded distributions γ 0 r w however this interpretation is not justified as distributions bounded from above contradict the nature of hydrological variables and can lead to risk underestimation e g zaghloul et al 2020 moccia et al 2021 for example an upper bounded distribution assumes a maximum precipitation value which cannot be exceeded while even probable maximum precipitation estimates have been surpassed salas et al 2020 therefore the r w distribution should be used with extreme caution when analyzing extreme hydroclimatic variables cook and harris 2004 harris 2004 recently to tackle some of these challenges different approaches have been applied for example marani and ignaccolo 2015 used a non asymptotic approach called the metastatistical extreme value m e v based on superstatistics beck and cohen 2003 another term of the same framework is compound distributions dubey 1970 m e v utilizes the distribution of the statistical parameters describing ordinary daily rainfall occurrence i e the number of times a process is observed each year and intensity since a larger amount of information is used ordinary events vs extremes this approach might be more accurate for rare return levels marra et al 2018 m e v was applied to extreme rainfall in italy outperforming g e v in terms of mean and root mean square error marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 found that m e v reduces the uncertainty in high quantile extremes estimation by up to 50 compared to classical evt marra et al 2019 simplified the method s formulation simplified m e v or s m e v and applied it to daily precipitation data from eastern mediterranean stations the pot approach focuses on observations exceeding a certain threshold x p base or truncation level based on the balkema and de haan 1974 and pickands 1975 theorem the peaks over a high threshold x p of a time series converge asymptotically to the generalized pareto g p distribution as the threshold increases the df of the g p is 5 f g p x 1 1 γ x α β 1 γ for γ 0 1 exp x α β f o r γ 0 where γ x α when γ 0 and α x α β γ when γ 0 the parameter α corresponds to the threshold x p therefore if the threshold is predefined then the g p has only two parameters shape and scale this parametrization is a convention followed in several studies deidda 2010 2007 deidda and puliga 2009 2006 langousis et al 2016 mascaro 2018 the same convention may hold for the three parameter gamma g weibull w or lognormal l n distributions for γ 0 the g p has the type i tail and corresponds to e with mean β for γ 0 the type ii tail or the pareto distribution emerges for the special case of γ 1 the distribution is the uniform u α β finally for γ 0 we have a type iii tail which is upper bounded note also that only the shape parameter is common between eqs 4 and 5 in practice selecting a proper threshold x p is challenging it must be high enough to assure convergence to the g p but not too high to allow enough values in the pot sample for reliable estimations most authors have used conventional estimation methods for threshold selection considering a given sample thus disregarding the possibility that the sample changes with the threshold alternatively choulakian and stephens 2001 used tests based on the iterative application of the cramér von mises statistics for the g p following davison and smith 1990 initially a high number of exceedances is selected and the test is implemented upon failure of the test the smallest values are omitted one by one and the test is re implemented until acceptance of the g p this method was implemented by deidda and puliga 2006 but failed due to the presence of many rounding off values among sample data affecting the goodness of fit statistics therefore a monte carlo based approach was adopted to account for these discrete recordings the discretization of records is a typical problem in rainfall records see e g deidda 2007 affecting the performance of parameter estimators for the g p deidda 2010 deidda and puliga 2009 2006 langousis et al 2016 deidda 2010 re parametrized the g p to have three threshold invariant parameters he then introduced and tested the novel multiple threshold method mtm which deals with the uncertainties related to the assessment of a reasonable threshold the mtm was superior against the standard single threshold fit langousis et al 2016 revised representative methods for the g p threshold selection they found that the graphical methods and the goodness of fit metrics that rely on asymptotic properties of the g p distribution have the best performance apart from threshold selection methods another difficulty of the pot approach is the assumption of data series independence bezak et al 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 performed a detailed analysis on the effects of threshold selection in the shape parameter of the g p and later serinaldi and kilsby 2018 investigated pot hydrological extremes in the presence of spatial and temporal dependence using the pot or bm analysis several studies choose to fit different tail types instead of using the g p or g e v distributions usually numerous distributions are tested with pot or bm data and the most suitable one is selected based on goodness of fit criteria see also stedinger et al 1993 and grimaldi et al 2011 this approach is flexible since it does not assume convergence to the g p or g e v another option is the selection of a probability distribution which adequately describes both the extremes and the non zero values of the sample e g papalexiou et al 2018 after defining the evaluation approach for the maxima and selecting the statistical df the distribution parameters of the chosen df need to be estimated emphasis is given on the shape parameter or the evi which defines the heaviness of the right tail of the distribution a positive evi implies a heavy tail and a negative evi a light one see equations 4 5 this is the most commonly used convention in several papers however an opposite sign convention is assumed i e heavy tailed distributions are characterized by a negative shape parameter as in the works of hosking et al 1985 hosking and wallis 1997 hosking and wallis 1987 moharram et al 1993 madsen et al 1997 rasmussen 2001 ashoori et al 2017 de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 martins and stedinger 2001 2000 morrison and smith 2002 durocher et al 2019 and xu 2019 cited here 3 real world studies and most popular distributions 3 1 streamflow in the early 80s shen et al 1980 performed a country scale study to identify the extreme river flow distribution they used the maximum likelihood ml estimator and fitted the g u and the log pearson type iii l p i i i distributions on extreme hydrological data from 231 stations in the usa they compared the range of parameter values the range of the 1000 year flood and the range of 1000 to 10 year flood ratio suggesting that g u can underestimate extremes while the f r fits better during the 90s many more df s were tested on extreme flows for example the g e v in eastern us territory australian central victoria canadian new brunswick canadian new scotland and usa gingras and adamowski 1992 hosking and wallis 1997 pilon and adamowski 2011 vogel and wilson 1996 the g p in israel ben zvi and azmon 1997 and the l p i i i in australia along with the g e v g p and the three parameter lognormal l n 3 and the usa along with the two parametric lognormal l n 2 and g e v vogel et al 1993 the g e v and the l n 3 distributions were the most suitable for floods with return periods over 100 years in 13 streams in germany and scotland when compared to the l n 2 g u pearson type iii p i i i l p i i i log logistic l l and wakeby w a k distributions haktanir and horlacher 1993 the results were assessed by the chi squared test χ 2 pearson 1900 kolmogorov smirnov ks smirnov 1939 cramer von mises cvm criterion cramér 1928 and relative error re madsen et al 1997 compared the pot and the bm methods and used monte carlo simulations to assess flood data from 48 catchments in new zealand the g p was more efficient lowest standardized root mean square error rmse for the t year event in regions with a positive evi i e heavy tails whereas the g e v was better suited for regions with a negative evi later morrison and smith 2002 used the ml and l moments lm to estimate the location shape and scale parameters of the g e v distribution they extended the combined parameter estimation method for the two largest flood peaks in a year under the pot framework and applied their methods to 104 central appalachian basins the shape parameter values were larger than previously considered e g martins and stedinger 2000 indicating very heavy tails katz et al 2002 fitted the g e v distribution to annual peak flows of a time series longer than 100 years 1895 2000 at the potomac river usa using the ml they obtained a 0 191 evi which was supported by the comparison between the observed and theoretical distributions in a quantile quantile q q plot ashkar and mahdi 2003 focused on the performance of the l l distribution compared to the l n the two parameter w and the g u in estimating extreme flow data from 114 hydrometric stations in ontario canada the distribution parameters were estimated with the ml under the bm approach the l l generally performed better compared to the other three distributions as indicated by the anderson darling ad statistic chandra et al 1981 d agostino and stephens 1986 moisello 2007 estimated the peak discharge of 297 experimental samples from one african and four european countries under the bm framework tested the applicability of five different distributions e p g u g e v and g p using l diagrams and found that g e v is the most suitable calenda et al 2009 used bm and the ml to analyze the long flood time series of the river tiber in rome the g u typically used to describe the modern flood series of tiber was rejected for the complete sample extending back to 1872 in the 2010s haddad and rahman 2011 used the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 the akaike information criterion second order variant aicc and the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 for two parameter distributions and the ad statistic for three parameter distributions to select the most appropriate for extreme flows in 44 tasmanian sites the l n distribution offered the best fit compared to the normal n g u f r g e v p i i i and l p i i i gubareva 2011 examined thousands of stations from 5 countries with different climate conditions and used lm for annual maxima flows based on the χ 2 test and the w criterion vinogradov 1988 they demonstrated that g e v dominates over l n pearson type v p v and g p distributions in rivers of austria siberia and the far east the g p however was the most suitable for hawaiian islands extremes strupczewski et al 2011 used l moment ratio diagrams linearity test on log log plots and a two step model selection procedure el adlouni et al 2008 to conclude that annual peak flows in most of the 39 studied polish stations are better modeled using light tailed distributions like the three parameter inverse gaussian however nine stations were characterized by heavy tails rutkowska et al 2017 used lm to assess floods in poland including most of the regions examined in strupczewski et al 2011 based on lm ratio diagrams they showed that the homogenous clusters defined by 52 catchments are well described by the g p the generalized logistic g l o and the p i i i with the latter two fitting better to stations with higher and lower latitudes respectively murshed et al 2011 used the ks and ad tests with lm to examine the application of the g e v g u and beta κ b κ distributions on the annual maxima flow amounts of colorado streamflow data the g e v and b κ were better fitted than g u the authors claimed that using lm with the b κ distribution for small samples describes accurately heavy tails a disadvantage of the b κ distribution is the lack of a location parameter bowers et al 2012 analyzed daily discharge in nine usa rivers focusing on dry wet and transitional seasons the ks test showed that dry seasons can be described by l n and power law distributions while in wet seasons the l n distribution performed better only the salt river in arizona was better described by a power law with evi equal to 2 37 and 1 97 for the wet and dry season respectively similar results were found by anderson and meerschaert 1998 kochanek et al 2014 used the g e v for annual maxima flows in over 1000 stations in france and suggested that fitting should be based on local regional estimates rather than local ones they also indicated that the g u underestimates the extremes of mediterranean catchments salinas et al 2014 noted that a single statistical model i e the g e v cannot encompass the variation of flood processes at a pan european scale and each catchment should be investigated individually vivekanandan 2015 showed that the g u was more effectively fitted on floods in two gauging stations in india as indicated by the χ 2 and ks tests compared to the e f r g e v g p and n another study in india assessing floods in a monsoon dominated river showed that the l p i i i is better fitted than g u r w l n and l p i i i based on the ad ks and χ 2 tests bandyopadhyay et al 2016 ashkar and el adlouni 2015 analyzed four hydrometric stations 101 datasets in ontario canada and through ad tests assessed that 81 2 of them can be adequately fitted by a g p distribution more recently domma and condino 2017 proposed using two four parameter distributions for extreme hydrologic data analysis the beta dagum b d and the beta singh maddala b s m which are generalizations of a re parametrization of b κ and beta p b p distributions accordingly they applied them to the flow dataset used in murshed et al 2011 and proposed them as alternatives to classical models the b s m specifically as assessed by ml had the smallest parameter standard errors se and the best performance based on aic and ad ul hassan et al 2019 studied the extreme flow from five stations in sweden and tested the g e v l n 3 g l o p i i i and g u using a combination of goodness of fit tests ad mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape rmse root mean square percentage error rmspe they inferred that almost every station was best fitted by a different distribution smith et al 2018 examined the upper tail ratio i e the peak discharge divided by the 10 year flood magnitude of more than 8000 u s geological survey usgs stations they assumed that the upper tail ratio follows the g e v distribution being dependent on the shape parameter value independent of the basin properties and the sample size only the heavy tailed case could represent the upper tail ratio extremes another big dataset of annual flood peaks 1120 stations in china was analyzed by yang et al 2019 using g e v they inferred that the shape parameter is weakly dependent on the drainage area they also observed heavier tails of flood distributions in northern compared to southern china although the flood magnitudes and variability were smaller in the north finally they found that landfalling tropical cyclones greatly affect the characterization of flow tail properties leading to heavier flood distributions tails brunner et al 2020 assessed flood events in 671 catchments in the united using the pot approach based on simulations from the four parameter kappa k a 4 distribution zaghloul et al 2020 tested the g e v on 1088 streamflow stations across canada they detected that in 39 1 of the stations g e v predicts an upper limit for streamflow maxima which is inconsistent with the nature of streamflow they suggested burr type iii b r i i i and xii b r x i i as consistent alternatives 3 2 rainfall at the beginning of the 21st century katz et al 2002 analyzed the 100 year daily precipitation from a station in fort collins usa they fitted the g e v distribution by ml using both the bm and pot approaches yielding an evi equal to 0 174 and 0 182 respectively an indication of heavy tail both estimators were equivalent but the indication for a heavy tail was stronger with the pot due to higher data availability coles et al 2003 examined daily rainfall in the tropical zone of the north central coast of venezuela 1961 1999 they proposed using the g e v model instead of the g u to include uncertainty in the estimate yue hashino 2007 used the l moment ratio diagrams and the average weighted distance awd kroll and vogel 2002 to estimate the suitable distributions for annual seasonal and monthly precipitation in japan they concluded that the p i i i and l p i i i distributions are appropriate for describing extreme precipitation statistics with the l n 3 being a potential alternative aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 used several parametric and semiparametric evi estimators with g e v to effectively characterize long term daily rainfall tail behavior from 6 locations globally using the rmse and mae indices smith et al 2011 observed that central usa daily rainfall stations exhibit heavy tails with great spatial heterogeneity in the estimated g e v parameters the location and scale parameters are larger in the eastern part while the minimum values are observed west of the appalachian mountains nguyen and nguyen 2016 examined the annual maxima of 21 rainfall stations in ontario canada using a combination of q q plots rmse relative rmse rrmse and correlation coefficient cc they found that the g e v the generalized n and the p i i i were suitable distributions when fitting the g e v on 728 rainfall stations from all over china gu et al 2017 found that most tails are heavy and unbounded more recently mascaro 2020 analyzed a dataset of 240 gauges in central arizona and found that 1 the g e v well characterizes annual rainfall maxima at durations ranging from 30 min to 24 h 2 the shape parameter is positive across durations and has the largest value 0 12 on average for the 6 h duration and 3 the location and scale parameters vary with elevation and exhibit scaling properties across durations similar results were found by blanchet et al 2016 in a region in france in an alternative study mascaro 2018 used the g p distribution to analyze the annual and seasonal distributions of daily rainfall extremes in central arizona the distribution was found to be heavy tailed positive shape parameter during summer due to convective monsoonal thunderstorms and light tailed e during winter due to cold fronts the author proposed a hybrid model combining the two seasonal distributions for the description of the annual distribution and found a correlation of the g p scale parameter with elevation douka and karacostas 2018 used hourly precipitation records from a station in greece and ranked the performance of 61 theoretical distributions based on ks ad and χ 2 they proposed the g p and the johnson sb j s b and the log gamma l g and the l n as the best models for annual and seasonal extreme rainfall events respectively shahraki et al 2019 proposed the gamma generalized pareto approach a combination of the g p and the gamma density estimation method stacy 1962 for modeling extreme daily rainfall from five stations in iran tencaliec et al 2020 also presented a semiparametric distribution for the entire range of rainfall amount based on the extended g p e g p distribution family naveau et al 2016 they applied the distribution to the daily rainfall of 180 french stations it accurately estimated high quantiles and outperformed the classical g p and the parametric e g p in terms of rmse moccia et al 2021 applied the g e v over 13 247 daily gridded rainfall annual maxima samples in italy they found that in 44 9 of the cases g e v predicts an upper rainfall limit and suggested the use of g e v i e the g e v with shape parameters restricted to positive values and non extreme value distributions like the b r x i i instead moustakis et al 2021 investigated hourly precipitation in the united states using 3119 stations and simulations from the wrf climate model they used pot values and fitted the p i i and w tails to assess extremes and future changes extreme precipitation rainfall studies of global extent are common wilson and toumi 2005 used a global dataset and found that extreme daily precipitation can be represented by a stretched e form with a global shape parameter of 2 3 heavy tail papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 fitted the g e v and the g u distributions on 15 137 global records of daily rainfall 40 163 years with lm ratio plots to show that the f r law prevails over the g u they detected a relationship between record length and the g e v shape parameter which implied that only large samples can provide reliable estimates they also proposed an equation for the correction of the lm estimate of the g e v shape parameter which removes the bias due to small sample sizes papalexiou et al 2013 used a similar global dataset of 15 029 daily rainfall stations 50 172 years they tested the tails of pareto type ii p i i l n w and g covering a wide spectrum of tail heaviness from heavy tailed to light tailed they directly fitted the distributions to the empirical tails by numerically minimizing a modified mean square error mse norm 72 6 of the records were better described by sub exponential heavy tails serinaldi and kilsby 2014 used two worldwide data sets and performed a detailed investigation on how the threshold selection and record length affect the right tail behavior of pot observations they focused on the shape parameter of the g p distribution and identified two main effects 1 as the threshold decreases the g p shape parameter variance reduces converging to positive values yet the asymptotic g p hypothesis becomes less realistic tending to be replaced by weibull stretched exponential tails and 2 given a fixed high threshold and increasing record length the variance of the g p shape parameter decreases with its mean value converging to positive values later papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 examined approximately 170 000 global monthly daily precipitation records from more than 14 000 stations they utilized a combination of probability plots and lm and assessed that exponential tail light tailed distributions like the e mixed e or g can underestimate the magnitude of extreme events significantly also g w l n and p cannot universally represent daily precipitation the generalized gamma g g distribution is a suitable model for this purpose followed by b r x i i cavanaugh et al 2015 used a log likelihood ratio based test to find that the extremes of 22 000 global rainfall stations are better represented by a power law distribution rather than an exponential one papalexiou et al 2018 analyzed 4316 stations with more than 3000 nonzero hourly precipitation values after fitting distributions using the probability ratio mse and a novel bayesian adjustment approach they found that the w tail is more robust compared to the power type precipitation in mountainous areas was also fitted by heavier tails and a nonlinear increase of the tail s heaviness with elevation was observed nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 advanced the graphical mean excess function mef method to an algorithmic process applied it to 21 348 global stations with daily rainfall data and concluded that 75 8 of the records had sub exponential tails finally rajulapati et al 2020 assessed the tail heaviness using five global gridded precipitation products they fitted the p i i and w tails and found dissrepancies among the different products strong spatial variability in tail heaviness and singinficant differences in return levels for large return periods between the two tails 3 3 temperature the gaussian n df is frequently used for the analysis of large temperature datasets which are bell shaped most weather generators use the n distribution to simulate daily maximum and minimum temperature values harmel et al 2002 however studies have shown that it underestimates the probabilities of occurrence of extreme events for example harmel et al 2002 used temperature data from 15 sites in the usa and inferred that daily maximum and minimum air temperature are slightly skewed and not normally distributed in each month according to ruff and neelin 2012 the core of the observations from the national climatic data center may conform to the n but almost half of the stations present non gaussian tails of daily average maximum and minimum temperature garcía cueto et al 2014 used the g e v distribution to model the maximum and minimum temperature in four cities in north western mexico under the bm approach with the ml they also included temporal trends as covariates in the location parameter and used the likelihood ratio test to select the most appropriate model the likelihood test gave a negative shape parameter therefore the r w was well fitted on the extreme temperatures of the cities under study selvam 2014 suggested a universal inverse power law distribution for fractal fluctuations of temperature and rainfall for four stations in the uk vivekanandan 2018 compared the applicability of the g u f r l n 2 and l p i i i on the temperature extremes minimum and maximum of a station in india using the method of moments mom ml and the order statistics approach with the weibull plotting position the l p i i i with the ml was best suited for these extremes based on the ad and ks tests xu 2019 used the g e v distribution to model extreme temperature and wind in two locations in norway with the probability weighted moments pwm method the r w was ultimately fitted caissie et al 2020 commented on the advantage of the pot to describe air and water temperatures in magnitude duration and degree day accumulation when they applied it to a canadian case study 4 parameter estimation methods a parameter estimation method can be judged by its consistency bias and efficiency rice 2006 let θ n be an estimate of θ based on a sample of size n θ n is consistent if p θ n θ 0 0 as n thus a consistent estimator converges to the true parameter value as the sample size increases θ n is unbiased if the mean value of the estimation equals the parameter values that is e θ n θ finally an estimator is efficient if it has the lowest variance among all unbiased estimators parameter estimation methods thus can be evaluated in terms of bias variance or mse of the distribution parameters or the quantiles an unbiased quantile estimator though may lead to biased distribution parameter estimates and vice versa for example the quantiles and distribution parameters of l n or w have a nonlinear relationship pajari et al 2021 pajari et al 2021 propose the bin criterion makkonen et al 2013 to assess the quantile estimator s goodness of fit which considers the frequency interpretation of probability in this section we present parameter estimation methods that have been used for hydroclimatic extremes assessments and are included in comparative studies each method is shortly described along with the most important outcomes derived by the comparative studies analytical equations are not given the interested reader can consult the cited references since the focus is on their performance in real world applications the reviewed studies are summarized in table 1 which includes the references the variable s studied the sample length the location of the study area the distribution s tested the parameter estimation methods compared and the evaluation criteria used 4 1 method of moments mom the method of moments mom aims to match sample moments with the corresponding theoretical moments of the fitted distribution christopeit 1994 pearson 1902a b generally if a distribution has n parameters a system of n equations is formed and solved for the unknown parameters this is accomplished by equating the theoretical moments μ q or moment related quantities with the corresponding sample ones i e μ q μ q for q 1 2 n q is the moment order note that the theoretical moments are functions of the distribution s parameters for example we typically fit a two parameter distribution by equating the expressions of the theoretical mean and standard deviation with the corresponding sample ones i e μ μ σ σ a limitation of the method is that higher order moments may diverge in power type distributions depending on the tail heaviness specifically if the asymptotic behavior of the tail is pr x x x 1 γ then only moments for q γ exist the effects of such divergence can produce biased estimates also for moment orders lower but close to critical ones thus the applicability of mom depends on the considered distribution its tail and the order of moments used de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 note that the mom is simple to apply i e compared to the ml and ideal for computing initial estimates for parameter estimation methods such as the ml which is typically implemented numerically in some cases the mom offers comparable results to the ml e g it performed better for l n distributions with low skewness in terms of quantiles estimation rmse mean squared deviation and ratios thereof stedinger 1980 madsen et al 1997 compared mom ml and probability weighted moments pwm under pot and bm and suggested applying the mom with pot for positive evi corresponding to heavy tailed distributions for evis between 0 2 and 0 or evis lower than 0 2 and small samples the bm with mom is preferable they used monte carlo simulations the cunnane plotting position and the rmse ratio of the t year event for evaluation note that madsen et al 1997 use a different evi convention öztekin 2005 compared the performance of mom pwm ml the principle of maximum entropy pome and least squares ls with the g p distribution for the annual flood peaks of 50 rivers located in turkey scotland usa and canada they computed the average deviation the mean residual error mre the average relative percent error arpe and the coefficient of efficiency ce for quantiles using the cunnane plotting position the mom tended to provide high estimate values for the location parameter nevertheless it was superior followed by the ml holešovský et al 2016 recommended the mom with bootstrapping and found that it provides narrower confidence intervals compared to the ml and pwm approaches they used the χ 2 ks and ad test for evaluation along with visual inspection with histograms and q q plots murshed et al 2011 found that ml and lm were less sensitive and more precise than mom in fitting the b κ distribution when the parent df was unknown they tested the failure percentage of monte carlo simulations the relative bias rbias and rmse were used to test the discrepancy between empirical and modeled quantiles and the average scaled absolute error asae to evaluate the goodness of fit of the distribution lombardo et al 2014 suggest practitioners use higher order q 2 moments with caution when fitting distributions in geophysical time series rowinski et al 2002 noted that mom cannot be used for the l l and log gumbel l g u parameter estimation when they are applied to extreme hydrological data since the statistical moments exist for a very limited range of parameters finally vivekanandan 2017 found that mom was less accurate compared to ml when tested against rainfall data in india based on the ad and ks tests and using the weibull plotting position 4 2 probability weighted moments pwm and l moments lm the probability weighted moments pwm greenwood et al 1979 hosking et al 1985 sillitto 1951 are plotting position functions of observed data katz et al 2002 the method extracts information on both the magnitude and order of the sample values jing and rongfu 1988 the pwm are quite straightforward to compute and perform well for many distributions used in hydroclimatology in general pwm need analytical inverse df s to provide analytical solutions based on simulations the standard deviations of the pwm parameter estimators are comparable with those of ml for moderate g e v sample sizes n 50 100 and often significantly lower for small samples hosking et al 1985 they can perform very well for the g e v even if the sample size is not large and 0 e v i 0 5 castillo and hadi 1994 pwm for the g e v have no severe bias parameter or quantile and they compare favorably with ml hosking et al 1985 in general pwm exist for power type distributions with evi less than 1 for g p for example this method allows for the estimation of a wider range of tails compared to mom de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 although they are asymptotically inefficient compared to ml estimators for the g p they perform equally well for sizes of 100 or less furrer and naveau 2007 derived some properties of pwm for small g p samples pwm and mom have lower parameter and quantile bias and variance than the classical ml for small g p samples less than 500 hosking and wallis 1987 however the pwm and mom sometimes result in non feasible estimates dupuis 1996 for g u generated samples with sizes larger than 20 the pwm performed better in terms of bias for the location and scale parameters and the quantiles and efficiency compared to the biased and unbiased mom ml ls mode and interquartile range method mir and best linear combination of order statistics blocs raynal and salas 1986 the authors used the weibull plotting position and tested the mean bias mse variance and efficiency of the parameters and quantile estimators moharram et al 1993 compared the ml mom pwm and ls the latter appropriately adapted for the g p using monte carlo simulations and flood series of two rivers in the uk they used the cunnane plotting position and the rmse and bias for the evi and the quantiles for moderate and large sample sizes n 50 and positive negative according to the convention of moharram et al 1993 shape parameters the pwm was the superior method vivekanandan 2013 applied mom ml ls order statistics osa pome and pwm to two rainfall stations in india they used the se ks and rmse as evaluation criteria with the gringorten plotting position all methods were appropriate for fitting bm rainfall data with the pwm and ls performing slightly better curceac et al 2020 compared the performance of eight different g p parameter estimators with monte carlo analysis to model flood time series in the uk the ml the unbiased pwm the biased pwm the mom the penalized maximum likelihood estimator pml the hybrid likelihood moment estimator hlme zhang 2007 the pickands estimator and the maximum goodness of fit estimator mgf luceño 2006 they combined q q plots mse normalized rmse nrmse and the relative index of agreement willmott 1981 the unbiased pwm and biased pwm were the most unbiased and accurate in terms of parameter estimation being the least sensitive to sample size coles and dixon 1999 proposed a penalized maximum likelihood pml approach with e v i 1 which outperformed the pwm in terms of bias and mse for parameter and quantile estimations coles and dixon 1999 diebolt et al 2008 stressed that the method presents limitations for strongly heavy tailed distributions noting that the asymptotic properties of pwm cannot be derived for g e v shape parameter values higher than 0 5 the pwm may also have inflated sampling errors in samples with outliers for which case jing and rongfu 1988 have provided formulas engeland et al 2004 used the pwm and ml pml under the bm and the pot approaches on daily streamflow observations they noted that the pwm cannot incorporate non stationarities and therefore the ml and pml estimators can be more flexible the pwm along with mom and ml estimators had robust results for large threshold ranks but demonstrated inconsistency for small ranks aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 for short tailed distributions negative shape parameter the hybrid mom pwm method is recommended dupuis and tsao 1998 l moments lm are another popular method in hydroclimatology they have similar properties as pwm since they are defined as linear combinations of them hosking 1990 similar to pwm lm exist for heavy tailed distributions common in hydroclimatology and show low estimation bias for example lm present lower estimation bias and are less susceptible to sampling variability or outliers in extreme data compared to mom hosking 1990 the lm are more easily related to the distribution s shape and spread than pwm however the two methods lead to identical parameter estimates rasmussen 2001 hosking 1990 noted the benefits of standardized lm or l moment ratios over mom ratios in that the former are more robust in the presence of extreme values and do not have sample size related bounds l moment ratio diagrams have been suggested as a useful tool for discriminating between candidate distributions hosking 1990 hosking and wallis 1997 peel et al 2001 in the l moment ratio diagrams the sample l moment ratios are plotted as a scatterplot and compared with theoretical l moment ratio curves of candidate distributions the l skewness and l kurtosis are usually used to verify the type of the distribution law gubareva and gartsman 2010 hosking 1990 similar to pwm lm exist for power type distributions with evi less than 1 a generalization of the lm i e the lh moments wang 1997 can be used for estimating gp heavy tailed distributions de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 gubareva and gartsman 2010 provided algorithms for determining parameters by lm for some df s used in hydrology they also compared the lm with ml and the mom on three distributions widely used in hydrology the p i i i the g e v and the l n 3 the lm and the ml were superior with small parameter bias lm performed better than mom and ml in the study of bezak et al 2014 for the estimation of extreme floods in slovenia table 1 in particular the combination of lm with l p i i i provided the best estimation compared to the rest approaches and distributions based on several criteria focusing on the extreme quantiles vivekanandan 2015 analyzed flood discharges at two rivers in india and used mom and lm to determine the parameters of six probability distributions the g u estimated by lm was better suited for the studied locations based on various goodness of fit tests table 1 ul hassan et al 2019 studied the extreme flow of 5 stations in sweden and ranked each combination of distribution parameter estimation methods based on goodness of fit tests and accuracy measures table 1 for most sites the best fitted distributions were conducted with lm hu et al 2020 analyzed the flows in six hydrological regions in the united states using bm g e v l p i i i and pot g p and found that lm provides less uncertainty in flood frequency estimates than ml rowinski et al 2002 however claimed that lm are not sufficient in estimating the location scale and shape parameters of the l l and l g u distribution tails this limitation is because the estimates of the parameters from lm do not asymptotically converge to the statistical moments of l l and l g u samples as in the case of mom murshed et al 2011 used the mom the lm and the ml to estimate the parameters of the extreme flow and wave data in colorado the lm presented limitations for heavy tailed cases but the combination of lm with b κ distribution for small samples was precise in characterizing heavy tails bernardara et al 2008 used the pot approach with the hill and generalized hill estimators semiparametric and the ml and lm parametric all the estimators were consistent but for very high evi values lm systematically underestimated the shape parameter 4 3 generalized probability weighted moments gpwm rasmussen 2001 introduced the generalized probability weighted moments gpwm for the g p an extension of the pwm which does not impose integer and nonnegative restrictions on the exponents gpwm presented lower bias for all parameters for positive evis and small samples at the expense of computational simplicity compared to pwm and lm the mse in gwpm was reduced by 20 40 in most cases of practical interest i e for return periods of 50 and 100 years but not higher gpwm outperformed the mom in terms of mse ratio ashkar and mahdi 2003 examined the application of the gpwm and ml for the l l simulations showed that the gpwm had better performance lower rmse for parameter estimates only for very small sample sizes when estimating quantiles in asymmetrical distributions with this limitation and considering the restrictive conditions under which the gpwm performs better ashkar and mahdi 2003 recommended the use of the ml for the estimation of extreme quantiles of the l l 4 4 partial probability weighted moments ppwm wang 1990 introduced the partial probability weighted moments ppwm for the g e v parameter and quantile estimation ppwm censor some of the smaller observations in the left tail to estimate the upper quantiles of variables right tail the method tackles the undesirable effects of low outliers which frequently arise in semiarid and arid regions the author suggested using moderately high lower bound censoring thresholds for high quantile estimation moisello 2007 used ppwm and pwm to model peak discharge from 297 stations from one african and four european countries with bm they used the sample mean as a censoring threshold the ppwm quantile estimators had a smaller re for sample sizes larger than 50 for local analyses and performed equally well on a regional level monte carlo simulations showed that the re of the ppwm is higher than the classic pwm when estimating extreme quantiles with the g e v distribution with l n as the parent finally attention should be paid to the presence of outliers when applying the ppwm 4 5 generalized method of moments gmom in the generalized method of moments gmom hansen 1982 sargan 1959 1958 the number of moment conditions exceeds the number of the parameters under estimation an objective function is defined and minimized to estimate the parameters essentially it is the mom under a wider framework de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 the use of the gmom for estimating the evi of the g p is suggested for the range 0 e v i 0 4 de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 for heavy tailed light tailed distributions the gmom can weigh the large small observations more heavily for small g p samples it may be used as an alternative to the pwm for a restricted range of the shape parameter de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 the method has been tested for various distributions g g l p i i i g p by monte carlo simulations or real world flood data ashkar et al 1988 ashkar and bobée 1987 ashkar and ouarda 1996 bobee and ashkar 1988 ashkar and ouarda 1996 examined six versions of the gmom for fitting a modified version of the g p they found that the choice of the order of any two moments of g p to fit the distribution can lead to a reduction in the variance in comparison with the estimation by the mom which typically uses moments of order one and two 4 6 maximum likelihood estimation ml the maximum likelihood estimator fisher 1922 involves defining and maximizing a likelihood function so that the observed data are most probable under the assumed statistical model the estimates are the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function ml at least theoretically is the most prominent parametric estimation method due to its good theoretical properties unbiased consistent normally distributed and efficient for large samples ml can be safer to use in heavy tailed cases positive evi de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 although it was effective for light tailed samples b κ presenting low quantile and estimate errors murshed et al 2011 however ml estimators require numerical algorithms and can face convergence issues irrespectively of the sample size some studies argue that this is solely due to an incorrect choice of algorithms ashkar and nwentsa tatsambon 2007 de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 the hybrid likelihood moment estimator overcomes the limitations of the ml while keeping the desired properties zhang 2007 stedinger 1980 showed that the ml is better than mom for fitting l n 2 for samples larger than 25 in terms of quantile accuracy juárez and schucany 2004 found that ml is a desirable estimation procedure for g p due to its easy generalization to more complicated data structures convenient large sample properties and capability to incorporate trends covariates and multivariate extremes they tested the mse for the shape parameter and the frequency of convergence failure curceac et al 2020 demonstrated that ml was among the most unbiased and accurate estimators for flood samples in the uk although being negatively biased for small sample sizes and outperformed the rest of the estimators for large sample sizes ml was more accurate than mom when combined with g u f r l n 2 and l p i i i to model the extreme temperature data from an indian station vivekanandan 2017 the same distributions were used with mom ml and order statistics approach osa for the extreme value analysis of rainfall and temperature of an indian station vivekanandan 2018 the l p i i i with ml was the most suitable combination for all extreme variables öztekin 2005 provided suggestions for effective ml application proposing to use the golden section search kiefer and wolfowitz 1956 instead of the newton raphson process wallis 1685 to avoid convergence issues the ml though can provide absurd g e v shape parameter estimates for small samples martins and stedinger 2000 compared to pwm it does not perform well for small samples in terms of bias and rmse of estimated quantiles hosking et al 1985 madsen et al 1997 proposed using ml with pot for shape parameters lower than 0 2 but stressed that the ml is not ideal for small sample sizes instead they proposed the mom even for evis lower than 0 2 rowinski et al 2002 noted that the ml is not very sensitive to the upper tail shape but it provides asymptotic convergence beyond the domain of existence of the first two moments or lm ml provided a systematic overestimation of the shape parameter underestimation by lm for very high evi values due to its sensitivity to very large observations bernardara et al 2008 the poor performance of the ml is due to the noticeable positive skew of the estimator gubareva and gartsman 2010 found that the ml and lm is superior to the mom being consistent and with small parameter bias hosking and wallis 1987 showed that unless the g p sample size is 500 or more estimators derived by mom or the pwm are more reliable than the ml ashkar and tatsambon 2007 suggested the use of ml when the return period of the quantiles under estimation is smaller than the sample size finally ml demanded higher numerical effort than pwm for any probability distribution under assessment in haktanir and horlacher 1993 4 7 generalized or penalized maximum likelihood estimator gml pml the generalized or penalized maximum likelihood estimator gml or pml coles and dixon 1999 augments the maximum likelihood with a penalty function which may contain prior knowledge on the parameters or discourage undesirable estimates the penalty is full for evi larger than 1 no penalty is given for evi less than 0 and a continuous function is defined between 0 and 1 the penalty function is multiplied with the likelihood function and the pml estimator is obtained the approach resembles the bayesian inference see section 4 16 coles and dixon 1999 showed that the pml can outperform the pwm in small g p sample sizes keeping the good properties of the ml estimation for large samples they tested the pml performance by applying it to 58 uk sea level sets engeland et al 2004 noticed that for floods the difference between the estimators ml pml and pwm is minor contrary to droughts for which pwm is less sensitive to block size they also noted that the pml estimators along with the ml can incorporate non stationarities and therefore be more flexible than pwm curceac et al 2020 found the pml and ml to be among the most unbiased in terms of parameter estimation and accurate estimators although negatively biased for small sample sizes compared to the mom the pickands estimator and the maximum goodness of fit estimator mgf martins and stedinger 2001 2000 defined the generalized maximum likelihood gml following the reasoning of pml based on hydrologic experience they suggested a beta distribution b with an evi between 0 5 and 0 5 as a prior to restrict the estimated g e v shape parameter values to a physically reasonable range the gml applied for the g e v distribution is preferable to lm and mom estimators for flood like distributions which correspond to positive values of the tail index i e heavy tailed and particularly for shape parameters in the range of 0 to 0 4 martins and stedinger 2000 for e v i 0 another prior should be adopted martins and stedinger 2001 resolved the issue of possible adverse estimates of the g p shape parameter when using ml in small samples by adding another prior distribution on the shape parameter again for positive shape parameters the gml under both pot and bm performs better compared to mom and lm in terms of bias variance and rmse of the flood quantiles the estimator has also been widely used in studies of non stationary hydrologic and climate variables cannon 2010 el adlouni et al 2007 vasiliades et al 2015 xavier et al 2020 4 8 pickands estimator the pickands estimator pickands 1975 uses the excess above a threshold and the rank of the upper threshold k the estimator is shift and scale invariant since the estimator is a function of k it is quite volatile with large asymptotic variance pickands 1975 proved that the estimator is weakly consistent dekkers and haan 1989 showed consistency and asymptotical normality for all shape parameters expressing the tail many studies have aimed at improving the estimator since it is a linear combination of log spacings of order statistics segers 2005 the pickands estimator yielded large variability especially for small values of the upper threshold rank compared to other parametric estimators which were more consistent in the study of aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 4 9 two and three step estimators zhou 2008 proposed a two step estimator which resembles the ml as far as asymptotic behavior is concerned but is also explicitly given he used the pickands estimator for a first approximation of the evi other estimators can also be used i e the hill estimator for positive γ the second step involves performing an approximation to the likelihood function such that the difference between the two step estimator and the ml is approximately zero this approach has a small estimation error satisfies theoretical properties such as shift and scale invariance and is simple in application the result of the two step estimator can be considered as the first estimate to a three step estimator the latter is even more accurate zhou 2008 for the acquisition of the evi in the study of aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 the two and three step estimators exhibited similar performance with the ml these estimators and particularly the two step provided robust and consistent estimates and the approach was preferred over the semiparametric pickands and hill 4 10 hill estimator adapted hill estimator and moment estimator the hill estimator hill 1975 is the most commonly used technique for tail index estimation although it is restricted to e v i 0 the estimator is a result of the slope of the quantile plot it is based on the logarithms of the observed data therefore it is not shift invariant the estimator owes its wide use to the dominance of heavy tails in hydroclimatology the method is based on the concept of conditional ml moore and harter 1969 it has both weak and strong consistency and asymptotic normality assuming iid data as in the pickands estimator for high k values the variance of the parameter estimation increases and the bias increases for low values of k fedotenkov 2020 bernardara et al 2008 applied the ml and lm parametric estimators and the hill and generalized hill semiparametric estimators to a set of daily discharges from 173 stations in the rhone mediterranean region france although the hill estimator gave consistent results for the heavy tail it can be sensitive to shifts in the data thus inducing the hill horror plots a term used by resnick 1997 attention is needed with hill assumption based methods which utilize the asymptotic properties of the g p distribution not always applying under pre asymptotic conditions low values of the index in the range of 0 1 0 2 cause slow convergence of the log transformed g p quantiles to exponential ones therefore hill s estimations may lead to significant overestimation of g p shape parameters when applied to empirical finite length hydroclimatic records langousis et al 2016 dekkers et al 1989 presented an adaptation of hill s estimator which is consistent for e v i r called the moment estimator me the study of aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 showed that although the moment estimator along with pwm and ml estimators had robust results for large threshold ranks low variability the method demonstrated inconsistency for small ranks draisma et al 1999 presented a bootstrap based method to improve the evi for both moment and pickands estimators balancing parameter variance and bias components finally beirlant et al 1996 proposed the generalized quantile plot which is asymptotically linear and the slope of the plot corresponds to the evi assuming iid then they applied the hill estimator to the generalized quantile plot introducing the generalized hill estimator which is not restricted to heavy tails 4 11 least squares ls estimator the least square galton 1886 legendre 1805 estimator ls finds the parameter estimates which minimize the sum of squared deviations between the sample and the fitted order statistics usually the probability p m m n 1 the so called weibull plotting position is assigned to the ordered ranked values where m is the order and n is the sample size lloyd 1952 the method played a significant role in the work of gumbel gumbel 1958 the analysis with ls estimators has the longest history and various versions of the approach exist according to the plotting position apart from the weibull plotting position weibull 1939 others are also appropriate according to cunnane 1978 such as the gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 see also makkonen 2008 for a relevant review however many plotting positions have been optimized for specific probability distribution thus an optimal use would imply knowing the distribution a priori and this is rarely the case see also jordaan 2005 according to makkonen 2008 the choice of a proper fitting method has smaller uncertainty than the selection of the plotting position he states that only the weibull formula which provides the mean of the distribution of order ranked variables is an appropriate approach while the rest do not correspond to the true non exceedance probability see also makkonen and pajari 2014 when the data set is large the choice of plotting position has little effect on the results jordaan 2005 lloyd 1952 first formed the framework for obtaining linear unbiased estimators for location and scale parameters with ordered observations and least squares other studies which have dealt with linear combinations of order statistics are the ones of lieblein 1953 and downton 1966 among others see raynal and salas 1986 for more information several variations exist for the estimator like the ordinary ls ols legendre 1805 the weighted or generalized gls harris 1996 that adjusts the weight of each observation using the weighted arithmetic mean cotes 1768 alternating ls and partial ls wold 1982 in the comparative study of estimators by moharram et al 1993 the ls was generally better in terms of rmse followed by the mom in quantile estimation the ls method had also the best performance in terms of bias for negative positive according to the convention in the study of moharram et al 1993 shape parameter raynal and salas 1986 note that the ls and the mode interquartile range method should not be used for fitting the g u as they give the largest quantile biases öztekin 2005 provided some conditions which prevent the sensitivity of the ls method in the initial estimates of the location parameter 4 12 minimum density power divergence estimator mdpde the class of density power divergence was introduced by basu et al 1998 who designed the minimum density power divergence estimator mdpde the estimator has a single parameter α m d p d e which controls the interchange between robustness and efficiency when α m d p d e 0 the divergence is also known as the kullback leiber in this case the estimator has higher efficiency and less robustness against outliers while the opposite is true as α m d p d e increases τhe mdpde has been applied with various asymmetric models such as the g p juárez and schucany 2004 the f r kim and lee 2008 and the l n pak 2014 juárez and schucany 2004 compared the mdpde with ml dupuis optimally biased robust estimator obre and peng and welsh s medians estimator for the estimation of the shape and scale parameters of the g p distribution they applied them to the monthly rainfall of a station in mexico 1904 2003 the mdpde carries the good properties of ml which are the easy generalization the capability of incorporating trends covariates and multivariate extremes the asymptotic efficiency and normality and simplicity in producing ses it is also robust against gross errors making the approach more efficient for gross errors contaminated g p s for α m d p d e 0 2 the estimator maintains good asymptotic relative efficiencies above 90 however when the g p model is not contaminated the authors recommend the ml 4 13 dupuis optimally biased robust estimator obre hampel s optimally biased robust estimator obre hampel et al 1986 belongs to the class of m estimators which constitute a generalization of the ml huber 1964 the algorithm is convergent if the starting point is near the solution dupuis 1999 implemented obre to fit the g p on the exceedances over high thresholds of flow data at the river derwent uk obre along with mdpde was robust against gross errors in estimating the parameters of contaminated g p distributions however the authors observed a high rate of non convergence in the study of juárez and schucany 2004 obre and mdpde was more efficient than ml for the case of g p distributions contaminated with gross errors however the method has some convergence problems with short tail data the ml has higher efficiency for non contaminated g p models 4 14 peng and welsh s medians estimator peng and welsh 2001 derived their median estimator by equating the sample and population likelihood score medians an approach based on trimmed moments brazauskas et al 2009 the estimator is robust and asymptotically normal however it has shown high rates of non convergence and generally poor performance for extreme rainfall under all simulated models in the study of juárez and schucany 2004 4 15 principle of maximum entropy pome the shannon information entropy shannon 1948 quantifies the uncertainty of a random variable following a specific distribution jaynes 1982 formulated the principle of maximum entropy pome and mentioned that the minimally prejudiced assignment of probabilities is the one which maximizes the entropy subject to the given information the pome parameter estimation involves three steps i e the specification of constraints related to the data sample the derivation of the entropy function of the distribution which is maximized and the derivation of the relations between parameters and constraints singh 1998 the main parameter estimation method based on the concept of entropy is the ordinary entropy method a variant of the ordinary entropy method is the maximum entropy parameter space expansion both methods are analyzed in singh 1998 pome is considered an efficient parameter estimation method in the study of vivekanandan 2013 pome provides the smallest sampling variance compared to other approaches however in some cases it gives biased quantile estimates and often is not quite accurate as in the case of ml vivekanandan 2013 the ordinary entropy method was applied to wind extremes to successfully estimate the g e v parameters in the study of soukissian and tsalis 2015 giving the smallest values of evi bias and satisfactory mse and variance 4 16 bayesian inference bayesian markov chain monte carlo bmcmc the bayesian inference bayes and price 1763 requires a prior distribution on the parameters which represents prior knowledge or arbitrary distributions with a large variance if the former is not available through a likelihood function the prior information leads to a posterior distribution of the parameters the result of the method is a distribution and not a point estimate a summary statistic of the posterior distribution is used if a point estimate is needed coles et al 2003 markov chain monte carlo bmcmc methods are used to approximate a solution since integration over the parameter space is typically not possible coles 2001 hastings 1970 coles et al 2003 applied the bmcmc and the ml with the g u and g e v to analyze extreme daily rainfall from the tropical zone of the venezuelan north central coast 1961 1999 the bayesian analysis was preferred as it allowed for proper formalization of the uncertainty and modeling of seasonal heterogeneity reis and stedinger 2005 used the bmcmc for the evaluation of the posterior distributions in flood quantiles under the l n and l p i i i the bayesian inference approach has been used in flood frequency analysis with g e v seidou et al 2006 and extreme drought analysis with g e v and g p cindrić and pasarić 2018 haddad and rahman 2011 evaluated mom ml and bmcmc and found that the bmcmc gives the best parameter estimates for the l n in terms of smallest bias and se however bayesian methods can be very time consuming to implement and as noted by eugenia castellanos and cabras 2007 they can only be used for g p with e v i 0 5 4 17 elemental percentile method ep the elemental percentile ep method castillo and hadi 1995 equals the cumulative df evaluated at the ordered statistics of the observed data to the percentile values the resulting equations are used to obtain initial parameter estimates these are combined to give overall estimates which are substituted in the quantile function to obtain quantile estimates when assessing the parameters and quantiles of the g e v the ep estimators are well defined based on equations that involve only one variable and exist in cases where other classical estimators do not castillo and hadi 1995 the simulation results of castillo and hadi 1995 showed that ep was comparable to pwm for 0 5 evi 0 5 but it performed better outside this range castillo and hadi 1997 suggested that for the g p ml should be used if the sample size is large e g n 500 and evi is in the 0 5 0 5 range and pwm should be used if the sample size is small and evi is in the 0 5 0 range in every other case ep is the most suitable method based on the ses the asae and the biases of the parameter estimators ep was suggested for use under all cases when the ml has convergence issues since it exists for all evi values and has no convergence issues soukissian and tsalis 2015 examined several common and less known estimation methods for the g e v parameters under bm mom pwm lm ml the maximum product spacings method mps the quantile ls the ep and two methods based on the principle of maximum entropy the lesser known mps ep and ordinary entropy performed better in the description of extreme wind speed quantiles ashoori et al 2017 also used the g e v distribution and four parameter estimation methods i e ml pwm ep and quantile ls on precipitation data in iran and the ep performed almost as equally well as quantile ls based on quantile estimates comparison by the asae criterion 4 18 maximum product spacings mps method cheng and amin 1983 and ranneby 1984 first introduced the method of maximum product spacings mps for parameter estimation of continuous distributions the difference between the values of the cumulative df and the adjacent ordered points are called spacings the mps maximizes the logarithm of the geometric mean of these spacings mps estimators are solved numerically with nonlinear optimization methods the mps can be used as an alternative for the ml in cases where the latter fails to converge wong and li 2006 note that the mps method has been neglected in evt despite the restrictions of ml for small sample sizes the mps is stable in contrast to ml or even pwm 4 19 hybrid likelihood moment estimator hlme zhang 2007 presented the hybrid likelihood moment estimator hlme for the g p which merges likelihood and moment estimators these hybrid likelihood moment estimators always exist have high asymptotic efficiency are always feasible and are computationally simple mackay et al 2011 zhang 2007 demonstrated that the solution to their equations can be given by a newton raphson method within 4 6 iterations the hlme keeps the excellent properties of the ml without its limitations de zea bermudez and kotz 2010 in the study of curceac et al 2020 the hlme was one of the most efficient estimators in terms of parameter accuracy and bias except for the very short tails e v i 0 5 according to mackay et al 2011 the hlme for the g p has the best performance for small sample sizes of 200 or less low quantile bias and rmse for all evi values compared to mom gpwm ml ls and pml 4 20 variance weighted least squares vwls recently makkonen and tikanmäki 2019 developed a new parameter estimation method that combines minimization of the variance of order ranked observations v weibull plotting positions w and weighted least squares ls they called it the vwls method they used the g e v linking the weighing and the fitting to each other by solving their optimal selection iteratively they compared their method with ml pwm lm and lh moments wang 1997 by using monte carlo simulations and producing random data from g u f r and w type distributions representing environmental variables the bin criterion was used for evaluation pajari et al 2021 the vwls method predicted the highest and smallest value in the data set better the method does not require subjective methodological decisions by the user but the assumptions of iid and stationarity need to be held 5 non stationarity 5 1 non stationary approaches the methods described so far are implemented under the assumption of a stationary hydrological cycle however in light of the changes due to anthropogenic and climatic stressors which cause non stationary conditions the stationary assumption may not be viable coles 2001 salas et al 2018 yet nonstationarity should be used cautiously serinaldi and kilsby 2015 the use of traditional stationary methods for the description of non stationary processes may lead to poor design estimates meaning either expensive over designed or unsafe under designed infrastructure françois et al 2019 consequently new techniques and practices have been developed which perform under the framework of non stationarity salas et al 2018 provide an extensive review of such techniques therefore we will reduce this section to a brief reference to the basic parameter estimation techniques of non stationary extremes in hydroclimatology and the comparative studies performed for them the bm approach can be extended to model non stationary extremes assuming the same type of g e v distribution as in the stationary case and considering that the parameters vary with covariates i e time or explanatory variables which vary with time coles 2001 the non stationary df can be expressed as 6 f g e v x exp 1 γ t x α t β t 1 γ t where α t β t γ t location scale and shape parameters depending on time and 1 γ t β t x α t 0 various combinations exist regarding which parameters are functions of time and which are kept constant for example el adlouni et al 2007 have used both location and scale parameters as functions of covariates with a fixed shape parameter it is very rare for all three parameters to be functions of covariates coles 2001 likewise the pot approach can be extended to non stationary conditions smith 1989 the x p threshold the occurrence process i e the distribution of the number of exceedances and the exceedances can be considered as non stationary in many cases the threshold x p is modeled using quantile regression koenker 2005 roth et al 2014 roth et al 2012 in some studies both the occurrence and the g p parameters are considered non stationary parey et al 2007 a superposition of sinusoidal cycles may be used for the description of the seasonality in the occurrence process north 1980 prosdocimi et al 2015 compared the non stationary bm model with a point process characterization of threshold exceedances when the same covariates are considered for extreme hydrological data the point process approach was more effective than bm in identifying the effect of the urbanization levels increase on high flows wi et al 2016 found a great discrepancy between the estimates from pot and bm approaches under non stationarity agilan and umamahesh 2017 noted that pot estimated return levels under non stationarity are higher compared to bm estimated ones for short durations and small return periods while the opposite is true for long durations and high return periods other applications of non stationary pot models are the studies of razmi et al 2017 silva 2016 and silva et al 2014 5 2 parameter estimation methods for extremes under non stationarity and comparative studies maximum likelihood was introduced for the estimation of distribution parameters with covariates in davison and smith 1990 more recently the presence of time covariates in the flood frequency analysis is usually estimated by the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss rigby et al 2005 kochanek et al 2013 presented the hybrid two stage ts method which has a separate estimator of the time dependent mean and standard deviation based on which the shape parameter and quantiles are estimated in the first stage the weighted least squares wls estimate the mean and standard deviation which are time dependent to deal with the trend in the first two moments in the second stage after the distribution is chosen the shape parameter is estimated using the lm and the time dependent quantiles are determined demaria et al 2017 used a bayesian approach with monte carlo techniques on sub daily precipitation intensities they evaluated temporal trends and developed intensity duration frequency idf curves under both stationary and non stationary climatic conditions using both bm and pot ouarda and charron 2019 proposed an approach based on l moment ratio diagrams to estimate non stationarity in hydroclimatic extremes and identify relations between the extreme distribution shapes and the climate indices el adlouni et al 2007 developed the generalized maximum likelihood estimation gml method for the non stationary g e v model they compared the gml method to the ml method for the 1 stationary 2 non stationary with a linear dependence on covariates 3 non stationary with a quadratic dependence on covariates and 4 non stationary with linear dependence in both location and scale parameters cases the gml was superior to the ml based on the bias and rmse of the estimated quantiles el adlouni and ouarda 2008 proposed the generalization of the lm for the non stationary case of the g e v model the authors estimated that the lm is better than the ml in terms of bias and rmse of the estimated quantiles compared to the gml the lm gives equally good results especially for a weak skewness strupczewski et al 2016 utilized both ml and the two stage method ts their approach was applied to monte carlo mc simulation experiments assuming linear trends in the mean and standard deviation and to flow data of three polish rivers ts was superior in estimating the two first time dependent moments time invariant skewness and time dependent upper quantiles the estimates derived by the method were less sensitive to the choice of the probability distribution šraj et al 2016 examined two approaches under both stationary and non stationary frameworks i e the ml and the bayesian monte carlo markov chain bmcmc cheng et al 2014 they noted that the estimates given by ml can be unrealistic and this is the sole reason for preferring the bayesian approach over ml see also katz et al 2002 debele et al 2017 compared the application of three non stationary estimation methods on non stationary floods table 2 i e the ml the two stage method for wls with simultaneous assessment of trends in the mean and standard deviation wls ts and gamlss the gamlss was superior in terms of rbias and rmse in the estimates of the standard deviation trend and the constant shape parameter trend the wls ts was more accurate in the estimates of the mean value trend and was more appropriate for short non stationary time series chen et al 2017 compared the parametric weighted least squares wls estimation the non parametric discrete wavelet transform dwt and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd for the extreme precipitation analysis in taiwan all three methods were suitable for the identification of non stationarity and yielded similar trends although local variations in precipitation were magnified by dwt and eemd the authors suggest that a linear model is sufficient for the portrayal of time variance in the first or second moment and warn practitioners to carefully use parabolic trends which have rapid increases razmi et al 2017 observed no significant difference between ml and pml estimators applied on the maxima of a water level time series in manhattan under both pot and bm except for the case of pot under non stationarity they based their assessments only on visual inspection of the frequency analysis durocher et al 2019 compared the regression approach to the ml under pot and deduced that the former was less biased and more accurate in the parameter estimation for short time series with positive g p shape parameters i e heavy tailed distributions under non stationarity agilan et al 2021 stress that the threshold uncertainty increases under the non stationary condition and that it is higher for low probabilities 6 model selection tools the literature provides many goodness of fit gof tests or tools examining the suitability of theoretical distributions to describe extreme observations here we refer to comparative studies using gof tests to assess the fitting of distributions in hydroclimatic extremes the studies used monte carlo simulations to produce multiple samples from theoretical distributions and assessed the probabilities of correct selection based on gof tests the anderson darling test ad anderson and darling 1954 for extreme value distributions is powerful and easily applicable it is more sensitive and powerful than other commonly used gof tests especially for data with strong variations in the tail d agostino and stephens 1986 haddad and rahman 2011 claim that ad is more successful in identifying the parent distribution when it has three parameters compared to the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic however aic and bic are more suitable when the parent is a two parameter distribution the cramér von mises cvm family of tests is also popular because they are powerful and adaptable ashkar et al 2013 yet the ad test might perform better compared to the cvm in extreme value analysis because it weights more the tail observations and can detect outliers ashkar et al 2013 laio 2004 compared various tests and distributions commonly used in hydrology table 3 and suggested using probability plot tests when the hypothesized distribution is n or l n and ad in all other cases ashkar and aucoin 2012 reviewed the main tests used to discriminate between pairs of two parameter distributions used in hydrology with emphasis on the w and l l distributions they used the ratio of maximized likelihood rml the anderson darling ad the cramer von mises cvm the one sample kolmogorov smirnov ks1 the modified shapiro wilk msw the sample skewness coefficient and the sample l skewness monte carlo simulations coupled with ml parameter estimation indicated the rml the ad and msw as the most powerful tests with the latter performing well with small samples ashkar and ba 2017 tested various discrimination methods in fitting the three k a 3 and two parameter kappa k a 2 and g p distributions to flood pot datasets from 8 canadian stations among the ad the rml and a normality transformation followed by application of the sw statistic nt sw the latter was the most appropriate method for sample sizes usually encountered in hydrology recently krit et al 2019 compared and reviewed gof tests for the two parameter w and extreme value distributions they studied tests based on probability plots pp coles 1989 smith and bain 1976 shapiro wilk sw tests öztürk and korukoglu 1988 shapiro and brain 1987 tests based on the empirical distribution function including the kolmogorov smirnov statistics ks cramer von mises statistics cvm and anderson darling statistics ad chandra et al 1981 d agostino and stephens 1986 tests based on the normalized spacings ns lockhart et al 1986 mann et al 1973 tiku and singh 1981 generalized smooth tests gs rayner et al 2009 tests based on the kullback leibler information kl pérez rodríguez et al 2009 tests based on the laplace transform lt cabaña and quiroz 2005 likelihood based gof tests lb and combined gof tests krit et al 2016 the most widely used test weibull probability plot had the worst performance while the shapiro wilk type test of öztürk and korukoglu 1988 and the tiku singh test based on the normalized spacings performed the best 7 conclusions this review focused mainly on probability distributions used since the 1980s and parameter estimation methods used in analyses of hydroclimatic extremes a brief overview of non stationary approaches and model selection tools for extreme events was also provided the synthesis mainly resulted from the comparative studies cited the results of the studies differ depending on the distributions applied the case studies the temporal scales the sample sizes and the evaluation metrics although a unified framework for parameter estimation comparison and a global distribution for hydroclimatic extremes assessment do not exist synthesis of the results indicates peaks over threshold pot and block maxima bm prevail in the extreme flow analysis typically using the g p and g e v distributions respectively other distributions have also been used with these approaches l l l n l p i i i g l o p i i i b κ recently distributions not typically used in extremes such as b r i i i and b r x i i have been successfully applied for discharge extremes the g e v distribution is the most popular choice for extreme flow analysis with applications in many countries austria siberia far east switzerland italy ethiopia scotland england usa in many cases when g e v is applied to describe streamflow maxima it indicates an upper limit but according to many studies this contradicts the hydrological variables nature leading potentially to risk underestimation most studies indicate that heavy tailed distributions should describe streamflow extremes the g u for example has been shown to underestimate extremes in the usa and the mediterranean region topographical weather interactions such as landfalling tropical cyclones affect the tail heaviness significantly global studies on precipitation agree that precipitation extremes are better described by heavy tailed distributions including stretched exponential and power type apart from the typically used pot and bm with g p and g e v common distributions used for extreme daily rainfall are p i i i l p i i i l n 3 p i i l n w g g g as well as the b r x i i not typically used in extremes the l g l n and w distributions have been applied for hourly extreme precipitation semiparametric distributions for the entire range of rainfall amount have also been proposed based on the extended g p distribution family the gaussian distribution potentially underestimates extreme temperature events and during the last years there is a shift towards distributions with longer tails the method of moments mom although a popular choice in parameter estimation for extreme value distributions is outperformed by other methods most recent studies use the l moments lm method to estimate the parameters of the g e v distribution since lm is not sensitive to outliers and provides good estimates for small sample sizes the lesser known estimators maximum product of spacings mps elemental percentile ep minimum density power divergence estimator mdpde and the new vwls method showed promising results in comparative studies these estimators have attractive features and fewer limitations compared to popular methods more research and applications are needed to fully assess their performance in extreme value analyses other satisfactory less common estimators were the hybrid likelihood moment estimator hlme partial probability weighted moments ppwm penalized maximum likelihood pml 2 and 3 step estimators bayesian markov chain monte carlo bmcmc the classic anderson darling test is one of the top choices to assess goodness of fit or model selection the shapiro wilk test simple or modified or used in combination with a normality transformation is among the best when applied for the w e v 1 l l g p and k a 2 distributions non stationary extreme value distributions have become widely applicable mainly over the last 10 years to account for observed hydroclimatic changes typically attributed to global warming many methods have been developed to fit non stationary extreme value distribution a limited number of studies show that the generalized maximum likelihood gml the weighted least squares wls and the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss are outperforming the more standard non stationary ml

3782,this study presents the impacts of glacial loading and unloading on the hydraulic conductivity k of bedrock aquifers using private residential wells the scopes of this research were to i compare the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock aquifers under glaciated and unglaciated regions ii correlate the aquifer parameters thickness and depth with a k of the aquifer and iii study the variations in k of the sandstone aquifers due to cyclic loading and unloading of glaciers it was hypothesized that glaciated regions would have greater k than unglaciated regions and thus would correlate with larger aquifer yield to test this hypothesis data were collected from 14 counties in northeastern ohio that consist of well location well construction details well production test and rudimentary lithological descriptions these results suggested that glacial loading and unloading had created new fractures and reactivated the older fractures in the bedrock aquifers more so for glaciated regions than those in unglaciated regions because of that the glaciated sandstone aquifers had a larger yield than the unglaciated sandstone aquifers furthermore the sandstone aquifers in the northern counties had generally greater mean k than those in the southern counties the frequency distribution curves of k of the aquifer in the glaciated regions were considerably tighter and shifted right compared to the unglaciated regions understanding the variations in k of the aquifer provides important insight into sustainable development management of water resources in the glaciated landscape keywords hydraulic conductivity stress released fractures glaciation residential wells statistical analysis global warming 1 introduction the occurrence and rate of groundwater movement depend on aquifer parameters such as storativity s and transmissivity t determining such parameters of aquifers is crucial for the sustainable development management of water resources to regulate pumping rates in connection to recharge rates however predicting the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties in heterogeneous sedimentary bedrock especially when fractured remains a challenge long 1996 hydraulic conductivity k of fractured bedrock aquifers is related to fracture characteristics like fracture aperture and frequency fracture length fracture orientation angle fracture interconnectivity infilling materials and fracture plane features hamm et al 2007 the lineament analysis has been used in fractured bedrock aquifers to establish high yield water wells during groundwater investigation lineaments exhibit a positive correlation with springs and stream locations in mineral and grant counties west virginia usa rega 2011 lin et al 2013 demonstrate the delineation of groundwater body using three combined geophysical methods to identify high yield well locations however detecting fractured zones and defining hydrogeologic characteristics in bedrock aquifers are complicated when the bedrock has been covered with glacial drifts the efficacy of advanced geophysical techniques decreases sharply in urban areas surrounded by residences and facilities with fences sewers cables as well as water gas and electric lines tectonic forces unloading and weathering can influence the porosity and permeability of an aquifer thereby changing aquifer parameters such as k and s lachassagne et al 2011 maharjan and eckstein 2013 an increase in thickness of overburden decreases fracture permeability of the aquifer davison et al 1983 however the relationship between external stress and aquifer characteristic is complex and affected by rock type engelder 1993 fracture orientation gale 1982 and regional tectonics history milnes et al 1998 engelder 1993 evan 1994 the formation of fracture is a structural process through the activation growth and coalescence of a system of microcracks in a rock mass depending upon increasing levels of compressive stress fractures in rock masses would respond to initially sliding deformation followed by fracture propagation and fractures coalesce shen 1993 rock may burst for hard rocks under unloading conditions especially with increasing axial stress and decreasing confining pressure li et al 2017 a stress strain curve of rock masses is non linear during loading and shows hysteresis during unloading the fractures may result from i development of micro extension of cracks under loading and ii volumetric expansion of rock masses under unloading confining pressure li et al 2017 besides natural processes human activities such as heavy withdrawal and artificial recharge could impact hydrogeological environment of bedrock such actions are analogous to unloading and loading respectively wu et at 2019 and wu et al 2021 showed heavy pumping of groundwater leading to land subsidence while artificial recharge preventing settlement but heaving soil inside a deep pit zeng et al 2019a zeng et al 2019b continental ice sheets have advanced and retreated eight times during pleistocene ice age 1 6 and 0 01 million years ray 1992 although multiple glacial events were known to exist the impact of early glaciers was difficult to characterize because of deeply weathered glacial deposits or overlapped by the recent glacial deposits hansen 2020 at their greatest extent the glaciers and ice sheets were up to 2 km thick that covered most of canada and much of the upper midwest of the us paterson 1972 glacial formation in the higher latitude of north america flowed its way down towards the lower latitudes towards the modern day united states hansen 2020 the ice sheets were thick in the upper latitudes and thin towards the lower latitudes except along the buried valleys powers 2004 the ice sheets flow outward in response to the gravity thus forming a new area that had thinner ice than the accumulation zone ray 1992 gramiger s model 2017 showed the mechanical stress generated by glacial loading and unloading producing limited new fractures in bedrock that is proportionate to the thickness of the ice another model that incorporated changes in hydraulic pressure due to a fluctuating water table in addition to mechanical stress showed a substantial number of new fractures during late pleistocene and holocene glacial cycles in an alpine valley gramiger et al 2020 glacial history had a considerable impact on the evolution of the current stress regime in bedrock especially the shallow bedrock because glacial loading and unloading changes horizontal and vertical stresses in the bedrock at the interior and edge of the ice sheet subsequently creating a new fracture system or reactivating an old fracture system asmis and lee 1984 the evidence from present day great lake basin tilting indicates that the relaxation of the glacial depression is continuing in the great lakes region after 12 000 years since the last glacial unloading bowbly 1984 stress redistribution in the surficial rocks could persist for the next 1000 years due to deglaciation at the present climatic conditions baroni et al 2014 glacial loading and unloading could affect the bedrock aquifer considerably and develop secondary porosity due to changes in principal stresses in connection with glacial loading and unloading since the last glaciation this bedrock had experienced remarkably less stresses on them that would allow secondary porosity to increase thereby increasing the overall k of the aquifers thus it was hypothesized that glaciated regions would have greater k than unglaciated regions furthermore within the glaciated regions the northern counties have larger k than the southern counties as the glaciers flowed from north to south indicating that the northern territories have thicker glaciers than the south such findings are important to anyone interested in withdrawing a high volume of groundwater on a regular basis such as water supply managers farmers industries etc besides such results could provide insights into how bedrock would respond to the change in stress conditions due to melting of ice due to global warming that could potentially have larger implications to slope stability after the ice has melted to the authors knowledge no one has presented the impacts of glacial loading and unloading on the k of bedrock aquifers using private residential wells the objectives of this study were to i compare k of the aquifer under glaciated and non glaciated regions ii correlate the aquifer parameters thickness and depth with k of the aquifer and iii study the variations in the values of aquifer parameters due to cyclic loading and unloading of glaciation 1 1 study area the study area lies in northeast ohio consisting of 14 counties in allegheny plateau physiographic province fig 1 the thick black line in the middle of the study area is the maximum glacial extent north of the line is glaciated regions while south of the line is unglaciated regions it is important to note that six of 14 counties were completely glaciated four were partially glaciated and the rest were never glaciated the glaciated regions have smoother topography due to pleistocene glaciation that blanketed the area with surficial sediments while the unglaciated regions are highly dissected due to successive erosion the thickness of surficial deposits in the glaciated regions ranges from less than a meter to over 46 m foos et al 2003 the glacial boundary in the study area is farther north than the other areas in the state of ohio because the erosion resistant bedrock sharon sandstone impeded southward glacial advances powers 2004 multiple lobes of ice sheets moved south from the north in the state of ohio miami and scioto lobes reached further south in comparison to killbuck and grand river lobes fig 2 bedrock units in the study area dip toward the southeast resulting in progressively younger toward the southeast and have ages ranging from mississippian to pennsylvanian the sharon sandstone is the uppermost bedrock unit in the northwestern counties while it underlies the younger bedrock in southeastern counties the bedrock of the study area comprises mississippian and pennsylvanian rocks divided into multiple formations fig 3 fig 3 also shows the gamma ray log whose intensity increases to the right reflecting the amount of fines content in those formations cuyahoga formation consists of a series of muddy to silty members with sand and conglomerate hyde 1953 logan formation is mississippian in age and consists of reddish brown fine grained sandstones interbedded with siltstones and shales totaling about 85 m szmuc 1970 pottsville group consists of sandstone and conglomerate while allegheny group comprises multiple cyclothems ninke and evans 2002 conemaugh group has an intermediate allocycle of a 90 m thick sequence donaldson and eble 1991 berea sandstone formation is very deep in this region hence no well was drilled into the formation among all the bedrock sharon sandstone caps the highlands of the preglacial topography because of its high resistance to erosion rice et al 1992 the sharon sandstone is pennsylvanian in age a member of the pottsville group and it uncomfortably overlies the mississippian cuyahoga formation with paleotopographic relief of up to 80 m coogan et al 1974 it is loosely cemented coarse grained and gray to tan in color often found with conglomerate zones the upper contact of the sharon formation is planar consisting of crossbeds while the lower contact is erosional consisting of cut and fill structures creating highly variable thickness wells et al 1993 ninke and evans 2002 sharon formation is a reliable aquifer to the residents in the regions that has an average thickness of 15 m and has a high yield that ranges from 27 to 545 m3 day angle 1990 joints and fractures are common in the aquifer that has been related to tectonics stresses as well as pre and post glacial stresses foos et al 2003 sharon aquifer is the most productive unit of the pottsville group that supplies 38 of the groundwater to many residents industries and agriculture in northeast ohio sedam 1973 several rounded isolated knobs and uplands of sharon sandstone separated from other bedrocks which have been infilled with glacial drift sharon aquifer remains bounded by impermeable cuyahoga formation below and glacial till above in northeast ohio a conceptual diagram fig 4 of lithospheric responses due to glacial loading and unloading was adopted from shaw et al 2012 this model considers the glacially induced stress that build up the flexural stress such that the ice sheet induces flexural compression under the thick ice sheet and tension on the fore bulge outside the ice sheet the stress conditions are reversed at the near surface as the ice melts away while shaw et al s model is static we can imagine that the surficial rock would be under dynamic stress conditions as the ice sheet advances and retreats rock would go under compression with glacial loading while the same rock would go from compression to tension as unloading begins such dynamic stress conditions would create new fractures and reactivate older fractures that increase well yield allowing water to flow preferentially through those fractures 2 methods we collected data for more than 26 000 residential water wells tapped only into sandstone aquifers within 14 counties from the division of soil and water resources of the ohio department of natural resources odnr we used the custom data search option to filter the database a combination of search options such as well log type county names and aquifer type were used to obtain the wells of interest the reported number of data was not a complete list of wells registered in the odnr but only were the ones with complete information required for the analysis any incomplete data were avoided table 1 shows the area of the counties and the number of wells per square km for each county in the study area it was important to notify readers that these wells are developed into sandstone aquifers at different depths which are not equally productive it also means that the k of these sandstone aquifers could vary within the range listed in table 2 it was assumed that most wells were developed into the sharon sandstone because it is a highly productive aquifer and caps the top of the hills sharon aquifer remains bounded by low permeable cuyahoga formation below and glacial till above in most parts of the glaciated regions of the study area except for some portions of the northwestern counties fig 1 odnr requires well owners to run pumping tests before the operation of residential water wells and the results were recorded into well logs and drilling reports such reports contain well location well construction details well production test data aquifer thickness and rudimentary lithological description fig a1 the production test of residential water wells consists of static water level pumping rate pumping time duration and drawdown at the end of pumping the drawdown record was made at the end of the production test within the residential well at r rw rw is the nominal well radius these data were used to calculate hydraulic conductivities of sandstone aquifers at different depths using cooper and jacob 1946 approximation to theis 1935 method this approximation yields an insignificant error in the estimation of the k as the radius of residential wells being smaller than 0 0762 m renders the value of a well function very small 1 q h

pumping t is the aquifer transmissivity s is the aquifer storativity according to walton 1970 assumptions inherent in equation 1 are water flows into the wells through the complete thickness of the aquifer negligible well loss the completed wells have an equal radius of drilling generally water wells were cased only to the top of the formation leaving the entire thickness of sandstone aquifers uncased in this region however it was not strictly checked for each individual well hence it is noteworthy to mention that partially screened wells could have different k than the estimated value using equation 1 these wells were tested at a relatively low rate at q 100 m3 day for a short period usually t two hours generating relatively small drawdowns if a well screen represents the entire aquifer thickness then well loss could be considered negligible rorabaugh 1953 bennett and patten 1960 mace et al 1999 recently established that turbulent well loss in wells with pumping rates of approximately less than 3 270 m3 day can be ignored and the nominal radius of wells could be an effective radius equation 1 contains two unknown aquifer parameters i t and ii s which are constants for an aquifer the storage coefficient ranges from 0 0001 to 0 001 for a leaky aquifer the value of s depends strongly on the degree of confinement meaning that the value of t may be computed assuming the value of s based on aquifer conditions in this study an estimate of s of 0 001 was used large errors in estimating the s value would cause noticeable errors in the resulting value of t however an error of two orders of magnitude in the estimated s value would yield roughly 10 to 20 error in the resulting t value walton 1970 once the value of s was estimated the t value was computed iteratively in excel using a solver to convergence later it was divided by the thickness of the aquifer yielding k for the aquifer in the immediate surroundings of the well statistical analysis of k of the sandstone aquifer was conducted in excel i to estimate central tendency and despersion of k for different counties ii to run t test and f test using the data analysis package and iii to calculate correlation coefficient of k of the aquifers with other well parameters 3 results the average pumping rate for the 14 counties was about 100 m3 day the maximum pumping rate was 5450 m3 day for only two wells and the second to the maximum rate was 2725 m3 day the average pumping duration for the wells was approximately 2 hours while the maximum pumping duration was 112 hours however approximately 12 of the total wells that were sampled for this study had more than 2 hours of pumping duration and only 4 of wells had more than 4 hours of pumping duration table 3 summarizes the statistical analysis a measure of the central tendency dispersion shape of the data distribution around central tendency of the k of the sandstone aquifers within the study area the table also covers analysis for the glaciated and unglaciated regions separated by the maximum glacial extent within the study area the results clearly showed that the glaciated counties had more wells per square area tapped into sandstone aquifers than that in the unglaciated counties not only the number of wells but also the statistic of the two groups were different for instance the completely unglaciated counties jefferson harrison carroll and tuscarawas had a mean k value less than 6 00 generally the mean k values for the partially glaciated counties were larger than the unglaciated counties and were the highest for the glaciated counties the glaciated counties had standard deviations less than 1 while the rest had standard deviations greater than one similarly the glaciated counties had positive kurtosis values and the rest had negative except for carroll county fig 5 displays frequency distribution curves of calculated k of the sandstone aquifers that overlay histograms for glaciated and unglaciated regions the x axis represents the log transformed k of the sandstone aquifers in meters per second the y axis represents the number of wells the vertical line green and blue represents the mean k of the sandstone aquifers frequency distribution curves were assigned the same starting and ending k values to make comparison easy among other figures the glaciated region consisted of 20 683 data points while the unglaciated region had 5679 data points comparatively the glaciated regions have approximately twice more wells per square area than the unglaciated regions the mean k for the glaciated region green vertical line was significantly larger than that of the unglaciated region blue vertical line the glaciated area had lower skewness lower standard deviation and a narrow range of k for the sandstone aquifers than the unglaciated region the frequency distribution curve for the glaciated region showed a noticeable shift towards the right in comparison to the unglaciated region the t test table 4 determines whether two means are significantly different from their population means assuming that the two samples have unequal variances table 3 t tests were separately conducted for glaciated and unglaciated regions within the study area and holmes county the t calculated values were greater than the t critical values for both tests this result verified that the average k values for the sandstone aquifers within the glaciated regions were significantly greater than that for those unglaciated regions fig 6 depicts the frequency distribution curves of k of the sandstone aquifers for each county within the study area that were arranged geographically as observed in the field x axes represent log transformed k values ranging from 10 to 0 and y axes represent frequency the frequency assigned to the figures on the far left column applied only to the figures on the same rows the frequency of wells increased moving from southern to northern counties strictly under allegheny and pottsville group the frequency distribution curves for the unglaciated counties were wider than that for those glaciated counties the mean k of the sandstone aquifers expressed in green blue red and cyan colors increased from south to north in general except for summit and mahoning county most of the frequency distribution curves were positively skewed except for medina trumbull and coshocton counties with maximum skewness of 0 66 for tuscarawas county the maximum glacial extent line passes through the middle of holmes county and separates it into roughly two regions glaciated in the north of the line and unglaciated in the south because of this reason a frequency distribution of the k for the county showed a bimodal distribution meaning two peaks fig 7 frequency distribution curves displayed a nature of data characteristics for holmes county as a whole and its glaciated and unglaciated regions although the sampled wells in the glaciated and unglaciated regions were not geographically far from each other their mean k of the sandstone aquifer was significantly different from one another the glaciated region had the highest mean followed by county and then the unglaciated region the frequency distribution curve for the glaciated region showed a noticeable shift towards the right in comparison to the unglaciated region following the same trend as for the glaciated and unglaciated regions within the study area the f test table 5 looks at the variance between glaciated and unglaciated regions within holmes county and all counties the f calculated for glaciated and unglaciated regions within the study area was larger than f critical value which inferred that the variances were statistically different from their population variances that was confirmed by a very low probability and such difference was not due to random chance however the f calculated for glaciated and unglaciated regions within holmes county was less than its f critical value indicating that the two variances were not statistically different from their population variances the kriging map displays the distribution of k values of sandstone aquifers within the study area fig 8 although the k of the aquifers ranges from 9 11 to 1 50 m s on a log scale the kriging process truncated outliers and displayed its range from 6 75 to 3 98 m s on a log scale nevertheless the distribution of k in the glaciated region is significantly more than in the unglaciated region not only that the maximum glacial extent line roughly separated two regions the north of the line was mostly red representing larger k and the south of the line was mostly blue indicating lower k it is also evident that the distribution of k was clustered on both sides of the maximum glacial extent the k of the unglaciated aquifers in the east was different from the west tuscarawas county had clusters of high k values in the center of the county while its surrounding area contained lower k values fig 9 shows the distribution of total well depths left and aquifer thickness right of the sandstone aquifers within the study area the depth of wells would be shallower where the bedrock is close to the surface and the aquifer is thin the results show the total depth of wells was the highest nearby the maximum glaciated extent and the sandstone aquifer was thicker along the line besides those locations both well depth and aquifer thickness were relatively greater in tuscarawas county both well depth and aquifer thickness showed a similar distribution of data and had a correlation coefficient of 0 88 between them well depth and aquifer thickness data spread above and beyond the displayed values in fig 9 that were truncated while kriging table 6 shows the correlation coefficient between k of the sandstone aquifer and well parameters such as well depth depth to the aquifer dem elevation bedrock elevation and aquifer thickness k decreased with an increase in total well depth elevations of the ground surface as well as bedrock and aquifer thickness although those parameters had a negative correlation with the k of the sandstone aquifer only aquifer thickness and total well depth had a relatively stronger correlation with the k depth to aquifer had a positive but weaker correlation coefficient with k of the sandstone aquifer depth to the aquifer refers to an overburden to the aquifer which also includes glacial drift in the glaciated regions of the study area 4 discussion 4 1 comparing results from previous studies with this study the k of sandstone in general ranges from 3 00 10 10 m s 9 5 to 6 00 10 6 m s 5 22 schwartz and domenico 1973 the results showed that the average k for sandstone aquifers ranges from 6 13 to 5 01 m s which is greater than that of the average sandstone this indicates that the bedrock aquifers had developed secondary porosity which could have been linked to external stresses such as glacial loading and unloading that is capable of creating new fractures gramiger et al 2017 gramiger et al 2020 shen 1993 studies have shown a decrease in k with an increase in vertical effective stress in a granular aquifer due to decreasing in pore sizes bredehoeft et al 1983 grant 1996 however glacial unloading would decrease the vertical stress creating stress released fractures in a granular aquifer stanley 1973 li et al 2017 hence the inference was made that the increase in k could have been linked to glacier advances and retreats during the last ice age although the results show a connection between the cyclic loading and unloading of glaciers to the k of the aquifers in these regions other unaccounted factors such as heterogeneity in the grain size of the aquifers and erosion of the bedrock before the glaciation cannot be ignored to account for such factors and further consolidate the findings of this study requires numerical modeling foos et al 2003 studied sharon sandstone at geauga medina portage summit and wayne counties the author found that the sandstone had a similar average k and degree of variability in those counties and concluded that there was no geographic control on the k it is worth noting that those counties are in proximity to each other and completely glaciated when data were analyzed for both glaciated and unglaciated regions noticeably greater average k and lower variance were observed in the glaciated region compared to the unglaciated region fig 5 this finding suggested that the glacial loading and unloading had a considerable impact on the bedrock aquifers in the region more so to the glaciated than the unglaciated regions the data were further divided into county level and similar analysis was done which suggested that the intensity of the glacial impact decreased towards the south which aligned with the glacier movements from north to south direction in the study area fig 1 these findings contradict foos et al s 2003 conclusion that the sandstone aquifers have a similar characteristic regardless of geographical locations this region had gone through tectonic activities in the past and most recently glaciations and inter glaciations events hansen 2020 prior studies indicated the tectonic and stress release fractures were responsible for heterogeneity in the sharon sandstone aquifer kammer 1982 richards 1981 sedam 1973 stanley 1973 it was assumed that fractures created due to tectonic activities alone would be homogeneous in the study area regardless of glaciated or unglaciated status generally the mean k values were larger for the partially glaciated counties than the unglaciated counties and were the highest for the glaciated counties fig 6 this result was an indication of differential stress conditions in glaciated vs unglaciated regions the idea that the glaciers had larger impacts on the glaciated regions than the unglaciated regions was supported by the fact that the glaciated regions had small standard deviations while the unglaciated regions had large standard deviations table 3 this finding means that the aquifers in the glaciated regions had a narrow range of k than those in the unglaciated regions the narrow range was possible only when preexisting fractures created by tectonic activities were reactivated by the loading and unloading of glaciation reactivation of preexisting fractures in the glaciated regions thus allowed water to flow into the well easily and quickly compared to the unglaciated regions where such reactivation did not happen to the same intensity as in the glaciated regions the frequency distribution curves show positive skewness except for three counties which suggests the glaical loading and unloading had improved well yield that resulted in due to the creation of new fractures and reactivation of older fractures williams 1983 compared the t of sandstone aquifer to its thickness well depth and depth of aquifer in two townships within summit county and found no relationships among the parameters in this study we compared k the ratio of t to the thickness of aquifer instead of t of the sandstone aquifer to the same parameters and found a mild correlation r 0 42 0 72 to both well depth and aquifer thickness and a weak correlation r 0 10 0 27 to the depth to the aquifer table 6 aquifers with equal t could have different k values depending on their thickness lower the thickness higher the k the depth to the aquifer had the least correlation coefficient to k because these aquifers were not uniform not always underlain by glacial drift alone in the case of deeper aquifers other bedrocks and glacial drift overlie these aquifers furthermore k had an inverse relationship with well depth and aquifer thickness table 6 wells are often developed near the bottom of the aquifer and become deep when the aquifer is at a greater depth or is thick hence the depth and thickness of the aquifer are connected besides the k could differ spatially depending upon the level of connectivity of existing fractures the existence of thicker aquifers along the maximum glacial extent supports the fact that sharon sandstone not only resisted erosion but also impede glacial movement during the last glaciation which in turn yielded lower k along the line 4 2 present study kurtosis is a measure of the combined sizes of the two tails of frequency distribution curves the glaciated regions had higher peaks and lighter tails than the normal distribution curve while the unglaciated regions had the opposite this result suggested the unglaciated regions had more extreme values on their tails and consisted of more outliers table 3 this result indicated that the k in the glaciated regions was more concentrated to the central value which physically means that the glaciers exerted vertical stress on the bedrock aquifer creating new fractures and reactivating old fractures in the regions whereas the glaciers had less impact on the unglaciated regions thus the old fractures were not reactivated equally as in the glaciated regions that left the lower spectrum of k of the aquifer holmes county had about 54 of the total sampled wells within the county in the glaciated region and the rest in the unglaciated region the average k for the glaciated region was one order magnitude larger than the maximum k value assigned to sandstone aquifers whereas it was one half order magnitude less for the unglaciated regions fig 7 although the average k for the glaciated and unglaciated regions was significantly different both values suggested that the glaciated and the unglaciated regions had developed secondary porosity but the intensity was much greater in the glaciated region than that in the unglaciated region this finding supported the idea that glacial loading and unloading could create new fractures under and around the thick ice sheets fig 4 the unglaciated region had a lower variance compared to the glaciated and overall holmes county however the variance was not significantly different between glaciated and unglaciated regions table 5 this result suggests that the glacial loading and unloading had affected both regions however the glaciated regions were impacted more compared to the unglaciated regions within the county the overall county had a larger spread in its dataset as it consisted of extreme low and high values from both unglaciated and glaciated regions respectively spatial autocorrelation evaluates whether the pattern expressed is clustered dispersed or random spatial autocorrelation of the k of the bedrock aquifers in glaciated and unglaciated was separately calculated in arcgis using global moran s i table 7 the result shows that the spatial distribution of k values for both regions was clustered the likelihood that the clustered pattern of k could be the result of randomness is 0 the threshold distance was 3 93 km for unglaciated while it was 4 40 km for glaciated regions apparently unglaciated regions had a better spatial correlation than the glaciated regions rizzo 1993 suggested that the clustering in k of the sandstone aquifers could be a function of the diverse depositional environment 4 3 future implications the primary usages of groundwater are for residence agriculture and industry in the state of ohio angle et al 2003 groundwater recharge rates were calculated throughout the state of ohio which were greater than the general sandstone aquifer pettyjohn and henning 1979 the larger replenishment rates allow wells to have a continuum and consistent yield at a constant withdrawal rate greater recharge rates result in a rapid replenishment of groundwater made possible by interconnected fracture networks as discussed earlier the presence of such a network is likely in the state of ohio due to the cyclic loading and unloading of glaciations that changed the stress regime prior studies suggested that higher k could be linked to the change in stress regime freeze and cherry 1979 kammer 1982 glaciation not only changed the stress regime in the region but also deposited thick glacial till that could inversely impact well yield as glacial till would impede vertical infiltration of water into aquifers furthermore well yield depends on the preglacial topography such that wells near the buried valley would have larger k than one that is far from the valley stanely 1973 angle 1990 finding appropriate well locations would be important to manage groundwater supply and have a sustainable well yield for the economic growth of the region 5 conclusion ice sheet spread outward radially under its weight from northern canada to the usa ice sheets were thicker in the upper latitudes and thinner in the lower latitudes the glaciated regions have distinct different aquifer responses than the unglaciated regions the glaciated regions have a recognizably greater number of wells per square area higher mean lower standard deviation and larger peaks at the center of the frequency distribution curve than the unglaciated regions furthermore the mean k of both glaciated and unglaciated regions was larger than the average k of sandstone the culmination of these findings inferred to the change in vertical stresses linked to the cyclic glacial loading and unloading of glaciers in the ice age it suggests that such change in stress regime to the aquifers have perhaps created new fractures and reactivated old fractures linked to the pre glaciation events this study sheds light on the potential application of private residential wells in revealing aquifer responses to historic stress changes accurate estimates of aquifer parameters and their spatial variations would lead to better resource management sustainable development of water and geotechnical engineering applications aquifer yield correlated with aquifer thickness and total well depth however the geomorphology of the study area could have a larger impact on the well yield for instance a residential water well drilled close to the buried valley would have a noticeably larger yield than wells at the same depth but far from such features this study infers that sandstone aquifers in other counties would have a larger yield that had undergone similar glacial history mountainous and polar regions are experiencing a higher rate of melting ice due to changing climate thus releasing vertical stress from the underlying bedrock the glacier retreat being the catalyst for an increase in secondary porosity should not be limited to this study but it should be of greater interest for other regions where similar geological history prevailed and even for regions that are experiencing changes in stress due to glacier melt it would be interesting to see how climate change would influence aquifer parameters at high latitudes and high altitudes as stress regime changes credit authorship contribution statement madan maharjan conceptualization

3782,this study presents the impacts of glacial loading and unloading on the hydraulic conductivity k of bedrock aquifers using private residential wells the scopes of this research were to i compare the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock aquifers under glaciated and unglaciated regions ii correlate the aquifer parameters thickness and depth with a k of the aquifer and iii study the variations in k of the sandstone aquifers due to cyclic loading and unloading of glaciers it was hypothesized that glaciated regions would have greater k than unglaciated regions and thus would correlate with larger aquifer yield to test this hypothesis data were collected from 14 counties in northeastern ohio that consist of well location well construction details well production test and rudimentary lithological descriptions these results suggested that glacial loading and unloading had created new fractures and reactivated the older fractures in the bedrock aquifers more so for glaciated regions than those in unglaciated regions because of that the glaciated sandstone aquifers had a larger yield than the unglaciated sandstone aquifers furthermore the sandstone aquifers in the northern counties had generally greater mean k than those in the southern counties the frequency distribution curves of k of the aquifer in the glaciated regions were considerably tighter and shifted right compared to the unglaciated regions understanding the variations in k of the aquifer provides important insight into sustainable development management of water resources in the glaciated landscape keywords hydraulic conductivity stress released fractures glaciation residential wells statistical analysis global warming 1 introduction the occurrence and rate of groundwater movement depend on aquifer parameters such as storativity s and transmissivity t determining such parameters of aquifers is crucial for the sustainable development management of water resources to regulate pumping rates in connection to recharge rates however predicting the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties in heterogeneous sedimentary bedrock especially when fractured remains a challenge long 1996 hydraulic conductivity k of fractured bedrock aquifers is related to fracture characteristics like fracture aperture and frequency fracture length fracture orientation angle fracture interconnectivity infilling materials and fracture plane features hamm et al 2007 the lineament analysis has been used in fractured bedrock aquifers to establish high yield water wells during groundwater investigation lineaments exhibit a positive correlation with springs and stream locations in mineral and grant counties west virginia usa rega 2011 lin et al 2013 demonstrate the delineation of groundwater body using three combined geophysical methods to identify high yield well locations however detecting fractured zones and defining hydrogeologic characteristics in bedrock aquifers are complicated when the bedrock has been covered with glacial drifts the efficacy of advanced geophysical techniques decreases sharply in urban areas surrounded by residences and facilities with fences sewers cables as well as water gas and electric lines tectonic forces unloading and weathering can influence the porosity and permeability of an aquifer thereby changing aquifer parameters such as k and s lachassagne et al 2011 maharjan and eckstein 2013 an increase in thickness of overburden decreases fracture permeability of the aquifer davison et al 1983 however the relationship between external stress and aquifer characteristic is complex and affected by rock type engelder 1993 fracture orientation gale 1982 and regional tectonics history milnes et al 1998 engelder 1993 evan 1994 the formation of fracture is a structural process through the activation growth and coalescence of a system of microcracks in a rock mass depending upon increasing levels of compressive stress fractures in rock masses would respond to initially sliding deformation followed by fracture propagation and fractures coalesce shen 1993 rock may burst for hard rocks under unloading conditions especially with increasing axial stress and decreasing confining pressure li et al 2017 a stress strain curve of rock masses is non linear during loading and shows hysteresis during unloading the fractures may result from i development of micro extension of cracks under loading and ii volumetric expansion of rock masses under unloading confining pressure li et al 2017 besides natural processes human activities such as heavy withdrawal and artificial recharge could impact hydrogeological environment of bedrock such actions are analogous to unloading and loading respectively wu et at 2019 and wu et al 2021 showed heavy pumping of groundwater leading to land subsidence while artificial recharge preventing settlement but heaving soil inside a deep pit zeng et al 2019a zeng et al 2019b continental ice sheets have advanced and retreated eight times during pleistocene ice age 1 6 and 0 01 million years ray 1992 although multiple glacial events were known to exist the impact of early glaciers was difficult to characterize because of deeply weathered glacial deposits or overlapped by the recent glacial deposits hansen 2020 at their greatest extent the glaciers and ice sheets were up to 2 km thick that covered most of canada and much of the upper midwest of the us paterson 1972 glacial formation in the higher latitude of north america flowed its way down towards the lower latitudes towards the modern day united states hansen 2020 the ice sheets were thick in the upper latitudes and thin towards the lower latitudes except along the buried valleys powers 2004 the ice sheets flow outward in response to the gravity thus forming a new area that had thinner ice than the accumulation zone ray 1992 gramiger s model 2017 showed the mechanical stress generated by glacial loading and unloading producing limited new fractures in bedrock that is proportionate to the thickness of the ice another model that incorporated changes in hydraulic pressure due to a fluctuating water table in addition to mechanical stress showed a substantial number of new fractures during late pleistocene and holocene glacial cycles in an alpine valley gramiger et al 2020 glacial history had a considerable impact on the evolution of the current stress regime in bedrock especially the shallow bedrock because glacial loading and unloading changes horizontal and vertical stresses in the bedrock at the interior and edge of the ice sheet subsequently creating a new fracture system or reactivating an old fracture system asmis and lee 1984 the evidence from present day great lake basin tilting indicates that the relaxation of the glacial depression is continuing in the great lakes region after 12 000 years since the last glacial unloading bowbly 1984 stress redistribution in the surficial rocks could persist for the next 1000 years due to deglaciation at the present climatic conditions baroni et al 2014 glacial loading and unloading could affect the bedrock aquifer considerably and develop secondary porosity due to changes in principal stresses in connection with glacial loading and unloading since the last glaciation this bedrock had experienced remarkably less stresses on them that would allow secondary porosity to increase thereby increasing the overall k of the aquifers thus it was hypothesized that glaciated regions would have greater k than unglaciated regions furthermore within the glaciated regions the northern counties have larger k than the southern counties as the glaciers flowed from north to south indicating that the northern territories have thicker glaciers than the south such findings are important to anyone interested in withdrawing a high volume of groundwater on a regular basis such as water supply managers farmers industries etc besides such results could provide insights into how bedrock would respond to the change in stress conditions due to melting of ice due to global warming that could potentially have larger implications to slope stability after the ice has melted to the authors knowledge no one has presented the impacts of glacial loading and unloading on the k of bedrock aquifers using private residential wells the objectives of this study were to i compare k of the aquifer under glaciated and non glaciated regions ii correlate the aquifer parameters thickness and depth with k of the aquifer and iii study the variations in the values of aquifer parameters due to cyclic loading and unloading of glaciation 1 1 study area the study area lies in northeast ohio consisting of 14 counties in allegheny plateau physiographic province fig 1 the thick black line in the middle of the study area is the maximum glacial extent north of the line is glaciated regions while south of the line is unglaciated regions it is important to note that six of 14 counties were completely glaciated four were partially glaciated and the rest were never glaciated the glaciated regions have smoother topography due to pleistocene glaciation that blanketed the area with surficial sediments while the unglaciated regions are highly dissected due to successive erosion the thickness of surficial deposits in the glaciated regions ranges from less than a meter to over 46 m foos et al 2003 the glacial boundary in the study area is farther north than the other areas in the state of ohio because the erosion resistant bedrock sharon sandstone impeded southward glacial advances powers 2004 multiple lobes of ice sheets moved south from the north in the state of ohio miami and scioto lobes reached further south in comparison to killbuck and grand river lobes fig 2 bedrock units in the study area dip toward the southeast resulting in progressively younger toward the southeast and have ages ranging from mississippian to pennsylvanian the sharon sandstone is the uppermost bedrock unit in the northwestern counties while it underlies the younger bedrock in southeastern counties the bedrock of the study area comprises mississippian and pennsylvanian rocks divided into multiple formations fig 3 fig 3 also shows the gamma ray log whose intensity increases to the right reflecting the amount of fines content in those formations cuyahoga formation consists of a series of muddy to silty members with sand and conglomerate hyde 1953 logan formation is mississippian in age and consists of reddish brown fine grained sandstones interbedded with siltstones and shales totaling about 85 m szmuc 1970 pottsville group consists of sandstone and conglomerate while allegheny group comprises multiple cyclothems ninke and evans 2002 conemaugh group has an intermediate allocycle of a 90 m thick sequence donaldson and eble 1991 berea sandstone formation is very deep in this region hence no well was drilled into the formation among all the bedrock sharon sandstone caps the highlands of the preglacial topography because of its high resistance to erosion rice et al 1992 the sharon sandstone is pennsylvanian in age a member of the pottsville group and it uncomfortably overlies the mississippian cuyahoga formation with paleotopographic relief of up to 80 m coogan et al 1974 it is loosely cemented coarse grained and gray to tan in color often found with conglomerate zones the upper contact of the sharon formation is planar consisting of crossbeds while the lower contact is erosional consisting of cut and fill structures creating highly variable thickness wells et al 1993 ninke and evans 2002 sharon formation is a reliable aquifer to the residents in the regions that has an average thickness of 15 m and has a high yield that ranges from 27 to 545 m3 day angle 1990 joints and fractures are common in the aquifer that has been related to tectonics stresses as well as pre and post glacial stresses foos et al 2003 sharon aquifer is the most productive unit of the pottsville group that supplies 38 of the groundwater to many residents industries and agriculture in northeast ohio sedam 1973 several rounded isolated knobs and uplands of sharon sandstone separated from other bedrocks which have been infilled with glacial drift sharon aquifer remains bounded by impermeable cuyahoga formation below and glacial till above in northeast ohio a conceptual diagram fig 4 of lithospheric responses due to glacial loading and unloading was adopted from shaw et al 2012 this model considers the glacially induced stress that build up the flexural stress such that the ice sheet induces flexural compression under the thick ice sheet and tension on the fore bulge outside the ice sheet the stress conditions are reversed at the near surface as the ice melts away while shaw et al s model is static we can imagine that the surficial rock would be under dynamic stress conditions as the ice sheet advances and retreats rock would go under compression with glacial loading while the same rock would go from compression to tension as unloading begins such dynamic stress conditions would create new fractures and reactivate older fractures that increase well yield allowing water to flow preferentially through those fractures 2 methods we collected data for more than 26 000 residential water wells tapped only into sandstone aquifers within 14 counties from the division of soil and water resources of the ohio department of natural resources odnr we used the custom data search option to filter the database a combination of search options such as well log type county names and aquifer type were used to obtain the wells of interest the reported number of data was not a complete list of wells registered in the odnr but only were the ones with complete information required for the analysis any incomplete data were avoided table 1 shows the area of the counties and the number of wells per square km for each county in the study area it was important to notify readers that these wells are developed into sandstone aquifers at different depths which are not equally productive it also means that the k of these sandstone aquifers could vary within the range listed in table 2 it was assumed that most wells were developed into the sharon sandstone because it is a highly productive aquifer and caps the top of the hills sharon aquifer remains bounded by low permeable cuyahoga formation below and glacial till above in most parts of the glaciated regions of the study area except for some portions of the northwestern counties fig 1 odnr requires well owners to run pumping tests before the operation of residential water wells and the results were recorded into well logs and drilling reports such reports contain well location well construction details well production test data aquifer thickness and rudimentary lithological description fig a1 the production test of residential water wells consists of static water level pumping rate pumping time duration and drawdown at the end of pumping the drawdown record was made at the end of the production test within the residential well at r rw rw is the nominal well radius these data were used to calculate hydraulic conductivities of sandstone aquifers at different depths using cooper and jacob 1946 approximation to theis 1935 method this approximation yields an insignificant error in the estimation of the k as the radius of residential wells being smaller than 0 0762 m renders the value of a well function very small 1 q h o h r w t 4 π t 2 303 l o g 2 25 t t r w 2 s q is pumping rate ho is the static water level before pumping h rw t is the water level at the end of pumping rw is the well radius t is the duration of pumping t is the aquifer transmissivity s is the aquifer storativity according to walton 1970 assumptions inherent in equation 1 are water flows into the wells through the complete thickness of the aquifer negligible well loss the completed wells have an equal radius of drilling generally water wells were cased only to the top of the formation leaving the entire thickness of sandstone aquifers uncased in this region however it was not strictly checked for each individual well hence it is noteworthy to mention that partially screened wells could have different k than the estimated value using equation 1 these wells were tested at a relatively low rate at q 100 m3 day for a short period usually t two hours generating relatively small drawdowns if a well screen represents the entire aquifer thickness then well loss could be considered negligible rorabaugh 1953 bennett and patten 1960 mace et al 1999 recently established that turbulent well loss in wells with pumping rates of approximately less than 3 270 m3 day can be ignored and the nominal radius of wells could be an effective radius equation 1 contains two unknown aquifer parameters i t and ii s which are constants for an aquifer the storage coefficient ranges from 0 0001 to 0 001 for a leaky aquifer the value of s depends strongly on the degree of confinement meaning that the value of t may be computed assuming the value of s based on aquifer conditions in this study an estimate of s of 0 001 was used large errors in estimating the s value would cause noticeable errors in the resulting value of t however an error of two orders of magnitude in the estimated s value would yield roughly 10 to 20 error in the resulting t value walton 1970 once the value of s was estimated the t value was computed iteratively in excel using a solver to convergence later it was divided by the thickness of the aquifer yielding k for the aquifer in the immediate surroundings of the well statistical analysis of k of the sandstone aquifer was conducted in excel i to estimate central tendency and despersion of k for different counties ii to run t test and f test using the data analysis package and iii to calculate correlation coefficient of k of the aquifers with other well parameters 3 results the average pumping rate for the 14 counties was about 100 m3 day the maximum pumping rate was 5450 m3 day for only two wells and the second to the maximum rate was 2725 m3 day the average pumping duration for the wells was approximately 2 hours while the maximum pumping duration was 112 hours however approximately 12 of the total wells that were sampled for this study had more than 2 hours of pumping duration and only 4 of wells had more than 4 hours of pumping duration table 3 summarizes the statistical analysis a measure of the central tendency dispersion shape of the data distribution around central tendency of the k of the sandstone aquifers within the study area the table also covers analysis for the glaciated and unglaciated regions separated by the maximum glacial extent within the study area the results clearly showed that the glaciated counties had more wells per square area tapped into sandstone aquifers than that in the unglaciated counties not only the number of wells but also the statistic of the two groups were different for instance the completely unglaciated counties jefferson harrison carroll and tuscarawas had a mean k value less than 6 00 generally the mean k values for the partially glaciated counties were larger than the unglaciated counties and were the highest for the glaciated counties the glaciated counties had standard deviations less than 1 while the rest had standard deviations greater than one similarly the glaciated counties had positive kurtosis values and the rest had negative except for carroll county fig 5 displays frequency distribution curves of calculated k of the sandstone aquifers that overlay histograms for glaciated and unglaciated regions the x axis represents the log transformed k of the sandstone aquifers in meters per second the y axis represents the number of wells the vertical line green and blue represents the mean k of the sandstone aquifers frequency distribution curves were assigned the same starting and ending k values to make comparison easy among other figures the glaciated region consisted of 20 683 data points while the unglaciated region had 5679 data points comparatively the glaciated regions have approximately twice more wells per square area than the unglaciated regions the mean k for the glaciated region green vertical line was significantly larger than that of the unglaciated region blue vertical line the glaciated area had lower skewness lower standard deviation and a narrow range of k for the sandstone aquifers than the unglaciated region the frequency distribution curve for the glaciated region showed a noticeable shift towards the right in comparison to the unglaciated region the t test table 4 determines whether two means are significantly different from their population means assuming that the two samples have unequal variances table 3 t tests were separately conducted for glaciated and unglaciated regions within the study area and holmes county the t calculated values were greater than the t critical values for both tests this result verified that the average k values for the sandstone aquifers within the glaciated regions were significantly greater than that for those unglaciated regions fig 6 depicts the frequency distribution curves of k of the sandstone aquifers for each county within the study area that were arranged geographically as observed in the field x axes represent log transformed k values ranging from 10 to 0 and y axes represent frequency the frequency assigned to the figures on the far left column applied only to the figures on the same rows the frequency of wells increased moving from southern to northern counties strictly under allegheny and pottsville group the frequency distribution curves for the unglaciated counties were wider than that for those glaciated counties the mean k of the sandstone aquifers expressed in green blue red and cyan colors increased from south to north in general except for summit and mahoning county most of the frequency distribution curves were positively skewed except for medina trumbull and coshocton counties with maximum skewness of 0 66 for tuscarawas county the maximum glacial extent line passes through the middle of holmes county and separates it into roughly two regions glaciated in the north of the line and unglaciated in the south because of this reason a frequency distribution of the k for the county showed a bimodal distribution meaning two peaks fig 7 frequency distribution curves displayed a nature of data characteristics for holmes county as a whole and its glaciated and unglaciated regions although the sampled wells in the glaciated and unglaciated regions were not geographically far from each other their mean k of the sandstone aquifer was significantly different from one another the glaciated region had the highest mean followed by county and then the unglaciated region the frequency distribution curve for the glaciated region showed a noticeable shift towards the right in comparison to the unglaciated region following the same trend as for the glaciated and unglaciated regions within the study area the f test table 5 looks at the variance between glaciated and unglaciated regions within holmes county and all counties the f calculated for glaciated and unglaciated regions within the study area was larger than f critical value which inferred that the variances were statistically different from their population variances that was confirmed by a very low probability and such difference was not due to random chance however the f calculated for glaciated and unglaciated regions within holmes county was less than its f critical value indicating that the two variances were not statistically different from their population variances the kriging map displays the distribution of k values of sandstone aquifers within the study area fig 8 although the k of the aquifers ranges from 9 11 to 1 50 m s on a log scale the kriging process truncated outliers and displayed its range from 6 75 to 3 98 m s on a log scale nevertheless the distribution of k in the glaciated region is significantly more than in the unglaciated region not only that the maximum glacial extent line roughly separated two regions the north of the line was mostly red representing larger k and the south of the line was mostly blue indicating lower k it is also evident that the distribution of k was clustered on both sides of the maximum glacial extent the k of the unglaciated aquifers in the east was different from the west tuscarawas county had clusters of high k values in the center of the county while its surrounding area contained lower k values fig 9 shows the distribution of total well depths left and aquifer thickness right of the sandstone aquifers within the study area the depth of wells would be shallower where the bedrock is close to the surface and the aquifer is thin the results show the total depth of wells was the highest nearby the maximum glaciated extent and the sandstone aquifer was thicker along the line besides those locations both well depth and aquifer thickness were relatively greater in tuscarawas county both well depth and aquifer thickness showed a similar distribution of data and had a correlation coefficient of 0 88 between them well depth and aquifer thickness data spread above and beyond the displayed values in fig 9 that were truncated while kriging table 6 shows the correlation coefficient between k of the sandstone aquifer and well parameters such as well depth depth to the aquifer dem elevation bedrock elevation and aquifer thickness k decreased with an increase in total well depth elevations of the ground surface as well as bedrock and aquifer thickness although those parameters had a negative correlation with the k of the sandstone aquifer only aquifer thickness and total well depth had a relatively stronger correlation with the k depth to aquifer had a positive but weaker correlation coefficient with k of the sandstone aquifer depth to the aquifer refers to an overburden to the aquifer which also includes glacial drift in the glaciated regions of the study area 4 discussion 4 1 comparing results from previous studies with this study the k of sandstone in general ranges from 3 00 10 10 m s 9 5 to 6 00 10 6 m s 5 22 schwartz and domenico 1973 the results showed that the average k for sandstone aquifers ranges from 6 13 to 5 01 m s which is greater than that of the average sandstone this indicates that the bedrock aquifers had developed secondary porosity which could have been linked to external stresses such as glacial loading and unloading that is capable of creating new fractures gramiger et al 2017 gramiger et al 2020 shen 1993 studies have shown a decrease in k with an increase in vertical effective stress in a granular aquifer due to decreasing in pore sizes bredehoeft et al 1983 grant 1996 however glacial unloading would decrease the vertical stress creating stress released fractures in a granular aquifer stanley 1973 li et al 2017 hence the inference was made that the increase in k could have been linked to glacier advances and retreats during the last ice age although the results show a connection between the cyclic loading and unloading of glaciers to the k of the aquifers in these regions other unaccounted factors such as heterogeneity in the grain size of the aquifers and erosion of the bedrock before the glaciation cannot be ignored to account for such factors and further consolidate the findings of this study requires numerical modeling foos et al 2003 studied sharon sandstone at geauga medina portage summit and wayne counties the author found that the sandstone had a similar average k and degree of variability in those counties and concluded that there was no geographic control on the k it is worth noting that those counties are in proximity to each other and completely glaciated when data were analyzed for both glaciated and unglaciated regions noticeably greater average k and lower variance were observed in the glaciated region compared to the unglaciated region fig 5 this finding suggested that the glacial loading and unloading had a considerable impact on the bedrock aquifers in the region more so to the glaciated than the unglaciated regions the data were further divided into county level and similar analysis was done which suggested that the intensity of the glacial impact decreased towards the south which aligned with the glacier movements from north to south direction in the study area fig 1 these findings contradict foos et al s 2003 conclusion that the sandstone aquifers have a similar characteristic regardless of geographical locations this region had gone through tectonic activities in the past and most recently glaciations and inter glaciations events hansen 2020 prior studies indicated the tectonic and stress release fractures were responsible for heterogeneity in the sharon sandstone aquifer kammer 1982 richards 1981 sedam 1973 stanley 1973 it was assumed that fractures created due to tectonic activities alone would be homogeneous in the study area regardless of glaciated or unglaciated status generally the mean k values were larger for the partially glaciated counties than the unglaciated counties and were the highest for the glaciated counties fig 6 this result was an indication of differential stress conditions in glaciated vs unglaciated regions the idea that the glaciers had larger impacts on the glaciated regions than the unglaciated regions was supported by the fact that the glaciated regions had small standard deviations while the unglaciated regions had large standard deviations table 3 this finding means that the aquifers in the glaciated regions had a narrow range of k than those in the unglaciated regions the narrow range was possible only when preexisting fractures created by tectonic activities were reactivated by the loading and unloading of glaciation reactivation of preexisting fractures in the glaciated regions thus allowed water to flow into the well easily and quickly compared to the unglaciated regions where such reactivation did not happen to the same intensity as in the glaciated regions the frequency distribution curves show positive skewness except for three counties which suggests the glaical loading and unloading had improved well yield that resulted in due to the creation of new fractures and reactivation of older fractures williams 1983 compared the t of sandstone aquifer to its thickness well depth and depth of aquifer in two townships within summit county and found no relationships among the parameters in this study we compared k the ratio of t to the thickness of aquifer instead of t of the sandstone aquifer to the same parameters and found a mild correlation r 0 42 0 72 to both well depth and aquifer thickness and a weak correlation r 0 10 0 27 to the depth to the aquifer table 6 aquifers with equal t could have different k values depending on their thickness lower the thickness higher the k the depth to the aquifer had the least correlation coefficient to k because these aquifers were not uniform not always underlain by glacial drift alone in the case of deeper aquifers other bedrocks and glacial drift overlie these aquifers furthermore k had an inverse relationship with well depth and aquifer thickness table 6 wells are often developed near the bottom of the aquifer and become deep when the aquifer is at a greater depth or is thick hence the depth and thickness of the aquifer are connected besides the k could differ spatially depending upon the level of connectivity of existing fractures the existence of thicker aquifers along the maximum glacial extent supports the fact that sharon sandstone not only resisted erosion but also impede glacial movement during the last glaciation which in turn yielded lower k along the line 4 2 present study kurtosis is a measure of the combined sizes of the two tails of frequency distribution curves the glaciated regions had higher peaks and lighter tails than the normal distribution curve while the unglaciated regions had the opposite this result suggested the unglaciated regions had more extreme values on their tails and consisted of more outliers table 3 this result indicated that the k in the glaciated regions was more concentrated to the central value which physically means that the glaciers exerted vertical stress on the bedrock aquifer creating new fractures and reactivating old fractures in the regions whereas the glaciers had less impact on the unglaciated regions thus the old fractures were not reactivated equally as in the glaciated regions that left the lower spectrum of k of the aquifer holmes county had about 54 of the total sampled wells within the county in the glaciated region and the rest in the unglaciated region the average k for the glaciated region was one order magnitude larger than the maximum k value assigned to sandstone aquifers whereas it was one half order magnitude less for the unglaciated regions fig 7 although the average k for the glaciated and unglaciated regions was significantly different both values suggested that the glaciated and the unglaciated regions had developed secondary porosity but the intensity was much greater in the glaciated region than that in the unglaciated region this finding supported the idea that glacial loading and unloading could create new fractures under and around the thick ice sheets fig 4 the unglaciated region had a lower variance compared to the glaciated and overall holmes county however the variance was not significantly different between glaciated and unglaciated regions table 5 this result suggests that the glacial loading and unloading had affected both regions however the glaciated regions were impacted more compared to the unglaciated regions within the county the overall county had a larger spread in its dataset as it consisted of extreme low and high values from both unglaciated and glaciated regions respectively spatial autocorrelation evaluates whether the pattern expressed is clustered dispersed or random spatial autocorrelation of the k of the bedrock aquifers in glaciated and unglaciated was separately calculated in arcgis using global moran s i table 7 the result shows that the spatial distribution of k values for both regions was clustered the likelihood that the clustered pattern of k could be the result of randomness is 0 the threshold distance was 3 93 km for unglaciated while it was 4 40 km for glaciated regions apparently unglaciated regions had a better spatial correlation than the glaciated regions rizzo 1993 suggested that the clustering in k of the sandstone aquifers could be a function of the diverse depositional environment 4 3 future implications the primary usages of groundwater are for residence agriculture and industry in the state of ohio angle et al 2003 groundwater recharge rates were calculated throughout the state of ohio which were greater than the general sandstone aquifer pettyjohn and henning 1979 the larger replenishment rates allow wells to have a continuum and consistent yield at a constant withdrawal rate greater recharge rates result in a rapid replenishment of groundwater made possible by interconnected fracture networks as discussed earlier the presence of such a network is likely in the state of ohio due to the cyclic loading and unloading of glaciations that changed the stress regime prior studies suggested that higher k could be linked to the change in stress regime freeze and cherry 1979 kammer 1982 glaciation not only changed the stress regime in the region but also deposited thick glacial till that could inversely impact well yield as glacial till would impede vertical infiltration of water into aquifers furthermore well yield depends on the preglacial topography such that wells near the buried valley would have larger k than one that is far from the valley stanely 1973 angle 1990 finding appropriate well locations would be important to manage groundwater supply and have a sustainable well yield for the economic growth of the region 5 conclusion ice sheet spread outward radially under its weight from northern canada to the usa ice sheets were thicker in the upper latitudes and thinner in the lower latitudes the glaciated regions have distinct different aquifer responses than the unglaciated regions the glaciated regions have a recognizably greater number of wells per square area higher mean lower standard deviation and larger peaks at the center of the frequency distribution curve than the unglaciated regions furthermore the mean k of both glaciated and unglaciated regions was larger than the average k of sandstone the culmination of these findings inferred to the change in vertical stresses linked to the cyclic glacial loading and unloading of glaciers in the ice age it suggests that such change in stress regime to the aquifers have perhaps created new fractures and reactivated old fractures linked to the pre glaciation events this study sheds light on the potential application of private residential wells in revealing aquifer responses to historic stress changes accurate estimates of aquifer parameters and their spatial variations would lead to better resource management sustainable development of water and geotechnical engineering applications aquifer yield correlated with aquifer thickness and total well depth however the geomorphology of the study area could have a larger impact on the well yield for instance a residential water well drilled close to the buried valley would have a noticeably larger yield than wells at the same depth but far from such features this study infers that sandstone aquifers in other counties would have a larger yield that had undergone similar glacial history mountainous and polar regions are experiencing a higher rate of melting ice due to changing climate thus releasing vertical stress from the underlying bedrock the glacier retreat being the catalyst for an increase in secondary porosity should not be limited to this study but it should be of greater interest for other regions where similar geological history prevailed and even for regions that are experiencing changes in stress due to glacier melt it would be interesting to see how climate change would influence aquifer parameters at high latitudes and high altitudes as stress regime changes credit authorship contribution statement madan maharjan conceptualization

teleconnections and anthropogenic warming leading to severe socio economic impacts across various climate regions in this study the relative influence of six different teleconnection patterns and anthropogenic global warming on the global cdhw occurrences is quantified systematically using the instrumental data period 1982 2016 the results from the study suggest a substantial increase in the cdhw events 1 5 events per year across various parts of the globe at the beginning of 21st century 2000 2016 a bayesian approach is implemented to identify the most vulnerable climate regions based on the degree of susceptibility of heatwaves dshw towards drought as such top ten most vulnerable regions are selected based on the dshw magnitude and a partial correlation analysis is performed to select the natural and anthropogenic drivers of cdhw in those regions separately a logistic regression model is then used to determine significant changes in the odds of cdhw due to changes in the selected drivers that suggest a significantly positive and multiplicative effect of anthropogenic global warming in the top ten most vulnerable climate regions finally the same logistic regression model integrated with an analytical framework is applied to determine the relative influence of anthropogenic global warming on the changes in odds of cdhw for the future 1 5 c and 2 c warming limits the results suggest that relative to the 2 c global warming constraining to the 1 5 c global warming limit may conduce about 17 fold reduction in the odds of cdhw in the most vulnerable climate region

eastern north america and west asia keywords compound drought and heatwave natural climate variability climate change global warming hydroclimatic extreme events 1 introduction compound drought and heatwave cdhw events have had multiple societal and eco hydrological impacts including loss of crop yield ciais et al 2005 zampieri et al 2017 increased wildfires and tree mortality allen et al 2010 and health hazards poumadère et al 2005 cdhw events are typically triggered by anticyclonic flow patterns trenberth and fasullo 2012 followed by land atmosphere feedback processes that modulate the surface energy budget mukherjee et al 2020 mukherjee and mishra 2020 natural modes of climate variability are instrumental in influencing global circulation patters that lead to conditions favoring the development of anticyclonic regimes over terrestrial regions mukherjee et al 2020 pepler et al 2019 observations indicate a poleward expansion of these regimes in both hemispheres during the past few decades which is attributed to intensification and poleward shift in main storm tracks in mid latitudes associated with warming lu et al 2007 pepler et al 2019 trenberth et al 2014 yin 2005 the anticyclonic anomalies in the atmosphere are accompanied with clear skies or lack of moisture in the lower atmosphere making conditions less conducive for precipitation and thereby facilitating drought conditions the lack of surface moisture leads to excessive sensible heating at the expense of decreased latent energy or evapotranspiration causing surface warming the prolonged period of high surface temperatures eventually lead to heatwaves hw horton et al 2016 stéfanon et al 2014 resulting in the occurrence of cdhw events additionally the rise in surface air temperature further exacerbates drought conditions by initiating a land atmosphere feedback loop with the soil moisture by increasing the atmospheric demand leading to increased evapotranspiration this feedback process is very common in the anticyclonic weather regimes and is generally referred as the soil temperature coupling betts et al 1996 seneviratne et al 2010 whan et al 2015 anthropogenic climate change has already accelerated such processes leading to increased frequency of cdhw events across many parts of the globe mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 mukherjee and mishra 2020 sun et al 2017 2018 zhang et al 2019b given the role of temperature anomalies in the occurrence of chdw events drought quantification using only precipitation may lead to underestimation of drying dai and zhao 2017 which can lead to uncertainties in the characterization of cdhw events mukherjee et al 2020 mukherjee and mishra 2020 therefore it is imperative that soil moisture and surface temperature anomalies are incorporated in the estimation of cdhw using the energy budget framework to this end palmer drought severity index pdsi wells et al 2004 is a comprehensive drought index that incorporates hydroclimatic variables relevant to the estimation of drought under the changing climate mukherjee et al 2018 furthermore as previously noted the large scale natural modes of climate variability are instrumental in the formation of anticyclonic regimes and that anthropogenic footprint is detectable in the intensification of conditions that are conducive for the occurrence of extreme dry and hot conditions hassan and nayak 2020 lau and kim 2012 pepler et al 2019 therefore there is a need to establish analytical frameworks that not only identify relevant modes of climate variability that exert influence on distribution of chdw events across the globe but also incorporate the relative influence of anthropogenic warming ant on the evolution of cdhw events hao et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2019b in this study we present a comprehensive global analysis on the relative effect of anthropogenic warming and natural climate variability on cdhw events for the first time first we focus on the identification of natural and anthropogenic climate forcings that play a significant role in the occurrence of cdhw events during the 1982 2016 historical period subsequently we estimate the possible increase of such events at 1 5 c and 2 c future warming scenarios and discuss its implication for mitigation strategies the rest of the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 focuses on the data and methodology applied in the study the results and relevant discussions are provided in section 3 and finally the summary of major findings and concluding remarks are provided in section 4 2 data and

weekly cdhw events from 1982 to 2016 to evaluate the relative influence of anthropogenic warming and natural climate variability of the cdhw events we calculated global mean temeprature changes and selected six different natural modes of climate varability for analysis table s1 for the calculation of global mean temeprature changes global gridded monthly temperature anomaly data provided by

compared to the other rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp6 2 2 estimation of compound drought and heatwave cdhw events cdhw events are estimated following the procedure proposed in mukherjee et al 2020 drought estimation at weekly time scale can help to retain the memory of soil temperature and moisture inherited within a short time scale mukherjee et al 2020 this approach not only captures the diurnal feedback loop but also produces a considerable sample size required in the statistical analysis of rare events such as the co occurrence of hw and drought in this study we define a cdhw event as a hw event that occurred during the drought weeks over a given location and temporal period a threshold based approach was used to identify cdhw events during 1982 2016 at each grid point the 10th percentile of weekly self calibrated pdsi wpdsi sc for the reference period 1982 2011 were obtained as a threshold and any wpdsi sc value below that threshold was estimated as a drought week for the period 1982 2016 mukherjee et al 2020 mukherjee and mishra 2020 cdhw events were then identified when daily tmax value exceeded the 90th percentile tx90pct fischer and knutti 2015 meehl and tebaldi 2004 perkins et al 2012 unkašević and tošić 2013 for 3 or more consecutive days during these drought weeks the tx90pct was caluclated for each calender day as the 90th percentile of daily tmax over each 31 day window during the 30 years 1982 2011 climatological period fischer and schär 2010 2 3 measurement of degree of susceptibility of hw dshw towards drought to get a measure to which it is more likely that hw and drought will co occur in a particular location we estimated the degree of susceptibility of hw towards drought dshw in the historical period the dshw was estimated by using a bayesian approach based on the conditional formulation of cdhw events followed by a statistical test for significance first probability pe and pc of occurrence of two mutually exclusive extreme events hw events with and without an already existing drought that influences the background state of the climate were estimated based on the observational record across the globe statistically significant at 5 significance level pe pc ratio greater than 1 was obtained using the two proportion z test or chi square test the z statistic is based on a standard normal distribution therefore to remove the normality assumption the results were obtained for the two mutually exclusive events i e hw events with and without an already existing drought by resampling producing 1000 realizations each with replacement the resampling is performed based on the following steps a first the number of days with drought occurrences d no drought occurrences nd hw occurrences h and non occurrences nh are recorded for a given grid point b the pe and pc values from the above information is used to calculate the z statistics from the observed sample c a matrix consisting of binary elements 1 and 0 is generated based on the number of hw occurrences h indicated by the number of 1 s and non occurrences nh indicated by the number of 0 s d for a given realization out of total 1000 selected here total d samples are chosen with replacement from the binary matrix and stored as m1 subsequently pe is calculated as the sum of all 1 s and zeroes from the matrix m1 divided by the number of drought days d e similarly total nd samples were chosen with replacement from the binary matrix and stored as m2 subsequently pc is calculated as the sum of all 1 s and zeroes from the matrix m2 divided by the number of non drought days nd f the z statistics from the sampling distribution is calculated based on the pe and pc values from the sampling distribution g finally 1000 samples of the z statistics for the sampling distribution are generated by repeating the steps in c d e and f 1000 times finally the proportion of the z statistic from the sampling distribution which had absolute values as large or larger than that observed z statistic is calculated we rejected the null hypothesis of equal proportions if that proportion was greater than 0 05 the pe pc ratio showing a significantly greater than 1 value was thus obtained at each grid point and defined as the dshw in this study the detailed formulation of z statistics and the dshw is provided in appendix a of the supplemental information 2 4 estimation of partial correlaton partial correlation is the measure of association between two variables while controlling or adjusting the effect of one or more additional or confounding variables

of multiple large scale teleconnection patterns e g enso pdo nao and iod on temperature extremes and drought across many regions of the globe ashok and saji 2007 hu and huang 2009 manatsa et al 2008 mukherjee and mishra 2020 rajagopalan et al 2000 zhang et al 2019a in this study a non parametric spearman s rank correlation analysis was performed to identify possible drivers large scale oscillation patterns and ant that influence the cdhw events hence sstatistically significant at 5 significance level spearman s partial correlation between the region wise area weighted number of mt cdhw days and the interannual variability of the large scale climate indices and ant for the period 1982 2016 were estimated for the selected climate regions such that 1 r xyz r xy r xz r yz 1 r xz 2 1 r yz 2 where r xyz is the relative correlation between area weighted number of mt cdhw days and y largescale climate indices or ant with the effect of z either of the other indices or ant are removed in order to account for the inter dependence of different climate modes meyers et al 2007 perkins et al 2015 and ant we employ partial correlation technique equation 8 to isolate the influence of individual forcing 2 5 measurement of odds of occurrence of cdhw events previous studies have confirmed the link between the odds of occurrence of extreme events and other climate variables using logistic regression mahlstein et al 2012 zhai et al 2005 in this study we investigated the relative effect of large scale teleconnection patterns and anthropogenic warming based on odds ratios calculated using the firth logistic regression model the odds of occurrence of cdhw events in any month is calculated using the interannual variability of large scale climate indices and changes in the global mean temperature during the period 1982 2016 as predictors a detailed discussion on the application of the logistic regression model is discussed in the following section 2 5 1 logistic regression model we applied a multiple predictor based firth logistic regression model that is a special form of generalized linear model lindsey 2000 to estimate the penalized regression coefficients corresponding to natural and anthropogenic variability of the climate the firth s model applies penalized likelihood estimation rather than performing the conventional maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the penalized regression coefficients the penalization allows for convergence of the likelihood to finite estimates in conditions of separation and also with sparse data and therefore may alleviate overfitting albert and anderson 1984 in our analysis we used the following logistic regression model 2 log i t y ln π 1 π β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n natural c o m p o n e n t β ant x ant anthropogenic c o m p o n e n t α where π 1 π is the odds of having more than two cdhw events per year x 1 x 1 x n are the large scale climate indices used in the model and x ant is the change in global mean temperature with respect to the pre industrial period 1861 1900 α β 1 β 2 β n and β ant are the corresponding penalized regression coefficients or scaling factors once the model was fitted for the observational distribution the penalized regression coefficients were obtained that we refer as the scaling factors in this study 2 6 estimating odd ratio for 1 5 c and 2 c global warming one of our objectives is to answer the science question how much more likely will there be a cdhw day in a month at 1 5 c and 2 c global warming scenarios than there is at the current level of anthropogenic warming this was achieved by changing the anthropogenic component to different warming levels current 1 5 c and 2 c while keeping the natural component constant in the regression model we estimated the current level of warming based on the average of monthly temperature anomalies estimated with respect to the pre industrial period 1861 1890 for the current world finally the odd ratio or of monthly occurrence cdhw day for the future warming limits 1 5 c and 2 c to that for the current warming level was estimated as 3 o r t c π 1 π t c π 1 π current exp α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n natural c o m p o n e n t β ant t exp α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n natural c o m p o n e n t β ant x current exp β ant t exp β ant x current where t is the selected warming limit of 1 5 c and 2 c and xcurrent refers to the current warming level with respect to the pre industrial period 3 results 3 1 annual increase in the number of cdhw events the number of cdhw events has increased annually during the 21st century post 2000 compared to that observed during the last two decades of the 20th century pre 2000 fig 1 a figs s2a and 1 a show the spatial distribution of the average number of events during the pre 2000 and post 2000 periods and the corresponding difference in the same between the two periods respectively fig 1 b show the nonparametric probability density for the average number of cdhw events during the pre and post 2000 periods of the globe we also performed the kolmogorov smirnov and wilcoxon rank sum tests to show that there is a statistically significant at 5 significance level difference between the distributions and medians of the cdhw events respectively between these two periods our analysis suggests an overall annual range of 1 5 events during the post 2000 period fig s2b with major portions included in most of the climate regions showing an increase of 1 3 number of events per year fig 1a those regions include the southern parts of wna and can eastern nau eastern and southeastern saf northeastern sas eastern ena northern med central neu and almost all over was ceu and neb in addition to that regions such as the southern eas eastern ala western cgi and central amz show an increase of as high as 5 annual events during the post 2000 period however cgi and ala are excluded form rest of the analyses due to poor quality of available data over these regions 3 2 degree of susceptibility of hw dshw towards drought we focus on finding the locations where it is significantly more likely to have hw and drought co occurred on a particular day based on observations fig s3 we find that majority of grid points show higher dshw towards a persistent drought week pe pc greater than 1 fig 1c however the percentage of total area showing such dshw varies across the different climate regions fig 1d climate regions sea waf eaf cam nas tib and cgi exhibit more than half of the area with statistically significant pe pc ratio greater than 1 while sah wsa ssa and amz have less than half of the total area satisfying such conditions more importantly the rest of the 26 climate regions can ceu eas wna was neb ena nau sas med cas ala neu saf and sau exhibit more than 2 3rd of the area that shows statistically significant degree of susceptibility of hw under an ongoing drought condition with majority of them showing pe pc ratio as high as more than 5 fig 1c therefore out of all 26 climate regions considered in this study we selected the top 10 climate regions that show a significant dshw over more than 2 3rd of the total area fig 1d interestingly these regions also show an increase in the number of cdhw events during the post 2000 period as shown in fig 1a consequently we performed the rest of the analyses based on these 10 climate regions 3 3 possible natural and anthropogenic drivers previous studies suggest possible links between the large scale global circulation patterns or oceanic variabilities and anticyclonic regimes in both the northern and southern hemisphere abid et al 2020 garcía serrano et al 2017 pepler et al 2019 singh et al 2021 song and zhou 2013 wang and zhang 2002 therefore understanding and exploring such a relationship is key to identify the attributable factors behind the occurrence of compound events such as the cdhw for the climate regions that exhibit significant dshw towards drought over more than 2 3rd of the total area more precisely we explore possible links between the monthly total number of cdhw mt cdhw days and the interannual variability in the natural climate song and zhou 2013 as well as the influence of rise in ant on such extremes during the historical period we selected six table s1 natural modes of climate variability that exert major influence on the variability of climate globally at seasonal to decadal time scale to represent the interannual variability of these modes monthly anomalies of their representative indices and global mean temperature were smoothed by applying a 12 month running mean filter since areal extent varies across different regions area weighted mt cdhw days were estimated for all selected climate regions fig 2 a show only the statistically significant at 5 significance level spearman s partial correlation see methods between the region wise area weighted mt cdhw days and the interannual variability of the large scale climate indices and ant for the period 1982 2016 for the selected climate regions the results suggest that ant exerts strong influence on the observed mt cdhw days during the period 1982 2016 fig 2a which is consistent with previous studies that have suggested a progressive global warming footprint in the occurrence of heatwaves deng et al 2018 droughts wang et al 2016 and cdhw events aghakouchak et al 2014 at the regional scale in addition to that several natural modes of climate variability also show a significant but relatively weak correlations with the occurrences of cdhw events during the analyses period 3 3 1 southern oscillation index interannual variability of soi show statistically significant positive correlation with the area weighted mt cdhw days for the regions cna 0 3 eas 0 273 ena 0 27 med 0 13 was 0 29 and wna 0 15 and negative correlation for the nau 0 2 fig 2a it is well known that enso is one of the major natural modes of climate variability that exerts substantial influence in the global occurrences of simultaneous droughts singh et al 2021 it tele connects with remote regions through rossby wave trains that either originate directly from central equatorial pacific or propagate as a result of inter basin interactions abid et al 2020 wang et al 2017 3 3 2 indian ocean dipole iod show significant positive correlation for the climate regions such as ceu 0 17 cna 0 1 eas 0 23 med 0 24 sas 0 14 and was 0 32 fig 2a the role of iod has been suggested in the formation of anticyclonic circulation over the eastern asia leading to unusual summer temperature in 1961 and 1994 saji and yamagata 2003 the iod induced divergent flow and diabetic heating anomalies excite the rossby wave train propagation during summer towards the eas climate region qiu et al 2014 impact of iod is also linked to the circulation changes over the europe and north america guan and yamagata 2003 saji and yamagata 2003 and negative rainfall anomaly over the was climate region barlow et al 2002 a significant warming trend and a 10 20 reduction in rainfall is reported over the indian subcontinent included in the sas climate region over 1901 2012 due to rapid warming of the indian ocean positive iod phase roxy et al 2015 3 3 3 north atlantic oscillation nao strong influence of nao over european heat wave and drought is evidenced through observational studies that suggest excitation of stationary wave train that facilitates anticyclonic weather regimes over the region cassou et al 2005 moreover nao can be associated with the north atlantic jet variability that has strong influence over temperature and precipitation variability over the us and europe mahlstein et al 2012 trouet et al 2018 this is also evident in our correlation analysis that show statistically significant spearman s correlation coefficient over med 0 16 fig 2a besides med three more climate regions eas 0 33 neb 0 16 and was 0 28 also show a significant correlation with the mt cdhw days fig 2a except for neb where the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo is the major driver knight et al 2006 the nao show marked influence on the precipitation and temperature variability over was filippi et al 2014 and eas bollasina and messori 2018 note that due to the short span of the temporal period 1982 2016 we did not include amo in our analysis 3 3 4 pacific decadal oscillation pdo pdo show relatively strong negative correlation for three north american regions cna 0 38 ena 0 31 and wna 0 11 fig 2a which is consistent with the findings of previous studies that have documented significant influence of pdo on drought and heat wave events across the conterminous us dulière et al 2013 mccabe et al 2004 peterson et al 2013 moreover we find negative correlation with the interannual variability of pdo fig 2a and the number of mt cdhw days over the eas 0 33 and was 0 33 fig 2a climate regions which is also supported by previous observational studies yu et al 2018 however significant correlations between variability in pdo and climate regions such as nau 0 11 ceu 0 11 and med 0 24 indicate a possible indirect influence on the cdhw events over these regions therefore we exclude such influences in the further analysis of cdhw events over these regions 3 3 5 arctic oscillation ao and southern annular mode sam sam shows positive correlation for the climate regions in the northern hemisphere such as ceu 0 11 eas 0 2 ena 0 12 med 0 22 sas 0 19 was 0 4 and wna 0 1 fig 2a on the other hand significant correlation is found for climate regions nau 0 14 and neb 0 34 in the southern hemisphere fig 2a it is evidenced that positive sam has a strong influence on the frequency and poleward expansion of anticyclones in the southern hemisphere gillett et al 2006 marshall et al 2014 pepler et al 2019 with intensification of rossby wave in the eastern australia however except for eas wu et al 2015 there is no such evidence of sam index in the northern hemisphere therefore the impact of sam is not considered in the further analysis of cdhw events over the northern hemisphere climate regions ceu ena med sas was and wna on the other hand ao that has significant influence over the increased frequency and expansion of anticyclones in the northern hemisphere pepler et al 2019 also show significantly weak correlation for climate regions ceu 0 14 cna 0 17 neb 0 19 and was 0 1 in our further analysis we exclude the effect of ao over the climate regions such as was and neb finally based on the correlative evidence provided in this section a chord diagram is presented fig 2b to show the selected large scale climate indices along with the ant that has a significant impact on the occurrence of cdhw events for the selected climate regions 3 4 scaling factors associated with cdhws the selected large scale meteorological perturbations and ant fig 2b were used as independent variables to fit the flm see methods section for the 10 climate regions our aim is to find the possible relationship between the odds of having at least one cdhw day in a month and the combined effect of large scale modes of climate variability and ant based on the observational record the odds of having at least one cdhw day in a month indicate the minimum possible risk associated with the increasing anomalies in these global climate patterns and ant therefore monthly binary outcomes 0 and 1 of occurrence and non occurrence of cdhw day were used as dependent variables into the flm see methods to account for the anthropogenic component into the flm changes in the monthly global mean temperature with respect to the pre industrial period 1861 1890 was also added as one of the independent variables note that all the independent monthly variables natural and ant were first smoothed by applying a 12 month running mean and then regressed against the monthly time series of the binary variable finally the scaling factors and their 5 and 95 confidence intervals ci obtained after fitting the flm for each of the climate regions are shown in fig 3 these scaling factors and their ci suggest the multiplicative increase β 1 or decrease β 1 in the monthly odds of a cdhw day for per unit increase in the large scale climate indices and ant in addition to that we consider a signal from these large scale natural modes of climate variability and ant to have been detected when the ci do not cross zero and consider only the detected signals in our further discussion the results scaling factor 5 to 95 ci from the sensitivity analysis suggest that the rise in ant has a statistically significant positive impact on the odds of occurrence of cdhw days for all selected climate regions ceu 4 1 2 9 5 2 can 3 8 2 7 4 9 eas 5 6 4 1 7 3 ena 2 9 2 3 9 med 4 2 3 5 6 nau 3 7 2 7 4 9 neb 2 2 1 3 2 3 sas 4 2 3 5 4 was 3 2 2 4 4 and wna 3 3 2 2 4 5 fig 3 these findings agree with previous studies that report a substantial increase in dry and hot spells in various regions across the globe due to rise in global warming aghakouchak et al 2014 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 sun et al 2017 2018 zhang et al 2019 however depending on the climate regions the large scale climate oscillations show either positive or negative signals against the odds of occurrence of cdhw day for instance positive phase of soi shows a statistically significant positive relationship scaling factor 5 to 95 ci for the climate regions ena 0 29 0 05 0 53 med 0 29 0 07 0 53 was 0 51 0 11 0 62 and wna 0 36 0 11 0 62 while a negative relationship for nau 0 25 0 44 to 0 07 similarly significant effect of sam can be seen for the climate regions eas 0 6 1 08 to 0 14 nau 0 87 1 26 to 0 5 and neb 0 47 0 14 0 82 increase in positive ao show a significantly positive relationship with the odds of cdhw day for the climate regions ceu 0 79 0 29 1 3 can 0 72 0 18 1 2 and increase in positive pdo showed a statistically significant negative relationship for the climate regions can 0 51 0 88 to 0 14 and ena 0 379 0 69 to 0 07 on the other hand nao and iod show significantly negative and positive relationship with the odds of cdhw day for the climate regions eas 0 92 1 8 to 0 05 and was 2 96 1 53 4 45 respectively however for sas no statistically significant signal is found from the natural variability of the climate thus cdhw occurrences can be strongly attributable to the ant while natural variability has a very weak or no significant in case of sas influence over the odds of cdhw events for the selected regions furthermore the overall relationship of the natural modes of climate variability and ant with the odds of occurrence of cdhw day fig 3 are found to be consistent with that obtained from the correlation analysis with the mt cdhw events fig 2a over the same climate regions 3 5 effect of 1 5 c and 2 c rise in global warming form the sensitivity analysis the monthly odds of occurrence of observed cdhw days can be attributed to the rise in ant in almost all of the climate regions moreover the magnitude of the scaling factors for all the climate regions indicates a substantial increase in the odds with per unit rise in the ant forcing in the future climate given the continuous rise in global temperatures it is likely that global warming may exceed the 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels by the 2030 and mid 21st century respectively lee et al 2021 which indicates a possibility of higher odds in the future compared to the present climate to see the likely level of increase we estimated the ors for these climate regions as the ratio of monthly odds of occurrence of cdhw day in the 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels to that in the current warming level fig 4 presents the two dimensional ci plot showing the or and the corresponding ci for the studied regions that show significant dshw towards drought based on the observational record fig 1d we find or 5 95 ci as high as 3 5 2 5 5 2 2 6 1 98 3 5 2 5 1 9 3 4 2 5 1 9 3 2 2 4 1 8 3 2 3 1 8 3 2 1 1 6 2 8 2 1 6 2 7 1 9 1 6 2 4 and 1 7 1 3 2 for the climate regions eas med sas ceu can nau wna was ena and neb respectively fig 4 these results suggest greater than 1 7 fold increase in the odds of cdhw is likely in the 1 5 c warmer world compared to the present climate note that eas exhibit even higher 3 5 fold increase on the other hand at the 2 c warming level eas med sas ceu cna nau wna was ena and neb are likely to show ors of 60 8 20 4 209 18 22 1 9 1 58 20 9 9 51 3 19 5 8 7 45 9 16 1 7 4 37 2 15 7 7 2 35 5 11 36 5 27 4 10 26 4 5 24 7 8 6 4 4 17 5 and 5 2 2 6 10 7 respectively fig 4 therefore climate regions such as med and sas show about 20 fold increase ceu cna and nau show more than 15 fold increase wna and was show more than 10 fold increase and ena and neb show 5 8 fold increase in the 2 c warmer world again eas shows exceptionally higher levels of odds of having cdhw day in a month with a 60 fold increase at 2 c warming therefore limiting global warming to 1 5 c level can substantially limit the risk of increase in the odds of cdhw day in a month as it can mitigate more than 17 fold increase over eas 5 8 fold increase over wna nau can ceu sas and med and 3 4 fold increase over neb ena was when compared to the odds at 2 c warming level these results suggest pursuing active efforts to keep the warming levels well below the 2 c limit rogelj et al 2016 4 summary and conclusion precipitation and temperature variability is affected by the large scale climate perturbations that often lead to the formation of anticyclonic weather regimes under such circumstances the net radiation received during the daytime becomes the primary component in the surface energy budget that heats up the land surface betts et al 1996 the heating process has been accelerated and further intensified by the increased emission of heat trapping gases due to anthropogenic activities samset 2018 and conditions favored by large scale teleconnections mukherjee et al 2020 leading to increased probability of co occurrence of hw and drought events this study provides a quantitative assessment of the relative effect of anthropogenic warming and large scale teleconnection patterns on the occurrence of cdhw events during the instrumental period 1982 2016 in this study observational evidence has been provided that suggest a substantial increase in the number of cdhw events per year 1 5 events per year across various parts of the globe in the beginning of 21st century 2000 2016 hw events were found to be susceptible to the existing drought conditions to different levels in the different global climate regions for example out of all the 26 climate regions only fifteen showed a significant dshw to the existing drought conditions over more than 2 3rd of their corresponding total area out of these 15 regions the top 10 climate regions showing the greatest magnitudes of dshw are selected for the subsequent analyses monthly total number of cdhw days showed significant positive and negative correlation with the interannual variability of few natural modes of climate variability in some of these climate regions in contrast anthropogenic warming showed significant positive correlation over all the climate regions during the observational period 1982 2016 keeping in mind the various shortcomings of the correlation coefficients such as the susceptibility to outliers and errors arising from linearization we selected the potential large scale climate indices based on the literature review to avoid any statistical artifact in the results attribution study performed based on a logistic regression approach suggest a significantly positive and multiplicative effect of anthropogenic global warming on the odds of cdhw occurrences in the most vulnerable climate regions finally odd ratios were estimated for these climate regions that were found to be in the range of 1 7 3 5 and as high as 5 60 at 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels respectively with respect to the current world moreover these odd ratios suggest about 17 fold reduction in the odds over eas 5 8 fold reduction over wna nau can ceu sas and med and 3 4 fold reduction over neb ena was at the 1 5 c global warming level compared to the 2 c global warming level our findings show that among all the climate regions eas is the most affected region due to the rise in anthropogenic warming overall this study offers a quantitative assessment and understanding of the combined effects of natural climate variability and anthropogenic warming on the cdhw events during the past few decades nevertheless future period may see more amplified large scale teleconnections that may balance or reinforce the impact from increasing anthropogenic warming therefore further scope of improvements in such projections can be accomplished by incorporating the possible effect of warming on large scale climate perturbations even anticyclonic weather regimes which are accompanied by slow moving jet or stationary blocking zones caused by the relatively high pressure ridges may also get affected by increase in warming levels dong et al 2018 therefore should also be considered as additional co factors besides that a detailed analysis including the multiple components of human influences such as the land use practices findell et al 2017 increased effect of dust aerosol huang et al 2015 and surface energy partitioning mukherjee and mishra 2020 can also be beneficial for accurately assessing the future changes in cdhw event characteristics lastly simple regression techniques can only identify the relationships between variables and the cdhw events these techniques are restricted by model assumptions and have limitations in terms of defining the causal linkages that often are more meaningful for prediction purposes therefore necessitating development of more nuanced statistical techniques that robustly captures the causal associations between the drivers and cdhw events credit authorship contribution statement sourav mukherjee conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology visualization validation writing

teleconnections and anthropogenic warming leading to severe socio economic impacts across various climate regions in this study the relative influence of six different teleconnection patterns and anthropogenic global warming on the global cdhw occurrences is quantified systematically using the instrumental data period 1982 2016 the results from the study suggest a substantial increase in the cdhw events 1 5 events per year across various parts of the globe at the beginning of 21st century 2000 2016 a bayesian approach is implemented to identify the most vulnerable climate regions based on the degree of susceptibility of heatwaves dshw towards drought as such top ten most vulnerable regions are selected based on the dshw magnitude and a partial correlation analysis is performed to select the natural and anthropogenic drivers of cdhw in those regions separately a logistic regression model is then used to determine significant changes in the odds of cdhw due to changes in the selected drivers that suggest a significantly positive and multiplicative effect of anthropogenic global warming in the top ten most vulnerable climate regions finally the same logistic regression model integrated with an analytical framework is applied to determine the relative influence of anthropogenic global warming on the changes in odds of cdhw for the future 1 5 c and 2 c warming limits the results suggest that relative to the 2 c global warming constraining to the 1 5 c global warming limit may conduce about 17 fold reduction in the odds of cdhw in the most vulnerable climate region

eastern north america and west asia keywords compound drought and heatwave natural climate variability climate change global warming hydroclimatic extreme events 1 introduction compound drought and heatwave cdhw events have had multiple societal and eco hydrological impacts including loss of crop yield ciais et al 2005 zampieri et al 2017 increased wildfires and tree mortality allen et al 2010 and health hazards poumadère et al 2005 cdhw events are typically triggered by anticyclonic flow patterns trenberth and fasullo 2012 followed by land atmosphere feedback processes that modulate the surface energy budget mukherjee et al 2020 mukherjee and mishra 2020 natural modes of climate variability are instrumental in influencing global circulation patters that lead to conditions favoring the development of anticyclonic regimes over terrestrial regions mukherjee et al 2020 pepler et al 2019 observations indicate a poleward expansion of these regimes in both hemispheres during the past few decades which is attributed to intensification and poleward shift in main storm tracks in mid latitudes associated with warming lu et al 2007 pepler et al 2019 trenberth et al 2014 yin 2005 the anticyclonic anomalies in the atmosphere are accompanied with clear skies or lack of moisture in the lower atmosphere making conditions less conducive for precipitation and thereby facilitating drought conditions the lack of surface moisture leads to excessive sensible heating at the expense of decreased latent energy or evapotranspiration causing surface warming the prolonged period of high surface temperatures eventually lead to heatwaves hw horton et al 2016 stéfanon et al 2014 resulting in the occurrence of cdhw events additionally the rise in surface air temperature further exacerbates drought conditions by initiating a land atmosphere feedback loop with the soil moisture by increasing the atmospheric demand leading to increased evapotranspiration this feedback process is very common in the anticyclonic weather regimes and is generally referred as the soil temperature coupling betts et al 1996 seneviratne et al 2010 whan et al 2015 anthropogenic climate change has already accelerated such processes leading to increased frequency of cdhw events across many parts of the globe mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 mukherjee and mishra 2020 sun et al 2017 2018 zhang et al 2019b given the role of temperature anomalies in the occurrence of chdw events drought quantification using only precipitation may lead to underestimation of drying dai and zhao 2017 which can lead to uncertainties in the characterization of cdhw events mukherjee et al 2020 mukherjee and mishra 2020 therefore it is imperative that soil moisture and surface temperature anomalies are incorporated in the estimation of cdhw using the energy budget framework to this end palmer drought severity index pdsi wells et al 2004 is a comprehensive drought index that incorporates hydroclimatic variables relevant to the estimation of drought under the changing climate mukherjee et al 2018 furthermore as previously noted the large scale natural modes of climate variability are instrumental in the formation of anticyclonic regimes and that anthropogenic footprint is detectable in the intensification of conditions that are conducive for the occurrence of extreme dry and hot conditions hassan and nayak 2020 lau and kim 2012 pepler et al 2019 therefore there is a need to establish analytical frameworks that not only identify relevant modes of climate variability that exert influence on distribution of chdw events across the globe but also incorporate the relative influence of anthropogenic warming ant on the evolution of cdhw events hao et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2019b in this study we present a comprehensive global analysis on the relative effect of anthropogenic warming and natural climate variability on cdhw events for the first time first we focus on the identification of natural and anthropogenic climate forcings that play a significant role in the occurrence of cdhw events during the 1982 2016 historical period subsequently we estimate the possible increase of such events at 1 5 c and 2 c future warming scenarios and discuss its implication for mitigation strategies the rest of the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 focuses on the data and methodology applied in the study the results and relevant discussions are provided in section 3 and finally the summary of major findings and concluding remarks are provided in section 4 2 data and

weekly cdhw events from 1982 to 2016 to evaluate the relative influence of anthropogenic warming and natural climate variability of the cdhw events we calculated global mean temeprature changes and selected six different natural modes of climate varability for analysis table s1 for the calculation of global mean temeprature changes global gridded monthly temperature anomaly data provided by hadcrut4 morice et al 2012 was obtained from https crudata uea ac uk cru data temperature we further re calculated the anomalies over the globe using the pre industrial era 1861 1890 as the baseline period and then obtained the global mean temperature change referred hereafter as ant in this study the six natural modes of varability include southern oscillation index soi dipole mode index dmi iod

compared to the other rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp6 2 2 estimation of compound drought and heatwave cdhw events cdhw events are estimated following the procedure proposed in mukherjee et al 2020 drought estimation at weekly time scale can help to retain the memory of soil temperature and moisture inherited within a short time scale mukherjee et al 2020 this approach not only captures the diurnal feedback loop but also produces a considerable sample size required in the statistical analysis of rare events such as the co occurrence of hw and drought in this study we define a cdhw event as a hw event that occurred during the drought weeks over a given location and temporal period a threshold based approach was used to identify cdhw events during 1982 2016 at each grid point the 10th percentile of weekly self calibrated pdsi wpdsi sc for the reference period 1982 2011 were obtained as a threshold and any wpdsi sc value below that threshold was estimated as a drought week for the period 1982 2016 mukherjee et al 2020 mukherjee and mishra 2020 cdhw events were then identified when daily tmax value exceeded the 90th percentile tx90pct fischer and knutti 2015 meehl and tebaldi 2004 perkins et al 2012 unkašević and tošić 2013 for 3 or more consecutive days during these drought weeks the tx90pct was caluclated for each calender day as the 90th percentile of daily tmax over each 31 day window during the 30 years 1982 2011 climatological period fischer and schär 2010 2 3 measurement of degree of susceptibility of hw dshw towards drought to get a measure to which it is more likely that hw and drought will co occur in a particular location we estimated the degree of susceptibility of hw towards drought dshw in the historical period the dshw was estimated by using a bayesian approach based on the conditional formulation of cdhw events followed by a statistical test for significance first probability pe and pc of occurrence of two mutually exclusive extreme events hw events with and without an already existing drought that influences the background state of the climate were estimated based on the observational record across the globe statistically significant at 5 significance level pe pc ratio greater than 1 was obtained using the two proportion z test or chi square test the z statistic is based on a standard normal distribution therefore to remove the normality assumption the results were obtained for the two mutually exclusive events i e hw events with and without an already existing drought by resampling producing 1000 realizations each with replacement the resampling is performed based on the following steps a first the number of days with drought occurrences d no drought occurrences nd hw occurrences h and non occurrences nh are recorded for a given grid point b the pe and pc values from the above information is used to calculate the z statistics from the observed sample c a matrix consisting of binary elements 1 and 0 is generated based on the number of hw occurrences h indicated by the number of 1 s and non occurrences nh indicated by the number of 0 s d for a given realization out of total 1000 selected here total d samples are chosen with replacement from the binary matrix and stored as m1 subsequently pe is calculated as the sum of all 1 s and zeroes from the matrix m1 divided by the number of drought days d e similarly total nd samples were chosen with replacement from the binary matrix and stored as m2 subsequently pc is calculated as the sum of all 1 s and zeroes from the matrix m2 divided by the number of non drought days nd f the z statistics from the sampling distribution is calculated based on the pe and pc values from the sampling distribution g finally 1000 samples of the z statistics for the sampling distribution are generated by repeating the steps in c d e and f 1000 times finally the proportion of the z statistic from the sampling distribution which had absolute values as large or larger than that observed z statistic is calculated we rejected the null hypothesis of equal proportions if that proportion was greater than 0 05 the pe pc ratio showing a significantly greater than 1 value was thus obtained at each grid point and defined as the dshw in this study the detailed formulation of z statistics and the dshw is provided in appendix a of the supplemental information 2 4 estimation of partial correlaton partial correlation is the measure of association between two variables while controlling or adjusting the effect of one or more additional or confounding variables

of multiple large scale teleconnection patterns e g enso pdo nao and iod on temperature extremes and drought across many regions of the globe ashok and saji 2007 hu and huang 2009 manatsa et al 2008 mukherjee and mishra 2020 rajagopalan et al 2000 zhang et al 2019a in this study a non parametric spearman s rank correlation analysis was performed to identify possible drivers large scale oscillation patterns and ant that influence the cdhw events hence sstatistically significant at 5 significance level spearman s partial correlation between the region wise area weighted number of mt cdhw days and the interannual variability of the large scale climate indices and ant for the period 1982 2016 were estimated for the selected climate regions such that 1 r xyz r xy r xz r yz 1 r xz 2 1 r yz 2 where r xyz is the relative correlation between area weighted number of mt cdhw days and y largescale climate indices or ant with the effect of z either of the other indices or ant are removed in order to account for the inter dependence of different climate modes meyers et al 2007 perkins et al 2015 and ant we employ partial correlation technique equation 8 to isolate the influence of individual forcing 2 5 measurement of odds of occurrence of cdhw events previous studies have confirmed the link between the odds of occurrence of extreme events and other climate variables using logistic regression mahlstein et al 2012 zhai et al 2005 in this study we investigated the relative effect of large scale teleconnection patterns and anthropogenic warming based on odds ratios calculated using the firth logistic regression model the odds of occurrence of cdhw events in any month is calculated using the interannual variability of large scale climate indices and changes in the global mean temperature during the period 1982 2016 as predictors a detailed discussion on the application of the logistic regression model is discussed in the following section 2 5 1 logistic regression model we applied a multiple predictor based firth logistic regression model that is a special form of generalized linear model lindsey 2000 to estimate the penalized regression coefficients corresponding to natural and anthropogenic variability of the climate the firth s model applies penalized likelihood estimation rather than performing the conventional maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the penalized regression coefficients the penalization allows for convergence of the likelihood to finite estimates in conditions of separation and also with sparse data and therefore may alleviate overfitting albert and anderson 1984 in our analysis we used the following logistic regression model 2 log i t y ln π 1 π β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n natural c o m p o n e n t β ant x ant anthropogenic c o m p o n e n t α where π 1 π is the odds of having more than two cdhw events per year x 1 x 1 x n are the large scale climate indices used in the model and x ant is the change in global mean temperature with respect to the pre industrial period 1861 1900 α β 1 β 2 β n and β ant are the corresponding penalized regression coefficients or scaling factors once the model was fitted for the observational distribution the penalized regression coefficients were obtained that we refer as the scaling factors in this study 2 6 estimating odd ratio for 1 5 c and 2 c global warming one of our objectives is to answer the science question how much more likely will there be a cdhw day in a month at 1 5 c and 2 c global warming scenarios than there is at the current level of anthropogenic warming this was achieved by changing the anthropogenic component to different warming levels current 1 5 c and 2 c while keeping the natural component constant in the regression model we estimated the current level of warming based on the average of monthly temperature anomalies estimated with respect to the pre industrial period 1861 1890 for the current world finally the odd ratio or of monthly occurrence cdhw day for the future warming limits 1 5 c and 2 c to that for the current warming level was estimated as 3 o r t c π 1 π t c π 1 π current exp α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n natural c o m p o n e n t β ant t exp α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n natural c o m p o n e n t β ant x current exp β ant t exp β ant x current where t is the selected warming limit of 1 5 c and 2 c and xcurrent refers to the current warming level with respect to the pre industrial period 3 results 3 1 annual increase in the number of cdhw events the number of cdhw events has increased annually during the 21st century post 2000 compared to that observed during the last two decades of the 20th century pre 2000 fig 1 a figs s2a and 1 a show the spatial distribution of the average number of events during the pre 2000 and post 2000 periods and the corresponding difference in the same between the two periods respectively fig 1 b show the nonparametric probability density for the average number of cdhw events during the pre and post 2000 periods of the globe we also performed the kolmogorov smirnov and wilcoxon rank sum tests to show that there is a statistically significant at 5 significance level difference between the distributions and medians of the cdhw events respectively between these two periods our analysis suggests an overall annual range of 1 5 events during the post 2000 period fig s2b with major portions included in most of the climate regions showing an increase of 1 3 number of events per year fig 1a those regions include the southern parts of wna and can eastern nau eastern and southeastern saf northeastern sas eastern ena northern med central neu and almost all over was ceu and neb in addition to that regions such as the southern eas eastern ala western cgi and central amz show an increase of as high as 5 annual events during the post 2000 period however cgi and ala are excluded form rest of the analyses due to poor quality of available data over these regions 3 2 degree of susceptibility of hw dshw towards drought we focus on finding the locations where it is significantly more likely to have hw and drought co occurred on a particular day based on observations fig s3 we find that majority of grid points show higher dshw towards a persistent drought week pe pc greater than 1 fig 1c however the percentage of total area showing such dshw varies across the different climate regions fig 1d climate regions sea waf eaf cam nas tib and cgi exhibit more than half of the area with statistically significant pe pc ratio greater than 1 while sah wsa ssa and amz have less than half of the total area satisfying such conditions more importantly the rest of the 26 climate regions can ceu eas wna was neb ena nau sas med cas ala neu saf and sau exhibit more than 2 3rd of the area that shows statistically significant degree of susceptibility of hw under an ongoing drought condition with majority of them showing pe pc ratio as high as more than 5 fig 1c therefore out of all 26 climate regions considered in this study we selected the top 10 climate regions that show a significant dshw over more than 2 3rd of the total area fig 1d interestingly these regions also show an increase in the number of cdhw events during the post 2000 period as shown in fig 1a consequently we performed the rest of the analyses based on these 10 climate regions 3 3 possible natural and anthropogenic drivers previous studies suggest possible links between the large scale global circulation patterns or oceanic variabilities and anticyclonic regimes in both the northern and southern hemisphere abid et al 2020 garcía serrano et al 2017 pepler et al 2019 singh et al 2021 song and zhou 2013 wang and zhang 2002 therefore understanding and exploring such a relationship is key to identify the attributable factors behind the occurrence of compound events such as the cdhw for the climate regions that exhibit significant dshw towards drought over more than 2 3rd of the total area more precisely we explore possible links between the monthly total number of cdhw mt cdhw days and the interannual variability in the natural climate song and zhou 2013 as well as the influence of rise in ant on such extremes during the historical period we selected six table s1 natural modes of climate variability that exert major influence on the variability of climate globally at seasonal to decadal time scale to represent the interannual variability of these modes monthly anomalies of their representative indices and global mean temperature were smoothed by applying a 12 month running mean filter since areal extent varies across different regions area weighted mt cdhw days were estimated for all selected climate regions fig 2 a show only the statistically significant at 5 significance level spearman s partial correlation see methods between the region wise area weighted mt cdhw days and the interannual variability of the large scale climate indices and ant for the period 1982 2016 for the selected climate regions the results suggest that ant exerts strong influence on the observed mt cdhw days during the period 1982 2016 fig 2a which is consistent with previous studies that have suggested a progressive global warming footprint in the occurrence of heatwaves deng et al 2018 droughts wang et al 2016 and cdhw events aghakouchak et al 2014 at the regional scale in addition to that several natural modes of climate variability also show a significant but relatively weak correlations with the occurrences of cdhw events during the analyses period 3 3 1 southern oscillation index interannual variability of soi show statistically significant positive correlation with the area weighted mt cdhw days for the regions cna 0 3 eas

substantial influence in the global occurrences of simultaneous droughts singh et al 2021 it tele connects with remote regions through rossby wave trains that either originate directly from central equatorial pacific or propagate as a result of inter basin interactions abid et al 2020 wang et al 2017 3 3 2 indian ocean dipole iod show significant positive correlation for the climate regions such as ceu 0 17 cna 0 1 eas 0 23 med 0 24 sas 0 14 and was 0 32 fig 2a the role of iod has been suggested in the formation of anticyclonic circulation over the eastern asia leading to unusual summer temperature in 1961 and 1994 saji and yamagata 2003 the iod induced divergent flow and diabetic heating anomalies excite the rossby wave train propagation during summer towards the eas climate region qiu et al 2014 impact of iod is also linked to the circulation changes over the europe and north america guan and yamagata 2003 saji and yamagata 2003 and negative rainfall anomaly over the was climate region barlow et al 2002 a significant warming trend and a 10 20 reduction in rainfall is reported over the indian subcontinent included in the sas climate region over 1901 2012 due to rapid warming of the indian ocean positive iod phase roxy et al 2015 3 3 3 north atlantic oscillation nao strong influence of nao over european heat wave and drought is evidenced through observational studies that suggest excitation of stationary wave train that facilitates anticyclonic weather regimes over the region cassou et al 2005 moreover nao can be associated with the north atlantic jet variability that has strong influence over temperature and precipitation variability over the us and europe mahlstein et al 2012 trouet et al 2018 this is also evident in our correlation analysis that show statistically significant spearman s correlation coefficient over med 0 16 fig 2a besides med three more climate regions eas 0 33 neb 0 16 and was 0 28 also show a significant correlation with the mt cdhw days fig 2a except for neb where the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo is the major driver knight et al 2006 the nao show marked influence on the precipitation and temperature variability over was filippi et al 2014 and eas bollasina and messori 2018 note that due to the short span of the temporal period 1982 2016 we did not include amo in our analysis 3 3 4 pacific decadal oscillation pdo pdo show relatively strong negative correlation for three north american regions cna 0 38 ena 0 31 and wna 0 11 fig 2a which is consistent with the findings of previous studies that have documented significant influence of pdo on drought and heat wave events across the conterminous us dulière et al 2013 mccabe et al 2004 peterson et al 2013 moreover we find negative correlation with the interannual variability of pdo fig 2a and the number of mt cdhw days over the eas 0 33 and was 0 33 fig 2a climate regions which is also supported by previous observational studies yu et al 2018 however significant correlations between variability in pdo and climate regions such as nau 0 11 ceu 0 11 and med 0 24 indicate a possible indirect influence on the cdhw events over these regions therefore we exclude such influences in the further analysis of cdhw events over these regions 3 3 5 arctic oscillation ao and southern annular mode sam sam shows positive correlation for the climate regions in the northern hemisphere such as ceu 0 11 eas 0 2 ena 0 12 med 0 22 sas 0 19 was 0 4 and wna 0 1 fig 2a on the other hand significant correlation is found for climate regions nau 0 14 and neb 0 34 in the southern hemisphere fig 2a it is evidenced that positive sam has a strong influence on the frequency and poleward expansion of anticyclones in the southern hemisphere gillett et al 2006 marshall et al 2014 pepler et al 2019 with intensification of rossby wave in the eastern australia however except for eas wu et al 2015 there is no such evidence of sam index in the northern hemisphere therefore the impact of sam is not considered in the further analysis of cdhw events over the northern hemisphere climate regions ceu ena med sas was and wna on the other hand ao that has significant influence over the increased frequency and expansion of anticyclones in the northern hemisphere pepler et al 2019 also show significantly weak correlation for climate regions ceu 0 14 cna 0 17 neb 0 19 and was 0 1 in our further analysis we exclude the effect of ao over the climate regions such as was and neb finally based on the correlative evidence provided in this section a chord diagram is presented fig 2b to show the selected large scale climate indices along with the ant that has a significant impact on the occurrence of cdhw events for the selected climate regions 3 4 scaling factors associated with cdhws the selected large scale meteorological perturbations and ant fig 2b were used as independent variables to fit the flm see methods section for the 10 climate regions our aim is to find the possible relationship between the odds of having at least one cdhw day in a month and the combined effect of large scale modes of climate variability and ant based on the observational record the odds of having at least one cdhw day in a month indicate the minimum possible risk associated with the increasing anomalies in these global climate patterns and ant therefore monthly binary outcomes 0 and 1 of occurrence and non occurrence of cdhw day were used as dependent variables into the flm see methods to account for the anthropogenic component into the flm changes in the monthly global mean temperature with respect to the pre industrial period 1861 1890 was also added as one of the independent variables note that all the independent monthly variables natural and ant were first smoothed by applying a 12 month running mean and then regressed against the monthly time series of the binary variable finally the scaling factors and their 5 and 95 confidence intervals ci obtained after fitting the flm for each of the climate regions are shown in fig 3 these scaling factors and their ci suggest the multiplicative increase β 1 or decrease β 1 in the monthly odds of a cdhw day for per unit increase in the large scale climate indices and ant in addition to that we consider a signal from these large scale natural modes of climate variability and ant to have been detected when the ci do not cross zero and consider only the detected signals in our further discussion the results scaling factor 5 to 95 ci from the sensitivity analysis suggest that the rise in ant has a statistically significant positive impact on the odds of occurrence of cdhw days for all selected climate regions ceu 4 1 2 9 5 2 can 3 8 2 7 4 9 eas 5 6 4 1 7 3 ena 2 9 2 3 9 med 4 2 3 5 6 nau 3 7 2 7 4 9 neb 2 2 1 3 2 3 sas 4 2 3 5 4 was 3 2 2 4 4 and wna 3 3 2 2 4 5 fig 3 these findings agree with previous studies that report a substantial increase in dry and hot spells in various regions across the globe due to rise in global warming aghakouchak et al 2014 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 sun et al 2017 2018 zhang et al 2019 however depending on the climate regions the large scale climate oscillations show either positive or negative signals against the odds of occurrence of cdhw day for instance positive phase of soi shows a statistically significant positive relationship scaling factor 5 to 95 ci for the climate regions ena 0 29 0 05 0 53 med 0 29 0 07 0 53 was 0 51 0 11 0 62 and wna 0 36 0 11 0 62 while a negative relationship for nau 0 25 0 44 to 0 07 similarly significant effect of sam can be seen for the climate regions eas 0 6 1 08 to 0 14 nau 0 87 1 26 to 0 5 and neb 0 47 0 14 0 82 increase in positive ao show a significantly positive relationship with the odds of cdhw day for the climate regions ceu 0 79 0 29 1 3 can 0 72 0 18 1 2 and increase in positive pdo showed a statistically significant negative relationship for the climate regions can 0 51 0 88 to 0 14 and ena 0 379 0 69 to 0 07 on the other hand nao and iod show significantly negative and positive relationship with the odds of cdhw day for the climate regions eas 0 92 1 8 to 0 05 and was 2 96 1 53 4 45 respectively however for sas no statistically significant signal is found from the natural variability of the climate thus cdhw occurrences can be strongly attributable to the ant while natural variability has a very weak or no significant in case of sas influence over the odds of cdhw events for the selected regions furthermore the overall relationship of the natural modes of climate variability and ant with the odds of occurrence of cdhw day fig 3 are found to be consistent with that obtained from the correlation analysis with the mt cdhw events fig 2a over the same climate regions 3 5 effect of 1 5 c and 2 c rise in global warming form the sensitivity analysis the monthly odds of occurrence of observed cdhw days can be attributed to the rise in ant in almost all of the climate regions moreover the magnitude of the scaling factors for all the climate regions indicates a substantial increase in the odds with per unit rise in the ant forcing in the future climate given the continuous rise in global temperatures it is likely that global warming may exceed the 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels by the 2030 and mid 21st century respectively lee et al 2021 which indicates a possibility of higher odds in the future compared to the present climate to see the likely level of increase we estimated the ors for these climate regions as the ratio of monthly odds of occurrence of cdhw day in the 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels to that in the current warming level fig 4 presents the two dimensional ci plot showing the or and the corresponding ci for the studied regions that show significant dshw towards drought based on the observational record fig 1d we find or 5 95 ci as high as 3 5 2 5 5 2 2 6 1 98 3 5 2 5 1 9 3 4 2 5 1 9 3 2 2 4 1 8 3 2 3 1 8 3 2 1 1 6 2 8 2 1 6 2 7 1 9 1 6 2 4 and 1 7 1 3 2 for the climate regions eas med sas ceu can nau wna was ena and neb respectively fig 4 these results suggest greater than 1 7 fold increase in the odds of cdhw is likely in the 1 5 c warmer world compared to the present climate note that eas exhibit even higher 3 5 fold increase on the other hand at the 2 c warming level eas med sas ceu cna nau wna was ena and neb are likely to show ors of 60 8 20 4 209 18 22 1 9 1 58 20 9 9 51 3 19 5 8 7 45 9 16 1 7 4 37 2 15 7 7 2 35 5 11 36 5 27 4 10 26 4 5 24 7 8 6 4 4 17 5 and 5 2 2 6 10 7 respectively fig 4 therefore climate regions such as med and sas show about 20 fold increase ceu cna and nau show more than 15 fold increase wna and was show more than 10 fold increase and ena and neb show 5 8 fold increase in the 2 c warmer world again eas shows exceptionally higher levels of odds of having cdhw day in a month with a 60 fold increase at 2 c warming therefore limiting global warming to 1 5 c level can substantially limit the risk of increase in the odds of cdhw day in a month as it can mitigate more than 17 fold increase over eas 5 8 fold increase over wna nau can ceu sas and med and 3 4 fold increase over neb ena was when compared to the odds at 2 c warming level these results suggest pursuing active efforts to keep the warming levels well below the 2 c limit rogelj et al 2016 4 summary and conclusion precipitation and temperature variability is affected by the large scale climate perturbations that often lead to the formation of anticyclonic weather regimes under such circumstances the net radiation received during the daytime becomes the primary component in the surface energy budget that heats up the land surface betts et al 1996 the heating process has been accelerated and further intensified by the increased emission of heat trapping gases due to anthropogenic activities samset 2018 and conditions favored by large scale teleconnections mukherjee et al 2020 leading to increased probability of co occurrence of hw and drought events this study provides a quantitative assessment of the relative effect of anthropogenic warming and large scale teleconnection patterns on the occurrence of cdhw events during the instrumental period 1982 2016 in this study observational evidence has been provided that suggest a substantial increase in the number of cdhw events per year 1 5 events per year across various parts of the globe in the beginning of 21st century 2000 2016 hw events were found to be susceptible to the existing drought conditions to different levels in the different global climate regions for example out of all the 26 climate regions only fifteen showed a significant dshw to the existing drought conditions over more than 2 3rd of their corresponding total area out of these 15 regions the top 10 climate regions showing the greatest magnitudes of dshw are selected for the subsequent analyses monthly total number of cdhw days showed significant positive and negative correlation with the interannual variability of few natural modes of climate variability in some of these climate regions in contrast anthropogenic warming showed significant positive correlation over all the climate regions during the observational period 1982 2016 keeping in mind the various shortcomings of the correlation coefficients such as the susceptibility to outliers and errors arising from linearization we selected the potential large scale climate indices based on the literature review to avoid any statistical artifact in the results attribution study performed based on a logistic regression approach suggest a significantly positive and multiplicative effect of anthropogenic global warming on the odds of cdhw occurrences in the most vulnerable climate regions finally odd ratios were estimated for these climate regions that were found to be in the range of 1 7 3 5 and as high as 5 60 at 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels respectively with respect to the current world moreover these odd ratios suggest about 17 fold reduction in the odds over eas 5 8 fold reduction over wna nau can ceu sas and med and 3 4 fold reduction over neb ena was at the 1 5 c global warming level compared to the 2 c global warming level our findings show that among all the climate regions eas is the most affected region due to the rise in anthropogenic warming overall this study offers a quantitative assessment and understanding of the combined effects of natural climate variability and anthropogenic warming on the cdhw events during the past few decades nevertheless future period may see more amplified large scale teleconnections that may balance or reinforce the impact from increasing anthropogenic warming therefore further scope of improvements in such projections can be accomplished by incorporating the possible effect of warming on large scale climate perturbations even anticyclonic weather regimes which are accompanied by slow moving jet or stationary blocking zones caused by the relatively high pressure ridges may also get affected by increase in warming levels dong et al 2018 therefore should also be considered as additional co factors besides that a detailed analysis including the multiple components of human influences such as the land use practices findell et al 2017 increased effect of dust aerosol huang et al 2015 and surface energy partitioning mukherjee and mishra 2020 can also be beneficial for accurately assessing the future changes in cdhw event characteristics lastly simple regression techniques can only identify the relationships between variables and the cdhw events these techniques are restricted by model assumptions and have limitations in terms of defining the causal linkages that often are more meaningful for prediction purposes therefore necessitating development of more nuanced statistical techniques that robustly captures the causal associations between the drivers and cdhw events credit authorship contribution statement sourav mukherjee conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology visualization validation writing

3784,the groundwater of the coastal aquifers the primary source of drinking water for the community around it is under stress due to changing climatic conditions extreme climate events over exploitation and natural anthropogenic interferences to sustain coastal groundwater it is essential to understand the hydrogeological control on the distribution of salinity and submarine groundwater discharge sgd in various spatial and temporal scales at different depths this study is focused to delineate the sgd and salinity distribution for shallow surficial and deep aquifers by application of the hydrogeochemical and geophysical approach in an intertidal zone the resistivity electrical resistivity tomography ert vertical electrical sounding ves and ground penetrating radar gpr data show surficial aquifers have up to 1 5 m below ground level m bgl have higher freshwater discharge at the post monsoon season and recirculation of infiltrated brackish water with increasing offshore distances the re circulated seawater in distant offshore was also predominant for intermediate 1 5 up to 100 m bgl brackish water saturated and deeper depths 100 m bgl fresh groundwater which is observed from the distinct resistivity contrasts from ves the interaction process for all the depths with seawater has been induced by the coastal hydrodynamics meteoric recharge and fluctuation of groundwater levels however variations of resistivity and sounding data delineate that the groundwater resources underneath the shallow depth brackish water are physically vertically disconnected from the surficial aquifer but spatial variation in sounding data shows the hydraulic connectivity which would lead to a serious concern for fresh groundwater resources where density dependent transportation of solute is plausible both vertically and horizontally keywords aquifer vulnerability salinization hydrodynamics porewater hydraulic connectivity 1 introduction the coastal aquifers are the complex interface between the land and sea which are in vulnerable conditions due to ocean land disposition increasing abstraction rate and changing climatic conditions landward movement of seawater contaminates the fresh inland groundwater resources and the seaward discharge of groundwater can adversely affect the coastal ecosystems debnath et al 2015 in coastal aquifers both shallow and deep the groundwater is hydraulically connected to the sea and has intricate interaction from hourly to seasonal scale debnath et al 2019 das and mukherjee 2019 this surface water groundwater sw gw interaction is predominated by the submarine groundwater discharge sgd in shallow aquifers sub meter scale while seawater intrusion swi is for the deeper aquifer the dynamics of sw gw interaction in shallow seepage faces is rapid which varies even in hourly to diurnal to seasonal scale taniguchi et al 2002 taniguchi et al 2003 bokuniewicz et al 2008 heiss and michael 2014 debnath et al 2015 debnath and mukherjee 2016 debnath et al 2019 whereas in deeper depths this process may vary in seasonal to interannual scale das and mukherjee 2019 transportation of solutes is a major considerable factor for the sustainability of available fresh drinking water resources das and mukherjee 2019 the hydraulic connectivity is possibly responsible for the transportation of solutes vertically from the shallow depths das and mukherjee 2019 das et al 2021a das et al 2021b the interaction of seawater with the deeper aquifers is of greater interest on a local to regional scale as it is the only drinking water resource available for the community living around it yu et al 2016 das and mukherjee 2019 and has rarely being hypothesized and addressed integrated application of hydrological methods with advanced geophysical non invasive techniques electrical resistivity tomography ert vertical electrical sounding ves ground penetrating radar gpr has emerged out as an effective way of understanding these sw gw interaction processes in finer to coarser resolutions with increasing depth of interest viezzoli et al 2010 zarroca et al 2014 goebel et al 2017 de franco et al 2009 zarroca et al 2011 pidlisecky et al 2015 the goal of the study is to delineate the hydrogeological control on groundwater salinity distribution and discharge sgd in spatial and temporal scale for both shallow surficial and deeper aquifers by the application of hydrogeochemistry and geophysical techniques in the micro tidal younger alluvial plain along the coastal tract of bay of bengal bob specifically the study is aimed to 1 address the variation of sgd path by application of ert ves and hydrogeochemistry of the surficial aquifer in temporal scale within this 110 m offshore distance from high tide line htl 2 vertical distribution of salinity within this heterogeneous aquifer and hydraulic connectivity by ert up to accessible depth and ves and 3 groundwater vulnerability in presence of hydraulic connectivity 1 1 literature from the previous study our previous studies have delineated the zone and rate of sgd with its temporal and spatial variability debnath et al 2015 debnath and mukherjee 2016 the measured highest sgd rate was 0 003 0 25 m3 m 2h 1 in post monsoon season while no discharge to 0 15 m3 m 2h 1 for pre monsoon season debnath et al 2016 debnath and mukherjee 2016 for this study site the estimated annual solute fluxes to bob were found to be 240 mm m 2d 1 for no3 and 224 mm m 2d 1 for fetot total iron debnath et al 2018 zones of highest freshwater discharge were identified by the presence of dense algal mats and act as an indicator of the probable discharge path of essential nutrient solute to the bob debnath et al 2018 das et al 2020 local to regional hydrogeological cycles have control on the sgd rate which varies from diurnal to seasonal scale debnath et al 2019 for the sw gw interaction study cl the content was considered as a major conservative solute for surficial aquifer coupled with δ18o signature and it showed the influence of meteoric recharge on marine water recirculation in temporal scales debnath et al 2019 the values of cl is started increasing 5000 mg l from the 30 m offshore distances in pre monsoon seasons while in post monsoon season it started increasing from 60 m offshore distances transect length of the study was 110 m offshore form htl debnath et al 2019 from the porewater study it was observed that with increasing depths the cl concentration was also gradually decreasing the range of cl content varies from 866 to 13460 mg l in the pre monsoon season whereas from 470 to 16126 mg l in the post monsoon season debnath et al 2019 the δ18o signature of the sgd samples ranged from 3 63 to 2 58 and 5 03 to 2 27 in pre and post monsoon seasons debnath et al 2019 the sgd rate cl content and δ18o signature of porewater and seepage water data are used in this study from the previous report of debnath et al 2015 debnath and mukherjee 2016 debnath et al 2018 debnath et al 2019 and das et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted along with the bob in a coastal tract of chandipur 21 26 11 6 n and 87 01 3 1 e orissa india fig 1 the coast can be described as a tidal or marshy flat that emerges during low tide and submerges during high tide with an extensively developed intertidal zone 4 km mukherjee et al 1987 mukhopadhyay et al 2011 the inter tidal zone is formed by the recent and paleo aeolian dunes and further landward by recent alluvium deposits the coastal aquifers in the area are composed of unconsolidated quaternary marine sediments and fluvial deltaic deposits with grain size mostly varying from medium sand with occasional ferric nodules calcareous concretions etc representing both fluvial and fluvio marine facies with discontinuous impermeable clay layer chakrabarti 1991 the study area has a tropical monsoon climate and the temperature varies from 13 to 37 c on an annual scale with a mean annual temperature of 27 c the average precipitation of the study area is about 1500 mm with maximum rainfall 70 occurring during the monsoon season the water table in aquifers of the area is at a depth range of 2 to 4 m below the ground level bgl which varies seasonally 2 2 piezometry a level logger and a barologger were installed at depth of 30 m bgl located 30 m inland from the high tide line htl with a pre set 30 min interval to record the water level wl fluctuations water level sensors solinistlevelogger 3001 were used to measure the sub meter scale groundwater level fluctuations the groundwater level was presented in reversed order concerning ground surface elevation for a better understanding of depth to water level from the surface the level logger has an accuracy of 0 05 fs full scale while barologger measures have an accuracy of 0 05 kpa 2 3 vertical electrical sounding ves schlumberger sounding technique was used in the area to know the vertical variation of resistivity along with depth and to locate the subsurface formations including the fresh water and saline water zones in this method all four electrodes are kept in one line current is sent into the ground through two outer current electrodes and the resulting potential difference is measured between two inner electrodes resistance of the ground is measured for different sets of electrode spacing depth of investigation depends on the resistivity structure in the subsurface the higher the conductivity the more would be the depth of investigation orellana and mooney 1966 patra and bhattacharya 1966 following the methodology of zhody and jackson 1969 shalivahan 2000 choudhury et al 2001 choudhury and saha 2004 and hamzah et al 2007 and based on the known geology of the area the ves investigation was done the correlation has been made between the various lithological units including the groundwater zone and the true resistivity values interpreted for the area ves employing schlumberger electrode configuration with current electrode separation ab of the order of 400 to 800 m were conducted in the study site using aquameter crm 500 this system is capable of handling the maximum current output of 500 ma acquired ves points are marked as a1 a2 and b1 b2 fig 1 in the case of ves a1 and b1 the total length of ab was 400 m and for the other ves transects it was 800 m 2 4 electrical resistivity tomography ert a schlumberger array with 41equally spaced electrodes has been placed to measure apparent resistivity for the profiles along the beach the resistivity profiles were placed both parallel and perpendicular to the htl the parallel and perpendicular profiles are 400 m and 200 m in lengths with 10 m and 5 m inter electrode spacing respectively all the perpendicular profiles are placed along the transect a a b b and c c fig 1 both for pre and post monsoon seasons respectively two and four ert profiles are considered for the pre and post monsoon season respectively in parallel to the htl direction fig 1 each section of resistivity profiles was processed by the inversion of apparent resistivity ρa by using the res2dinv geotomo two dimensional 2d finite element software based on least square inversion by a quasi newton method loke and barker 1996 2 5 ground penetrating radar gpr gpr investigations were carried out in the pre monsoon season in the tidal mudflat of chandipur we have employed a 200 mhz monostatic and shielded antenna with a control unit sir 3000 manufactured by geophysical survey systems inc gssi gpr profiles with 200 mhz shielded antennas were acquired to delineate several sedimentological and hydrogeological features up to 3 to 7 m bgl gpr profiles were placed perpendicular to htl and only one profile was placed parallel to the htl at location c fig 2 fifty gpr profiles with 200 mhz shielded antennas were acquired for the perpendicular profile l l having a length of 30 m and spacing between two profiles was 2 m sixteen gpr profiles were acquired with a profile of 2 and 30 m spacing and length for both of the transect j j and k k with the trend of 146 326 but for m m the trends of the lines were 147 327 all the data were obtained in geological scan mode with equipment settings as follows 64 scans per second 150 ns time window 1024 samples per trace 16 bit per sample and dielectric constant 11 10 the acquired gpr data was processed in the radan 7 software of gssi all the data were treated with the routine processing steps like time zero correction finite impulse response fir filtering and gain deconvolution and migration are applied wherever required but in very few cases the hyperbolas obtained on the gpr reflection profiles of the chandipur area are used in velocity analysis the slope of the intertidal zone was characterized as a gentle slope with an inclination about 1 3 towards the sea for this reason all the gpr profiles are not processed with static corrections the velocity used for time to depth conversion is equal to 0 87 m ns which is estimated from the diffraction hyperbolas obtained along cross shore gpr sections 3 results 3 1 fluctuation of groundwater level and variation of sgd the groundwater level in the 30 m bgl deep observation well varies significantly across the seasons the average groundwater level from the surface varies from 2

relation with meteoric recharge estimated sgd rate was 0 15 and 0 003 to 0 25 m3 m 2 hr 1 in pre and post monsoon seasons the maximum discharge rate was observed at the 5 m offshore distance from the high tide line htl and was recorded 0 15 and 0 25 m3 m 2 hr 1 in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively 3 2 variation of ert in the surficial aquifer 3 2 1 shore perpendicular variations of ert along the transect a a and b b there are significant changes in resistivity from the shoreline to offshore distances up to the depth of 1 5 m bgl the observed resistivity was high at nearshore locations in the post monsoon season than the pre monsoon season along b b the a a has comparatively higher resistivity in the pre monsoon season than the post monsoon season fig 4 in pre monsoon season at a a the resistivity value was high 7 0 ohm m at the top of the surface and gradually decreased to 1 0 ohm m at depth of 3 9 to 5 2 m bgl and again increased up to 3 8 ohm m at the depth of 13 5 m bgl but the post monsoon profile shows that the resistivity value of the top surface is 1 9 ohm m which increases up to 3 ohm m at the depth of 3 m bgl and again gradually goes down to 0 7 ohm m to the depth of 32 m bgl fig 4 at b b during the pre monsoon season the resistivity value was recorded high 8 0 ohm m at the top surface up to 1 m bgl and then it goes down to 1 2 ohm m up to a depth of 26 m bgl in this site the resistivity value is around 1 0 ohm m at the top of the surface and it was highest at 5 2 m bgl depth which decreases up to 27 8 m bgl during the post monsoon season fig 4 the resistivity data from the b b showed the highest resistivity at the top which might indicate the saturated layer with high t sgd the saturation of the layer and the resistivity value might be due to the discharge of the terrestrial freshwater because of this the resistivity value was high in post monsoon than in the pre monsoon season the resistivity range at c c has higher values in the pre monsoon season than the post monsoon season the top layer has a resistivity value of 1 5 and 0 8 ohm m in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively at a depth of 1 to 5 m bgl the resistivity value varies between 1 and 1 7 and 1 to 1 2 ohm m in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively in the deeper region 5 m bgl the resistivity value was increasing in both seasons up to a depth of 60 m bgl the resistivity range was narrow for the post monsoon season than the pre monsoon season although this profile has shown saturated medium to coarse sand up to 5 m bgl saturated clayey sand from 5

extreme southwest to northeast of the shoreline which is d d e e f f and g g d d profile shows the variation of resistivity within the range of 1 5 to 2 5 ohm m from the top surface to 30 m bgl the resistivity values vary from 0 7 to 1 5 ohm m within the depth of 30 to 79 m bgl fig 5 similarly for the parallel profile e e the resistivity values vary within the range of 1 5 to 3 ohm m from the top surface up to a depth of 30 m bgl and 1 to 1 5 ohm m from 30 to 67 m bgl depth while higher variability of resistivity of 1 to 5 ohm m is observed within the depth range of 67 to 78 m bgl resistivity profiles f f and g g have similar variabilities of around 2 ohm m within the depth of 30 m bgl from the top surface and lower resistivity values are found for the depth of 30 to 78 m bgl fig 5 a significant variation in the resistivity values from the top surface layer up to 24 m bgl is identified in both pre and post monsoon seasons in the post monsoon season two ert profiles have been considered for the study from the extreme southwest h h of the beach to the extreme northeast i i location profiles from the post monsoon h h showed resistivity values vary mostly within the range of 2 to 4 5 ohm m for the depth range of 0 to 24 m bgl the variation of the resistivity values from the depth of 24 to 78 m bgl is found to be within the range of 1 5 to 0 20 ohm m while the post monsoon profile i i has wide variability along with the depth and distance i i profile has a resistivity variation of 1 5 to 2 5 ohm m from 0 to 25 m bgl and 0 8 to 2 0 ohm m from the depth of 25 to 68 m bgl fig 5 3 3 vertical electrical sounding ves vertical variation of resistivity data shows significant changes in the lithological configuration and the saturation level with brackish to freshwater at site a ves data shows higher resistivity of around 8 to 6 ohm m within 1 m depth from the surface at 20 m offshore distance whereas it shows 0 7 ohm m around the depth of 1 m from the surface at 40 m offshore distance layek et al 2018 at 20 m offshore distance at a depth from 1 to 10 m bgl the resistivity value is estimated to be 1 87 ohm m fig 6 but the ves data at 40 m offshore distance has estimated this value to around 2 ohm m the resistivity values vary around 1 5 ohm m up to the depth of 100 m bgl from 10 m bgl in each location fig 6 so variation in resistivity shows sgd with a higher freshwater fraction at the nearshore location from the top surface and the fraction of freshwater decreasing with offshore distance as reflected from the low resistivity values ves data along b b shows similar variations for the shallow depth and as well as for nearshore to offshore distances in location b the top layer up to 1 m bgl has a resistivity of around 4 15 ohm m in 20 m offshore and 0 9 ohm m in 40 m offshore distance similarly lower resistivity was observed from the depth of 1 to 100 m bgl fig 6 lowering of resistivity with higher depth from nearshore to offshore might be due to the saturation of clay layer with brackish to saline water another ves profile around location c has a resistivity of around 3 and 2 ohm m up to a depth of 1 m bgl in 7 m offshore and 27 m offshore distance respectively fig 6 at nearshore and offshore locations the resistivity values were estimated to be 33 and 10 ohm m within the depths of 1 to 5 m bgl respectively beyond 5 m bgl depth the resistivity value goes down from 9 ohm m to 1 33 ohm m and 2 01 to 1 25 ohm m at a depth of 100 m bgl in both nearshore and locations further away from shore the resistivity value was increased from 2 to 23 ohm m from the depth 100 m bgl to an extended accessible depth of 160 m bgl of both of the locations fig 6 an increase in the resistivity value is indicating the presence of a layer saturated with freshwater while a decrease indicates a brackish water saturated layer 3 4 ground penetrating radar entrapment of seawater on the upper surface or the sediment saturation by seawater causes rapid signal dissipation and loss as a result sections of many profiles extending below the high tidewater line on either the ocean facing beach or landward margin of a barrier along with deeper profile sections affected by saltwater intrusion are often reflection free van overmeeren 1998 however for delineating the freshwater brackish water contact gpr becomes an excellent mapping tool gpr profiles revealed the sgd zone at depth of 0 4 to 2 68 m bgl in this radar section this surface is identified with the high amplitude band like feature some of the places in the radargram yielded rapid signal attenuation or absence of reflection which represents the salt water intrusion but the prominent interaction zone is demarked in between the offset of 21 33 m and 25 71 m the radar section along the j j fig 7 demarcates the boundary between unsaturated and saturated layers which was more dispersed on the radargram due to the presence of fine grained sediments annan et al 1991 doolittle et al 2006 the water table reflector at a depth of 2 0 2 5 m is showing an almost linear continuous dispersed and not easily distinguishable signature in this profile this feature crosscuts the intertidal dune geometry and also truncates the lee side reflections of the dune in this radar section capillary fringe appears as discontinuous wide and high amplitude reflections just above the water table gpr profiles along k k fig 8 a b c d showed the dipping reflections in both landward and seaward sides of the shore normal gpr profiles of bx14 and bx16 respectively these are interpreted as dipping beds of the dune a trough of the dune towards the sea is mapped below the water table in gpr profile bx14 whereas the interdunal surface is replaced by sand depositions in the profile along bx16 the average depth of the saturated water surface is about 3 0 m bgl throughout both sections the water table goes up on the seaward side as it follows the internal bedding plane of the seaward dune otherwise it has a cross cut relationship with dipping reflections the coarser dune sand saturated with the freshwater gives a high dielectric contrast with the unsaturated overlying sand and is mapped as a high amplitude reflection a shore perpendicular profile at site c l l fig 9 shows the gpr profile cx2 which was acquired from the wet and marshy flat to backshore saline water intrusion zone appears in this section as no amplitude to very low amplitude reflection zone below the contact of freshwater and saltwater due to the high difference in conductivities the interface of freshwater saltwater appears as a sharp contact consisting of a series of three bands one negative pulse in between two positive vibrations the freshwater saltwater boundary is inclined at an angle about 30 up to 21 m distance from the end of the profile eop and then it became steeper up to 25 m eop this boundary reflection experienced a signal loss in between 30 and 55 m distance from the sea which may be due to the signal loss in finer grained topsoil material in this section the water table reflection is demarcated at a depth of 0 75 m from the datum the interface of freshwater and seawater existed almost at the top of the radar section thus inferring the groundwater discharge zone and having several discharge points debnath et al 2015 the shore parallel profile at location c m m di10 was taken at a distance of 16 m from the shoreline towards the tidal flat as shown in fig si 2 after applying predictive deconvolution and kirchhoff s migration this profile has identified the water table at a depth of 2 3 m bgl the water table has shown a horizontal continuous high amplitude and flat lying reflection along with the profile in this case it serves as a non dispersive boundary because of the overlying coarse textured wash over deposits gravel sheets at the top of the profile and a laminated sand layered zone has been identified for the profile dx32 fig si3 which are separated by a strong flat lying refelctor at a depth of 2 5 m bedding planes of dune are observed in this high resolution profile as the erosional processes are more active in this region the rest of the dune surfaces may have been eroded away and a lesser portion left above the erosional surface the gpr profile dx35 fig si4 has recognized the preservation of dune beds below the erosional surface two facies i e the upper gravel facies and the lower sand facies are joined at this erosional surface and has a vertical contact with saline brackish water saturated zone seaward dipping reflections from the internal bedding of dune beds are identified as a deeper penetration below 3 m in the landward side 4 discussion 4 1 sgd signature and variation of resistivity in the surficial aquifer in surficial aquifers salinity has an inverse relationship with resistivity values in both pre and post monsoon seasons spatially the low cl content with higher resistivity values was observed in nearshore locations and higher cl content with lower resistivity values was observed with increasing offshore distances fig 10 the variation of resistivity and cl the content of the discharging water is a contribution of both terrestrially derived freshwater fraction t sgd and the recirculated seawater m sgd through the seepage face which varies from tidal to seasonal scale debnath et al 2019 this contribution of fresh sgd t sgd is related to the meteoric recharge and is aggravated by higher groundwater levels in the post monsoon season than the pre monsoon season for the shallow depth up to 1 5 m bgl fig 3 the spatial variation of sgd having a higher t sgd fraction have higher resistivity values in surficial sediments extends up to 50 m offshore distances in post monsoon season while it only extends up to 30 m from htl in pre monsoon season fig 11 the geometry of the mixed brackish and freshwater wedges varied seasonally due to the potential loads of meteoric recharge which is directly related to the resistivity variations and change in cl content debnath et al 2019 das et al 2020 in the fine scale study the circulation of the salinity lens varies with the sgd pattern within the shallow aquifer the lithological variations showed brackish water saturated sandy clay and fine sand zone as a top layer within the depth of 1 5 m bgl parallel to the shoreline fig 12 previously reported studies identified 1 4 m thick saline water circulation cell above the fresh groundwater but it varies with beach morphology and terrestrial freshwater flow like the present study zarroca et al 2014 goebel et al 2017 the size of the circulation cell varies with the location lithological framework and level of saturation with fresh saline water franco et al 2009 zarroca et al 2014 the size and position of saline water wedges have been forced by the terrestrial freshwater load tidal action seasonal rainfall variation and the saturation of aquifer media with source water franco et al 2009 m bgl 4 2 variation of resistivity with depths and hydraulic connectivity the water table at k k below 3 m bgl was identified by the gpr data and the piezometry also shows the wl was at 3 m bgl in the pre monsoon season fig 12 the sw gw mixing interface was also identified by the gpr reflections which was situated from 30 m offshore distances from the htl and formed a shape followed by the ghyben herzberg theory in a coastal aquifer the gpr study shows the disposition of sw gw interaction interfaces the prominent sgd zone is identified along the shallow unconfined aquifer where groundwater is continuously interacting with the seawater and the zone of dispersion of solutes is continuously changing with the tidal action fig 10 lower resistivity signatures from the depth of 10 to 100 m bgl are indicating the presence of an aquifer layer saturated with the seawater fig 6 the extension of the low to the high resistive zone from nearshore to far offshore distance varies in seasonal scale in this studied area fig 11 above the 100 m bgl depth there were fresh groundwater resources up to 150 m bgl depths as observed from the sounding data fig 6 the intermediate low resistive zone between 10 to 100 m bgl is acting as a physical barrier having a clay layer saturated with brackish water which may inhibit the transportation of solutes contaminants from the shallow aquifer to the deeper levels layek et al 2018 but the changes in resistivity from the shallow and deeper aquifer are synchronous in both of the seasons having higher resistivity in the nearshore zone and low resistivity value in far offshore distances for a a and relatively high resistivity in far offshore distance than the nearshore location for b b the simultaneous change of pore water resistivity between shallow and deeper aquifers potentially indicates the possible hydraulic connectivity all the interfaces of shallow and deeper aquifers are hydraulically connected to the seawater as observed from the changes in isotopic signature and cl concentrations from the shallow aquifers the changes in resistivity values in shallow and deeper aquifers depict local flow as dominant whereas the different range of values in two different layers may depict a higher regional groundwater flow fraction for the deeper aquifer than the shallow aquifer fig 6 the trend of changes in resistivity values in different depths in this heterogeneous aquifer media depicts that there is a minimal chance of local vertical transport or downward migration of solutes from the shallow aquifer the transportation of solutes contaminants from the shallow depths would be more rapid pervasive and acute if the local hydraulic connectivity exits within this heterogeneous lithostratigraphic unit 4 3 coastal hydrodynamics dependent groundwater vulnerability groundwater salinization is a widespread problem associated with coastal aquifers however our study is addressing the sgd dynamics for the surficial aquifer vertical discontinuity from the shallow and deeper aquifer and the salinity distribution in the deeper aquifer having fresh groundwater resources by hydrogeochemical and geophysical signatures our study is expected to contribute to the development of sustainable groundwater management strategies and will account for the amount of fresh groundwater discharge to sea in the form of sgd based on the present and reported study by debnath et al 2015 and debnath and mukherjee 2016 the measured rate of sgd and solute recirculation spatially and depth wise in a micro tidal zone is globally comparable for the deep fresh groundwater resources the declining water level is inviting the nearby seawater into the freshwater aquifer by changing the vertical hydraulic gradient it is evident from the shallow aquifer that the freshwater lens is moving towards the offshore distances in post monsoon season whereas moving back near to htl in pre monsoon season when the piezometric head is low debnath et al 2019 the intensive groundwater abstraction near the coastal areas invite swi locally and if not managed properly would lead to contaminate regionally in the distant future swi is a resultant of the factors such as groundwater recharge groundwater abstraction and sea level rise rasmussen et al 2013 taylor et al 2013 and groundwater salinization has been reported from various parts of india choudhury et al 2001 nair et al 2016 rina et al 2013a rina et al 2013b rejani et al 2008 chidambaram et al 2012 akshitha et al 2021 and many parts of the world pulido bosch et al 1999 escolero et al 2007 panagopoulos 2009 safi et al 2018 polemio and walraevens 2019 meyer et al 2019 hydrochemical differences with depth and offshore distances showed significant changes in resistivity and sounding data therefore the coupling of ves and ert data with gpr projects the sediment textural changes with hydrogeochemical changes although gpr data was limited to only 7 m bgl depth the saturation level of the salinity content within this depth also varies seasonally a higher level of brackish water fraction was observed within this higher depth of a a and c c in post monsoon season whereas b b have a lower fraction of brackish water in the post monsoon season than pre monsoon season as observed from ert data up to accessible depths only fig 4 but the non availability of temporal data ves for deeper depths 100 m bgl limits the identification of the seasonal scale variability of sw gw interaction that is of greater interest as of only fresh groundwater resources to the community around the coastal area 4 4 environmental and anthropogenic influence on sw gw dynamics groundwater storage in modern alluvial systems is under serious threat due to the continuously increasing abstraction rate and unpredictability of the future precipitation rate macdonald et al 2015 lack of understanding of groundwater response in the coastal areas and its vulnerability associated with various stress e g hydrologic climatic anthropogenic modifications the drinking water options for the dense population living in the present study area can be severely jeopardized and more so with the threat of predicted impending potential changes of global sea levels das et al 2021a das et al 2021b while the sw gw dynamics in the coastal area are dependent on the time scale and spatial extension climate change has an impact on the swi due to slr 1 mm yr near study area slr has prolonged effects whereas the anthropogenic activities have seasonal to inter annual scale impacts on it white et al 2005 sanford and pope 2010 taylor et al 2013 in this present study the declining water level in the pre monsoon season shows a lower resistive zone moving towards the htl while in post monsoon season lower resistive zone is moving back from htl to offshore distance which delineates the influx and outflux of seawater to inland freshwater aquifer both for the shallow and deeper aquifer anthropogenic stresses are mostly the result of improper policy implementation on groundwater use to address the unsustainable groundwater abstraction practices bhanja et al 2017 lack of awareness among the local inhabitants would lead to the installation of deeper tube wells without any proper hydrogeological knowledge and huge abstraction is disturbing the equilibrium of groundwater dynamics by creating higher hydraulic gradient differences this disequilibrium of groundwater makes changes in groundwater flow by changing in pressure gradient on another way it changes the 1 the groundwater solute content by inversion of groundwater flow direction leading inland swi and 2 transport of solutes from the shallow contaminated aquifer to a deeper fresh one locally if connected and regionally in this vertical hydraulic connection das and mukherjee 2019 sreekanth and datta 2010 groundwater sustainability of coastal aquifer needs implementation of management practices and also need to address the maximum optimum feasible pumping rates in a day and need to optimize the well locations to meet community needs katsifarakis and petala 2006 singh 2014 das et al 2021a 4 5 implications of geophysical methods to the coastal groundwater resources several studies have been initiated on surficial sediments and integrated onshore offshore measurements of the aquifer layer however the application of combined geophysical methods would provide an insight into sw gw interaction with depth and seasons and the hydraulic connectivity dependent threat of solute transportation integrated gpr ves and ert data have potentially identified the linkages between electrochemical and hydrochemical factors influencing the groundwater discharge along its pathway in seasonal scale for shallow depths variations in resistivity in the present study depict the location and depth affected by the recirculated brackish water m sgd and the zone of terrestrial freshwater t sgd with depths sgd with a higher terrestrial freshwater fraction has a higher resistivity signature whereas the area saturated with saline water has a lower resistivity signature furthermore resistivity images show the information about the sgd flow path and convergence with seawater water along with the flow on the seasonal scale fig 11 this shallow depth solute content with geophysical data helped in understanding the dynamics of coastal groundwater resources of the largest sedimentary framework hence understanding hydrological interactions in the broad area becomes imperative to understand the present day ecological sustainability as well as the resilience of one of the most climate change sensitive coastal areas notwithstanding this significance information on the sgd to the bob and its relationship from the source water to the bob are limited especially in deeper depths salinization of groundwater due to swi in shallow groundwater is a widespread problem than the deeper groundwater resources because as a reason of lateral and vertical hydrostratigraphic differences the seawater in far offshore distances may not have reached the nearshore locations of deeper coastal aquifer a better hydrogeological understanding is required for sustainable groundwater management practices for coastal aquifers advanced geophysical techniques would lead to addressing the conceptual hydrological modeling in terms of inflow of seawater and outflow of fresh groundwater even in places with limited geochemical data especially in the present study a substantial amount of geochemical data is only available for the shallow depths in this data limiting conditions ert and ves data is addressing the broader aspect of sw gw interaction where aquifers are hydraulically connected and transportation of solute is occurring within the small distance from the htl to 110 m offshore both in shallow and deeper depths although the prevailing mechanism is different 5 conclusions in the present study we have tried to demonstrate the spatial and depth wise distribution of fresh groundwater resources in the sw gw interaction zone by using advanced geophysical techniques in conjunction with the conventional hydrological parameters like cl content and wl fluctuations of the coastal aquifer near bob the resistivity ert ves and gpr data show the sub meter scale variations of sw gw for the shallow depth up to 1 5 m below ground level m bgl have higher sgd at the post monsoon season the changes in geomorphic patterns in the aquifer system and saturation with varied source water with depth and seasons showed a significant circulation pattern of terrestrially sourced groundwater in the nearshore zone in shallow depth with 1 5 m bgl from the surface the re circulated seawater in distant offshore was also predominant from shallow 1 5 m bgl to intermediate 1 5 up to 100 m bgl brackish water saturated and deeper depths 100 m bgl fresh groundwater with distinct resistivity values observed from ves excessive groundwater pumping in this complex lithostratigraphic unit may be leading to seawater encroachment which even controls the groundwater flow and recharge processes far inland overexploitation of groundwater resources from the deeper fresh groundwater resources in these hydraulically connected aquifers would aggravate the transportation of solutes from the shallow depths locally if connected regionally and potentially would enhance the swi which may deplete the fresh groundwater resources this abstraction induced change of hydrodynamic transport and enhanced vertical hydraulic gradients would lead to rapid depletion of groundwater resources locally at present conditions and would move towards far inland in the distant future this study would lead to a new realm of understanding of the influence of the coastal hydrodynamic system of the coastal aquifer and near the tropical sea by continuous variability of resistivity as an outcome of the hydrologic variability and scalability authors contribution palash debnath and kousik das conceived the idea of the study and wrote the manuscript with supervision

3784,the groundwater of the coastal aquifers the primary source of drinking water for the community around it is under stress due to changing climatic conditions extreme climate events over exploitation and natural anthropogenic interferences to sustain coastal groundwater it is essential to understand the hydrogeological control on the distribution of salinity and submarine groundwater discharge sgd in various spatial and temporal scales at different depths this study is focused to delineate the sgd and salinity distribution for shallow surficial and deep aquifers by application of the hydrogeochemical and geophysical approach in an intertidal zone the resistivity electrical resistivity tomography ert vertical electrical sounding ves and ground penetrating radar gpr data show surficial aquifers have up to 1 5 m below ground level m bgl have higher freshwater discharge at the post monsoon season and recirculation of infiltrated brackish water with increasing offshore distances the re circulated seawater in distant offshore was also predominant for intermediate 1 5 up to 100 m bgl brackish water saturated and deeper depths 100 m bgl fresh groundwater which is observed from the distinct resistivity contrasts from ves the interaction process for all the depths with seawater has been induced by the coastal hydrodynamics meteoric recharge and fluctuation of groundwater levels however variations of resistivity and sounding data delineate that the groundwater resources underneath the shallow depth brackish water are physically vertically disconnected from the surficial aquifer but spatial variation in sounding data shows the hydraulic connectivity which would lead to a serious concern for fresh groundwater resources where density dependent transportation of solute is plausible both vertically and horizontally keywords aquifer vulnerability salinization hydrodynamics porewater hydraulic connectivity 1 introduction the coastal aquifers are the complex interface between the land and sea which are in vulnerable conditions due to ocean land disposition increasing abstraction rate and changing climatic conditions landward movement of seawater contaminates the fresh inland groundwater resources and the seaward discharge of groundwater can adversely affect the coastal ecosystems debnath et al 2015 in coastal aquifers both shallow and deep the groundwater is hydraulically connected to the sea and has intricate interaction from hourly to seasonal scale debnath et al 2019 das and mukherjee 2019 this surface water groundwater sw gw interaction is predominated by the submarine groundwater discharge sgd in shallow aquifers sub meter scale while seawater intrusion swi is for the deeper aquifer the dynamics of sw gw interaction in shallow seepage faces is rapid which varies even in hourly to diurnal to seasonal scale taniguchi et al 2002 taniguchi et al 2003 bokuniewicz et al 2008 heiss and michael 2014 debnath et al 2015 debnath and mukherjee 2016 debnath et al 2019 whereas in deeper depths this process may vary in seasonal to interannual scale das and mukherjee 2019 transportation of solutes is a major considerable factor for the sustainability of available fresh drinking water resources das and mukherjee 2019 the hydraulic connectivity is possibly responsible for the transportation of solutes vertically from the shallow depths das and mukherjee 2019 das et al 2021a das et al 2021b the interaction of seawater with the deeper aquifers is of greater interest on a local to regional scale as it is the only drinking water resource available for the community living around it yu et al 2016 das and mukherjee 2019 and has rarely being hypothesized and addressed integrated application of hydrological methods with advanced geophysical non invasive techniques electrical resistivity tomography ert vertical electrical sounding ves ground penetrating radar gpr has emerged out as an effective way of understanding these sw gw interaction processes in finer to coarser resolutions with increasing depth of interest viezzoli et al 2010 zarroca et al 2014 goebel et al 2017 de franco et al 2009 zarroca et al 2011 pidlisecky et al 2015 the goal of the study is to delineate the hydrogeological control on groundwater salinity distribution and discharge sgd in spatial and temporal scale for both shallow surficial and deeper aquifers by the application of hydrogeochemistry and geophysical techniques in the micro tidal younger alluvial plain along the coastal tract of bay of bengal bob specifically the study is aimed to 1 address the variation of sgd path by application of ert ves and hydrogeochemistry of the surficial aquifer in temporal scale within this 110 m offshore distance from high tide line

connectivity 1 1 literature from the previous study our previous studies have delineated the zone and rate of sgd with its temporal and spatial variability debnath et al 2015 debnath and mukherjee 2016 the measured highest sgd rate was 0 003 0 25 m3 m 2h 1 in post monsoon season while no discharge to 0 15 m3 m 2h 1 for pre monsoon season debnath et al 2016 debnath and mukherjee 2016 for this study site the estimated annual solute fluxes to bob were found to be 240 mm m 2d 1 for no3 and 224 mm m 2d 1 for fetot total iron debnath et al 2018 zones of highest freshwater discharge were identified by the presence of dense algal mats and act as an indicator of the probable discharge path of essential nutrient solute to the bob debnath et al 2018 das et al 2020 local to regional hydrogeological cycles have control on the sgd rate which varies from diurnal to seasonal scale debnath et al 2019 for the sw gw interaction study cl the content was considered as a major conservative solute for surficial aquifer coupled with δ18o signature and it showed the influence of meteoric recharge on marine water recirculation in temporal scales debnath et al 2019 the values of cl is started increasing 5000 mg l from the 30 m offshore distances in pre monsoon seasons while in post monsoon season it started increasing from 60 m offshore distances transect length of the study was 110 m offshore form htl debnath et al 2019 from the porewater study it was observed that with increasing depths the cl concentration was also gradually decreasing the range of cl content varies from 866 to 13460 mg l in the pre monsoon season whereas from 470 to 16126 mg l in the post monsoon season debnath et al 2019 the δ18o signature of the sgd samples ranged from 3 63 to 2 58 and 5 03 to 2 27 in pre and post monsoon seasons debnath et al 2019 the sgd rate cl content and δ18o signature of porewater and seepage water data are used in this study from the previous report of debnath et al 2015

aquifers of the area is at a depth range of 2 to 4 m below the ground level bgl which varies seasonally 2 2 piezometry a level logger and a barologger were installed at depth of 30 m bgl located 30 m inland from the high tide line htl with a pre set 30 min interval to record the water level wl fluctuations water level sensors solinistlevelogger 3001 were used to measure the sub meter scale groundwater level fluctuations the groundwater level was presented in reversed order concerning ground surface elevation for a better understanding of depth to water level from the surface the level

the vertical variation of resistivity along with depth and to locate the subsurface formations including the fresh water and saline water zones in this method all four electrodes are kept in one line current is sent into the ground through two outer current electrodes and the resulting potential difference is measured between two inner electrodes resistance of the ground is measured for different sets of electrode spacing depth of investigation depends on the resistivity structure in the subsurface the higher the conductivity the more would be the depth of investigation orellana and mooney

lines were 147 327 all the data were obtained in geological scan mode with equipment settings as follows 64 scans per second 150 ns time window 1024 samples per trace 16 bit per sample and dielectric constant 11 10 the acquired gpr data was processed in the radan 7 software of gssi all the data were treated with the routine processing steps like time zero correction finite impulse response fir filtering and gain deconvolution and migration are applied wherever required but in very few cases the hyperbolas obtained on the gpr reflection profiles of the chandipur area are used in velocity analysis the slope of the intertidal zone was characterized as a gentle slope with an inclination about 1 3 towards the sea for this reason all the gpr profiles are not processed with static corrections the velocity used for time to depth conversion is equal to 0 87 m ns which is estimated from the diffraction hyperbolas obtained along cross shore gpr sections 3 results 3 1 fluctuation of groundwater level and variation of sgd the groundwater level in the 30 m bgl deep observation well varies significantly across the seasons the average groundwater level from the surface varies from 2 to 3 m bgl in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively fig 3 the synchronous rising of groundwater level from 3 to 2 m bgl with high rainfall 300 mm of that respective periods indicates significant relation with meteoric recharge estimated sgd rate was 0 15 and 0 003 to 0 25 m3 m 2 hr 1 in pre and post monsoon seasons the maximum discharge rate was observed at the 5 m offshore distance from the high tide line htl and was recorded 0 15 and 0 25 m3 m 2 hr 1 in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively 3 2 variation of ert in the surficial aquifer 3 2 1 shore perpendicular variations of ert along the transect a a and b b there are significant changes in resistivity from the shoreline to offshore distances up to the depth of 1 5 m bgl the observed resistivity was high at nearshore locations in the post monsoon season than the pre monsoon season along b b the a a has comparatively higher resistivity in the pre monsoon season than the post monsoon season fig 4 in pre monsoon season at a a the resistivity value was high 7 0 ohm m at the top of the surface and gradually decreased to 1 0 ohm m at depth of 3 9 to 5 2 m bgl and again increased up to 3 8 ohm m at the depth of 13 5 m bgl but the post monsoon profile shows that the resistivity value of the top surface is 1 9 ohm m which increases up to 3 ohm m at the depth of 3 m bgl and again gradually goes down to 0 7 ohm m to the depth of 32 m bgl fig 4 at b b during the pre monsoon season the resistivity value was recorded high 8 0 ohm m at the top surface up to 1 m bgl and then it goes down to 1 2 ohm m up to a depth of 26 m bgl in this site the resistivity value is around 1 0 ohm m at the top of the surface and it was highest at 5 2 m bgl depth which decreases up to 27 8 m bgl during the post monsoon season fig 4 the resistivity data from the b b showed the highest resistivity at the top which might indicate the saturated layer with high t sgd the saturation of the layer and the resistivity value might be due to the discharge of the terrestrial freshwater because of this the resistivity value was high in post monsoon than in the pre monsoon season the resistivity range at c c has higher values in the pre monsoon season than the post monsoon season the top layer has a resistivity value of 1 5 and 0 8 ohm m in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively at a depth of 1 to 5 m bgl the resistivity value varies between 1 and 1 7 and 1 to 1 2 ohm m in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively in the deeper region 5 m bgl the resistivity value was increasing in both seasons up to a depth of 60 m bgl the resistivity range was narrow for the post monsoon season than the pre monsoon season although this profile has shown saturated medium to coarse sand up to 5 m bgl saturated clayey sand from 5 to 16 m bgl and have fine sand from 16 to 98 m bgl in pre monsoon season fig si 1 3 2 2 shore parallel variations of ert in the pre monsoon season four parallel profiles have been considered from extreme southwest to northeast of the shoreline which is d d e e f f and g g d d profile shows the variation of resistivity within the range of 1 5 to 2 5 ohm m from the top surface to 30 m bgl the resistivity values vary from 0 7 to 1 5 ohm m within the depth of 30 to 79 m bgl fig 5 similarly for the parallel profile e e the resistivity values vary within the range of 1 5 to 3 ohm m from the top surface up to a depth of 30 m bgl and 1 to 1 5 ohm m from 30 to 67 m bgl depth while higher variability of resistivity of 1 to 5 ohm m is observed within the depth range of 67 to 78 m bgl resistivity profiles f f and g g have similar variabilities of around 2 ohm m within the depth of 30 m bgl from the top surface and lower resistivity values are found for the depth of 30 to 78 m bgl fig 5 a significant variation in the resistivity values from the top surface layer up to 24 m bgl is identified in both pre and post monsoon seasons in the post monsoon season two ert profiles have been considered for the study from the extreme southwest h h of the beach to the extreme northeast i i location profiles from the post monsoon h h showed resistivity values vary mostly within the range of 2 to 4 5 ohm m for the depth range of 0 to 24 m bgl the variation of the resistivity values from the depth of 24 to 78 m bgl is found to be within the range of 1 5 to 0 20 ohm m while the post monsoon profile i i has wide variability along with the depth and distance i i profile has a resistivity variation of 1 5 to 2 5 ohm m from 0 to 25 m bgl and 0 8 to 2 0 ohm m from the depth of 25 to 68 m bgl fig 5 3 3 vertical electrical sounding ves vertical variation of resistivity data shows significant changes in the lithological configuration and the saturation level with brackish to freshwater at site a ves data shows higher resistivity of around 8 to 6 ohm m within 1 m depth from the surface at 20 m offshore distance whereas it shows 0 7 ohm m around the depth of 1 m from the surface at 40 m offshore distance layek et al 2018 at 20 m offshore distance at a depth from 1 to 10 m bgl the resistivity value is estimated to be 1 87 ohm m fig 6 but the ves data at 40 m offshore distance has estimated this value to around 2 ohm m the resistivity values vary around 1 5 ohm m up to the depth of 100 m bgl from 10 m bgl in each location fig 6 so variation in resistivity shows sgd with a higher freshwater fraction at the nearshore location from the top surface and the fraction of freshwater decreasing with offshore distance as reflected from the low resistivity values ves data along b b shows similar variations for the shallow depth and as well as for nearshore to offshore distances in location b the top layer up to 1 m bgl has a resistivity of around 4 15 ohm m in 20 m offshore and 0 9 ohm m in 40 m offshore distance similarly lower resistivity was observed from the depth of 1 to 100 m bgl fig 6 lowering of resistivity with higher depth from nearshore to offshore might be due to the saturation of clay layer with brackish to saline water another ves profile around location c has a resistivity of around 3 and 2 ohm m up to a depth of 1 m bgl in 7 m offshore and 27 m offshore distance respectively fig 6 at nearshore and offshore locations the resistivity values were estimated to be 33 and 10 ohm m within the depths of 1 to 5 m bgl respectively beyond 5 m bgl depth the resistivity value goes down from 9 ohm m to 1 33 ohm m and 2 01 to 1 25 ohm m at a depth of 100 m bgl in both nearshore and locations further away from shore the resistivity value was increased from 2 to 23 ohm m from the depth 100 m bgl to an extended accessible depth of 160 m bgl of both of the locations fig 6 an increase in the resistivity value is indicating the presence of a layer saturated with freshwater while a decrease indicates a brackish water saturated layer 3 4 ground penetrating radar entrapment of seawater on the upper surface or the sediment saturation by seawater causes rapid signal dissipation and loss as a result sections of many profiles extending below the high tidewater line on either the ocean facing beach or landward margin of a barrier along with deeper profile sections affected by saltwater intrusion are often reflection free van overmeeren 1998 however for delineating the freshwater brackish water contact gpr becomes an excellent mapping tool gpr profiles revealed the sgd zone at depth of 0 4 to 2 68 m bgl in this radar section this surface is identified with the high amplitude band like feature some of the places in the radargram yielded rapid signal attenuation or absence of reflection which represents the salt water intrusion but the prominent interaction zone is demarked in between the offset of 21 33 m and 25 71 m the radar section along the j j fig 7 demarcates the boundary between unsaturated and saturated layers which was more dispersed on the radargram due to the presence of fine grained sediments annan et al 1991 doolittle et al 2006 the water table reflector at a depth of 2 0 2 5 m is showing an almost linear continuous dispersed and not easily distinguishable signature in this profile this feature crosscuts the intertidal dune geometry and also truncates the lee side reflections of the dune in this radar section capillary fringe appears as discontinuous wide and high amplitude reflections just above the water table gpr profiles along k k fig 8 a b c d showed the dipping reflections in both landward and seaward sides of the shore normal gpr profiles of bx14 and bx16 respectively these are interpreted as dipping beds of the dune a trough of the dune towards the sea is mapped below the water table in gpr profile bx14 whereas the interdunal surface is replaced by sand depositions in the profile along bx16 the average depth of the saturated water surface is about 3 0 m bgl throughout both sections the water table goes up on the seaward side as it follows the internal bedding plane of the seaward dune otherwise it has a cross cut relationship with dipping reflections the coarser dune sand saturated with the freshwater gives a high dielectric contrast with the unsaturated overlying sand and is mapped as a high amplitude reflection a shore perpendicular profile at site c l l fig 9 shows the gpr profile cx2 which was acquired from the wet and marshy flat to backshore saline water intrusion zone appears in this section as no amplitude to very low amplitude reflection zone below the contact of freshwater and saltwater due to the high difference in conductivities the interface of freshwater saltwater appears as a sharp contact consisting of a series of three bands one negative pulse in between two positive vibrations the freshwater saltwater boundary is inclined at an angle about 30 up to 21 m distance from the end of the profile eop and then it became steeper up to 25 m eop this boundary reflection experienced a signal loss in between 30 and 55 m distance from the sea which may be due to the signal loss in finer grained topsoil material in this section the water table reflection is demarcated at a depth of 0 75 m from the datum the interface of freshwater and seawater existed almost at the top of the radar section thus inferring the groundwater discharge zone and having several discharge points debnath et al 2015 the shore parallel profile at location c m m di10 was taken at a distance of 16 m from the shoreline towards the tidal flat as shown in fig si 2 after applying predictive deconvolution and kirchhoff s migration this profile has identified the water table at a depth of 2 3 m bgl the water table has shown a horizontal continuous high amplitude and flat lying reflection along with the profile in this case it serves as a non dispersive boundary because of the overlying coarse textured wash over deposits gravel sheets at the top of the profile and a laminated sand layered zone has been identified for the profile dx32 fig si3 which are separated by a strong flat lying refelctor at a depth of 2 5 m bedding planes of dune are observed in this high resolution profile as the erosional processes are more active in this region the rest of the dune surfaces may have been eroded away and a lesser portion left above the erosional surface the gpr profile dx35 fig si4 has recognized the preservation of dune beds below the erosional surface two facies i e the upper gravel facies and the lower sand facies are joined at this erosional surface and has a vertical contact with saline brackish water saturated zone seaward dipping reflections from the internal bedding of dune beds are identified as a deeper penetration below 3 m in the landward side 4 discussion 4 1 sgd signature and variation of resistivity in the surficial aquifer in surficial aquifers salinity has an inverse relationship with resistivity values in both pre and post monsoon seasons spatially the low cl content with higher resistivity values was observed in nearshore locations and higher cl content with lower resistivity values was observed with increasing offshore distances fig 10 the variation of resistivity and cl the content of the discharging water is a contribution of both terrestrially derived freshwater fraction t sgd and the recirculated seawater m sgd through the seepage face which varies from tidal to seasonal scale debnath et al 2019 this contribution of fresh sgd t sgd is related to the meteoric recharge and is aggravated by higher groundwater levels in the post monsoon season than the pre monsoon season for the shallow depth up to 1 5 m bgl fig 3 the spatial variation of sgd having a higher t sgd fraction have higher resistivity values in surficial sediments extends up to 50 m offshore distances in post monsoon season while it only extends up to 30 m from htl in pre monsoon season fig 11 the geometry of the mixed brackish and freshwater wedges varied seasonally due to the potential loads of meteoric recharge which is directly related to the resistivity variations and change in cl content debnath et al 2019 das et al 2020 in the fine scale study the circulation of the salinity lens varies with the sgd pattern within the shallow aquifer the lithological variations showed brackish water saturated sandy clay and fine sand zone as a top layer within the depth of 1 5 m bgl parallel to the shoreline fig 12 previously reported studies identified 1 4 m thick saline water circulation cell above the fresh groundwater but it varies with beach morphology and terrestrial freshwater flow like the present study zarroca et al 2014 goebel et al 2017 the size of the circulation cell varies with the location lithological framework and level of saturation with fresh saline water franco et al 2009 zarroca et al 2014 the size and position of saline water wedges have been forced by the terrestrial freshwater load tidal action seasonal rainfall variation and the saturation of aquifer media with source water franco et al 2009 m bgl 4 2 variation of resistivity with depths and hydraulic connectivity the water table at k k below 3 m bgl was identified by the gpr data and the piezometry also shows the wl was at 3 m bgl in the pre monsoon season fig 12 the sw gw mixing interface was also identified by the gpr reflections which was situated from 30 m offshore distances from the htl and formed a shape followed by the ghyben herzberg theory in a coastal aquifer the gpr study shows the disposition of sw gw interaction interfaces the prominent sgd zone is identified along the shallow unconfined aquifer where groundwater is continuously interacting with the seawater and the zone of dispersion of solutes is continuously changing with the tidal action fig 10 lower resistivity signatures from the depth of 10 to 100 m bgl are indicating the presence of an aquifer layer saturated with the seawater fig 6 the extension of the low to the high resistive zone from nearshore to far offshore distance varies in seasonal scale in this studied area fig 11 above the 100 m bgl depth there were fresh groundwater resources up to 150 m bgl depths as observed from the sounding data fig 6 the intermediate low resistive zone between 10 to 100 m bgl is acting as a physical barrier having a clay layer saturated with brackish water which may inhibit the transportation of solutes contaminants from the shallow aquifer to the deeper levels layek et al 2018 but the changes in resistivity from the shallow and deeper aquifer are synchronous in both of the seasons having higher resistivity in the nearshore zone and low resistivity value in far offshore distances for a a and relatively high resistivity in far offshore distance than the nearshore location for b b the simultaneous change of pore water resistivity between shallow and deeper aquifers potentially indicates the possible hydraulic connectivity all the interfaces of shallow and deeper aquifers are hydraulically connected to the seawater as observed from the changes in isotopic signature and cl concentrations from the shallow aquifers the changes in resistivity values in shallow and deeper aquifers depict local flow as dominant whereas the different range of values in two different layers may depict a higher regional groundwater flow fraction for the deeper aquifer than the shallow aquifer fig 6 the trend of changes in resistivity values in different depths in this heterogeneous aquifer media depicts that there is a minimal chance of local vertical transport or downward migration of solutes from the shallow aquifer the transportation of solutes contaminants from the shallow depths would be more rapid pervasive and acute if the local hydraulic connectivity exits within this heterogeneous lithostratigraphic unit 4 3 coastal hydrodynamics dependent groundwater vulnerability groundwater salinization is a widespread problem associated with coastal aquifers however our study is addressing the sgd dynamics for the surficial aquifer vertical discontinuity from the shallow and deeper aquifer and the salinity distribution in the deeper aquifer having fresh groundwater resources by hydrogeochemical and geophysical signatures our study is expected to contribute to the development of sustainable groundwater management strategies and will account for the amount of fresh groundwater discharge to sea in the form of sgd based on the present and reported study by debnath et al 2015 and debnath and mukherjee 2016 the measured rate of sgd and solute recirculation spatially and depth wise in a micro tidal zone is globally comparable for the deep fresh groundwater resources the declining water level is inviting the nearby seawater into the freshwater aquifer by changing the vertical hydraulic gradient it is evident from the shallow aquifer that the freshwater lens is moving towards the offshore distances in post monsoon season whereas moving back near to htl in pre monsoon season when the piezometric head is low debnath et al 2019 the intensive groundwater abstraction near the coastal areas invite swi locally and if not managed properly would lead to contaminate regionally in the distant future swi is a resultant of the factors such as groundwater recharge groundwater abstraction and sea level rise rasmussen et al 2013 taylor et al 2013 and groundwater salinization has been reported from various parts of india choudhury et al 2001 nair et al 2016 rina et al 2013a rina et al 2013b rejani et al 2008 chidambaram et al 2012 akshitha et al 2021 and many parts of the world pulido bosch et al 1999 escolero et al 2007 panagopoulos 2009 safi et al 2018 polemio and walraevens 2019 meyer et al 2019 hydrochemical differences with depth and offshore distances showed significant changes in resistivity and sounding data therefore the coupling of ves and ert data with gpr projects the sediment textural changes with hydrogeochemical changes although gpr data was limited to only 7 m bgl depth the saturation level of the salinity content within this depth also varies seasonally a higher level of brackish water fraction was observed within this higher depth of a a and c c in post monsoon season whereas b b have a lower fraction of brackish water in the post monsoon season than pre monsoon season as observed from ert data up to accessible depths only fig 4 but the non availability of temporal data ves for deeper depths 100 m bgl limits the identification of the seasonal scale variability of sw gw interaction that is of greater interest as of only fresh groundwater resources to the community around the coastal area 4 4 environmental and anthropogenic influence on sw gw dynamics groundwater storage in modern alluvial systems is under serious threat due to the continuously increasing abstraction rate and unpredictability of the future precipitation rate macdonald et al 2015 lack of understanding of groundwater response in the coastal areas and its vulnerability associated with various stress e g hydrologic climatic anthropogenic modifications the drinking water options for the dense population living in the present study area can be severely jeopardized and more so with the threat of predicted impending potential changes of global sea levels das et al 2021a das et al 2021b while the sw gw dynamics in the coastal area are dependent on the time scale and spatial extension climate change has an impact on the swi due to slr 1 mm yr near study area slr has prolonged effects whereas the anthropogenic activities have seasonal to inter annual scale impacts on it white et al 2005 sanford and pope 2010 taylor et al 2013 in this present study the declining water level in the pre monsoon season shows a lower resistive zone moving towards the htl while in post monsoon season lower resistive zone is moving back from htl to offshore distance which delineates the influx and outflux of seawater to inland freshwater aquifer both for the shallow and deeper aquifer anthropogenic stresses are mostly the result of improper policy implementation on groundwater use to address the unsustainable groundwater abstraction practices bhanja et al 2017 lack of awareness among the local inhabitants would lead to the installation of deeper tube wells without any proper hydrogeological knowledge and huge abstraction is disturbing the equilibrium of groundwater dynamics by creating higher hydraulic gradient differences this disequilibrium of groundwater makes changes in groundwater flow by changing in pressure gradient on another way it changes the 1 the groundwater solute content by inversion of groundwater flow direction leading inland swi and 2 transport of solutes from the shallow contaminated aquifer to a deeper fresh one locally if connected and regionally in this vertical hydraulic connection das and mukherjee 2019 sreekanth and datta 2010 groundwater sustainability of coastal aquifer needs implementation of management practices and also need to address the maximum optimum feasible pumping rates in a day and need to optimize the well locations to meet community needs katsifarakis and petala 2006 singh 2014 das et al 2021a 4 5 implications of geophysical methods to the coastal groundwater resources several studies have been initiated on surficial sediments and integrated onshore offshore measurements of the aquifer layer however the application of combined geophysical methods would provide an insight into sw gw interaction with depth and seasons and the hydraulic connectivity dependent threat of solute transportation integrated gpr ves and ert data have potentially identified the linkages between electrochemical and hydrochemical factors influencing the groundwater discharge along its pathway in seasonal scale for shallow depths variations in resistivity in the present study depict the location and depth affected by the recirculated brackish water m sgd and the zone of terrestrial freshwater t sgd with depths sgd with a higher terrestrial freshwater fraction has a higher resistivity signature whereas the area saturated with saline water has a lower resistivity signature furthermore resistivity images show the information about the sgd flow path and convergence with seawater water along with the flow on the seasonal scale fig 11 this shallow depth solute content with geophysical data helped in understanding the dynamics of coastal groundwater resources of the largest sedimentary framework hence understanding hydrological interactions in the broad area becomes imperative to understand the present day ecological sustainability as well as the resilience of one of the most climate change sensitive coastal areas notwithstanding this significance information on the sgd to the bob and its relationship from the source water to the bob are limited especially in deeper depths salinization of groundwater due to swi in shallow groundwater is a widespread problem than the deeper groundwater resources because as a reason of lateral and vertical hydrostratigraphic differences the seawater in far offshore distances may not have reached the nearshore locations of deeper coastal aquifer a better hydrogeological understanding is required for sustainable groundwater management practices for coastal aquifers advanced geophysical techniques would lead to addressing the conceptual hydrological modeling in terms of inflow of seawater and outflow of fresh groundwater even in places with limited geochemical data especially in the present study a substantial amount of geochemical data is only available for the shallow depths in this data limiting conditions ert and ves data is addressing the broader aspect of sw gw interaction where aquifers are hydraulically connected and transportation of solute is occurring within the small distance from the htl to 110 m offshore both in shallow and deeper depths although the prevailing mechanism is different 5 conclusions in the present study we have tried to demonstrate the spatial and depth wise distribution of fresh groundwater resources in the sw gw interaction zone by using advanced geophysical techniques in conjunction with the conventional hydrological parameters like cl content and wl fluctuations of the coastal aquifer near bob the resistivity ert ves and gpr data show the sub meter scale variations of sw gw for the shallow depth up to 1 5 m below ground level m bgl have higher sgd at the post monsoon season the changes in geomorphic patterns in the aquifer system and saturation with varied source water with depth and seasons showed a significant circulation pattern of terrestrially sourced groundwater in the nearshore zone in shallow depth with 1 5 m bgl from the surface the re circulated seawater in distant offshore was also predominant from shallow 1 5 m bgl to intermediate 1 5 up to 100 m bgl brackish water saturated and deeper depths 100 m bgl fresh groundwater with distinct resistivity values observed from ves excessive groundwater pumping in this complex lithostratigraphic unit may be leading to seawater encroachment which even controls the groundwater flow and recharge processes far inland overexploitation of groundwater resources from the deeper fresh groundwater resources in these hydraulically connected aquifers would aggravate the transportation of solutes from the shallow depths locally if connected regionally and potentially would enhance the swi which may deplete the fresh groundwater resources this abstraction induced change of hydrodynamic transport and enhanced vertical hydraulic gradients would lead to rapid depletion of groundwater resources locally at present conditions and would move towards far inland in the distant future this study would lead to a new realm of understanding of the influence of the coastal hydrodynamic system of the coastal aquifer and near the tropical sea by continuous variability of resistivity as an outcome of the hydrologic variability and scalability authors contribution palash debnath and kousik das conceived the idea of the study and wrote the manuscript with supervision
