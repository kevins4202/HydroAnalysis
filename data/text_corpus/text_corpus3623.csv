18115,seawater as an alternative magnesium source has the potential to improve the overall economics and environmental footprint of struvite production compared to the use of pure magnesium salts however the dilution effect and the presence of other ions in seawater can reduce the phosphorus recovery potential and the simultaneous precipitation of other compounds may reduce the quality of the produced struvite this work presents a comparative study of seawater and mgcl2 by performing a series of thermodynamic equilibrium modeling and crystallization experiments the results revealed that acceptable phosphorus recovery 80 90 is achievable by using seawater as the magnesium source for struvite precipitation further the simultaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates was successfully controlled and minimized by optimum selection of reaction ph and seawater volume i e mg p and mg ca molar ratios the increase of temperature from 20 c to 30 c reduced the phosphorus recovery by 15 20 while it increased the particle size by 30 35 the presence of suspended solids in reject water did not have significant effects on phosphorus recovery but it made the struvite separation difficult as the obtained struvite was mixed with suspended solids the experimental results and economic evaluation showed that the use of seawater can reduce the chemical costs 30 50 and the co2 footprint 8 40 of struvite production it was concluded that seawater is a potential alternative to pure magnesium sources in struvite production while studies in larger scale and continuous mode are needed for further verification before full scale applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords struvite economics seawater phosphorus recovery alternative magnesium source environmental footprint 1 introduction the transition towards modern generations of wastewater treatment is being shaped by several developments that aim at improving effluent quality cutting greenhouse gas emissions and recovering energy and valuable resources recovery of phosphorus among all available resources is a prominent action as phosphorus p is a vital nutrient for all forms of life while it is expected that the quality and quantity of the main source for phosphorus i e mineral rocks will be reduced in coming decades cordell et al 2011 regardless of an exact timetable of global phosphate rocks depletion phosphorus is a limited and irreplaceable resource therefore the recovery of phosphorus from waste streams can be a promising approach to reduce the conventional mining and moderate the expected future shortage of phosphate shaddel et al 2019b among phosphorus compounds struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate mgnh4po4 6h2o has the advantages of being composed of primary nitrogen and phosphorus and secondary magnesium macronutrients and being a slow release fertilizer that can potentially be used directly as precipitated therefore struvite has been considered as an advantageous option to recover phosphorus from wastewater the source of constituent ions in full scale struvite production is mainly the dewatering reject of anaerobically digested sludge nh4 and po4 3 with addition of an adequate amount of magnesium however the use of pure magnesium sources such as magnesium salts i e mgcl2 and mgso4 may stress the total sustainability and economic feasibility of the process shaddel et al 2019a the cost of struvite production is mainly influenced by chemical costs especially that of the magnesium which can contribute up to 75 of overall costs hövelmann and putnis 2016 therefore a critical challenge for a sustainable phosphorus cycle is to improve the economics of struvite crystallization by using low cost magnesium sources while ensuring the quality of the final product it has been reported that a low cost magnesium source may reduce the costs by 18 81 gunay et al 2008 lahav et al 2013 some low cost alternatives to conventional magnesium sources are seawater seawater concentrate nanofiltration reverse osmosis kim et al 2016 lahav et al 2013 bittern a by product in salt industry ye et al 2011 and wood ash sakthivel et al 2012 bittern may not be available in many areas whereas wood ash is considerably cheap but the high content of heavy metals makes it an unsafe alternative for struvite production sakthivel et al 2012 using seawater concentrate minimizes the intake volume but will not change the molar ratio of magnesium with respect to other ions on the other hand pretreatment of seawater for removing the interfering ions may not be economic as it introduces additional costs however raw seawater untreated seawater is an inexhaustible cost effective and environmentally friendly alternative generally the availability of an alternative magnesium source in local context improves the economics of struvite production after sodium magnesium is the most commonly found cation in seawater 1300 mg l which makes the application of seawater financially attractive and technically feasible although it is not advantageous cost wise for plants located away from the seashore this is because long distances increase the power cost for seawater pumping as well as investment and maintenance costs there are several ions i e sodium chloride calcium and sulfate that inevitably will be added into the system by using seawater so simultaneous precipitation of other compounds i e calcium phosphates calcium carbonate should be minimized to improve the quality of produced struvite however it is expected that adverse effect of some ions such as chloride on biological processes would not be significant this is because the sidestreams constitutes 1 of the overall flowrate to the plant and contribution of salt content from seawater to the main stream is likely to be marginal lahav et al 2013 matsumiya et al 2000 generally calcium ions compete with magnesium ions for reaction with phosphate species however the interfering effect of these ions on struvite precipitation strongly depends on operational conditions previous studies have reported examples for both cases where calcium ions interfered with jaffer et al 2002 or did not significantly affect the struvite crystallization krähenbühl et al 2016 le corre 2006 therefore further studies are required to define the optimum operational conditions for struvite crystallization by seawater to maximize the quality and quantity of the final product that determine the profitability of a full scale struvite plant most of the reported studies for struvite production by seawater were carried out by using treated seawater for p recovery from urine nur et al 2018 quist jensen et al 2016 rubio rincón et al 2014 and a few studies were carried out by using untreated seawater for struvite production from municipal wastewater matsumiya et al 2000 there are some associated challenges by using seawater for struvite production which should be addressed both theoretically and practically the low mg2 concentration in seawater compared to pure magnesium sources requires addition of large amounts of seawater for obtaining similar magnesium concentration which results in dilution and decrease in the concentrations of ammonium and orthophosphates in the reaction medium i e reduction of the struvite precipitation potential also overdosing of seawater beyond the demand for p recovery can introduce residual magnesium and unwanted ions in the system however the dilution effect of seawater has mainly been disregarded in previous studies aguado et al 2019 wongphudphad and kemacheevakul 2019 the liquid from dewatering of anaerobically digested sludge mesophilic 30 38 c is the main feed for the majority of struvite reactors shaddel et al 2019b the feed temperature will be different depending on the process at the treatment plant and the seasonal variations of ambient temperature temperature is an important parameter for the activity of different ions in the reactor since it affects the solubility of struvite and other phases that can simultaneously precipitate in addition precipitation kinetics of different phases can vary with temperature despite its importance the effect of temperature in struvite production by seawater has not been investigated in previous studies the organic content of the obtained struvite from wastewater is a determining factor in the final application of the product as potential fertilizer however there is little information available on organic contamination of the struvite specifically by using seawater the environmental impact of any phosphorus recovery technology in addition to technical feasibility should be considered to our knowledge the life cycle assessment and comparison of using seawater with pure magnesium sources for struvite production has not been reported in the literature the potential of seawater for struvite production is demonstrated although a comprehensive understanding is still necessary for further application this study aims to systematically evaluate the feasibility of using seawater as a sustainable source of magnesium for struvite production compared to mgcl2 the equilibrium thermodynamic calculations and experimental studies were performed by using synthetic and real reject water after sludge dewatering of municipal wastewater to evaluate the p recovery potential and the characteristics of the final products such as product purity particle size and crystal morphology the chemical costs and lca analysis are presented for struvite crystallization by both mgcl2 and seawater the results of this study can be used for the development of struvite production by seawater in industrial scale further it can be used to maximize the struvite purity and minimize the addition of unwanted ions to the wastewater treatment system 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate nah2po4 2h2o ammonium chloride nh4cl and sodium hydroxide naoh were used for preparation of synthetic reject water and readjustment of real reject water all chemical reagents were purchased from merck with analytical grade unless stated otherwise milli q water 18 2 mω cm was used for all purposes the seawater was obtained from trondheim fjord an inlet of the norwegian sea where it was pumped from a depth of 70 m and 800 m away from land the seawater was passed through a sand filter of 70 μm and then kept in the fridge 1 4 c prior to further use without any pretreatment table 1 presents the properties of seawater 2 2 methods all experiments were carried out using a lab scale crystallization system composed of a 1 l glass reactor stirred with a teflon two blade propeller controlled by a mechanical stirrer operated

with kcl reference electrolyte connected to easydirect ph software metrohm and calibrations were carried out daily nitrogen atmosphere was constantly preserved on top of the solutions throughout the crystallization reactions to prevent intrusion of atmospheric carbon dioxide an ion exchange chromatograph 940 professional ic vario metrohm with an autosampler 813 compact was used for characterization of seawater wastewater and the composition of completely dissolved precipitates the phosphate ion concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry hach dr lange 1900 the chemical speciation and activity based supersaturation were determined by the thermodynamic calculation program visual minteq 3 1 the activity based supersaturation sa was calculated for each experiment by using equation 1 1 s a iap k sp 1 3 iap ion activity product a m g 2 a n h 4 a p o 4 3 ksp solubility product of struvite the theoretical and experimental results of percent phosphorus recovery were calculated by using eq 2 2 p r e c o v e r y p initial p final p initial 100 the precipitates were collected at the end of each experiment by vacuum filtration through a 0 2 μm pore size filter polypropylene membrane solid phases were air dried at room temperature 20 c and characterized by powder x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance davinci bruker axs gmbh in the range of 5 75 with a step size of 0 013 and a step time of 0 67 s the analysis of xrd data was performed by diffrac suite eva software bruker and the international centre for diffraction data database icdd pdf 4 2018 was used to characterize the precipitates sem analyses hitachi s 3400n were performed where samples were placed on sem stub using carbon tape and sputter coated with gold the particle size distribution was analyzed with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer beckman coulter ls230 the presented particle size distributions are based on volumetric standard distribution by dynamic light scattering technique and derived based on a sphericity thus the presented results are nominal size of crystals for the comparison of the results alkalinity of the seawater was measured by titration with hcl jenkins et al 1981 the soluble components were characterized after filtration of sample through 0 45 μm filter pp membranes in order to measure the elemental composition of the precipitates the samples were dissolved in 1 m hno3 and the ion concentrations were measured by ion chromatography 940 professional ic vario metrohm the total organic carbon toc content of the samples was determined by dissolving the samples in 21 v v h3po4 and measuring by apollo 9000 teledyne tekmar total organic carbon toc analyzer determination of solids including total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss in wastewater were performed according to standard methods 209 american public health 1960 2 3 preparation of solutions the real reject water was obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in the western part of norway treating wastewater from 300 000 population equivalent p e the treatment comprises of the drum sieves for primary treatment followed by enhanced biological phosphorus removal in activated sludge mode with anaerobic digestion for sludge stabilization the characterization of real reject is presented in table 2 the target composition of the reject water has total ammonium nitrogen nh4 n 754 mg l and total phosphate po4 p 137 mg l therefore the final composition of the real reject was adjusted by addition of salts of sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate and ammonium chloride synthetic reject water composed only of ammonium and phosphate at the same concentrations was prepared from stock solutions based on dissolution of the corresponding crystalline solids nah2po4 2h2o and nh4cl 2 4 design of experiments all experiments in this study were performed in duplicate and table 3 presents an overview of different series of experiments the reactions were let to proceed for 60 min and the ph was kept constant during experiments by addition of 1 m naoh the preliminary experiments were performed for optimization of mixing speed reaction time and the molar ratio of mg p the mg p 1 67 1 was selected based on a series of preliminary experiments to maximize the p recovery beyond the stoichiometric ratio with minimum requirement of magnesium addition the reaction temperatures 20 c and 30 c were selected based on the measured temperature at the targeted wastewater treatment plant in cold and warm seasons respectively 2 5 life cycle assessment lca lca was used to assess the environmental impact of both struvite production alternatives investigated in this study namely 1 using commercial magnesium chloride hexahydrate and 2 using seawater the lca was conducted following the iso standards international organization for standardization iso 2000 international organization for standardization iso 2006 in order to evaluate and quantify the potential co2 equivalent emissions international organization for standardization iso 2006 ryding 1999 it consisted of four main stages i goal and scope definition ii inventory analysis iii impacts assessment and iv interpretation of the results international organization for standardization iso 2006 the functional unit used for this evaluation is one kg of produced struvite the boundaries for both systems include only the direct and indirect emissions associated with operation and necessary chemicals sodium hydroxide and or magnesium chloride transport of those chemicals the pumping of seawater and seawater the process equipment was not included as the differences between both systems are considered negligible and it is reported in the literature that the impact from the system infrastructure is minor compared to the operation e g lundin et al 2000 machado et al 2007 for this study the production of magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o has been modelled according to linderholm et al 2012 linderholm et al 2012 magnesium chloride salts are produced in netherlands and transported to norway by ship representing a distance of 1000 km trucks are assumed to be the means of transport from the supplier to the facility and the distance is assumed to be 200 km the rest of the inventory data were collected from relevant datasets from the ecoinvent database and real data obtained from experiments performed in this study and provided in the supplementary documents lca was performed using the software simapro 8 pré sustainability 2014 the equivalent co2 co2 eq emissions were calculated using the cml2 method 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermodynamic modeling the thermodynamic modeling was performed to define the supersaturated phases potential precipitates and the theoretical p recovery yields in the planned experiments which are presented in table s1 and fig s1 respectively according to thermodynamic calculations when seawater is used as the magnesium source the reaction solutions become supersaturated with respect to calcium phosphate cap phases along with struvite due to high levels of ca2 present in seawater table s1 however the final composition of the precipitates is governed by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors and struvite has faster precipitation kinetics than most ca ps making it the dominant phase also in the presence of calcium lahav et al 2013 p recovery was therefore calculated solely based on struvite formation and the validity of this assumption was evaluated experimentally the general trend in theoretical yield shows that p recovery increases by increasing mg p molar ratio and reaction ph fig s1 this is due to the increasing supersaturation with respect to struvite with higher mg p molar ratio and higher reaction ph which provides a higher driving force for precipitation of struvite that consequently enhances p recovery fig s2 the thermodynamic modeling shows that ion complexation and ion pairs lower the free concentration of magnesium therefore mg p molar ratios higher than stoichiometric ratio in struvite is advantageous to enhance the reaction kinetics and to achieve p recovery yields higher than 80 at low ph values the calculations show the p recovery to be higher than 95 at mg p 1 1 at ph 9 with mgcl2 and at mg p 1 67 1 at ph 8 with seawater therefore further increase of mg p molar ratio or ph beyond these conditions is theoretically not necessary since it increases the operational costs while improving the p recovery marginally however in order to define the optimum operational conditions the experimental results and the product properties should also be considered along with equilibrium modeling 3 2 crystallization experiments with varying magnesium sources the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations are useful to define the potential supersaturated phases solid precipitants however this approach does not take into consideration the kinetic differences between potential precipitates therefore a series of crystallization experiments were planned to validate the results against experimental data fig 1 presents the measured p recovery in crystallization experiments by seawater and mgcl2 by using eq 2 the experimental results for p recovery show the same trend as equilibrium calculations where it increases by increasing the mg p molar ratio and reaction ph the experimental p recovery results for seawater in this work were generally lower compared to a pure magnesium source i e mgcl2 which is in line with reported studies zhang et al 2016 application of seawater as the magnesium source increases the ionic strength of solution in the reactor and thus decreases the ionic activity product and supersaturation with respect to struvite the higher ionic strength affects particularly the activities of multivalent ions such as mg2 and po4 3 via formation of ion pairs e g mgso4 0 napo4 2 thus maintaining higher reaction ph is required to compensate for this effect however under current experimental conditions ph values higher than 8 5 are redundant since the improving effect of higher ph values on p recovery is minimal the measured p recovery in the experiments at ph values higher than 8 5 was slightly higher up to 3 than the calculated equilibrium p recovery based on precipitation of struvite this discrepancy is within the uncertainty range of the measurements and the simultaneous precipitation of other compounds was insignificant the consumption of magnesium by struvite precipitation reduces mg ca molar ratio and the consumption rate of magnesium is even higher at high ph values which lowers both mg ca and mg p molar ratios therefore it is important to keep the mg ca molar ratio high enough during the course of precipitation to favor the struvite precipitation and minimize the simultaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates le corre et al 2005 3 3 dilution effect of seawater the dilution effect of seawater on phosphorus recovery efficiency and product properties was studied by addition of varying volumes of seawater in the reaction media which consequently results in different mg p molar ratios i e different dilution factors the experiments were conducted at ph 7 5 for both synthetic and real reject water to optimize the mg p molar ratio including the dilution effect this ph value was selected to minimize the costs regarding the use of naoh since achieving maximum p recovery at minimum cost was another objective the initial ionic concentrations at different dilution factors and the p recovery results are presented in table s2 and fig 2 respectively the p recovery was reduced by 4 and 6 respectively owing to the dilution effect of seawater at mg p 1 1 and mg p 1 67 1 with respect to the experiments without any dilution the similar experiments were performed with real reject water to test the efficiency of seawater under real conditions the real reject contains suspended solids which can affect the struvite precipitation and the purity of final product therefore the unfiltered and filtered real reject filtered with filter paper 1 2 μm pore size were used to investigate the effect of suspended solids fig 2a it was noticed that the suspended solids had no noticeable effect on p recovery but it made the separation of final product difficult as the final product was a mixture of struvite crystals and suspended solids fig s3 the mg p molar ratios of 1 67 and 2 34 were found to be optimal based on p recovery for the current reject composition at ph 7 5 so the phosphorus recovery at these molar ratios were further investigated for real filtered reject at ph 8 and 8 5 fig 2b according to fig 2b mg p 2 34 1 at ph 8 can be considered as the optimum operational condition since the cost of increasing mg p molar ratio by seawater is less than increasing the reaction ph 3 4 effect of temperature the reaction temperature determines the solubility products of all potential precipitates as well as their precipitation kinetics which can affect the recovery efficiency and potentially induce simultaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates with struvite hanhoun et al 2011 therefore the effect of temperature on struvite crystallization was investigated by performing the experiments with seawater and synthetic reject water at 20 and 30 c and the results are presented in fig 2c it was observed that increasing the temperature to 30 c hindered the struvite nucleation at mg p 1 1 during the 60 min duration of reaction in this study the increase of reaction temperature increases the solubility product of struvite which decreases its supersaturation in solution eq 1 at other mg p ratios the p recovery was reduced by 11 28 by the increase of temperature from 20 to 30 c in accordance with decreasing supersaturation however no adverse effects were observed on the product quality results showed that higher mg p molar ratio can compensate the adverse effect of higher temperature on p recovery fig 2c 3 5 product properties 3 5 1 product purity the purity of struvite precipitated from aqueous solutions containing additional ions i e calcium is determining in the effective economical implementation of the final product the presence of pure struvite in all experiments with mgcl2 and seawater was confirmed by xrd fig 3 and fig s4 the purity of struvite in the experiments with seawater was attributed to fast precipitation kinetic of struvite compared to calcium phosphate phases which was facilitated by the presence of ammonium additional experiments showed that in the absence of ammonium the final precipitate phase was mainly amorphous calcium phosphate with traces of magnesium fig s5 however presence of ammonium even at a low molar ratio of n p 1 led to the precipitation of struvite rather than other phases fig s6 the n p molar ratio should not be the limiting factor in the struvite crystallization with seawater since ammonium concentration is one of the determining factors that can enhance struvite precipitation in the presence of calcium by inhibiting precipitation of calcium bearing minerals aguado et al 2019 golubev et al 1999 gunnars et al 2004 our review showed that simultaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates by using seawater has been mainly reported in the studies with unfavorable n p molar ratio i e urine or n p 4 aguado et al 2019 an increase of n p molar ratio increases the buffer capacity of solutions precipitation kinetics and nucleation rate of struvite which makes it kinetically more favorable with respect to potential calcium phosphates at similar conditions crutchik and garrido 2011 enhanced buffer capacity of the solutions results in lowering the required ph for nucleation of struvite which in turn favors the precipitation of p as struvite and improves the product purity by reducing the share of other compounds i e calcium phosphates capdevielle et al 2013 in addition to xrd analysis complete dissolution of final precipitate obtained by using seawater and real reject water was performed fig 4 a this is because small crystalline size and low crystallinity of simultaneously precipitated phases can prevent their detection by xrd crutchik and garrido 2011 le corre et al 2005 lee et al 2013 trace amounts of sodium and potassium 0 1 wt were detected in the dissolved samples precipitated by using real reject water which is in line with previous studies nur et al 2018 also trace amounts of calcium carbonate were identified in the end product of the precipitation reaction conducted with real filtered reject water at mg p 2 34 1 and at ph 8 5 fig s7 however the calcium share with respect to struvite constituent ions in the final precipitate was less than 1 in all cases and the simultaneous precipitation of calcium bearing minerals was shown to be insignificant at all experimental conditions used in this study fig 4a the results showed that mg p molar ratio higher than 1 is beneficial specially at higher ph values to keep mg ca molar ratio high enough during the reaction the increase of reaction temperature to 30 c did not show any adverse effects on purity of struvite although the xrd spectra differed in intensities of some peaks fig s4g the total organic carbon toc content of struvite is another important factor that defines the value of the final product as mineral fertilizer or an organo mineral soil amendment eu parliment 2019 therefore the toc content of struvite obtained from seawater and real reject was analyzed fig 4b the results showed that increasing the reaction ph slightly increased the toc of the sample that can be attributed to increasing nucleation and growth rates due to increasing supersaturation with ph increasing the crystallization ph increases the number of crystals and the surface area of crystals and the probability of organic compound incorporation in the final product the higher contamination of final products by organic compounds at higher ph values has also been reported in previous work zhou et al 2015 this contamination has been explained by the coprecipitation of organic compounds or complexation between organic acids and mg2 or nh4 however the toc values in this study should be considered only for comparison purposes and not as absolute toc of the final product this is because seeded crystallization and washing of the product in full scale application will reduce the toc in the final product 3 5 2 crystal morphology the final precipitates were imaged by scanning electron microscopy sem to investigate the impact of additional ions in the seawater on the struvite morphology fig 5 the obtained struvite crystals by both mgcl2 and seawater had well faceted bipyramidal shape at low supersaturation values ph 7 5 increasing the supersaturation by increasing the ph produced hopper crystals with x shape morphology ph 8 5 and higher supersaturations ph 9 5 produced needle shape and dendritic shape crystals for both sets of experiments with mgcl2 and seawater this is due to the dominant impact of supersaturation on morphology development of crystals compared to the effects of additional ions in seawater the development of struvite crystal morphologies in correlation with supersaturation has been explained in detail in our previous work shaddel et al 2019c the initial supersaturation is an important factor also for aggregation of struvite crystals it can be seen in fig 5 panel a that at ph 8 the struvite crystals formed with seawater show some degrees of aggregation unlike the crystals with mgcl2 maintaining sufficiently high levels of supersaturation during growth of particles can enhance their aggregation shaddel et al 2019c seawater reduces the initial supersaturation with respect to struvite which consequently reduces the nucleation rate thus the supersaturation level could be maintained for aggregation of crystals the increase of temperature from 20 to 30 c had no significant impact on the morphology of the final struvite crystals fig s8 3 5 3 particle size the size distribution of the final particles of precipitation experiments were measured fig 6 due to importance of the particle size in the design and the operation of struvite crystallizers i e settleability and post handling steps filtration and drying the general trend in fig 6 shows that smaller particle size is accompanied by higher share of fine particles this is because the nucleation rate scales with initial supersaturation and higher nucleation rate produces higher numbers of particles agrawal et al 2018 the consumption of the remaining supersaturation for the growth of many particles leads to smaller particle size however lower initial supersaturations in the case of using seawater moderates the struvite nucleation rate which consequently results in larger particles the similar standard deviation values showed that homogeneity of the produced particles was not affected by seawater data not shown the size of the produced particles by real reject water was significantly smaller than synthetic reject water fig 6c this could be associated with the presence of suspended solids in the real reject water which can increase the nucleation rate by acting as heterogenous nucleation sites or with the presence of organic and inorganic impurities in the real reject water that might reduce the particle size by blocking the active growth sites and lowering the crystal growth rate koutsopoulos and dalas 2000 van der houwen and valsami jones 2001 the size difference between particles precipitated by seawater and mgcl2 is smaller for synthetic reject water while bigger size difference for real reject water shows the dominant impact of organic and inorganic impurities the larger particle sizes observed at 30 c are associated with the effect of temperature on the nucleation and growth stages of crystallization fig 6c increasing the temperature reduces the supersaturation and hence lowers the nucleation rate of struvite which results in larger particles as well as increasing the crystal growth rate 4 environmental footprint lca and chemical costs the reduction potential of the environmental footprint by using seawater as an alternative of commercial magnesium chloride has been evaluated using lca the data used in this evaluation originate from the laboratory experiments and discrepancy may occur with full scale systems the production infrastructures facility and reactors are expected to be very similar with the only difference being pumps and pipes necessary for the seawater extraction and transport yet this assessment considers only the operational phase as the contribution of the infrastructure is considered negligible as stated in the literature e g lundin et al 2000 machado et al 2007 the potential co2 eq emissions associated with each alternative at each ph considered in this study are shown in fig 7 the results indicate that the use of seawater instead of synthetic magnesium chloride would allow to reduce the co2 eq emissions in a range of 8 40 the results show that ph 9 has adverse effect on co2 eq emissions for instance the mg p 1 67 1 at ph 7 5 and 8 with seawater has the minimum co2 eq emissions while at the same conditions increasing the ph to 9 5 will increase the co2 eq emissions by 67 fig 8 a shows as an example the contribution of each component used in the molar ratio of mg p 1 67 1 using mgcl2 at ph 9 5 and fig 8b shows the contribution when seawater is used for the same ph and mg p ratio similar distribution was observed for the other conditions evaluated in this study these results indicate that the largest contribution to co2 eq emissions is due to sodium hydroxide which has the highest co2 footprint per kg 2 16 kg co2 eq kg naoh as it requires large electricity input sodium hydroxide is generated by the electrolysis of sodium chloride solution produced by mining salt deposits using high pressure water to form a brine solution which is then pumped to the production facility garcia herrero et al 2017 traditionally electrolysis has been carried out by the mercury amalgam or diaphragm cell processes but the share of ion exchange membrane cell is growing for environmental and economic reasons garcia herrero et al 2017 the main production route in the us is via the diaphragm cell while the mercury and membrane cells are more dominant in europe sodium hydroxide used for the comparison presented in this study is modelled using the production mix model mercury cell 55 1 diaphragm cell 23 5 and membrane cell 21 4 available in ecoinvent database for the production mix an electricity consumption of 3 356 kwh kg naoh is calculated based on electricity input of 3 294 kwh kg naoh 3 920 kwh kg naoh and 2 900 kwh kg naoh for mercury cell diaphragm cell and membrane cell productions respectively consequently the electricity mix used for the production would have a large impact on the resulting co2 footprint and a production powered with renewable electricity should always be favored as well as membrane cell production the second largest contributor is the mgcl2 which has a co2 footprint of 0 293 kg co2 eq kg mgcl2 while the transport and the electricity are minor contributors magnesium chloride used in this study is produced in netherland with a total required energy of 1835 mj ton which is equivalent to 0 513 kwh kg mgcl2 6h2o similarly to sodium hydroxide magnesium chloride salts are extracted from depth by applying water under high pressure salts are then dissolved to form a concentrated brine 30 magnesium chloride which is then pressed upwards the brine is then purified by a series of processes and then heated to get a saturated solution of 47 magnesium chloride this hot concentrated liquid is then transported to a water cooled rotating drum where solid magnesium chloride flakes are formed nedmag 2004 the outcome of the comparison is very dependent on the input of sodium hydroxide and to smaller extent to magnesium sources however these results are very site specific as they depend on the type of production and electricity energy mix the reduction of co2 emissions implies optimizing the use of chemicals as the conditions requiring lower input of that chemical would have lower co2 emissions table s3 but also selecting the greenest available chemicals with respect to production and transport indeed the type of technology e g membrane cells for sodium hydroxide production and renewable electricity energy should always be favored to reduce the impact of those chemicals as long as the emissions associated with the transport distance and type to the struvite production site does not outweigh the benefits the chemical costs constitute an important fraction of the operational costs magnesium source cost is a major part of the overall struvite production costs 50 70 which is deterministic on payback time the chemical cost calculations based on the experimental results in this study were performed for using mgcl2 and seawater as magnesium sources fig s9 the energy cost for pumping is the only associated cost with using seawater as mg source which has been calculated according to meneses et al 2010 meneses et al 2010 the results showed that increasing the ph when magnesium is the limiting factor is not cost effective owing to low product yield with respect to high chemical consumption i e mg p 1 1 at ph 8 5 further the naoh consumption for initial raise of ph increases exponentially by ph and the ph values higher than 8 5 are not cost effective this is due to high buffer capacity of phosphate that implies addition of considerably higher amount of naoh in the current study the base requirement for adjustment of initial ph to 8 5 and 9 5 were respectively 2 2 and 7 7 times higher than base requirement for ph 7 5 our calculations show that struvite production by seawater has clearly lower chemical costs than using mgcl2 which can reduce the chemical costs by 30 50 the combination of using seawater and ph values of 8 and 8 5 showed lower costs and the lowest cost was obtained by using seawater at mg p 1 1 at ph 8 however the mg ca is a determining factor for minimum simultaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates meaning mg p 1 67 1 at ph 8 can be considered as the optimum operational window in this case the lca analysis and calculation of chemical costs are based on lab scale experimental results in this study and presented for comparison between mgcl2 and seawater while an inclusive analysis applicable for full scale requires data of main metrics in relevant scale i e operational and maintenance costs savings revenue and period of analysis 5 conclusion the presented study demonstrated both the potential of seawater as an alternative magnesium source for struvite production and the optimization of operational conditions for enhancing phosphorus recovery and product quality the minimal reduction of phosphorus recovery 1 6 by using seawater compared to mgcl2 indicates seawater can be an adequate magnesium source for struvite production the mg ca and n p molar ratios and reaction ph were important factors to control the simultaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates it was concluded that the simultaneous precipitation of other compounds would not significantly compromise the struvite purity in the final product the particle size of the final crystals was highly dependent on supersaturation and ph has a prominent impact on supersaturation as the median particle size was reduced by 40 70 at the ph values higher than 8 the presence of soluble organic compounds in the real reject water reduced the median particle size by 50 70 the presence of suspended solids in this study had no notable impact on the phosphorus recovery but it reduced the final product quality by making it more difficult to separate the final product from the suspended solids the increase of temperature from 20 c to 30 c reduced the phosphorus recovery 11 28 but produced slightly bigger crystals the lca analysis in this study showed that optimization of reaction conditions mg p and ph is an effective approach to minimize the co2 eq emissions of struvite production it was shown that using seawater instead of mgcl2 will improve the environmental and financial sustainability of the struvite production process by reducing the co2 footprint by 8 40 and the chemical costs by 30 50 the results show that the concept of using untreated seawater as an alternative magnesium source for struvite precipitation is feasible both technically and economically owing to the controlled conditions and the lab scale experiments in this study investigation in larger scales is recommended for verification of the results and demonstration of benefits

18115,seawater as an alternative magnesium source has the potential to improve the overall economics and environmental footprint of struvite production compared to the use of pure magnesium salts however the dilution effect and the presence of other ions in seawater can reduce the phosphorus recovery potential and the simultaneous precipitation of other compounds may reduce the quality of the produced struvite this work presents a comparative study of seawater and mgcl2 by performing a series of thermodynamic equilibrium modeling and crystallization experiments the results revealed that acceptable phosphorus recovery 80 90 is achievable by using seawater as the magnesium source for struvite precipitation further the simultaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates was successfully controlled and minimized by optimum selection of reaction ph and seawater volume i e mg p and mg ca molar ratios the increase of temperature from 20 c to 30 c reduced the phosphorus recovery by 15 20 while it increased the particle size by 30 35 the presence of suspended solids in reject water did not have significant effects on phosphorus recovery but it made the struvite separation difficult as the obtained struvite was mixed with suspended solids the experimental results and economic evaluation showed that the use of seawater can reduce the chemical costs 30 50 and the co2 footprint 8 40 of struvite production it was concluded that seawater is a potential alternative to pure magnesium sources in struvite production while studies in larger scale and continuous mode are needed for further verification before full scale applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords struvite economics seawater phosphorus recovery alternative magnesium source environmental footprint 1 introduction the transition towards modern generations of wastewater treatment is being shaped by several developments that aim at improving effluent quality cutting greenhouse gas emissions and recovering energy and valuable resources recovery of phosphorus among all available resources is a prominent action as phosphorus p is a vital nutrient for all forms of life while it is expected that the quality and quantity of the main source for phosphorus i e mineral rocks will be reduced in coming decades cordell et al 2011 regardless of an exact timetable of global phosphate rocks depletion phosphorus is a limited and irreplaceable resource therefore the recovery of phosphorus from waste streams can be a promising approach to reduce the conventional mining and moderate the expected future shortage of phosphate shaddel et al 2019b among phosphorus compounds struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate mgnh4po4 6h2o has the advantages of being composed of primary nitrogen and phosphorus and secondary magnesium macronutrients and being a slow release fertilizer that can potentially be used directly as precipitated therefore struvite has been considered as an advantageous option to recover phosphorus from wastewater the source of constituent ions in full scale struvite production is mainly the dewatering reject of anaerobically digested sludge nh4 and po4 3 with addition of an adequate amount of magnesium however the use of pure magnesium sources such as magnesium salts i e mgcl2 and mgso4 may stress the total sustainability and economic feasibility of the process shaddel et al 2019a the cost of struvite production is mainly influenced by chemical costs especially that of the magnesium which can contribute up to 75 of overall costs hövelmann and putnis 2016 therefore a critical challenge for a sustainable phosphorus cycle is to improve the economics of struvite crystallization by using low cost magnesium sources while ensuring the quality of the final product it has been reported that a low cost magnesium source may reduce the costs by 18 81 gunay et al 2008 lahav et al 2013 some low cost alternatives to conventional magnesium sources are seawater seawater concentrate nanofiltration reverse osmosis kim et al 2016 lahav et al 2013 bittern a by product in salt industry ye et al 2011 and wood ash sakthivel et al 2012 bittern may not be available in many areas whereas wood ash is considerably cheap but the high content of heavy metals makes it an unsafe alternative for struvite production sakthivel et al 2012 using seawater concentrate minimizes the intake volume but will not change the molar ratio of magnesium with respect to other ions on the other hand pretreatment of seawater for removing the interfering ions may not be economic as it introduces additional costs however raw seawater untreated seawater is an inexhaustible cost effective and environmentally friendly alternative generally the availability of an alternative magnesium source in local context improves the economics of struvite production after sodium magnesium is the most commonly found cation in seawater 1300 mg l which makes the application of seawater financially attractive and technically feasible although it is not advantageous cost wise for plants located away from the seashore this is because long distances increase the power cost for seawater pumping as well as investment and maintenance costs there are several ions i e sodium chloride calcium and sulfate that inevitably will be added into the system by using seawater so simultaneous precipitation of other compounds i e calcium phosphates calcium carbonate should be minimized to improve the quality of produced struvite however it is expected that adverse effect of some ions such as chloride on biological processes would not be significant this is because the sidestreams constitutes 1 of the overall flowrate to the plant and contribution of salt content from seawater to the main stream is likely to be marginal lahav et al 2013 matsumiya et al 2000 generally calcium ions compete with magnesium ions for reaction with phosphate species however the interfering effect of these ions on struvite precipitation strongly depends on operational conditions previous studies have reported examples for both cases where calcium ions interfered with jaffer et al 2002 or did not significantly affect the struvite crystallization krähenbühl et al 2016 le corre 2006 therefore further studies are required to define the optimum operational conditions for struvite crystallization by seawater to maximize the quality and quantity of the final product that determine the profitability of a full scale struvite plant most of the reported studies for struvite production by seawater were carried out by using treated seawater for p recovery from urine nur et al 2018 quist jensen et al 2016 rubio rincón et al 2014 and a few studies were carried out by using untreated seawater for struvite production from municipal wastewater matsumiya et al 2000 there are some associated challenges by using seawater for struvite production which should be addressed both theoretically and practically the low mg2 concentration in seawater compared to pure magnesium sources requires addition of large amounts of seawater for obtaining similar magnesium concentration which results in dilution and decrease in the concentrations of ammonium and orthophosphates in the reaction medium i e reduction of the struvite precipitation potential also overdosing of seawater beyond the demand for p recovery can introduce residual magnesium and unwanted ions in the system however the dilution effect of seawater has mainly been disregarded in previous studies aguado et al 2019 wongphudphad and kemacheevakul 2019 the liquid from dewatering of anaerobically digested sludge mesophilic 30 38 c is the main feed for the majority of struvite reactors shaddel et al 2019b the feed temperature will be different depending on the process at the treatment plant and the seasonal variations of ambient temperature temperature is an important parameter for the activity of different ions in the reactor since it affects the solubility of struvite and other phases that can simultaneously precipitate in addition precipitation kinetics of different phases can vary with temperature despite its importance the effect of temperature in struvite production by seawater has not been investigated in previous studies the organic content of the obtained struvite from wastewater is a determining factor in the final application of the product as potential fertilizer however there is little information available on organic contamination of the struvite specifically by using seawater the environmental impact of any phosphorus recovery technology in addition to technical feasibility should be considered to our knowledge the life cycle assessment and comparison of using seawater with pure magnesium sources for struvite production has not been reported in the literature the potential of seawater for struvite production is demonstrated although a comprehensive understanding is still necessary for further application this study aims to systematically evaluate the feasibility of using seawater as a sustainable source of magnesium for struvite production compared to mgcl2 the equilibrium thermodynamic calculations and experimental studies were performed by using synthetic and real reject water after sludge dewatering of municipal wastewater to evaluate the p recovery potential and the characteristics of the final products such as product purity particle size and crystal morphology the chemical costs and lca analysis are presented for struvite crystallization by both mgcl2 and seawater the results of this study can be used for the development of struvite production by seawater in industrial scale further it can be used to maximize the struvite purity and minimize the addition of unwanted ions to the wastewater treatment system 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate nah2po4 2h2o ammonium

m away from land the seawater was passed through a sand filter of 70 μm and then kept in the fridge 1 4 c prior to further use without any pretreatment table 1 presents the properties of seawater 2 2 methods all experiments were carried out using a lab scale crystallization system composed of a 1 l glass reactor stirred with a teflon two blade propeller controlled by a mechanical stirrer operated

crystallization reactions to prevent intrusion of atmospheric carbon dioxide an ion exchange chromatograph 940 professional ic vario metrohm with an autosampler 813 compact was used for characterization of seawater wastewater and the composition of completely dissolved precipitates the phosphate ion concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry hach dr lange 1900 the chemical speciation and activity based supersaturation were determined by the thermodynamic calculation program visual minteq 3 1 the activity based supersaturation sa was calculated for each experiment by

polypropylene membrane solid phases were air dried at room temperature 20 c and characterized by powder x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance davinci bruker axs gmbh in the range of 5 75 with a step size

jenkins et al 1981 the soluble components were characterized after filtration of sample through 0 45 μm filter pp membranes in order to measure the elemental composition of the precipitates the samples were dissolved in 1 m hno3 and the ion concentrations were measured by ion chromatography 940 professional ic vario metrohm the total organic carbon toc content of the samples was determined by dissolving the samples in 21 v v h3po4 and measuring by apollo 9000 teledyne tekmar total organic carbon toc analyzer determination of solids including total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss in wastewater were performed according to standard methods 209 american public health 1960 2 3 preparation of solutions the real reject water was obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in the western part of norway treating wastewater from 300 000 population equivalent p e the treatment comprises of the drum sieves for primary treatment followed by enhanced biological phosphorus removal in activated sludge mode with anaerobic digestion for sludge stabilization the characterization of real reject is presented in table 2 the target composition of the reject water has total ammonium nitrogen nh4 n 754 mg l and total phosphate po4 p 137 mg l therefore the final composition of the real reject was adjusted by addition of salts of sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate and ammonium chloride synthetic reject water composed only of ammonium and phosphate at the same concentrations was prepared from stock solutions based on dissolution of the corresponding crystalline solids nah2po4 2h2o and nh4cl 2 4 design of experiments all experiments in this study were performed in duplicate and table 3 presents an overview of different series of

speed reaction time and the molar ratio of mg p the mg p 1 67 1 was selected based on a series of preliminary experiments to maximize the p recovery beyond the stoichiometric ratio with minimum requirement of magnesium addition the reaction temperatures 20 c and 30 c were selected based on the measured temperature at the targeted wastewater treatment plant in cold and warm seasons respectively 2 5 life cycle assessment lca lca was used to assess the environmental impact of both struvite production alternatives investigated in this study namely 1 using commercial magnesium chloride hexahydrate and 2 using seawater the lca was conducted following the iso standards international organization for standardization iso 2000 international organization for standardization iso 2006 in order to evaluate and quantify the potential co2 equivalent emissions international organization for standardization iso 2006 ryding 1999 it consisted of four main stages i goal and scope definition ii inventory analysis iii impacts assessment and iv interpretation of the results international organization for standardization iso 2006 the functional unit used for this evaluation is one kg of produced struvite the boundaries for both systems include only the direct and indirect emissions associated with operation and necessary chemicals sodium hydroxide and or magnesium chloride transport of those chemicals the pumping of seawater and seawater the process equipment was not included as the differences between both systems are considered negligible and it is reported in the literature that the impact from the system infrastructure is minor compared to the operation e g lundin et al 2000 machado et al 2007 for this study the production of magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o has been modelled according to linderholm et al 2012 linderholm et al 2012 magnesium chloride salts are produced in netherlands and transported to norway by ship representing a distance of 1000 km trucks are assumed to be the means of transport from the supplier to the facility and the distance is assumed to be 200 km the rest of the inventory data were collected from relevant datasets from the ecoinvent database and real data obtained from experiments performed in this study and provided in the supplementary documents lca was performed using the software simapro 8 pré sustainability 2014 the equivalent co2 co2 eq emissions were calculated using the cml2 method 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermodynamic modeling the thermodynamic modeling was performed to define the supersaturated phases potential precipitates and the theoretical p recovery yields in the planned experiments which are presented in table s1 and fig s1 respectively according to thermodynamic calculations when seawater is used as the magnesium source the reaction solutions become supersaturated with respect to calcium phosphate cap phases along with struvite due to high levels of ca2 present in seawater table s1 however the final composition of the precipitates is governed by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors and struvite has faster precipitation kinetics than most ca ps making it the dominant phase also in the presence of calcium lahav et al 2013 p recovery was therefore calculated solely based on struvite formation and the validity of this assumption was evaluated experimentally the general trend in theoretical yield shows that p recovery increases by increasing mg p molar ratio and reaction ph fig s1 this is due to the increasing supersaturation with respect to struvite with higher mg p molar ratio and higher reaction ph which provides a higher driving force for precipitation of struvite that consequently enhances p recovery fig s2 the thermodynamic modeling shows that ion complexation and ion pairs lower the free concentration of magnesium therefore mg p molar ratios higher than stoichiometric ratio in struvite is advantageous to enhance the reaction kinetics and to achieve p recovery yields higher than 80 at low ph values the calculations show the p recovery to be higher than 95 at mg p 1 1 at ph 9 with mgcl2 and at mg p 1 67 1 at ph 8 with seawater therefore further increase of mg p molar ratio or ph beyond these conditions is theoretically not necessary since it increases the operational costs while improving the p recovery marginally however in order to define the optimum operational conditions the experimental results and the product properties should also be considered along with equilibrium modeling 3 2 crystallization experiments with varying magnesium sources the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations are useful to define the potential supersaturated phases solid precipitants however this approach does not take into consideration the kinetic differences between potential precipitates therefore a series of crystallization experiments were planned to validate the results against experimental data fig 1 presents the measured p recovery in crystallization experiments by seawater and mgcl2 by using eq 2 the experimental results for p recovery show the same trend as equilibrium calculations where it increases by increasing the mg p molar ratio and reaction ph the experimental p recovery results for seawater in this work were generally lower compared to a pure magnesium source i e mgcl2 which is in line with reported studies zhang et al 2016 application of seawater as the magnesium source increases the ionic strength of solution in the reactor and thus decreases the ionic activity product and supersaturation with respect to struvite the higher ionic strength affects particularly the activities of multivalent ions such as mg2 and po4 3 via formation of ion pairs e g mgso4 0 napo4 2 thus maintaining higher reaction ph is required to compensate for this effect however under current experimental conditions ph values higher than 8 5 are redundant since the improving effect of higher ph values on p recovery is minimal the measured p recovery in the experiments at ph values higher than 8 5 was slightly higher up to 3 than the calculated equilibrium p recovery based on precipitation of struvite this discrepancy is within the uncertainty range of the measurements and the simultaneous precipitation of other compounds was insignificant the consumption of magnesium by struvite precipitation reduces mg ca molar ratio and the consumption rate of magnesium is even higher at high ph values which lowers both mg ca and mg p molar ratios therefore it is important to keep the mg ca molar ratio high enough during the course of precipitation to favor the struvite precipitation and minimize the simultaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates le corre et al 2005 3 3 dilution effect of seawater the dilution effect of seawater on phosphorus recovery efficiency and product properties was studied by addition of varying volumes of seawater in the reaction media which consequently results in different mg p molar ratios i e different dilution factors the experiments were conducted at ph 7 5 for both synthetic and real reject water to optimize the mg p molar ratio including the dilution effect this ph value was selected to minimize the costs regarding the use of naoh since achieving maximum p recovery at minimum cost was another objective the initial ionic concentrations at different dilution factors and the p recovery results are presented in table s2 and fig 2 respectively the p recovery was reduced by 4 and 6 respectively owing to the dilution effect of seawater at mg p 1 1 and mg p 1 67 1 with respect to the experiments without any dilution the similar experiments were performed with real reject water to test the efficiency of seawater under real conditions the real reject contains suspended solids which can affect the struvite precipitation and the purity of final product therefore the unfiltered and filtered real reject filtered with filter paper 1 2 μm pore size were used to investigate the effect of suspended solids fig 2a it was noticed that the suspended solids had no noticeable effect on p recovery but it made the separation of final product difficult as the final product was a mixture of struvite crystals and suspended solids fig s3 the mg p molar ratios of 1 67 and 2 34 were found to be optimal based on p recovery for the current reject composition at ph 7 5 so the phosphorus recovery at these molar ratios were further investigated for real filtered reject at ph 8 and 8 5 fig 2b according to fig 2b mg p 2 34 1 at ph 8 can be considered as the optimum operational condition since the cost of increasing mg p molar ratio by seawater is less than increasing the reaction ph 3 4 effect of temperature the reaction temperature determines the solubility products of all potential precipitates as well as their precipitation kinetics which can affect the recovery efficiency and potentially induce simultaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates with struvite hanhoun et al 2011 therefore the effect of temperature on struvite crystallization was investigated by performing the experiments with seawater and synthetic reject water at 20 and 30 c and the results are presented in fig 2c it was observed that increasing the temperature to 30 c hindered the struvite nucleation at mg p 1 1 during the 60 min duration of reaction in this study the increase of reaction temperature increases the solubility product of struvite which decreases its supersaturation in solution eq 1 at other mg p ratios the p recovery was reduced by 11 28 by the increase of temperature from 20 to 30 c in accordance with decreasing supersaturation however no adverse effects were observed on the product quality results showed that higher mg p molar ratio can compensate the adverse effect of higher temperature on p recovery fig 2c 3 5 product properties 3 5 1 product purity the purity of struvite precipitated from aqueous solutions containing additional ions i e calcium is determining in the effective economical implementation of the final product the presence of pure struvite in all experiments with mgcl2 and seawater was confirmed by xrd fig 3 and fig s4 the purity of struvite in the experiments with seawater was attributed to fast precipitation kinetic of struvite compared to calcium phosphate phases which was facilitated by the presence of ammonium additional experiments showed that in the absence of ammonium the final precipitate phase was mainly amorphous calcium phosphate with traces of magnesium fig s5 however presence of ammonium even at a low molar ratio of n p 1 led to the precipitation of struvite rather than other phases fig s6 the n p molar ratio should not be the limiting factor in the struvite crystallization with seawater since ammonium concentration is one of the determining factors that can enhance struvite precipitation in the presence of calcium by inhibiting precipitation of calcium bearing minerals aguado et al 2019 golubev et al 1999 gunnars et al 2004 our review showed that simultaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates by using seawater has been mainly reported in the studies with unfavorable n p molar ratio i e urine or n p 4 aguado et al 2019 an increase of n p molar ratio increases the buffer capacity of solutions precipitation kinetics and nucleation rate of struvite which makes it kinetically more favorable with respect to potential calcium phosphates at similar conditions crutchik and garrido 2011 enhanced buffer capacity of the solutions results in lowering the required ph for nucleation of struvite which in turn favors the precipitation of p as struvite and improves the product purity by reducing the share of other compounds i e calcium phosphates capdevielle et al 2013 in addition to xrd analysis complete dissolution of final precipitate obtained by using seawater and real reject water was performed fig 4 a this is because small crystalline size and low crystallinity of simultaneously precipitated phases can prevent their detection by xrd crutchik and garrido 2011 le corre et al 2005 lee et al 2013 trace amounts of sodium and potassium 0 1 wt were detected in the dissolved samples precipitated by using real reject water which is in line with previous studies nur et al 2018 also trace amounts of calcium carbonate were identified in the end product of the precipitation reaction conducted with real filtered reject water at mg p 2 34 1 and at ph 8 5 fig s7 however the calcium share with respect to struvite constituent ions in the final precipitate was less than 1 in all cases and the simultaneous precipitation of calcium bearing minerals was shown to be insignificant at all experimental conditions used in this study fig 4a the results showed that mg p molar ratio higher than 1 is beneficial specially at higher ph values to keep mg ca molar ratio high enough during the reaction the increase of reaction temperature to 30 c did not show any adverse effects on purity of struvite although the xrd spectra differed in intensities of some peaks fig s4g the total organic carbon toc content of struvite is another important factor that defines the value of the final product as mineral fertilizer or an organo mineral soil amendment eu parliment 2019 therefore the toc content of struvite obtained from seawater and real reject was analyzed fig 4b the results showed that increasing the reaction ph slightly increased the toc of the sample that can be attributed to increasing nucleation and growth rates due to increasing supersaturation with ph increasing the crystallization ph increases the number of crystals and the surface area of crystals and the probability of organic compound incorporation in the final product the higher contamination of final products by organic compounds at higher ph values has also been reported in previous work zhou et al 2015 this contamination has been explained by the coprecipitation of organic compounds or complexation between organic acids and mg2 or nh4 however the toc values in this study should be considered only for comparison purposes and not as absolute toc of the final product this is because seeded crystallization and washing of the product in full scale application will reduce the toc in the final product 3 5 2 crystal morphology the final precipitates were imaged by scanning electron microscopy sem to investigate the impact of additional ions in the seawater on the struvite morphology fig 5 the obtained struvite crystals by both mgcl2 and seawater had well faceted bipyramidal shape at low supersaturation values ph 7 5 increasing the supersaturation by increasing the ph produced hopper crystals with x shape morphology ph 8 5 and higher supersaturations ph 9 5 produced needle shape and dendritic shape crystals for both sets of experiments with mgcl2 and seawater this is due to the dominant impact of supersaturation on morphology development of crystals compared to the effects of additional ions in seawater the development of struvite crystal morphologies in correlation with supersaturation has been explained in detail in our previous work shaddel et al 2019c the initial supersaturation is an important factor also for aggregation of struvite crystals it can be seen in fig 5 panel a that at ph 8 the struvite crystals formed with seawater show some degrees of aggregation unlike the crystals with mgcl2 maintaining sufficiently high levels of supersaturation during growth of particles can enhance their aggregation shaddel et al 2019c seawater reduces the initial supersaturation with respect to struvite which consequently reduces the nucleation rate thus the supersaturation level could be maintained for aggregation of crystals the increase of temperature from 20 to 30 c had no significant impact on the morphology of the final struvite crystals fig s8 3 5 3 particle size the size distribution of the final particles of precipitation experiments were measured fig 6 due to importance of the particle size in the design and the operation of struvite crystallizers i e settleability and post handling steps filtration and drying the general trend in fig 6 shows that smaller particle size is accompanied by higher share of fine particles this is because the nucleation rate scales with initial supersaturation and higher nucleation rate produces higher numbers of particles agrawal et al 2018 the consumption of the remaining supersaturation for the growth of many particles leads to smaller particle size however lower initial supersaturations in the case of using seawater moderates the struvite nucleation rate which consequently results in larger particles the similar standard deviation values showed that homogeneity of the produced particles was not affected by seawater data not shown the size of the produced particles by real reject water was significantly smaller than synthetic reject water fig 6c this could be associated with the presence of suspended solids in the real reject water which can increase the nucleation rate by acting as heterogenous nucleation sites or with the presence of organic and inorganic impurities in the real reject water that might reduce the particle size by blocking the active growth sites and lowering the crystal growth rate koutsopoulos and dalas 2000 van der houwen and valsami jones 2001 the size difference between particles precipitated by seawater and mgcl2 is smaller for synthetic reject water while bigger size difference for real reject water shows the dominant impact of organic and inorganic impurities the larger particle sizes observed at 30 c are associated with the effect of temperature on the nucleation and growth stages of crystallization fig 6c increasing the temperature reduces the supersaturation and hence lowers the nucleation rate of struvite which results in larger particles as well as increasing the crystal growth rate 4 environmental footprint lca and chemical costs the reduction potential of the environmental footprint by using seawater as an alternative of commercial magnesium chloride has been evaluated using lca the data used in this evaluation originate from the laboratory experiments and discrepancy may occur with full scale systems the production infrastructures facility and reactors are expected to be very similar with the only difference being pumps and pipes necessary for the seawater extraction and transport yet this assessment considers only the operational phase as the contribution of the infrastructure is considered negligible as stated in the literature e g lundin et al 2000 machado et al 2007 the potential co2 eq emissions associated with each alternative at each ph considered in this study are shown in fig 7 the results indicate that the use of seawater instead of synthetic magnesium chloride would allow to reduce the co2 eq emissions in a range of 8 40 the results show that ph 9 has adverse effect on co2 eq emissions for instance the mg p 1 67 1 at ph 7 5 and 8 with seawater has the minimum co2 eq emissions while at the same conditions increasing the ph to 9 5 will increase the co2 eq emissions by 67 fig 8 a shows as an example the contribution of each component used in the molar ratio of mg p 1 67 1 using mgcl2 at ph 9 5 and fig 8b shows the contribution when seawater is used for the same ph and mg p ratio similar distribution was observed for the other conditions evaluated in this study these results indicate that the largest contribution to co2 eq emissions is due to sodium hydroxide which has the highest co2 footprint per kg 2 16 kg co2 eq kg naoh as it requires large electricity input sodium hydroxide is generated by the electrolysis of sodium chloride solution produced by mining salt deposits using high pressure water to form a brine solution which is then pumped to the production facility garcia herrero et al 2017 traditionally electrolysis has been carried out by the mercury amalgam or diaphragm cell processes but the share of ion exchange membrane cell is growing for environmental and economic reasons garcia herrero et al 2017 the main production route in the us is via the diaphragm cell while the mercury and membrane cells are more dominant in europe sodium hydroxide used for the comparison presented in this study is modelled using the production mix model mercury cell 55 1 diaphragm cell 23 5 and membrane cell 21 4 available in ecoinvent database for the production mix an electricity consumption of 3 356 kwh kg naoh is calculated based on electricity input of 3 294 kwh kg naoh 3 920 kwh kg naoh and 2 900 kwh kg naoh for mercury cell diaphragm cell and membrane cell productions respectively consequently the electricity mix used for the production would have a large impact on the resulting co2 footprint and a production powered with renewable electricity should always be favored as well as membrane cell production the second largest contributor is the mgcl2 which has a co2 footprint of 0 293 kg co2 eq kg mgcl2 while the transport and the electricity are minor contributors magnesium chloride used in this study is produced in netherland with a total required energy of 1835 mj ton which is equivalent to 0 513 kwh kg mgcl2 6h2o similarly to sodium hydroxide magnesium chloride salts are extracted from depth by applying water under high pressure salts are then dissolved to form a concentrated brine 30 magnesium chloride which is then pressed upwards the brine is then purified by a series of processes and then heated to get a saturated solution of 47 magnesium chloride this hot concentrated liquid is then transported to a water cooled rotating drum where solid magnesium chloride flakes are formed nedmag 2004 the outcome of the comparison is very dependent on the input of sodium hydroxide and to smaller extent to magnesium sources however these results are very site specific as they depend on the type of production and electricity energy mix the reduction of co2 emissions implies optimizing the use of chemicals as the conditions requiring lower input of that chemical would have lower co2 emissions table s3 but also selecting the greenest available chemicals with respect to production and transport indeed the type of technology e g membrane cells for sodium hydroxide production and renewable electricity energy should always be favored to reduce the impact of those chemicals as long as the emissions associated with the transport distance and type to the struvite production site does not outweigh the benefits the chemical costs constitute an important fraction of the operational costs magnesium source cost is a major part of the overall struvite production costs 50 70 which is deterministic on payback time the chemical cost calculations based on the experimental results in this study were performed for using mgcl2 and seawater as magnesium sources fig s9 the energy cost for pumping is the only associated cost with using seawater as mg source which has been calculated according to meneses et al 2010 meneses et al 2010 the results showed that increasing the ph when magnesium is the limiting factor is not cost effective owing to low product yield with respect to high chemical consumption i e mg p 1 1 at ph 8 5 further the naoh consumption for initial raise of ph increases exponentially by ph and the ph values higher than 8 5 are not cost effective this is due to high buffer capacity of phosphate that implies addition of considerably higher amount of naoh in the current study the base requirement for adjustment of initial ph to 8 5 and 9 5 were respectively 2 2 and 7 7 times higher than base requirement for ph 7 5 our calculations show that struvite production by seawater has clearly lower chemical costs than using mgcl2 which can reduce the chemical costs by 30 50 the combination of using seawater and ph values of 8 and 8 5 showed lower costs and the lowest cost was obtained by using seawater at mg p 1 1 at ph 8 however the mg ca is a determining factor for minimum simultaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates meaning mg p 1 67 1 at ph 8 can be considered as the optimum operational window in this case the lca analysis and calculation of chemical costs are based on lab scale experimental results in this study and presented for comparison between mgcl2 and seawater while an inclusive analysis applicable for full scale requires data of main metrics in relevant scale i e operational and maintenance costs savings revenue and period of analysis 5 conclusion the presented study demonstrated both the potential of seawater as an alternative magnesium source for struvite production and the optimization of operational conditions for enhancing phosphorus recovery and product quality the minimal reduction of phosphorus recovery 1 6 by using seawater compared to mgcl2 indicates seawater can be an adequate magnesium source for struvite production the mg ca and n p molar ratios and reaction ph were important factors to control the simultaneous precipitation of calcium phosphates it was concluded that the simultaneous precipitation of other compounds would not significantly compromise the struvite purity in the final product the particle size of the final crystals was highly dependent on supersaturation and ph has a prominent impact on supersaturation as the median particle size was reduced by 40 70 at the ph values higher than 8 the presence of soluble organic compounds in the real reject water reduced the median particle size by 50 70 the presence of suspended solids in this study had no notable impact on the phosphorus recovery but it reduced the final product quality by making it more difficult to separate the final product from the suspended solids the increase of temperature from 20 c to 30 c reduced the phosphorus recovery 11 28 but produced slightly bigger crystals the lca analysis in this study showed that optimization of reaction conditions mg p and ph is an effective approach to minimize the co2 eq emissions of struvite production it was shown that using seawater instead of mgcl2 will improve the environmental and financial sustainability of the struvite production process by reducing the co2 footprint by 8 40 and the chemical costs by 30 50 the results show that the concept of using untreated seawater as an alternative magnesium source for struvite precipitation is feasible both technically and economically owing to the controlled conditions and the lab scale experiments in this study investigation in larger scales is recommended for verification of the results and demonstration of benefits

18116,alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons apahs are the main components of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in petroleum contaminated waters in our study three kinds of green microalgae pseudokirchneriella subcapitata chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus were shown to degrade six kinds of methylphenanthrenes 1 methylphenanthren 2 methylphenanthrenem 3 nmmethylphenanthrene 4 methylphenanthren 9 methylphenanthrene and 3 6 dimethylphenanthrene with different degrading abilities among the six methylphenanthrenes 99 8 of 1 methylphenanthrene 1 mp was removed and 75 6 of 3 6 dimethylphenanthrene 3 6 dmp was removed by p subcapitata after 7 days of incubation the metabolites of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp were identified by gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms six metabolites of 1 mp and one metabolite of 3 6 dmp were found they were all monohydroxylated methylphenanthrenes the oh group was added to either methyl group or benzene ring through the monooxygenase system and the methyl group attack was the main pathway this research increases our knowledge of the degrading ability of apahs by green microalgae and offers information for the bioremediation of apahs quantum chemical calculation was conducted to elucidate the biodegradation metabolites of methylphenanthrene by green microalgae which is a helpful tool in the bioremediation of environmental pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons microalgae biodegradation quantum chemical calculation monooxygenase 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are ubiquitous environmental contaminants found in air soil and aquatic environments bozlaker et al 2008 alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons apahs are the derivatives of pahs comprising up to 98 of the total pah fraction in crude oil hawthorne et al 2006 in petroleum contaminated soil phenanthrenic compounds including phenanthrene 1 2 3 methylphenanthrenes and 2 6 dimethylphenanthrene are predominant over other pahs and can account for approximately 46 of all detectable pahs zhong et al 2017 methylphenanthrene is a kind of important apah in the environment compared with their non alkylated homologues methylphenanthrenes are more persistent barron and holder 2003 the bioaccumulation due to the decreased water solubility in the presence of alkyls increases the possibility of affecting microorganisms seo et al 2009 moreover the existence of methyl groups has been found to be more toxic than their parental compounds honda et al 1990 sabate et al 1999 methylphenanthrene was found to increase its potency by 2 5 times in human aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activation and signaling processes sun et al 2014 exposure to dimethyl pahs reduced the latching success of embryonic medaka and increased the time of hatching rhodes et al 2005 therefore it is imperative to study the degradation of methylphenanthrenes in crude oil polluted environments although apahs are toxic and recalcitrant to degradation chen et al 2013 research on the biotic removal and transformation of apahs is inadequate and mainly focused on benthic invertebrates bacterium and fungi cerniglia et al 1984 dutta et al 1998 malmquist et al 2013 nadalig et al 2002 zhong et al 2017 for example the soil organism nereis diversicolor transformed 21 of 1 methylpyrene to 1 pyrenecarboxylic acid glucuronide conjugates and glycine conjugate malmquist et al 2013 the bacterium species sphingomonas paucimobilis strain dutta et al 1998 sphingobium sp mp9 4 zhong et al 2017 and sphingomonas sp 2mpii nadalig et al 2002 can degrade apahs thoroughly through monooxygenase or dioxygenase systems moreover the fungi species cunninghamella elegans has been reported to convert 1 and 2 methylnaphthalene to 1 and 2 hydroxymethylnaphthalene respectively cerniglia et al 1984 as primary producers microalgae have important ecological status in the environment as the first acceptor of toxicants in the food chain hong et al 2008 some microalgae species can degrade pahs chan et al 2006 chlorella vulgaris c vulgaris pseudokirchneriella subcapitata p subcapitata and scenedesmus obliquus s obliquus were reported to remove parent pahs including phenanthrene pyrene fluoranthene and benzo a pyrene lei et al 2007 luo et al 2014 for apahs no research has reported on removal and biodegradation with microalgae the existence of methyl groups in pah biodegradation by microalgae has rarely been investigated to understand the degradation of apahs by microalgae the degradation of methylphenanthrene by green microalgae was investigated the lack of authentic standards is a problem in identifying the metabolites of pollutants and quantum chemical calculation was used to predict the metabolite structures of methylphenanthrene 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 1 methylphenanthrene 1 mp 99 2 methylphenanthrene 2 mp 99 4 methylphenanthrene 4 mp 99 and 9 methylphenanthrene 9 mp 99 were obtained from

guangzhou china 2 2 alga culture to screen for algae with the ability to degrade apahs three microalgae species p subcapitata c vulgaris and s obliquus were selected p subcapitata and c vulgaris under pure culture were obtained from carolina biological supply company burlington nc usa s obliquus was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china the algae were cultured in sterilized soil extract se medium at 22 2 c illuminated with cool white fluorescent light at a light intensity of 80 μmol m 2 s 1 and a light dark cycle of 16 8 h cells reaching the mid to late exponential growth phase 5 7 days were harvested by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min at 4 c and washed with sterile deionized water the cell number was counted using a hemocytometer boeco germany 2 3 capacity to degrade methylphenanthrenes with microalgae the initial cell densities of p subcapitata c vulgaris and s obliquus were set as 5 63 106 5 28 106 and 2 93 106 cells ml 1 respectively in this test six methylphenanthrenes 1 mp 2 mp 3 mp 4 mp 9 mp and 3 6 dmp were selected as target compounds which are typical apahs for each microalga six methylphenanthrenes were spiked separately the initial concentrations of 1 mp 2 mp 3 mp 4 mp and 9 mp were 0 5 mg l 1 and the concentration of 3 6 dmp was 0 1 mg l 1 control groups without inoculation of algal cells were set to monitor the abiotic losses of apahs the experiments were carried out in conical flasks shaken on a rotary shaker 160 rpm at room temperature 22 2 c with the same photoperiod 16 8 h light dark and light intensity 80 μmol m 2 s 1 as for the algal culture triplicate flasks from each group were cultured and the residual concentrations of methylphenanthrenes in the medium and in algal cells were determined after 14 days of incubation 2 4 degradation of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp by p subcapitata microalgae of p subcapitata was selected to further degrade 1 mp and 3 6 dmp the initial density of p subcapitata was set as 2 106 cells ml 1 in 100 ml culture medium in 250 ml flasks the concentrations of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp were both adjusted to 0 5 mg l 1 the flasks without algal cells were used as the abiotic controls to monitor the abiotic loss of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp triplicate flasks from each group were retrieved after 1 3 5 and 7 days of exposure 200 μl of suspension was sampled to count the cell number of p subcapitata and the remainder were used to determine the concentration of residual methylphenanthrenes and identify the metabolites of methylphenanthrenes the growth of the microalgae in the stress of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp was tested according to the oecd guidelines for the testing of chemicals freshwater alga and cyanobacteria growth inhibition test oecd 2011 the 96h ec50 and 95 confidential interval of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp with p subcapitata were calculated with graphpad prism 5 2 5 extraction of methylphenanthrenes algal cells were separated from the medium by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min at 4 c the residual methylphenanthrenes in the medium were extracted twice with ethyl acetate 2 25 ml by liquid liquid extraction phenanthrene d10 the surrogate standard for the quantification of methylphenanthrenes was added before the extraction after removing the water from the extracts with anhydrous sodium sulfate the extracts were concentrated to 1 ml by rotary evaporation heidolph laborota 4000 the final volume was adjusted to 1 ml and stored at 4 c for further analysis to extract the target compounds absorbed in the microalgae cells the cells were mixed with 4 ml ethyl acetate and extracted three times by ultrasonification 30 min each time then the organic phase was separated by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min the organic phase was combined and concentrated in the same way as the medium 2 6 analysis of methylphenanthrenes the concentrations of methylphenanthrenes were determined using an agilent technologies 7890a gas chromatograph gc equipped with a 5975c mass spectrometer ms and a db 5ms capillary column length 30 m inner diameter 0 25 mm film thickness 0 25 μm the injector temperature was held at 280 c the injection mode was splitless with an injection volume of 1 μl the carrier gas was ultrapure helium at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the temperature program initial column temperature of 90 c followed by heating to 210 c at a rate of 20 c min 1 to 235 c at a rate of 3 c min 1 and to 300 c at a rate of 30 c min 1 the ms was operated in electron impact ionization ei mode with an energy of 70 ev and the detector temperature was 280 c the samples were analyzed in the selected ion monitoring sim mode the limit of detection lod of the six methylphenanthrenes defined as a signal three times the noise level ranged from 0 44 to 21 85 μg l 1 2 7 determination of methylphenanthrene metabolites the analysis of apahs metabolites was performed using gc ms after derivatization with mtbstfa the extract was concentrated to nearly dry under a gentle steam of nitrogen gas then 50 μl mtbstfa were added and the reaction was performed in a water bath at 60 c after 60 min the solution was concentrated by gentle nitrogen flow and redissolved in 1 ml ethyl acetate the parameters of gc and ms were the same as in the apah analysis except for the gc column temperature program the initial column temperature was held at 100 c for 1 min then heated to 160 c at the speed of 15 c min 1 to 300 c at a rate of 4 c min 1 and then held for 2 min the identification of apah metabolites was confirmed by comparing their retention times and characteristic mass spectra with the authentic standards or their isomers the mass spectral library of nist and the literature the mass spectra were acquired in full scan mode ranging from 50 to 500 amu 2 8 computational details the structure calculations were carried out using density functional theory dft in the gaussian 09 package becke 1993 the geometry optimizations of the reactants rcs transition states tss intermediates ims and products pcs were performed by the m06 2x function method zhao and truhlar 2007 and the 6 31 g d p basis set was carried out to descry all the atoms the vibrational frequency and intrinsic reaction coordinate irc were calculated at the same level as above gonzalez and schlegel 1989 1990 the vibrational frequency calculation was given to verify the stable point on the potential energy surface there were no imaginary frequencies for the rcs and pcs and only one imaginary frequency for the tss at 298 15 k and 1 atm the irc was employed to verify the optimal reaction path from rc to pc in addition to explore the accurate energy the single point energy of all the optimal structures was calculated at m06 2x6 311 g 2df 2p and the solvent effect was investigated with a solvation model density smd continuum model in water solution marenich et al 2009 2 9 statistical analysis the mean and standard deviation values of the triplicates were calculated the growth of p subcapitata of different groups at each sampling time was compared by one way analysis of variance anova if the anova results were significant at p 0 05 tukey s multiple comparisons were applied as post hoc tests to determine where the differences occurred using spss 3 results and discussion 3 1 alkylphenanthrene degradation ability of microalgae three microalgae species p subcapitata s obliquus and c vulgaris were selected to test their alkylphenanthrene degradation ability five monomethylated phenanthrenes 1 mp 2 mp 3 mp 4 mp and 9 mp and one dimethylated phenanthrene 3 6 dmp were the target compounds the alkylphenanthrenes were removed in biotic and abiotic ways after 14 days of incubation six alkylphenanthrenes were slightly removed by abiotic loss in the control group the removal percentages were 14 8 8 9 17 1 24 2 24 2 and 23 2 for 1 mp 2 mp 3 mp 4 mp and 9 mp and 3 6 dmp respectively fig s1 the abiotic loss was mostly attributed to photooxidation bacosa et al 2015 the abiotic loss of 1 mp 2 mp and 3 mp were lower than that of 4 mp and 9 mp which is consistent with the research of baocosa et al 2015 but contrary to that of radovic et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 the percentages of the apah residual in the medium uptake in the cells and biodegradation were dependent on the microalgae species the amounts of apah residual in the medium and uptake in cells were highest in c vulgaris c vulgaris was the least effective species in degrading apahs and p subcapitata was the most effective species almost 100 of the apahs were biodegraded by p subcapitata whereas only 0 97 29 5 of the apahs were biodegraded by c vulgaris these results were similar to the degradation of pahs p subcapitata was the most effective species to degrade pyrene and fluoranthene and c vulgaris was the least effective species lei et al 2007 the microalgae s obliquus also degraded apahs 68 8 98 1 of the apahs were biodegraded after 14 days incubation the residual apahs in the system tended to adsorb on algal cells 39 0 68 8 of the apahs were uptake by algal cells in c vulgaris fig 1b different physico chemical properties of microalgae such as the cell wall composition enzymes involved and lipid content are important in the detoxification and degradation of apahs lei et al 2007 as toxicants to microalgae cells apahs stimulate the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps to establish a barrier with strong three dimensional networks that can adsorb apahs chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the amount of eps secreted by c vulgaris was abundant chen et al 2015 compounds of 4 mp and 9 mp were resistant to biodegradation by s obliquus but showed a relatively high biodegradation rate by c vulgaris fig 1c this suggests that the degradation of apahs is dependent on the microalgae species moreover we can found that these microalgae exhibit the ability to biodegrade apahs without further acclimation in any subculture of pahs apahs which has also been reported in previous published literatures lei et al 2007 subashchandrabose et al 2017 3 2 biodegradation of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp by p subcapitata p subcapitata is a typical microalga that degrades pahs and apahs thus it was selected for further study with1 mp and 3 6 dmp the growth of p subcapitata under the stress of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp is shown in fig 2 in the first 5 days the cell density of p subcapitata was significantly lower in the 1 mp group than that in control group p 0 05 however the density of p subcapitata in the 3 6 dmp group shows no significant difference from the control group p 0 05 after 7 days of incubation the growth of the three groups had no significant difference p 0 05 possibly because most of the apahs were removed from the system the toxicity of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp to p subcapitata was also tested the 96h ec50 of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp to p subcapitata were 0 173 and 0 241 mg l 1 respectively table s1 indicating that 1 mp was more toxic to microalgae than 3 6 dmp it was most likely due to the difference of their physical properties eg water solubility the water solubility of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp was 0 269 and 0 071 mg l 1 respectively may et al 1983 nlm 2019 the higher water solubility of 1 mp made the microalgae exposure to higher effective concentration as shown in fig 3 the concentration of 1 mp decreased rapidly during the incubation of p subcapitata the biodegradation percentage was nearly 100 after 5 days which demonstrated that 1 mp can be totally transferred with p subcapitata compared with 1 mp the structure of 3 6 dmp was more stable and the biodegradation percentage was 73 6 after 7 days the degradation of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp was fitted to the first order reaction r2 0 9574 for 1 mp r2 0 9166 for 3 6 dmp and the half lives t1 2 were calculated as 0 75 and 4 18 d respectively fig s2 the increased methyl group slowed down the biodegradation rate of apah by microalgae 3 3 identification of the metabolites of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp the metabolites of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp were separated and identified using gc ms the gc ms chromatogram and qualitative parameters of the metabolites are displayed in fig s3 and table 1 six compounds were found in the degradation of 1 mp peak 3 p3 at the retention time of 26 604 min was identified as 1 phenanthrenemethanol 1 p methanol by comparing the mass spectra and gc retention time with the authentic standard the other five metabolites were considered isomers because they had nearly identical mass spectra with ion fragments at m z 322 265 250 and 235 according to the authentic standard p2 and p4 were identified as 9 hydroxy 1 methylphenanthrene 9 oh 1 mp and 9 hydroxy 8 methylphenanthrene 9 oh 8 mp respectively the oh group was added to the benzene ring however the position of the oh group in peaks 1 5 and 6 could not be confirmed because of the lack of authentic standards they were tentatively identified as monohydroxymethylphenanthrene i ii and iii respectively the hydroxylated metabolites of 1 mp detected in the present work were similar to those reports for its parent compound phenanthrene for example the primary metabolite of phenanthrene with p subcapitata was monohydroxylated phenanthrene such as 4 9 3 1 2 oh phenanthrene chan et al 2006 ke et al 2010 the existence of methyl group in 1 mp changed the position of oh group in the metabolites all the metabolites were found in the medium and little was found in the algae cells it is suggested that an oh group was added when 1 mp entered the intracellular matrix to increase its polarity and then it was excreted to the extracellular matrix as soon as possible the concentrations of 1 p methanol 9 oh 1 mp and 9 oh 8 mp were analyzed and are shown in fig 4 a compound of 1 p methanol had the highest concentration and reached the highest accumulation first at day 3 suggesting that the ch3 site in 1 mp was the most vulnerable to be attacked by an oh group the metabolite of 9 oh 8 mp had the lowest concentration among the three metabolites the metabolite content first increased and then decreased during 7 days of incubation indicating that the monohydroxymethylphenanthrenes would be further degraded however no ring open product was found during the incubation the concentrations of monohydroxymethylphenanthrene i ii and iii were roughly quantitated according to the average calibration curve of 9 oh 1 mp and 9 oh 8 mp ke et al 2010 since they were isomers with similar retention times and ion fragments although the results are not very precise they are acceptable because the isomers of 9 oh 1 mp and 9 oh 8 mp had very similar calibration curves the concentrations of monohydroxymethylphenanthrene i ii and iii during 7 days of incubation is shown in fig s4 monohydroxymethylphenanthrene ii had the highest concentration at day 3 and then declined different from the other metabolites the content of monohydroxymethylphenanthrene i kept an increased trend during the 7 days of incubation indicating that this metabolite would be accumulated without degradation to evaluate the 1 mp degradation by microalgae the metabolites of 1 mp were converted into parent 1 mp according to the mass balance calculation and the result is shown in fig 4b monohydroxymethylphenanthrene i ii and iii were defined as unknown metabolites in fig 4b at the beginning of the third day nearly all the disappeared 1 mp was transformed into hydroxyl compounds and the recovery percentages were 92 3 95 6 indicating that almost all the metabolites of 1 mp were detected the benzene ring of 1 mp cannot be broken and the metabolites accumulated in medium in the early incubation period when the incubation time was extended to 5 days the recovery percentage declined at day 7 the parent 1 mp was 100 degraded fig 3 and only 42 0 of 1 mp remained as hydroxyl metabolites suggesting that the hydroxyl compounds can be further degraded only one metabolite of 3 6 dmp was detected at a retention time of 28 607 min fig s3b it had a molecular ion m at m z 336 and fragment ions at m z 279 m c ch3 3 and 205 m osi ch3 2c ch3 3 table 1 and fig 5 a it was confirmed as a monohydroxylated compound according to the fragment ions moreover the major fragment ions of m z 279 and 205 showed a mass shift 14 methyl substituted relative to 1 p methanol m z 265 191 this result suggests that the position of the oh group was on the methyl side the position c 3 is equal to c 6 hence the metabolite of 3 6 dmp was concluded as 3 methanol 6 methylphenanthrene the amount of it was represented with a peak area ratio of metabolite to surrogate standard phenanthrene d10 which increased during 7 days of incubation fig 5b similar to 1 mp the metabolite was mainly in the medium and only 7 82 17 4 was in the cell besides 3 methanol 6 methylphenanthrene no other metabolite was found in the incubation of 3 6 dmp with p subcapitata which was much different from 1 mp the degradation products of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp in the abiotic control were also determined however none of the biodegradation metabolites in biotic treatments were found in the abiotic control the compounds of phenanthrenequinone were determined as the main product of phenanthrene photodegradation kou et al 2009 hence quinones were concluded as the photodegradation products of methylphenanthrene but no quinone was found in abiotic control in this work when referred to the mass spectral library of nist which needed a further research in the future methylphenanthrenes were transformed by microalgae through the oxidation of alkyl groups and formed monohydroxylated metabolites for the initial research however the biodegradation of apahs by bacterium had many researches and two pathways have been summarized one was the biodegradation through dioxygenase which leads to the formation of dihydrodiols and subsequent ring cleavage and the other one was the oxidation of alkyls to form corresponding alcohols aldehyde and carboxylic acid dutta et al 1998 mahajan et al 1994 malmquist et al 2013 sabate et al 1999 zhong et al 2017 the pathway through dioxygenase was more important than the oxidation of alkyls in bacterium zhong et al 2017 for microalgae few studies have been devoted to the biodegradation of apahs the reported dihydrodiols and ring cleavage intermediates in bacterium were not found in the incubation of microalgae when apahs entered the microalgae cells they were transformed to hydroxylated apahs that are more water soluble than their parent compounds then the microalgae eliminated the hydrophilic compounds into the medium to reduce the toxic effect to the cells the degradation pathway is not well understood and needs more attention among six monohydroxylated metabolites of 1 mp p subcapitata preferred to produce benzylic alcohol derivatives 1 phenanthrenemethanol rather than ring hydroxylation products the only metabolite of 3 6 dmp we observed was a benzylic alcohol derivative 3 methanol 6 methylphenanthrene the same phenomenon was reported by dutta et al 1998 methyl monoxygenation may first form benzylic alcohol the difference in the hydroxyl sites resulted in the differences in their physicochemical properties fallahtafti et al 2012 tested the toxicity of four ring hydroxylation methylphenanthrenes and benzylic alcohol derivatives to japanese medaka the results show that the ring hydroxylation increased the apah toxicity the congenital avoidance of disadvantages of organisms may explain why more benzylic alcohol derivatives were formed 3 4 computational study of apah metabolites since authentic standards for apah metabolites are rare many metabolites cannot be determined and thus high accuracy molecular orbital calculations were carried out to determine the potential metabolites according to the potential degradation pathways based on the results of the laboratory experiments the dominant products were identified as apah phenol table 1 suggesting that the oh addition is the dominant reaction pathway the computational study of apahs with microalgae was primarily focused on the reaction of apahs with the oh group there are two steps in the reaction of apah with the oh group first the oh group attacks c atoms in benzene ring forming a reaction complex rc then different adduct isomers im are formed through the oh addition to the c atoms in the process of im a transition state ts is formed next the im further reacts via unimolecular decomposition to yield oh apahs through cleavage of the c h bond fig 6 the rate limiting step is step 1 since step 2 progresses rapidly the compound of 1 mp was selected as an example to display the reaction pathway for convenience of description the c atoms in 1 mp were numbered as presents in fig 6 the oh group can add to ch3 in the 1 mp molecule directly via unimolecular decomposition to yield 1 p methanol the reaction is more likely to occur due to skipping step 1 which was the rate limiting step comparison of the oh addition to the benzene ring with the methyl group shows that oh addition to the methyl group is energetically without a barrier the calculation results were well in agreement with the laboratory experimental data the amount of 1 p methanol was highest at the beginning of the third day fig 4 for the c atoms in the benzene ring nine different oh 1 mp isomers can readily form through oh addition to the c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8 c9 and c10 atoms since the ts of a chemical reaction is a particular configuration along the reaction coordinate it is defined as the state corresponding to the highest potential energy along this reaction coordinate the production of oh 1 mp was dependent on the gibbs reaction energy δg of the ts the ts is strongly endothermic by 5 96 8 69 kcal mol on nine c atom particularly the oh addition to the c9 atom has a lower barrier and the most energetically favorable relative to the addition to other c atoms this was supported by the result of the laboratory experiments 9 oh 1 mp showed the highest content among the detected metabolites fig 4 the δg of ts to form 9 oh 1 mp and 9 oh 8 mp equal to 10 oh 1 mp was higher than the other metabolites suggesting that the positions of c9 and c10 are more active than the other c positions the c9 and c10 positions are known as the k region of phenanthrene which is the oleinic aromatic double bond with high electron density three unknown metabolites named memonohydroxymethylphenanthrene i ii and iii were found table 1 with concentrations in the order of ii iii i at the beginning of the third days fig s3 according to the result of the dft calculation in fig 6 we can estimate that metabolites i ii and iii might be 2 oh 1 mp 4 oh 1 mp and 8 oh 1 mp respectively the reaction energy in c3 c6 and c7 in the benzene ring is higher than the other c atoms suggesting that these positions are a high energy barrier for oh addition the 3 6 dmp molecule has a c 2v symmetry c1 and c8 c2 and c7 c3 and c6 c4 and c5 and c9 and c10 are thus equivalent four different oh 3 6 dmp adduct isomers can be formed through the addition of oh to the c1 c2 c4 and c9 atoms the corresponding δg of ts range from 5 88 to 8 32 kcal mol at the m06 2x 6 311 g 2df 2p level table s2 the oh addition to the c9 atom has the lowest activation barrier except for the methyl position all the gibbs reaction energies were estimated at 298 k and 1 atm unless otherwise specified the reaction energy of oh addition to 2 mp 3 mp 4 mp and 9 mp at each c position was also calculated and is shown in tables s3 6 the oh addition to the c9 or c10 atoms is the most exothermic and the most energetically favorable relative to addition to other c atoms except for the methyl position which indicates that the k region of phenanthrene was reactive for substitution reaction the relatively low gibbs activation barriers and strong exothermicity imply that the formation of methyl phenanthrol can occur under ambient conditions quantum calculation is usually used in the chemical reaction system eg radical mediated degradation of pah dang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 the quantum chemical calculation was attempted to predict the biodegradation of apahs by microalgae in the present work the theoretical calculations of these metabolites were in well agreement with the experimental results obtained by gc ms this suggests that biological degradation by enzyme catalyzed reaction also complies with the principles of chemical reaction hence quantum chemical calculation would be a helpful tool to predict the reaction pathway of pollutants by biodegradation 4 conclusions this study discovers that the green microalgae p subcapitata c vulgaris and s obliquus had different degradation abilities for methylphenanthrenes among them p subcapitata were the most efficient species p subcapitata degraded methylphenanthrenes through monooxidation to form monohydroxlated compounds this study introduces the possibility of biodegradation of apahs by green microalgae for the first time offering important

graphical abstract image 1 keywords alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons microalgae biodegradation quantum chemical calculation monooxygenase 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are ubiquitous environmental contaminants found in air soil and aquatic environments bozlaker et al 2008 alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons apahs are the derivatives of pahs comprising up to 98 of the total pah fraction in crude oil hawthorne et al 2006 in petroleum contaminated soil phenanthrenic compounds including phenanthrene 1 2 3 methylphenanthrenes and 2 6 dimethylphenanthrene are predominant over other pahs and can account for approximately 46 of all detectable pahs zhong et al 2017 methylphenanthrene is a kind of important apah in the environment compared with their non alkylated homologues methylphenanthrenes are more persistent barron and holder 2003 the bioaccumulation due to the decreased water solubility in the presence of alkyls increases the possibility of affecting microorganisms seo et al 2009 moreover the existence of methyl groups has been found to be more toxic than their parental compounds honda et al 1990 sabate et al 1999 methylphenanthrene was found to increase its potency by 2 5 times in human aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr activation and signaling processes sun et al 2014 exposure to dimethyl pahs reduced the latching success of embryonic medaka and increased the time of hatching rhodes et al 2005 therefore it is imperative to study the degradation of methylphenanthrenes in crude oil polluted environments although apahs are toxic and recalcitrant to degradation chen et al 2013 research on the biotic removal and transformation of apahs is inadequate and mainly focused on benthic invertebrates bacterium and fungi cerniglia et al 1984 dutta et al 1998 malmquist et al 2013 nadalig et al 2002 zhong et al 2017 for example the soil organism nereis diversicolor transformed 21 of 1 methylpyrene to 1 pyrenecarboxylic acid glucuronide conjugates and glycine conjugate malmquist et al 2013 the bacterium species sphingomonas paucimobilis strain dutta et al 1998 sphingobium sp mp9 4 zhong et al 2017 and sphingomonas sp 2mpii nadalig et al 2002 can degrade apahs thoroughly through monooxygenase or dioxygenase systems moreover the fungi species cunninghamella elegans has been reported to convert 1 and 2 methylnaphthalene to 1 and 2 hydroxymethylnaphthalene respectively cerniglia et al 1984 as primary producers microalgae have important ecological status in the environment as the first acceptor of toxicants in the food chain hong et al 2008 some microalgae species can degrade pahs chan et al 2006 chlorella vulgaris c vulgaris pseudokirchneriella subcapitata p subcapitata and scenedesmus obliquus s obliquus were reported to remove parent pahs including phenanthrene pyrene fluoranthene and benzo a pyrene lei et al 2007 luo et al 2014 for apahs no research has reported on removal and biodegradation with microalgae the existence of methyl groups in pah biodegradation by microalgae has rarely been investigated to understand the degradation of apahs by microalgae the degradation of methylphenanthrene by green microalgae was investigated the lack of authentic standards is a problem in identifying the metabolites of pollutants and quantum chemical calculation was used to predict the metabolite structures of methylphenanthrene 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 1 methylphenanthrene 1 mp 99 2 methylphenanthrene 2 mp 99 4 methylphenanthrene 4 mp 99 and 9 methylphenanthrene 9 mp 99 were obtained from

guangzhou china 2 2 alga culture to screen for algae with the ability to degrade apahs three microalgae species p subcapitata c vulgaris and s obliquus were selected p subcapitata and c vulgaris under pure culture were obtained from carolina biological supply company burlington nc usa s obliquus was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china the algae were cultured in sterilized soil extract se medium at 22 2 c illuminated with cool white fluorescent light at a light intensity of 80 μmol m 2 s 1 and a light dark cycle of 16 8 h cells reaching the mid to late exponential growth phase 5 7 days were harvested by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min at 4 c and washed with sterile deionized water the cell number was counted using a hemocytometer boeco germany 2 3 capacity to degrade methylphenanthrenes with microalgae the initial cell densities of p subcapitata c vulgaris and s obliquus were set as 5 63 106 5 28 106 and 2 93 106 cells ml 1 respectively in this test six methylphenanthrenes 1 mp 2 mp 3 mp 4 mp 9 mp and 3 6 dmp were selected as target compounds which are typical apahs for each microalga six methylphenanthrenes were spiked separately the initial concentrations of 1 mp 2 mp 3 mp 4 mp and 9 mp were 0 5 mg l 1 and the concentration of 3 6 dmp was 0 1 mg l 1 control groups without inoculation of algal cells were set to monitor the abiotic losses of apahs the experiments were carried out in conical flasks shaken on a rotary shaker 160 rpm at room temperature 22 2 c with the same photoperiod 16 8 h light dark and light intensity 80 μmol m 2 s 1 as for the algal culture triplicate flasks from each group were cultured and the residual concentrations of methylphenanthrenes in the medium and in algal cells were determined after 14 days of incubation 2 4 degradation of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp by p subcapitata microalgae of p subcapitata was selected to further degrade 1 mp and 3 6 dmp the initial density of p subcapitata was set as 2 106 cells ml 1 in 100 ml culture medium in 250 ml flasks the concentrations of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp were both adjusted to 0 5 mg l 1 the flasks without algal cells were used as the abiotic controls to monitor the abiotic loss of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp triplicate flasks from each group were retrieved after 1 3 5 and 7 days of exposure 200 μl of suspension was sampled to count the cell number of p subcapitata and the remainder were used to determine the concentration of residual methylphenanthrenes and identify the metabolites of methylphenanthrenes the growth of the microalgae in the stress of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp was tested according to the oecd guidelines for the testing of chemicals freshwater alga and cyanobacteria growth inhibition test oecd 2011 the 96h ec50 and 95 confidential interval of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp with p subcapitata were calculated with graphpad prism 5 2 5 extraction of methylphenanthrenes algal cells were separated from the medium by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min at 4 c the residual methylphenanthrenes in the medium were extracted twice with ethyl acetate 2 25 ml by liquid liquid extraction phenanthrene d10 the surrogate standard for the quantification of methylphenanthrenes was added before the extraction after removing the water from the extracts with anhydrous sodium sulfate the extracts were concentrated to 1 ml by rotary evaporation heidolph laborota 4000 the final volume was adjusted to 1 ml and stored at 4 c for further analysis to extract the target compounds absorbed in the microalgae cells the cells were mixed with 4 ml ethyl acetate and extracted three times by ultrasonification 30 min each time then the organic phase was separated by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min the organic phase was combined and concentrated in the same way as the medium 2 6 analysis of methylphenanthrenes the concentrations of methylphenanthrenes were determined using an agilent technologies 7890a gas chromatograph gc equipped with a 5975c mass spectrometer ms and a db 5ms capillary column length 30 m inner diameter 0 25 mm film thickness 0 25 μm the injector temperature was held at 280 c the injection mode was splitless with an injection volume of 1 μl the carrier gas was ultrapure helium at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the temperature program initial column temperature of 90 c followed by heating to 210 c at a rate of 20 c min 1 to 235 c at a rate of 3 c min 1 and to 300 c at a rate of 30 c min 1 the ms was operated in electron impact ionization ei mode with an energy of 70 ev and the detector temperature was 280 c the samples were analyzed in the selected ion monitoring sim mode the limit of detection lod of the six methylphenanthrenes defined as a signal three times the noise level ranged from 0 44 to 21 85 μg l 1 2 7 determination of methylphenanthrene metabolites the analysis of apahs metabolites was performed using gc ms after derivatization with mtbstfa the extract was concentrated to nearly dry under a gentle steam of nitrogen gas then 50 μl mtbstfa were added and the reaction was performed in a water bath at 60 c after 60 min the solution was concentrated by gentle nitrogen flow and redissolved in 1 ml ethyl acetate the parameters of gc and ms were the same as in the apah analysis except for the gc column temperature program the initial column temperature was held at 100 c for 1 min then heated to 160 c at the speed of 15 c min 1 to 300 c at a rate of 4 c min 1 and then held for 2 min the identification of apah metabolites was confirmed by comparing their retention times and characteristic mass spectra with the authentic standards or their isomers the mass spectral library of nist and the literature the mass spectra were acquired in full scan mode ranging from 50 to 500 amu 2 8 computational details the structure calculations were carried out using density functional theory dft in the gaussian 09 package becke 1993 the geometry optimizations of the reactants rcs transition states tss intermediates ims and products pcs were performed by the m06 2x function method zhao and truhlar 2007 and the 6 31 g d p basis set was carried out to descry all the atoms the vibrational frequency and intrinsic reaction coordinate irc were calculated at the same level as above gonzalez and schlegel 1989 1990 the vibrational frequency calculation was given to verify the stable point on the potential energy surface there were no imaginary frequencies for the rcs and pcs and only one imaginary frequency for the tss at 298 15 k and 1 atm the irc was employed to verify the optimal reaction path from rc to pc in addition to explore the accurate energy the single point energy of all the optimal structures was calculated at m06 2x6 311 g 2df 2p and the solvent effect was investigated with a solvation model density smd continuum model in water solution marenich et al 2009 2 9 statistical analysis the mean and standard deviation values of the triplicates were calculated the growth of p subcapitata of different groups at each sampling time was compared by one way analysis of variance anova if the anova results were significant at p 0 05 tukey s multiple comparisons were applied as post hoc tests to determine where the differences occurred using spss 3 results and discussion 3 1 alkylphenanthrene degradation ability of microalgae three microalgae species p subcapitata s obliquus and c vulgaris were selected to test their alkylphenanthrene degradation ability five monomethylated phenanthrenes 1 mp 2 mp 3 mp 4 mp and 9 mp and one dimethylated phenanthrene 3 6 dmp were the target compounds the alkylphenanthrenes were removed in biotic and abiotic ways after 14 days of incubation six alkylphenanthrenes were slightly removed by abiotic loss in the control group the removal percentages were 14 8 8 9 17 1 24 2 24 2 and 23 2 for 1 mp 2 mp 3 mp 4 mp and 9 mp and 3 6 dmp respectively fig s1 the abiotic loss was mostly attributed to photooxidation bacosa et al 2015 the abiotic loss of 1 mp 2 mp and 3 mp were lower than that of 4 mp and 9 mp which is consistent with the research of baocosa et al 2015 but contrary to that of radovic et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 the percentages of the apah residual in the medium uptake in the cells and biodegradation were dependent on the microalgae species the amounts of apah residual in the medium and uptake in cells were highest in c vulgaris c vulgaris was the least effective species in degrading apahs and p subcapitata was the most effective species almost 100 of the apahs were biodegraded by p subcapitata whereas only 0 97 29 5 of the apahs were biodegraded by c vulgaris these results were similar to the degradation of pahs p subcapitata was the most effective species to degrade pyrene and fluoranthene and c vulgaris was the least effective species lei et al 2007 the microalgae s obliquus also degraded apahs 68 8 98 1 of the apahs were biodegraded after 14 days incubation the residual apahs in the system tended to adsorb on algal cells 39 0 68 8 of the apahs were uptake by algal cells in c vulgaris fig 1b different physico chemical properties of microalgae such as the cell wall composition enzymes involved and lipid content are important in the detoxification and degradation of apahs lei et al 2007 as toxicants to microalgae cells apahs stimulate the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps to establish a barrier with strong three dimensional networks that can adsorb apahs chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the amount of eps secreted by c vulgaris was abundant chen et al 2015 compounds of 4 mp and 9 mp were resistant to biodegradation by s obliquus but showed a relatively high biodegradation rate by c vulgaris fig 1c this suggests that the degradation of apahs is dependent on the microalgae species moreover we can found that these microalgae exhibit the ability to biodegrade apahs without further acclimation in any subculture of pahs apahs which has also been reported in previous published literatures lei et al 2007 subashchandrabose et al 2017 3 2 biodegradation of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp by p subcapitata p subcapitata is a typical microalga that degrades pahs and apahs thus it was selected for further study with1 mp and 3 6 dmp the growth of p subcapitata under the stress of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp is shown in fig 2 in the first 5 days the cell density of p subcapitata was significantly lower in the 1 mp group than that in control group p 0 05 however the density of p subcapitata in the 3 6 dmp group shows no significant difference from the control group p 0 05 after 7 days of incubation the growth of the three groups had no significant difference p 0 05 possibly because most of the apahs were removed from the system the toxicity of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp to p subcapitata was also tested the 96h ec50 of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp to p subcapitata were 0 173 and 0 241 mg l 1 respectively table s1 indicating that 1 mp was more toxic to microalgae than 3 6 dmp it was most likely due to the difference of their physical properties eg water solubility the water solubility of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp was 0 269 and 0 071 mg l 1 respectively may et al 1983 nlm 2019 the higher water solubility of 1 mp made the microalgae exposure to higher effective concentration as shown in fig 3 the concentration of 1 mp decreased rapidly during the incubation of p subcapitata the biodegradation percentage was nearly 100 after 5 days which demonstrated that 1 mp can be totally transferred with p subcapitata compared with 1 mp the structure of 3 6 dmp was more stable and the biodegradation percentage was 73 6 after 7 days the degradation of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp was fitted to the first order reaction r2 0 9574 for 1 mp r2 0 9166 for 3 6 dmp and the half lives t1 2 were calculated as 0 75 and 4 18 d respectively fig s2 the increased methyl group slowed down the biodegradation rate of apah by microalgae 3 3 identification of the metabolites of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp the metabolites of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp were separated and identified using gc ms the gc ms chromatogram and qualitative parameters of the metabolites are displayed in fig s3 and table 1 six compounds were found in the degradation of 1 mp peak 3 p3 at the retention time of 26 604 min was identified as 1 phenanthrenemethanol 1 p methanol by comparing the mass spectra and gc retention time with the authentic standard the other five metabolites were considered isomers because they had nearly identical mass spectra with ion fragments at m z 322 265 250 and 235 according to the authentic standard p2 and p4 were identified as 9 hydroxy 1 methylphenanthrene 9 oh 1 mp and 9 hydroxy 8 methylphenanthrene 9 oh 8 mp respectively the oh group was added to the benzene ring however the position of the oh group in peaks 1 5 and 6 could not be confirmed because of the lack of authentic standards they were tentatively identified as monohydroxymethylphenanthrene i ii and iii respectively the hydroxylated metabolites of 1 mp detected in the present work were similar to those reports for its parent compound phenanthrene for example the primary metabolite of phenanthrene with p subcapitata was monohydroxylated phenanthrene such as 4 9 3 1 2 oh phenanthrene chan et al 2006 ke et al 2010 the existence of methyl group in 1 mp changed the position of oh group in the metabolites all the metabolites were found in the medium and little was found in the algae cells it is suggested that an oh group was added when 1 mp entered the intracellular matrix to increase its polarity and then it was excreted to the extracellular matrix as soon as possible the concentrations of 1 p methanol 9 oh 1 mp and 9 oh 8 mp were analyzed and are shown in fig 4 a compound of 1 p methanol had the highest concentration and reached the highest accumulation first at day 3 suggesting that the ch3 site in 1 mp was the most vulnerable to be attacked by an oh group the metabolite of 9 oh 8 mp had the lowest concentration among the three metabolites the metabolite content first increased and then decreased during 7 days of incubation indicating that the monohydroxymethylphenanthrenes would be further degraded however no ring open product was found during the incubation the concentrations of monohydroxymethylphenanthrene i ii and iii were roughly quantitated according to the average calibration curve of 9 oh 1 mp and 9 oh 8 mp ke et al 2010 since they were isomers with similar retention times and ion fragments although the results are not very precise they are acceptable because the isomers of 9 oh 1 mp and 9 oh 8 mp had very similar calibration curves the concentrations of monohydroxymethylphenanthrene i ii and iii during 7 days of incubation is shown in fig s4 monohydroxymethylphenanthrene ii had the highest concentration at day 3 and then declined different from the other metabolites the content of monohydroxymethylphenanthrene i kept an increased trend during the 7 days of incubation indicating that this metabolite would be accumulated without degradation to evaluate the 1 mp degradation by microalgae the metabolites of 1 mp were converted into parent 1 mp according to the mass balance calculation and the result is shown in fig 4b monohydroxymethylphenanthrene i ii and iii were defined as unknown metabolites in fig 4b at the beginning of the third day nearly all the disappeared 1 mp was transformed into hydroxyl compounds and the recovery percentages were 92 3 95 6 indicating that almost all the metabolites of 1 mp were detected the benzene ring of 1 mp cannot be broken and the metabolites accumulated in medium in the early incubation period when the incubation time was extended to 5 days the recovery percentage declined at day 7 the parent 1 mp was 100 degraded fig 3 and only 42 0 of 1 mp remained as hydroxyl metabolites suggesting that the hydroxyl compounds can be further degraded only one metabolite of 3 6 dmp was detected at a retention time of 28 607 min fig s3b it had a molecular ion m at m z 336 and fragment ions at m z 279 m c ch3 3 and 205 m osi ch3 2c ch3 3 table 1 and fig 5 a it was confirmed as a monohydroxylated compound according to the fragment ions moreover the major fragment ions of m z 279 and 205 showed a mass shift 14 methyl substituted relative to 1 p methanol m z 265 191 this result suggests that the position of the oh group was on the methyl side the position c 3 is equal to c 6 hence the metabolite of 3 6 dmp was concluded as 3 methanol 6 methylphenanthrene the amount of it was represented with a peak area ratio of metabolite to surrogate standard phenanthrene d10 which increased during 7 days of incubation fig 5b similar to 1 mp the metabolite was mainly in the medium and only 7 82 17 4 was in the cell besides 3 methanol 6 methylphenanthrene no other metabolite was found in the incubation of 3 6 dmp with p subcapitata which was much different from 1 mp the degradation products of 1 mp and 3 6 dmp in the abiotic control were also determined however none of the biodegradation metabolites in biotic treatments were found in the abiotic control the compounds of phenanthrenequinone were determined as the main product of phenanthrene photodegradation kou et al 2009 hence quinones were concluded as the photodegradation products of methylphenanthrene but no quinone was found in abiotic control in this work when referred to the mass spectral library of nist which needed a further research in the future methylphenanthrenes were transformed by microalgae through the oxidation of alkyl groups and formed monohydroxylated metabolites for the initial research however the biodegradation of apahs by bacterium had many researches and two pathways have been summarized one was the biodegradation through dioxygenase which leads to the formation of dihydrodiols and subsequent ring cleavage and the other one was the oxidation of alkyls to form corresponding alcohols aldehyde and carboxylic acid dutta et al 1998 mahajan et al 1994 malmquist et al 2013 sabate et al 1999 zhong et al 2017 the pathway through dioxygenase was more important than the oxidation of alkyls in bacterium zhong et al 2017 for microalgae few studies have been devoted to the biodegradation of apahs the reported dihydrodiols and ring cleavage intermediates in bacterium were not found in the incubation of microalgae when apahs entered the microalgae cells they were transformed to hydroxylated apahs that are more water soluble than their parent compounds then the microalgae eliminated the hydrophilic compounds into the medium to reduce the toxic effect to the cells the degradation pathway is not well understood and needs more attention among six monohydroxylated metabolites of 1 mp p subcapitata preferred to produce benzylic alcohol derivatives 1 phenanthrenemethanol rather than ring hydroxylation products the only metabolite of 3 6 dmp we observed was a benzylic alcohol derivative 3 methanol 6 methylphenanthrene the same phenomenon was reported by dutta et al 1998 methyl monoxygenation may first form benzylic alcohol the difference in the hydroxyl sites resulted in the differences in their physicochemical properties fallahtafti et al 2012 tested the toxicity of four ring hydroxylation methylphenanthrenes and benzylic alcohol derivatives to japanese medaka the results show that the ring hydroxylation increased the apah toxicity the congenital avoidance of disadvantages of organisms may explain why more benzylic alcohol derivatives were formed 3 4 computational study of apah metabolites since authentic standards for apah metabolites are rare many metabolites cannot be determined and thus high accuracy molecular orbital calculations were carried out to determine the potential metabolites according to the potential degradation pathways based on the results of the laboratory experiments the dominant products were identified as apah phenol table 1 suggesting that the oh addition is the dominant reaction pathway the computational study of apahs with microalgae was primarily focused on the reaction of apahs with the oh group there are two steps in the reaction of apah with the oh group first the oh group attacks c atoms in benzene ring forming a reaction complex rc then different adduct isomers im are formed through the oh addition to the c atoms in the process of im a transition state ts is formed next the im further reacts via unimolecular decomposition to yield oh apahs through cleavage of the c h bond fig 6 the rate limiting step is step 1 since step 2 progresses rapidly the compound of 1 mp was selected as an example to display the reaction pathway for convenience of description the c atoms in 1 mp were numbered as presents in fig 6 the oh group can add to ch3 in the 1 mp molecule directly via unimolecular decomposition to yield 1 p methanol the reaction is more likely to occur due to skipping step 1 which was the rate limiting step comparison of the oh addition to the benzene ring with the methyl group shows that oh addition to the methyl group is energetically without a barrier the calculation results were well in agreement with the laboratory experimental data the amount of 1 p methanol was highest at the beginning of the third day fig 4 for the c atoms in the benzene ring nine different oh 1 mp isomers can readily form through oh addition to the c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8 c9 and c10 atoms since the ts of a chemical reaction is a particular configuration along the reaction coordinate it is defined as the state corresponding to the highest potential energy along this reaction coordinate the production of oh 1 mp was dependent on the gibbs reaction energy δg of the ts the ts is strongly endothermic by 5 96 8 69 kcal mol on nine c atom particularly the oh addition to the c9 atom has a lower barrier and the most energetically favorable relative to the addition to other c atoms this was supported by the result of the laboratory experiments 9 oh 1 mp showed the highest content among the detected metabolites fig 4 the δg of ts to form 9 oh 1 mp and 9 oh 8 mp equal to 10 oh 1 mp was higher than the other metabolites suggesting that the positions of c9 and c10 are more active than the other c positions the c9 and c10 positions are known as the k region of phenanthrene which is the oleinic aromatic double bond with high electron density three unknown metabolites named memonohydroxymethylphenanthrene i ii and iii were found table 1 with concentrations in the order of ii iii i at the beginning of the third days fig s3 according to the result of the dft calculation in fig 6 we can estimate that metabolites i ii and iii might be 2 oh 1 mp 4 oh 1 mp and 8 oh 1 mp respectively the reaction energy in c3 c6 and c7 in the benzene ring is higher than the other c atoms suggesting that these positions are a high energy barrier for oh addition the 3 6 dmp molecule has a c 2v symmetry c1 and c8 c2 and c7 c3 and c6 c4 and c5 and c9 and c10 are thus equivalent four different oh 3 6 dmp adduct isomers can be formed through the addition of oh to the c1 c2 c4 and c9 atoms the corresponding δg of ts range from 5 88 to 8 32 kcal mol at the m06 2x 6 311 g 2df 2p level table s2 the oh addition to the c9 atom has the lowest activation barrier except for the methyl position all the gibbs reaction energies were estimated at 298 k and 1 atm unless otherwise specified the reaction energy of oh addition to 2 mp 3 mp 4 mp and 9 mp at each c position was also calculated and is shown in tables s3 6 the oh addition to the c9 or c10 atoms is the most exothermic and the most energetically favorable relative to addition to other c atoms except for the methyl position which indicates that the k region of phenanthrene was reactive for substitution reaction the relatively low gibbs activation barriers and strong exothermicity imply that the formation of methyl phenanthrol can occur under ambient conditions quantum calculation is usually used in the chemical reaction system eg radical mediated degradation of pah dang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 the quantum chemical calculation was attempted to predict the biodegradation of apahs by microalgae in the present work the theoretical calculations of these metabolites were in well agreement with the experimental results obtained by gc ms this suggests that biological degradation by enzyme catalyzed reaction also complies with the principles of chemical reaction hence quantum chemical calculation would be a helpful tool to predict the reaction pathway of pollutants by biodegradation 4 conclusions this study discovers that the green microalgae p subcapitata c vulgaris and s obliquus had different degradation abilities for methylphenanthrenes among them p subcapitata were the most efficient species p subcapitata degraded methylphenanthrenes through monooxidation to form monohydroxlated compounds this study introduces the possibility of biodegradation of apahs by green microalgae for the first time offering important information for the bioremediation of apahs especially in crude oil contaminated environments quantum chemical calculation was conducted to elucidate the biodegradation metabolites of methylphenanthrene by green microalgae which is a helpful tool in the bioremediation of environmental pollution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18117,selective reduction of nitrate to n2 is attractive but still a difficult challenge in the water treatment field herein we established a flow through electrochemical system packed with polymeric beads supported nzvi nzvi d201 for selective nitrate reduction consequently efficient nitrate reduction in the flow mode was achieved on nzvi d201 under electrochemical regulation with n2 selectivity of up to 95 for at least 60 h otherwise nzvi was gradually exhausted after 20 h and the product was mainly the undesired nh4 through a series of comparative experiments we clarified that the enhanced nitrate reduction on nzvi under electrochemical regulation was mainly attributed to electrons from cathode and active hydrogen h rather than the previously speculated h2 combining the characterizations of nzvi during nitrate reduction by x ray diffraction and x ray photoelectron spectrometry we found that nitrate reduction under electrochemical regulation was mediated by nzvi along with the resultant fe0 fe x o y fe ii structure and was sustained by electrons from cathode and h via the in situ reduction of fe iii back to fe ii meanwhile the undesirable product nh4 was efficiently oxidized to n2 by the active chlorine generated on the anode this study not only clarifies the mechanism of enhanced nitrate reduction on nzvi via electrochemical regulation but also

reactivity to date most published studies have focused on using zvi as a reductant to remove nitrate consequently zvi is consumed with the progress of the reaction in addition ammonium has been found to be the main reduction product which is also an unfavorable pollutant recently sporadic studies teng et al 2018 have reported that nzvi has an excellent removal performance and n2 selectivity as a catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate suggesting an efficient and environmentally benign approach for nitrate decontamination from water the high n2 selectivity during the electrochemical reduction of nitrate is due to the oxidation of ammonium to n2 by hypochlorous acid hclo from the electrolysis of the coexisting chloride at the anode kim et al 2006 li et al 2009 mook et al 2012 however the roles of nzvi along with its corrosion products in the electrochemical reduction of nitrate whether as a cathode catalyst or reductant that can be regenerated by the h2 active hydrogen denoted as h produced at the cathode have hardly been addressed and remain unclear several studies li et al 2009 teng et al 2018 have proposed that the h2 generated from electrolysis not only provides the reducing agent for nitrate reduction but also protects nzvi from oxidation while rejuvenating fe ii to fe0 via the active hydrogen nevertheless the proposed mechanism still demands verification clarifying the actual role of nzvi in the electrochemical reduction of nitrate is conducive to the further development of fe based electrochemical decontamination technologies the main objective of this study is to investigate the performance and mechanism of nitrate reduction via electrochemical regulation on nzvi to utilize nzvi in flow through electrochemical systems a nanocomposite denoted as nzvi d201 was fabricated by immobilizing zvi nanoparticles inside a millimeter sized porous host and a columnar electrochemical reaction device was constructed as a model flow

ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm 2 2 preparation of nzvi d201 the nanocomposite nzvi d201 was prepared according to a previous study via ion exchange and chemical reduction jiang et al 2011 first 2 0 g of preprocessed d201 was added to a 200 ml solution containing 2 0 m fecl3 and 2 0 m hcl the resultant fecl4 anions serving as the precursor of nzvi were captured by d201 through preferable ion exchange

deoxygenated water and dried under vacuum for subsequent use as expected the loaded fecl4 ions were able to be reduced into zvi and the resultant composite presented as black spherical beads the whole process of preparing the nanocomposite nzvi d201 was performed under mild conditions for nitrate reduction all the composite materials were freshly prepared and vacuum sealed prior to use 2 3

diagram of the electrochemical reactor is shown in fig 1 the graphite hollow column 15 mm inner diameter and 240 mm in height and ru ir plated ti rod were used as the cathode and anode respectively the prepared nzvi d201 was used to fill the column which was in contact with the graphite column of the cathode and separated from the ru ir ti rod by wrapping the anode with a porous nonwoven cloth 200 mesh fixed bed experiments were carried out as shown in fig 1 and the synthetic solution in a down flow direction was pumped out by a peristaltic pump at the desired flow rate of 3 bed volumes bv h 1 with 2 6 ml 1 0 g of nzvi d201 a dc power supply with a voltage range of 0 20 v and a current range of 0 3 a was employed a kno3 solution 50 mg no3 n l was prepared for the electrolysis experiments unless otherwise stated different concentrations of nacl 0 020 1 00 m were introduced to the nitrate solutions as the electrolyte a high concentration of cl 1 0 m could completely inhibit no3 adsorption on d201 thus the removal of no3 by nzvi d201 can be solely attributed to its reduction by nzvi note the addition of excessive cl 1 0 m in this study is for simplicity to clarify the removal mechanism but is not required in practical applications 2 5 analytical methods the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were determined by ion chromatography dionex 1100 with an ionpac as19

adjusting the electrochemical reactor in four different ways fig 2 to differentiate the roles of the chemical reduction electric field h2 h and electrons from cathode for example the anode cathode was wrapped with a nonwoven material to insulate electrons and with a nonporous waterproof film to block both electrons and h2 h the detailed experimental design along with the effects is provided in table 1 active hydrogen h was monitored using electron paramagnetic resonance epr emx 10 12 bruker germany with dmpo as the spin trapping agent origins of the group names in fig 2 and table 1 are as follows chemical reduction normal chemical reduction experiment in the absence of electricity as the control group and no electrons from cathode or no generated h2 h were involved in the reaction e the graphite cathode was wrapped with nonporous waterproof films that block both electrons and h2 h from cathodes from nzvi d201 but the external electric field was maintained at nzvi d201 h 2 h e the graphite anode was wrapped with a porous nonwoven material that blocks electrons but allows the supply of h2 h from the cathode to penetrate the porous fabrics to nzvi d201 e h 2 h e nzvi d201 was in direct contact with the graphite cathode which could transfer electrons and supply h2 h from the cathode to nzvi d201 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of nzvi d201 the synthetic route for the preparation of nzvi d201 is shown in fig s1 the tem image fig 3 c shows that zvi nanoparticles with sizes of 10 30 nm were well dispersed in the inner surface of the porous polymeric hosts owing to the pore confinement effect of the host material d201 luis and sengupta 2005 as shown in the sem image fig 3b and d nzvi d201 was present as a spherical bead and the energy dispersive spectroscopy eds mapping of fe on the cross section of nzvi d201 fig 3e showed that the embedded zvi was uniformly distributed throughout the spherical bead consistent with our previous study jiang et al 2011 the xrd pattern of nzvi d201 fig 3f showed a wide peak at 44 9 indicating the presence of nanosized fe0 meanwhile no signals of fe oxides were observed possibly because of their small amount or poor crystallinity kyounghee et al 2006 interestingly no significant variation was observed in the xrd spectra of the nzvi d201 samples before and after air exposure for 15 days fig s2 demonstrating the stability of nzvi d201 during storage 3 2 electrochemically regulated nitrate reduction on nzvi d201 to assure reduction as the sole path for of nitrate removal by nzvi d201 under electrochemical regulation a high concentration of chloride 1 0 m was introduced in the electrolyte to completely inhibit the adsorption of nitrate fig s3 although nitrate could be reduced through chemical reduction by nzvi d201 without electrochemical assistance fig 4 a the embedded nzvi acting as a sacrificial reducing agent would be rapidly exhausted moreover 95 of nitrate was reduced to undesirable ammonia over the initial 20 h before the exhaustion of nzvi fig 4b the possible reaction pathway for nitrate reduction without electricity could described by eq 3 if nzvi acted only as a reductant it would be completely exhausted in approximately 22 4 h according to the stoichiometric calculation si which agreed well with the experimental data from the chemical reduction group fig 4a however under an applied voltage of 3 0 v nitrate removal reached 80 and then leveled off for at least 60 h more importantly the n2 selectivity of the above process was greater than 95 with applied voltage fig 4c hence compared with the chemical reduction electrochemical regulation not only increased nitrate removal during the reduction by nzvi d201 but also improved the selectivity for the desirable product n2 see the comprehensive comparison with some other materials in table s2 the high n2 selectivity of nitrate reduction under electrochemical assistance can be explained as follows the predominant product of nitrate produced by nzvi or by the electrons from cathode was ammonia however cl2 was generated on the anode during electrolysis in the presence of chloride eq 4 and immediately formed hypochlorite eq 5 which selectively oxidizes ammonia to n2 kim et al 2006 li et al 2009 mook et al 2012 teng et al 2018 3 cathode reaction no3 4fe0 10h nh4 4fe2 3h2o 4 anode reaction 2cl cl2 2e 5 cl2 h2o hclo cl h 6 nh4 3hclo n2 3h2o 5h 3cl although electrochemical regulation enhanced the reduction of nitrate by nzvi and the corresponding n2 selectivity the actual role of nzvi whether as a catalyst or reductant during the above process remained unclear it is critical to explore the mechanism in detail 3 3 mechanism of enhanced nitrate reduction under electrochemical regulation the enhanced nitrate reduction by nzvi d201 under electrochemical regulation might be mainly attributed to the electric field h2 h generated at the cathode and electrons from cathode to differentiate their contributions four sets of comparative experiments were carried out the evolution of c eff c in no3 n was quite similar in three parallel experiments of the chemical reduction group as well as the e h2 h e group fig s4 thus demonstrating the stability of system 3 3 1 role of electric field an electric field always exists between the anode and cathode in the presence of an applied voltage and nzvi d201 located between the anode and cathode was inevitably induced however a negligible difference in nitrate removal performance was observed between the chemical reduction and e groups fig 5 a indicating the ignorable role of the electric field in the enhanced nitrate reduction under electrochemical regulation the electric field intensity 3 0 v cm may have been too low to induce nzvi in this case 3 3 2 role of generated h2 h h2 could be produced at the cathode with 3 0 v of applied voltage previous studies li et al 2009 teng et al 2018 proposed that the generated h2 could act as an indirect reducing agent to regenerate the corrosion products of nzvi to fe0 or as a direct reductant for nitrate reduction catalyzed by nzvi to differentiate the above mechanisms the inner wall of the graphite column reactor was coated by a layer of nonwoven material to block direct electron transfer from the cathode to nzvi d201 while the porous nature of the nonwoven material still permitted the transfer of the generated h2 h to nzvi d201 consequently the performance of the h2 h e group in nitrate reduction was higher than that of the chemical reduction group but lower than that of the e h2 h e group which verified the corresponding contribution of the generated h2 h to the enhanced nitrate reduction under electrochemical regulation direct external h2 bubbling experiments were conducted to further differentiate the roles of h2 and h in the above nitrate reduction process the experiment group e h2 h was normally run for 15 h upon switching off the power source the effluent nitrate concentration sharply increased to the identical level of the chemical reduction group fig 5b in spite of external bubbling of h2 into the column in excess during the shutdown the removal of nitrate was insignificantly enhanced by contrast the effluent nitrate concentration sharply decreased upon switching on the power source and terminating the h2 supply at 45 h the above results demonstrated the negligible role of h2 in the enhanced performance under electrochemical regulation which also can be concluded from fig s5 note that our findings differed from a previous report teng et al 2018 in which h2 was speculated to act as a reducing agent to regenerate the corrosion products back to nzvi thus extending the nzvi usage lifespan and the reaction efficiency therefore h might play an important role in the enhanced performance the epr spectra showed obvious characteristic peaks of active hydrogen in both experimental groups of e h2 h e and h2 h e fig 6 indicating the in situ generation of h or permeation of the h produced at the cathode to the nzvi d201 side through the porous nonwovens by contrast h was not detected in the chemical reduction group or the e group briefly h played a significant role in electrochemical assistance which will be discussed in detail in the next section 3 3 3 role of electrons from cathode interestingly over the initial 20 h both experimental groups of e h2 h e and h2 h e exhibited a similar performance for nitrate removal possibly due to the excess nzvi as the chemical reductant without electrochemical assistance nevertheless the situation could not be sustained as shown by the decreased nitrate removal in the h2 h e group after 20 h fig 5a moreover the nzvi d201 beads used in the h2 h e experimental group obviously faded to brown or even pale implying the corrosion of nzvi whereas those in the e h2 h e experimental group remained as black as fresh nzvi d201 fig 7 b the above results suggested that electrons from cathode might stabilize the nzvi via electrochemical protection for sustainable nitrate reduction an additional control group was studied that was similar to the e h2 h e group except for the absence of nzvi d201 in the graphite column consequently negligible nitrate reduction occurred fig s6 thus neither electrons from cathode nor h could directly reduce nitrate in the absence of nzvi under the experimental conditions instead they assisted nzvi d201 during nitrate reduction however the question remains of how nzvi d201 or and its corrosion products reduced nitrate with the assistance of e and h 3 3 4 role of nzvi and its evolution the chemical states of fe and the corrosion products of nzvi during nitrate reduction were identified by xps and xrd respectively the fe 2p xps spectra of nzvi d201 from both the chemical reduction group and the e h2 h e group fig s7 exhibited two main peaks corresponding to fe ii and fe iii bhargava et al 2007 respectively in both groups the percentage of fe0 was negligible and fe ii was higher than the corresponding fe iii fig 7a and b which was understandable because of the limited probing depth of xps scanning actually xps analysis was able to probe the chemical states of fe on the surface where the electrocatalytic interconversion mainly occurred the higher fe iii percentage on the chemical reduction group than on the e h2 h e group indicated the formation of more ferric hydr oxide on the surface which agreed with the appearance of the crimson color of the used material fig 7a these ferric hydr oxides could block the reactive sites and inhibit electron transfer from the fe0 core to the interface for nitrate reduction which could partly explain the lower working capacity of the chemical reduction group for nitrate reduction the xrd patterns of the used nanocomposites from both groups mainly exhibited the crystalline signals of magnetite and residual fe0 note that amorphous corrosion products such as hydrated ferric oxide could not be detected by xrd nevertheless both magnetite and hydrated ferric oxide fe x o y could provide surface sites to bind fe ii tang et al 2014a as shown by the high content of fe ii in both groups specifically the percentage of surface fe ii 73 3 was higher on the e h2 h e group in comparison with the chemical reduction group 61 7 which could enhance nitrate reduction via two pathways first it has been well accepted that surface bound fe ii or structural fe ii is a stronger reducing agent than aqueous fe ii guan et al 2015a white and peterson 1996 meanwhile the generated fe ii could rejuvenate lepidocrocite γ feooh to magnetite fe3o4 with greatly improved conductivity thus facilitating electron transfer therefore in the e h2 h e group the electrons from cathode and h could sustain nitrate reduction by nzvi via reducing fe iii to fe ii on the surface and the electrochemically assisted redox interconversion of fe ii fe iii played a key role in nitrate reduction by nzvi under electrochemical regulation 3 3 5 overall mechanism briefly nitrate removal by nzvi d201 under electrochemical regulation was mediated by nzvi and the resultant fe0 fe x o y fe ii structure which has been proven to be highly reactive due to the presence of structural fe ii and the conductive magnetite layer guan et al 2015b noubactep 2015 tang et al 2014b xu et al 2012 electrochemical regulation played two indispensable roles in the enhanced nitrate reduction on one hand the above nitrate reducing reaction was sustained by the electrons from cathode and h via the in situ reduction of fe iii back to fe ii fig 8 which was demonstrated in our previous work gao et al 2015 on the other hand the undesirable product nh4 was efficiently oxidized to n2 by the active chlorine generated from the anode reaction eqs 4 6 li et al 2009 4 conclusions fixed bed experiments of nitrate reduction were carried out and nitrate removal efficiency was above 80 as well as the n2 selectivity up to 95 which demonstrated the enhanced durability and performance of nzvi d201 under electrochemical regulation moreover the roles of the electric field electrons from cathode h2 h and nzvi along with its evolution have been clarified and the mechanism of enhanced nitrate reduction via electrochemical regulation has been elucidated nitrate reducing reaction was mediated by nzvi along with the resultant fe0 fe x o y fe ii structure and sustained by the electrons from cathode and h via the in situ reduction of fe iii back to fe ii meanwhile the undesirable product nh4 was efficiently oxidized to n2 by the active chlorine generated from the anode reaction the proposed technique is promising in groundwater decontamination from nitrate greater than 10 mg l n even up to 100 mg l n and is believed to advance the synergistic technological coupling of nzvi reduction with electrochemistry more efforts are still required to promote the

experiments unless otherwise stated different concentrations of nacl 0 020 1 00 m were introduced to the nitrate solutions as the electrolyte a high concentration of cl 1 0 m could completely inhibit no3 adsorption on d201 thus the removal of no3 by nzvi d201 can be solely attributed to its reduction by nzvi note the addition of excessive cl 1 0 m in this study is for simplicity to clarify the removal mechanism but is not required in practical applications 2 5 analytical methods the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were determined by ion chromatography dionex 1100 with an ionpac as19

adjusting the electrochemical reactor in four different ways fig 2 to differentiate the roles of the chemical reduction electric field h2 h and electrons from cathode for example the anode cathode was wrapped with a nonwoven material to insulate electrons and with a nonporous waterproof film to block both electrons and h2 h the detailed experimental design along with the effects is provided in table 1 active hydrogen h was monitored using electron paramagnetic resonance epr emx 10 12 bruker germany with dmpo as the spin trapping agent origins of the group names in fig 2 and table 1 are as follows chemical reduction normal chemical reduction experiment in the absence of electricity as the control group and no electrons from cathode or no generated h2 h were involved in the reaction e the graphite cathode was wrapped with nonporous waterproof films that block both electrons and h2 h from cathodes from nzvi d201 but the external electric field was maintained at nzvi d201 h 2 h e the graphite anode was wrapped with a porous nonwoven material that blocks electrons but allows the supply of h2 h from the cathode to penetrate the porous fabrics to nzvi d201 e h 2 h e nzvi d201 was in direct contact with the graphite cathode which could transfer electrons and supply h2 h from the cathode to nzvi d201 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of nzvi d201 the synthetic route for the preparation of nzvi d201 is shown in fig s1 the tem image fig 3 c shows that zvi nanoparticles with sizes of 10 30 nm were well dispersed in the inner surface of the porous polymeric hosts owing to the pore confinement effect of the host material d201 luis and sengupta 2005 as shown in the sem image fig 3b and d nzvi d201 was present as a spherical bead and the energy dispersive spectroscopy eds mapping of fe on the cross section of nzvi d201 fig 3e showed that the embedded zvi was uniformly distributed throughout the spherical bead consistent with our previous study jiang et al 2011 the xrd pattern of nzvi d201 fig 3f showed a wide peak at 44 9 indicating the presence of nanosized fe0 meanwhile no signals of fe oxides were observed possibly because of their small amount or poor crystallinity kyounghee et al 2006 interestingly no significant variation was observed in the xrd spectra of the nzvi d201 samples before and after air exposure for 15 days fig s2 demonstrating the stability of nzvi d201 during storage 3 2 electrochemically regulated nitrate reduction on nzvi d201 to assure reduction as the sole path for of nitrate removal by nzvi d201 under electrochemical regulation a high concentration of chloride 1 0 m was introduced in the electrolyte to completely inhibit the adsorption of nitrate fig s3 although nitrate could be reduced through chemical reduction by nzvi d201 without electrochemical assistance fig 4 a the embedded nzvi acting as a sacrificial reducing agent would be rapidly exhausted moreover 95 of nitrate was reduced to undesirable ammonia over the initial 20 h before the exhaustion of nzvi fig 4b the possible reaction pathway for nitrate reduction without electricity could described by eq 3 if nzvi acted only as a reductant it would be completely exhausted in approximately 22 4 h according to the stoichiometric calculation si which agreed well with the experimental data from the chemical reduction group fig 4a however under an applied voltage of 3 0 v nitrate removal reached 80 and then leveled off for at least 60 h more importantly the n2 selectivity of the above process was greater than 95 with applied voltage fig 4c hence compared with the chemical reduction electrochemical regulation not only increased nitrate removal during the reduction by nzvi d201 but also improved the selectivity for the desirable product n2 see the comprehensive comparison with some other materials in table s2 the high n2 selectivity of nitrate reduction under electrochemical assistance can be explained as follows the predominant product of nitrate produced by nzvi or by the electrons from cathode was ammonia however cl2 was generated on the anode during electrolysis in the presence of chloride eq 4 and immediately formed hypochlorite eq 5 which selectively oxidizes ammonia to n2 kim et al 2006 li et al 2009 mook et al 2012 teng et al 2018 3 cathode reaction no3 4fe0 10h nh4 4fe2 3h2o 4 anode reaction 2cl cl2 2e 5 cl2 h2o hclo cl h 6 nh4 3hclo n2 3h2o 5h 3cl although electrochemical regulation enhanced the reduction of nitrate by nzvi and the corresponding n2 selectivity the actual role of nzvi whether as a catalyst or reductant during the above process remained unclear it is critical to explore the mechanism in detail 3 3 mechanism of enhanced nitrate reduction under electrochemical regulation the enhanced nitrate reduction by nzvi d201 under electrochemical regulation might be mainly attributed to the electric field h2 h generated at the cathode and electrons from cathode to differentiate their contributions four sets of comparative experiments were carried out the evolution of c eff c in no3 n was quite similar in three parallel experiments of the chemical reduction group as well as the e h2 h e group fig s4 thus demonstrating the stability of system 3 3 1 role of electric field an electric field always exists between the anode and cathode in the presence of an applied voltage and nzvi d201 located between the anode and cathode was inevitably induced however a negligible difference in nitrate removal performance was observed between the chemical reduction and e groups fig 5 a indicating the ignorable role of the electric field in the enhanced nitrate reduction under electrochemical regulation the electric field intensity 3 0 v cm may have been too low to induce nzvi in this case 3 3 2 role of generated h2 h h2 could be produced at the cathode with 3 0 v of applied voltage previous studies li et al 2009 teng et al 2018 proposed that the generated h2 could act as an indirect reducing agent to regenerate the corrosion products of nzvi to fe0 or as a direct reductant for nitrate reduction catalyzed by nzvi to differentiate the above mechanisms the inner wall of the graphite column reactor was coated by a layer of nonwoven material to block direct electron transfer from the cathode to nzvi d201 while the porous nature of the nonwoven material still permitted the transfer of the generated h2 h to nzvi d201 consequently the performance of the h2 h e group in nitrate reduction was higher than that of the chemical reduction group but lower than that of the e h2 h e group which verified the corresponding contribution of the generated h2 h to the enhanced nitrate reduction under electrochemical regulation direct external h2 bubbling experiments were conducted to further differentiate the roles of h2 and h in the above nitrate reduction process the experiment group e h2 h was normally run for 15 h upon switching off the power source the effluent nitrate concentration sharply increased to the identical level of the chemical reduction group fig 5b in spite of external bubbling of h2 into the column in excess during the shutdown the removal of nitrate was insignificantly enhanced by contrast the effluent nitrate concentration sharply decreased upon switching on the power source and terminating the h2 supply at 45 h the above results demonstrated the negligible role of h2 in the enhanced performance under electrochemical regulation which also can be concluded from fig s5 note that our findings differed from a previous report teng et al 2018 in which h2 was speculated to act as a reducing agent to regenerate the corrosion products back to nzvi thus extending the nzvi usage lifespan and the reaction efficiency therefore h might play an important role in the enhanced performance the epr spectra showed obvious characteristic peaks of active hydrogen in both experimental groups of e h2 h e and h2 h e fig 6 indicating the in situ generation of h or permeation of the h produced at the cathode to the nzvi d201 side through the porous nonwovens by contrast h was not detected in the chemical reduction group or the e group briefly h played a significant role in electrochemical assistance which will be discussed in detail in the next section 3 3 3 role of electrons from cathode interestingly over the initial 20 h both experimental groups of e h2 h e and h2 h e exhibited a similar performance for nitrate removal possibly due to the excess nzvi as the chemical reductant without electrochemical assistance nevertheless the situation could not be sustained as shown by the decreased nitrate removal in the h2 h e group after 20 h fig 5a moreover the nzvi d201 beads used in the h2 h e experimental group obviously faded to brown or even pale implying the corrosion of nzvi whereas those in the e h2 h e experimental group remained as black as fresh nzvi d201 fig 7 b the above results suggested that electrons from cathode might stabilize the nzvi via electrochemical protection for sustainable nitrate reduction an additional control group was studied that was similar to the e h2 h e group except for the absence of nzvi d201 in the graphite column consequently negligible nitrate reduction occurred fig s6 thus neither electrons from cathode nor h could directly reduce nitrate in the absence of nzvi under the experimental conditions instead they assisted nzvi d201 during nitrate reduction however the question remains of how nzvi d201 or and its corrosion products reduced nitrate with the assistance of e and h 3 3 4 role of nzvi and its evolution the chemical states of fe and the corrosion products of nzvi during nitrate reduction were identified by xps and xrd respectively the fe 2p xps spectra of nzvi d201 from both the chemical reduction group and the e h2 h e group fig s7 exhibited two main peaks corresponding to fe ii and fe iii bhargava et al 2007 respectively in both groups the percentage of fe0 was negligible and fe ii was higher than the corresponding fe iii fig 7a and b which was understandable because of the limited probing depth of xps scanning actually xps analysis was able to probe the chemical states of fe on the surface where the electrocatalytic interconversion mainly occurred the higher fe iii percentage on the chemical reduction group than on the e h2 h e group indicated the formation of more ferric hydr oxide on the surface which agreed with the appearance of the crimson color of the used material fig 7a these ferric hydr oxides could block the reactive sites and inhibit electron transfer from the fe0 core to the interface for nitrate reduction which could partly explain the lower working capacity of the chemical reduction group for nitrate reduction the xrd patterns of the used nanocomposites from both groups mainly exhibited the crystalline signals of magnetite and residual fe0 note that amorphous corrosion products such as hydrated ferric oxide could not be detected by xrd nevertheless both magnetite and hydrated ferric oxide fe x o y could provide surface sites to bind fe ii tang et al 2014a as shown by the high content of fe ii in both groups specifically the percentage of surface fe ii 73 3 was higher on the e h2 h e group in comparison with the chemical reduction group 61 7 which could enhance nitrate reduction via two pathways first it has been well accepted that surface bound fe ii or structural fe ii is a stronger reducing agent than aqueous fe ii guan et al 2015a white and peterson 1996 meanwhile the generated fe ii could rejuvenate lepidocrocite γ feooh to magnetite fe3o4 with greatly improved conductivity thus facilitating electron transfer therefore in the e h2 h e group the electrons from cathode and h could sustain nitrate reduction by nzvi via reducing fe iii to fe ii on the surface and the electrochemically assisted redox interconversion of fe ii fe iii played a key role in nitrate reduction by nzvi under electrochemical regulation 3 3 5 overall mechanism briefly nitrate removal by nzvi d201 under electrochemical regulation was mediated by nzvi and the resultant fe0 fe x o y fe ii structure which has been proven to be highly reactive due to the presence of structural fe ii and the conductive magnetite layer guan et al 2015b noubactep 2015 tang et al 2014b xu et al 2012 electrochemical regulation played two indispensable roles in the enhanced nitrate reduction on one hand the above nitrate reducing reaction was sustained by the electrons from cathode and h via the in situ reduction of fe iii back to fe ii fig 8 which was demonstrated in our previous work gao et al 2015 on the other hand the undesirable product nh4 was efficiently oxidized to n2 by the active chlorine generated from the anode reaction eqs 4 6 li et al 2009 4 conclusions fixed bed experiments of nitrate reduction were carried out and nitrate removal efficiency was above 80 as well as the n2 selectivity up to 95 which demonstrated the enhanced durability and performance of nzvi d201 under electrochemical regulation moreover the roles of the electric field electrons from cathode h2 h and nzvi along with its evolution have been clarified and the mechanism of enhanced nitrate reduction via electrochemical regulation has been elucidated nitrate reducing reaction was mediated by nzvi along with the resultant fe0 fe x o y fe ii structure and sustained by the electrons from cathode and h via the in situ reduction of fe iii back to fe ii meanwhile the undesirable product nh4 was efficiently oxidized to n2 by the active chlorine generated from the anode reaction the proposed technique is promising in groundwater decontamination from nitrate greater than 10 mg l n even up to 100 mg l n and is believed to advance the synergistic technological coupling of nzvi reduction with electrochemistry more efforts are still required to promote the

18118,though the ozone activated carbon process has been widely applied for drinking water purification little is known about how ozone modified natural organic matter nom competes with micropollutants in activated carbon adsorption in this study three natural waters and one synthetic water standard humics solution with highly heterogeneous nom compositions were employed to investigate the interference of ozonated nom with the adsorption of 2 methylisoborneol mib analysis using liquid chromatography with online carbon and uv254 detection lc ocd uvd revealed that ozonation led to various disintegration patterns of macromolecules in nom and uv absorbance was reduced markedly for nearly all nom fractions powdered activated carbon pac adsorption experiments showed that increasing ozone consumption coincided with reducing nom competition against mib in the three natural waters as expressed by the fitted initial concentrations of the equivalent background compound c0 ebc in the synthetic water in contrast competition increased under low moderate specific ozone consumptions and then decreased with further elevation of ozone consumptions regarding the significance on affecting ozonated nom interference aromaticity reduction outweighed formation of low molecular weight lmw organics in most cases enhancing mib adsorption capacity however disintegration of the humics fraction with larger molecular weight 1 103 g mol as compared to 546 697 g mol in three natural waters into smaller more competitive fractions caused the observed initial deteriorated mib adsorption in synthetic water a superior correlation between c0 ebc and the uv absorbance of lmw organics r2 0 93 over concentrations of lmw organics underlined the importance of the aromatic properties in competitive adsorption projection for ozone pretreated natural waters furthermore the change of relative concentration of uv absorbing compounds during ozonation could help estimate the decrease of c0 ebc which could be a promising tool for waterworks to adjust pac doses for mib removal in ozonated waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated carbon ozonation

from the breakage of larger nom constituents may act in the other direction newcombe et al 2002b it was revealed that ozonation of wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent positively alleviates the nom interference with micropollutants due to concomitantly decreasing aromaticity hydrophobicity zietzschmann et al 2015 however the origins and compositions of nom in surface waters are much different from those in wwtp gonsior et al 2011 nam and amy 2008 which would exert an influence on the oxidation and adsorption behaviors of nom and thus the competition with mib to describe the competitive adsorption the concentrations of lmw organic carbon lmwoc and uv absorbance of lmw organics lmwuv which could be measured by liquid chromatography with online oc and ultraviolet absorbance detection lc ocd uvd have been suggested as two important parameters zietzschmann et al 2016b on the other hand the equivalent background compound model ebcm najm et al 1991 has been used to project required pac doses or gac breakthrough curves for mib removal in surface waters by indicating the competing nom fraction of the targeted compound crittenden et al 2012 matsui et al 2012 relatively good correlation was mentioned between lmwoc lmwuv and ebc matsui et al 2012 however it is not clear if the two parameters could still be valid to describe the competing nom in ozonated waters therefore the present study aims at elucidating the effects of ozonation on the interference behaviors of nom to the mib adsorption on activated carbon and projecting the corresponding adsorption interference with mib three natural surface waters with diverse doc specific ultraviolet absorbance suva molecular weight distribution and one synthetic water prepared with high molecular weight humics solution were employed to represent largely heterogenous nom lc ocd uvd and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms were applied to characterize nom fractions and the ebcm was used to estimate the initial concentrations of competing nom the results of this study will be helpful for waterworks to deal with highly varying characteristics and concentrations of

examined waters the concentrations of ozone in inflow gas and exhaust gas were determined by iodimetry the specific ozone consumption was calculated by the difference of the inflow and exhaust ozone

allocates aromatic lmw humic acids as a part of lmw acids to the humics fraction however considering the impact on micropollutant adsorption lmw humic acids were assigned into lmw acids here and the expression of lmw humics and acids was adopted for both lmwoc and lmwuv integration the local minimum between the building blocks and the lmw humics and acids was used as left integration limit as

fitted to the experimental data for all batch tested waters the ebcm allocates all observed adsorption competition against a micropollutant here mib in a real water to one competing component the ebc which is characterized by freundlich isotherm parameters kf ebc 1 nebc and an initial concentration c0 ebc to increase comparability between the ebcm fitting results for different waters global kf ebc and 1 nebc were used for all waters so that c0 ebc was the only fitting parameter and could therefore be easily correlated to water quality parameters zietzschmann et al 2016a for each pac dose our algorithm searches for the best suiting q mib and q ebc using the two criteria of the ebc equations eqs 3 and 4 calculates the corresponding c mib and c ebc and determines the corresponding error for

discussion 3 1 raw water characterization the ph doc concentrations uv254 suva and m n of the examined waters are shown in table 1 in ascending suva their doc concentrations ranged from 1 39 mg l in the sy water to 5 29 mg l in mps water the suva values ranged from 2 16 to 6 26 l mg m the suva of anthropogenically influenced waters jz and sy was lower than the humic rich waters mps and sha m n ranged from 546 to 697 g mol in natural waters and 1 103 g mol in synthetic sha water the highest aromaticity and m n of sha was due to its resin isolation during which most neutral and hydrophilic fractions with lower suva were discarded thurman and malcolm 1981 for fluorescence pattern both mps and sha waters had typical humic like peaks while jz and sy waters shared similar protein rich peaks fluorescence characterization in fig s1 but their fluorescence intensities were considerably different the lc ocd chromatograms of the tested waters are shown in fig 1 also presenting chromatograms normalized by maximum intensity of each sample for easier comparison on varying doc concentrations nom could be divided into fractions including biopolymers 20000 g mol 13 min retention time humics

waters contained the largest proportion of lmw compounds including lmw humics and acids and lmw neutrals the mw of their humics fractions was comparatively small as indicated by longer retention time 21 min the corresponding uvd chromatograms were similar to the ocd chromatograms the highest measured value in sy water was lmw humics and acids suggesting higher aromaticity of lmw nom altmann et al 2016 the mps water contained a low percentage of biopolymers but a larger proportion of humics with a comparatively big m n 697 g mol indicating relatively low anthropogenic influence in the upstream regions wang et al 2013 huber et al 2011 the highest percentage of aromatic humics fraction was observed in sha water the m n and suva of sha were the highest among all examined aquatic nom according to investigation of huber huber et al 2011 which could help examining the behavior of aromatic macromolecules 1000 g mol in ozonation with little impact by lmw fractions in the current study 3 2 impacts of ozonation on nom fractions the ocd chromatograms of the examined waters within a specific ozone consumption range from 0 to 2 84 mg o3 mg doc are shown in fig 2 fractionized quantitative results in fig s4 ozonation led to disintegration of the macromolecules biopolymers and humics with increasing peaks of lower molecular weight fractions von sonntag and von gunten 2012 zietzschmann et al 2015 but it is interesting to find the different variation patterns of nom fractions displayed in different waters sha water experienced the most obvious reduction of humics and increase in building blocks and lmw humics and acids with only slight changes of these fractions in jz and sy waters the greater increase in building blocks in sha water may be related to the larger size of the humics precursors as shown a considerable reduction in the m n of the humics in sha water from 1103 g mol in raw water to 601 g mol under an ozone consumption of 2 84 mg o3 mg doc table s3 by contrast m n values only varied within narrower ranges in ozonated natural waters table s3 an apparent reduction of humics was also observed in mps water but the accumulation of lmw fractions did not occur possibly attributed to the strong mineralization as indicated by the conspicuous decrease of doc during ozonation fig 2c the uvd diagrams of the ozonated waters exhibited overall reduction of uv absorbance for most of the fractions fig s3 although the doc reduction differs significantly in four examined waters the decrease pattern of chromophores in organic matter indicated by uv is more similar only a mild increase in building blocks peak 22 min was observed in sha ozonated water caused by the strong shift of the humics peak this was also supported by the declining absorbance in the fractionized quantitative results fig s5a at the same time the aromaticity of all fractions was reduced by ozonation in the natural waters fig s5 independent of the size of fractions though the formation of new lmw unsaturated aromatic compounds was often observed in previous studies phungsai et al 2019 these and reemtsma 2005 ozonation would lead to the overall decrease for medium and low mw fractions van der helm et al 2009 only slight increments were observed in terms of uv absorbance of lmw humics and acids during ozonation of sha water cf fig s5a this could not be observed in ozonated natural waters or wastewaters without such a large proportion of aromatic humics cf fig 1 van der helm et al 2009 zietzschmann et al 2015 3 3 interference of ozonated nom with mib adsorption mib adsorption experiments were conducted in the four examined waters pre ozonated under a specific ozone consumption range between 0 and 2 84 mg o3 mg doc see isotherms in fig s2 in comparison with the batch in organic free water 25 95 of mib adsorption capacity was lost for all the nom containing samples as shown in fig 3 the mib adsorption capacity in jz raw water was the lowest followed by mps sy and sha waters accordingly the highest value of c0 ebc 1858 nmol l cf fig 4 in jz raw water was discovered and c0 ebc was in reverse order with mib adsorption capacity it is interesting that the c0 ebc of jz raw water was over a magnitude larger than that of sha raw water c0 ebc 132 nmol l though they had similar doc in this respect nom interference was not reflected by conventional bulk organic parameters like doc and bulk uv254 underlining the limitation of using these global parameters in explaining the nom interference on adsorption newcombe et al 2002b zietzschmann et al 2014 for sha water the extremely low c0 ebc indicated the adsorption sites occupied by the sha might be different from those by mib it was reported that the large humics are normally adsorbed on the surface of activated carbon ando et al 2010 while mib is reported to be mainly associated with the micropores yu et al 2007 also the ionizable character induced by resin isolation procedures elution at low ph the neutrals and bases fractions discarded might have accounted for the reported lower adsorption and interference at neutral ph hu et al 2014 matsui et al 2012 mccreary and snoeyink 1980 the stronger competitive effects in jz and mps were likely related to relatively high lmwoc lmwuv cf figs 1 and 3 regarding the ozonation impacts it was found that decreasing nom competition against mib adsorption in general occurred with increasing ozone consumption for sy mps and jz waters except for an insignificant increase in sy at the highest ozone consumption similar with a previous study with wastewater zietzschmann et al 2015 in contrast an increase in adsorption competition occurred at low moderate specific ozone consumptions 0 77 mg o3 mg doc in sha water while the competition declined at higher specific ozone consumptions this is the first time to find a different interference behavior of sha water under mild ozonation which might be associated with the enhanced pore accessibility due to the breakage of large humics fig 4 illustrates the variation of pac loading with nom fractionsand the corresponding c0 ebc from ebcm fitting at specific carbon dose 16 5 2 5 mg pac mg doc cf table s2 under different ozone consumptions compared with untreated samples the nom loading after ozonation experienced notable drops 20 55 at similar specific ozone consumptions of 2 mg o3 mg doc for the three surface waters by contrast the c0 ebc declined more significantly 64 68 on the other hand the reduction in nom loading was higher for smaller organics than for the humics building blocks fractions despite the increase of lmwoc concentrations suggesting the important effect of the decreased affinity of lmw nom the suspected competing nom towards activated carbon due to the destruction of aromaticity by ozonation in short the nom loading on pac only partly reflected the competitiveness of the corresponding nom zietzschmann et al 2014 in contrast to the natural waters the humic rich sha water exhibited a quite different adsorption and interference behavior and it is a valuable instance for elucidating counteracting ozonation impacts on humics fraction in adsorption interference the descending aromaticity and also declining m n table s3 in general the nom loading and c0 ebc shared the same variation trend during ozonation under mild ozonation 0 77 mg o3 mg doc the enhanced loading of humics fraction induced by higher pore accessibility from m n reduction was the main positive contributor to the elevated nom loading fig 4 more pores might be occupied or blocked by smaller aromatic humics and therefore mib adsorption was restricted this could not be easily avoided using pac like sae super with abundant secondary micropores and narrow mesopores data in table s4 and fig s6 as these pores are susceptible to the adsorption or blockage of aromatic humics with lower molecular weight in line with previous studies li et al 2003 for higher ozone consumptions 1 34 2 84 mg o3 mg doc aromaticity reduction was dominant and nom adsorbability decreased just like the ozonation in three natural waters hence scavenging the organic chromophores both in macromolecules and small molecules is the distinct advantage of ozonation to restrict the formation of competing nom in both synthetic and natural waters and the increment of competing nom should also be concerned where mw of humics fraction is high in source waters 3 4 lmwuv as the key indicator for competitive adsorption the c0 ebc for mib are plotted versus lmwoc concentrations and lmwuv absorbance in fig 5 no overall relation between c0 ebc and lmwoc concentrations occurred in all examined samples fig 5a instead the lmwuv exhibited a good relation with c0 ebc in natural waters fig 5b r2 0 93 sha excluded this appears to contrast with previous studies where lmwoc was also suggested to explain c0 ebc in manifold waters drinking waters surface waters wastewater treatment plant effluents matsui et al 2012 zietzschmann 2016 however these studies did not induce nom changes by pre treatment like ozonation but used only the original natural waters the results of the current study demonstrated that lmw aromatic organics should be the key nom fraction reflecting the competitiveness of natural water nom compounds against mib the superiority of lmwuv over lmwoc is that it not only incorporates the concentration of suspected competing nom but more importantly also the character aromaticity adsorbability the correlation in fig 5b thus helps to project c0 ebc or more generally prospective adsorption competition for mib in both natural waters and ozonated waters with a wide range of specific consumptions 0 2 mg o3 mg doc and simplifies the determination of required pac doses from a mechanistic point of view the counteracting effects of competing nom concentration and nom aromaticity are quite difficult to quantify clearly complicating a comprehensive evaluation of ozonation effects on nom mib competition in previous studies resin fractionation of nom has been reported to explain the competitive effect lerman et al 2013 hydrophobic acids and neutrals were found to be primary competitors while the hydrophilic fraction showed little competition however each resin isolation may contain nom fractions with different size and strongly variable uv absorbances distributed over the range of lc ocd chromatograms bolto et al 1999 kennedy et al 2005 similar wide distributions were also observed after ultrafiltration nanofiltration fractionization newcombe et al 2002a zietzschmann et al 2014 therefore tracing the changing lmwuv with lc ocd uvd can have better performance to describe the competing nom and give overall estimations for c0 ebc in figs s7 and s8 further results on lmw organics characterization in jz water by fticr ms reveals that both ozonation and adsorption had preferential performance in reducing the relative abundance of compounds with low o c value or low h c value covering the area reported correlating with uv absorbance facilitating our lmwuv projection lavonen et al 2015 the high similarity of ozonation and adsorption in removal components in the lmw organics also helps confirming the alleviation effect of ozonation on subsequent mib adsorption in nom containing waters from a practical point of view estimating nom adsorption competition variations against mib through monitoring lmwuv via lc ocd is still difficult for most waterworks in our study the reduction of lmwuv and online measurable bulk uv were similar during ozonation of individual natural waters cf fig s5 making bulk uv a potentially feasible practical parameter for inferring lmwuv variations the degradation of c0 ebc c0 ebc in ozonated water c0 ebc in raw water for mib is depicted over the change of bulk uv absorbance uv254 in ozonated water uv254 in raw water in fig 6 showing a well established relation between these two parameters similar r2 as when using lmwuv cf fig 5b in practical application the change of c0 ebc after ozonation can be well indicated by bulk uv accompanied with only one batch test for evaluation of the initial competition behavior in unozonated water these two estimation methods from both mechanistic and practical perspectives may provide more scientific grounds for reported application to use bulk uv serving as a simple and robust parameter for micropollutants removal altmann et al 2016 ziska et al 2016 4 conclusions variable ozonation of three natural waters and an ihss standard humics solution suwannee river humic acids sha resulted in highly heterogeneous nom with strong variability of the corresponding competitive adsorption against mib onto pac ozone induced accumulation of lmw organics were strongly impacted by the molecular weight of humics and doc mineralization on the other hand nom uv absorbance clearly decreased for nearly all fractions with increasing ozone consumptions nom adsorption competitiveness against mib decreased with increasing ozonation intensity in natural waters by contrast sha nom ozonation caused increased nom adsorption and competition against mib unexpectedly for low moderate ozone consumptions likely due to increased pore accessibility or blockage by humics with lower molecular weight for higher ozone consumptions this effect was outweighed by the competition alleviating uv absorbance reduction and nom adsorbability and competitiveness decline in sha water in this respect sha nom behaved differently than nom from the three natural waters c0 ebc of the ebcm correlated well with lmwuv synthetic water excluded underlining the predictability of adsorption competition against mib in ozonated natural waters and the relevance of incorporating lmw properties into estimating approaches as opposed to only using lmwoc further characterization with fticr ms showed that lmw organics with similar molecular properties low o c value or low h c value covering the area related with uv were preferentially removed both in ozonation and adsorption waterworks could use bulk uv to infer c0 ebc and thus optimize the required pac doses since lmwuv quantification via

18118,though the ozone activated carbon process has been widely applied for drinking water purification little is known about how ozone modified natural organic matter nom competes with micropollutants in activated carbon adsorption in this study three natural waters and one synthetic water standard humics solution with highly heterogeneous nom compositions were employed to investigate the interference of ozonated nom with the adsorption of 2 methylisoborneol mib analysis using liquid chromatography with online carbon and uv254 detection lc ocd uvd revealed that ozonation led to various disintegration patterns of macromolecules in nom and uv absorbance was reduced markedly for nearly all nom fractions powdered activated carbon pac adsorption experiments showed that increasing ozone consumption coincided with reducing nom competition against mib in the three natural waters as expressed by the fitted initial concentrations of the equivalent background compound c0 ebc in the synthetic water in contrast competition increased under low moderate specific ozone consumptions and then decreased with further elevation of ozone consumptions regarding the significance on affecting ozonated nom interference aromaticity reduction outweighed formation of low molecular weight lmw organics in most cases enhancing mib adsorption capacity however disintegration of the humics fraction with larger molecular weight 1 103 g mol as compared to 546 697 g mol in three natural waters into smaller more competitive fractions caused the observed initial deteriorated mib adsorption in synthetic water a superior correlation between c0 ebc and the uv absorbance of lmw organics r2 0 93 over concentrations of lmw organics underlined the importance of the aromatic properties in competitive adsorption projection for ozone pretreated natural waters furthermore the change of relative concentration of uv absorbing compounds during ozonation could help estimate the decrease of c0 ebc which could be a promising tool for waterworks to adjust pac doses for mib removal in ozonated waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated carbon ozonation competitive adsorption natural organic matter mib 1 introduction 2 methylisoborneol mib odorous at a concentration as low as 10 ng l matsui et al 2014 occurs in up to 50 of lake reservoir waters in

biological activated carbon bac combinations are often the methods of choice guo et al 2016 newcombe et al 2002b however adsorption interference by coexisting natural organic matter nom results in high pac doses or short service times for carbon filters summers et al 2013 the interference mechanisms are direct competition for internal adsorption sites and pore blockage with macromolecules li et al 2003 direct competition is the dominant factor for low molecular weight lmw nom molecules with aromatic nom inducing stronger competitive effects hu et al 2014 zietzschmann et al 2014 in o3 bac treatment ozonation prior to adsorption may affect nom characteristics e g by hydrophilizing hydrophobic compounds breakage of larger nom constituents or decreasing the aromatic content of the nom lamsal et al 2011 song et al 2010 the reduction in aromaticity and hydrophobicity of organics will reduce the competitive adsorption by nom lerman et al 2013 while the formation of small molecules from the breakage of larger nom constituents may act in the other direction newcombe et al 2002b it was revealed that ozonation of wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent positively alleviates the nom interference with micropollutants due to concomitantly decreasing aromaticity hydrophobicity zietzschmann et al 2015 however the origins and compositions of nom in surface waters are much different from those in wwtp gonsior et al 2011 nam and amy 2008 which would exert an influence on the oxidation and adsorption behaviors of nom and thus the competition with mib to describe the competitive adsorption the concentrations of lmw organic carbon lmwoc and uv absorbance of lmw organics lmwuv which could be measured by liquid chromatography with online oc and ultraviolet absorbance detection lc ocd uvd have been suggested as two important parameters zietzschmann et al 2016b on the other hand the equivalent background compound model ebcm najm et al 1991 has been used to project required pac doses or gac breakthrough curves for mib removal in surface waters by indicating the competing nom fraction of the targeted compound crittenden et al 2012 matsui et al 2012 relatively good correlation was mentioned between lmwoc lmwuv and ebc matsui et al 2012 however it is not clear if the two parameters could still be valid to describe the competing nom in ozonated waters therefore the present study aims at elucidating the effects of ozonation on the interference behaviors of nom to the mib adsorption on activated carbon and projecting the corresponding adsorption interference with mib three natural surface waters with diverse doc specific ultraviolet absorbance suva molecular weight distribution and one synthetic water prepared with high molecular weight humics solution were employed to represent largely heterogenous nom lc ocd uvd and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms were applied to characterize nom fractions and the ebcm was used to estimate the initial concentrations of competing nom the results of this study will be helpful for waterworks to deal with highly varying characteristics and concentrations of competing nom in ozonation adsorption stages 2 materials and methods 2 1 natural waters and synthetic water three raw waters were sampled in october 2018 from mopanshan reservoir mps in harbin jinze reservoir jz in shanghai and shiyan reservoir sy in shenzhen china at the sampling time no odor problems were identified in the reservoirs and the concentrations of mib were lower than 10 ng l in addition synthetic water was prepared by dissolving suwannee river humic acids sha from ihss in ultrapure water sha is an isolation product from suwannee river in south georgia usa impacted by peat deposits and decomposing vegetation averett et al 1994 the solution was stored in dark for 72 h to allow the humic solution to expand fully inorganic ions were amended to imitate the ionic background of natural waters for the sha water and organic free water table s1 to exclude the impacts of suspended solids on subsequent treatment process all raw waters were filtered by a 0 45 μm membrane 142 mm supor 450 pall co the corresponding water parameters are listed in table 1 2 2 ozonation procedures and pac batch tests filtered waters were ozonated with a bench scale ozonation setup equipped with an ozone generator os 1n mitsubishi electric co japan with o2 fed directly from an oxygen generator fy3 beijing north star yaao china ozone was bubbled into 2 l of the stirred filtrate in a glass jar with ozone production rate ranging from 130 to 200 mg h of ozone producer same for ozonation of each water the contact time of ozonation varied within 3 40 min according to the target dosage in four examined waters the concentrations of ozone in inflow gas and exhaust gas were determined by iodimetry the specific ozone consumption was calculated by the difference of the inflow and exhaust ozone by the water volume divided by the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc of the respective ozonated water samples mib was spiked in ozonated waters to comparable concentrations of 500 ng l using mib stock solutions at 10 mg l the stock solutions were prepared by diluting the as bought stock solution 10 g l sigma aldrich with ultrapure water pac batch tests were then conducted with the raw and ozonated waters pac sae super norit netherlands was washed dried and cooled in a desiccator suspended in ultrapure water at 4 g l and stored over night for full wetting more information about the carbon properties are explained in table s4 and fig s6 different volumes of stirred stock suspension were pipetted to 100 ml batches of the mib spiked waters pac dose range from 0 to 100 mg l details in table s2 which were put on a shaker under 160 rpm for 48 h whereupon the batches were filtered through 0 45 μm polyether sulfone membrane filters 2 3 analytical methods the mib

using an automated device combi pal gc multi function autosampler ctc analytics switzerland 2 isopropyl 3 methoxypyrazine supelco usa was added to each sample as an internal standard 80 ng l and the calibration range of mib was from 8 to 640 ng l bulk uv254 was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan doc was determined using a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan three dimensional fluorescence spectrum analysis was conducted by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan nom fractions of raw waters ozonated waters and corresponding ones after adsorption

and fractionized quantitative results were obtained using automated integration with manually adjusted time frames for each fraction in the chromcalc software doc labor huber chromcalc automatically allocates aromatic lmw humic acids as a part of lmw acids to the humics fraction however considering the impact on micropollutant adsorption lmw humic acids were assigned into lmw acids here and the expression of lmw humics and acids was adopted for both lmwoc and lmwuv integration the local minimum between the building blocks and the lmw humics and acids was used as left integration limit as right integration limit the baseline at the end of the chromatogram was used indicated in fig 1 zietzschmann et al 2016b the number averaged mw m n of humic substances fraction was calculated automatically in chromcalc by the number of molecules n and molar mass m eq 1 the mw was calibrated with humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa standards from ihss eq 2 accordingly retention time tr min and matching coefficients a and b from calibration with ihss ha and fa was utilized huber et al 2011 1 m n i n i m i i n i 2 m w exp t r a b the molecular characterization for lmw organics was performed

information 2 4 modeling for competing nom analysis the ebc model ebcm najm et al 1991 based on the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast as a fictive two component competitive adsorption model was fitted to the experimental data for all batch tested waters the ebcm allocates all observed adsorption competition against a micropollutant here mib in a real water to one competing component the ebc which is characterized by freundlich isotherm parameters kf ebc 1 nebc and an initial concentration c0 ebc to increase comparability between the ebcm fitting results for different waters global kf ebc and 1 nebc were used for all waters so that c0 ebc was the only fitting parameter and could therefore be easily correlated to water quality parameters zietzschmann et al 2016a for each pac dose our algorithm searches for the best suiting q mib and q ebc using the two criteria of the ebc equations eqs 3 and 4 calculates the corresponding c mib and c ebc and determines the corresponding error for each j in the minimization equation eq 5 the algorithm finds the lowest value of min i e the best suiting set of ebc parameters by trying various parameter combinations global kf ebc and 1 nebc were calculated by averaging over the water individual parameters using the global parameters we fitted a second time while only varying c0 ebc 3 c 0 m i b d q m i b q m i b q m i b q e b c n m i b q m i b

discussion 3 1 raw water characterization the ph doc concentrations uv254 suva and m n of the examined waters are shown in table 1 in ascending suva their doc concentrations ranged from 1 39 mg l in the sy water to 5 29 mg l in mps water the suva values ranged from 2 16 to 6 26 l mg m the suva of anthropogenically influenced waters jz and sy was lower than the humic rich waters mps and sha m n ranged from 546 to 697 g mol in natural waters and 1 103 g mol in synthetic sha water the highest aromaticity and m n of sha was due to its resin isolation during which most neutral and hydrophilic fractions with lower suva were discarded thurman and malcolm 1981 for fluorescence pattern both mps and sha waters had typical humic like peaks while jz and sy waters shared similar protein rich peaks fluorescence characterization in fig s1 but their fluorescence intensities were considerably different the lc ocd chromatograms of the tested waters are shown in fig 1 also presenting chromatograms normalized by maximum intensity of each sample for easier comparison on varying doc concentrations nom could be divided into fractions including biopolymers 20000 g mol 13 min retention time humics 1000 g mol 17 22 min building blocks sub units of humics 300 500 g mol 23 min lmw humics and acids 350 g mol 27 min lmw neutrals 350 g mol 29 min huber et al 2011 within the examined waters sy and jz waters contained the largest proportion of lmw compounds including lmw humics and acids and lmw neutrals the mw of their humics fractions was comparatively small as indicated by longer retention time 21 min the corresponding uvd chromatograms were similar to the ocd chromatograms the highest measured value in sy water was lmw humics and acids suggesting higher aromaticity of lmw nom altmann et al 2016 the mps water contained a low percentage of biopolymers but a larger proportion of humics with a comparatively big m n 697 g mol indicating relatively low anthropogenic influence in the upstream regions wang et al 2013 huber et al 2011 the highest percentage of aromatic humics fraction was observed in sha water the m n and suva of sha were the highest among all examined aquatic nom according to investigation of huber huber et al 2011 which could help examining the behavior of aromatic macromolecules 1000 g mol in ozonation with little impact by lmw fractions in the current study 3 2 impacts of ozonation on nom fractions the ocd chromatograms of the examined waters within a specific ozone consumption range from 0 to 2 84 mg o3 mg doc are shown in fig 2 fractionized quantitative results in fig s4 ozonation led to disintegration of the macromolecules biopolymers and humics with increasing peaks of lower molecular weight fractions von sonntag and von gunten 2012 zietzschmann et al 2015 but it is interesting to find the different variation patterns of nom fractions displayed in different waters sha water experienced the most obvious reduction of humics and increase in building blocks and lmw humics and acids with only slight changes of these fractions in jz and sy waters the greater increase in building blocks in sha water may be related to the larger size of the humics precursors as shown a considerable reduction in the m n of the humics in sha water from 1103 g mol in raw water to 601 g mol under an ozone consumption of 2 84 mg o3 mg doc table s3 by contrast m n values only varied within narrower ranges in ozonated natural waters table s3 an apparent reduction of humics was also observed in mps water but the accumulation of lmw fractions did not occur possibly attributed to the strong mineralization as indicated by the conspicuous decrease of doc during ozonation fig 2c the uvd diagrams of the ozonated waters exhibited overall reduction of uv absorbance for most of the fractions fig s3 although the doc reduction differs significantly in four examined waters the decrease pattern of chromophores in organic matter indicated by uv is more similar only a mild increase in building blocks peak 22 min was observed in sha ozonated water caused by the strong shift of the humics peak this was also supported by the declining absorbance in the fractionized quantitative results fig s5a at the same time the aromaticity of all fractions was reduced by ozonation in the natural waters fig s5 independent of the size of fractions though the formation of new lmw unsaturated aromatic compounds was often observed in previous studies phungsai et al 2019 these and reemtsma 2005 ozonation would lead to the overall decrease for medium and low mw fractions van der helm et al 2009 only slight increments were observed in terms of uv absorbance of lmw humics and acids during ozonation of sha water cf fig s5a this could not be observed in ozonated natural waters or wastewaters without such a large proportion of aromatic humics cf fig 1 van der helm et al 2009 zietzschmann et al 2015 3 3 interference of ozonated nom with mib adsorption mib adsorption experiments were conducted in the four examined waters pre ozonated under a specific ozone consumption range between 0 and 2 84 mg o3 mg doc see isotherms in fig s2 in comparison with the batch in organic free water 25 95 of mib adsorption capacity was lost for all the nom containing samples as shown in fig 3 the mib adsorption capacity in jz raw water was the lowest followed by mps sy and sha waters accordingly the highest value of c0 ebc 1858 nmol l cf fig 4 in jz raw water was discovered and c0 ebc was in reverse order with mib adsorption capacity it is interesting that the c0 ebc of jz raw water was over a magnitude larger than that of sha raw water c0 ebc 132 nmol l though they had similar doc in this respect nom interference was not reflected by conventional bulk organic parameters like doc and bulk uv254 underlining the limitation of using these global parameters in explaining the nom interference on adsorption newcombe et al 2002b zietzschmann et al 2014 for sha water the extremely low c0 ebc indicated the adsorption sites occupied by the sha might be different from those by mib it was reported that the large humics are normally adsorbed on the surface of activated carbon ando et al 2010 while mib is reported to be mainly associated with the micropores yu et al 2007 also the ionizable character induced by resin isolation procedures elution at low ph the neutrals and bases fractions discarded might have accounted for the reported lower adsorption and interference at neutral ph hu et al 2014 matsui et al 2012 mccreary and snoeyink 1980 the stronger competitive effects in jz and mps were likely related to relatively high lmwoc lmwuv cf figs 1 and 3 regarding the ozonation impacts it was found that decreasing nom competition against mib adsorption in general occurred with increasing ozone consumption for sy mps and jz waters except for an insignificant increase in sy at the highest ozone consumption similar with a previous study with wastewater zietzschmann et al 2015 in contrast an increase in adsorption competition occurred at low moderate specific ozone consumptions 0 77 mg o3 mg doc in sha water while the competition declined at higher specific ozone consumptions this is the first time to find a different interference behavior of sha water under mild ozonation which might be associated with the enhanced pore accessibility due to the breakage of large humics fig 4 illustrates the variation of pac loading with nom fractionsand the corresponding c0 ebc from ebcm fitting at specific carbon dose 16 5 2 5 mg pac mg doc cf table s2 under different ozone consumptions compared with untreated samples the nom loading after ozonation experienced notable drops 20 55 at similar specific ozone consumptions of 2 mg o3 mg doc for the three surface waters by contrast the c0 ebc declined more significantly 64 68 on the other hand the reduction in nom loading was higher for smaller organics than for the humics building blocks fractions despite the increase of lmwoc concentrations suggesting the important effect of the decreased affinity of lmw nom the suspected competing nom towards activated carbon due to the destruction of aromaticity by ozonation in short the nom loading on pac only partly reflected the competitiveness of the corresponding nom zietzschmann et al 2014 in contrast to the natural waters the humic rich sha water exhibited a quite different adsorption and interference behavior and it is a valuable instance for elucidating counteracting ozonation impacts on humics fraction in adsorption interference the descending aromaticity and also declining m n table s3 in general the nom loading and c0 ebc shared the same variation trend during ozonation under mild ozonation 0 77 mg o3 mg doc the enhanced loading of humics fraction induced by higher pore accessibility from m n reduction was the main positive contributor to the elevated nom loading fig 4 more pores might be occupied or blocked by smaller aromatic humics and therefore mib adsorption was restricted this could not be easily avoided using pac like sae super with abundant secondary micropores and narrow mesopores data in table s4 and fig s6 as these pores are susceptible to the adsorption or blockage of aromatic humics with lower molecular weight in line with previous studies li et al 2003 for higher ozone consumptions 1 34 2 84 mg o3 mg doc aromaticity reduction was dominant and nom adsorbability decreased just like the ozonation in three natural waters hence scavenging the organic chromophores both in macromolecules and small molecules is the distinct advantage of ozonation to restrict the formation of competing nom in both synthetic and natural waters and the increment of competing nom should also be concerned where mw of humics fraction is high in source waters 3 4 lmwuv as the key indicator for competitive adsorption the c0 ebc for mib are plotted versus lmwoc concentrations and lmwuv absorbance in fig 5 no overall relation between c0 ebc and lmwoc concentrations occurred in all examined samples fig 5a instead the lmwuv exhibited a good relation with c0 ebc in natural waters fig 5b r2 0 93 sha excluded this appears to contrast with previous studies where lmwoc was also suggested to explain c0 ebc in manifold waters drinking waters surface waters wastewater treatment plant effluents matsui et al 2012 zietzschmann 2016 however these studies did not induce nom changes by pre treatment like ozonation but used only the original natural waters the results of the current study demonstrated that lmw aromatic organics should be the key nom fraction reflecting the competitiveness of natural water nom compounds against mib the superiority of lmwuv over lmwoc is that it not only incorporates the concentration of suspected competing nom but more importantly also the character aromaticity adsorbability the correlation in fig 5b thus helps to project c0 ebc or more generally prospective adsorption competition for mib in both natural waters and ozonated waters with a wide range of specific consumptions 0 2 mg o3 mg doc and simplifies the determination of required pac doses from a mechanistic point of view the counteracting effects of competing nom concentration and nom aromaticity are quite difficult to quantify clearly complicating a comprehensive evaluation of ozonation effects on nom mib competition in previous studies resin fractionation of nom has been reported to explain the competitive effect lerman et al 2013 hydrophobic acids and neutrals were found to be primary competitors while the hydrophilic fraction showed little competition however each resin isolation may contain nom fractions with different size and strongly variable uv absorbances distributed over the range of lc ocd chromatograms bolto et al 1999 kennedy et al 2005 similar wide distributions were also observed after ultrafiltration nanofiltration fractionization newcombe et al 2002a zietzschmann et al 2014 therefore tracing the changing lmwuv with lc ocd uvd can have better performance to describe the competing nom and give overall estimations for c0 ebc in figs s7 and s8 further results on lmw organics characterization in jz water by fticr ms reveals that both ozonation and adsorption had preferential performance in reducing the relative abundance of compounds with low o c value or low h c value covering the area reported correlating with uv absorbance facilitating our lmwuv projection lavonen et al 2015 the high similarity of ozonation and adsorption in removal components in the lmw organics also helps confirming the alleviation effect of ozonation on subsequent mib adsorption in nom containing waters from a practical point of view estimating nom adsorption competition variations against mib through monitoring lmwuv via lc ocd is still difficult for most waterworks in our study the reduction of lmwuv and online measurable bulk uv were similar during ozonation of individual natural waters cf fig s5 making bulk uv a potentially feasible practical parameter for inferring lmwuv variations the degradation of c0 ebc c0 ebc in ozonated water c0 ebc in raw water for mib is depicted over the change of bulk uv absorbance uv254 in ozonated water uv254 in raw water in fig 6 showing a well established relation between these two parameters similar r2 as when using lmwuv cf fig 5b in practical application the change of c0 ebc after ozonation can be well indicated by bulk uv accompanied with only one batch test for evaluation of the initial competition behavior in unozonated water these two estimation methods from both mechanistic and practical perspectives may provide more scientific grounds for reported application to use bulk uv serving as a simple and robust parameter for micropollutants removal altmann et al 2016 ziska et al 2016 4 conclusions variable ozonation of three natural waters and an ihss standard humics solution suwannee river humic acids sha resulted in highly heterogeneous nom with strong variability of the corresponding competitive adsorption against mib onto pac ozone induced accumulation of lmw organics were strongly impacted by the molecular weight of humics and doc mineralization on the other hand nom uv absorbance clearly decreased for nearly all fractions with increasing ozone consumptions nom adsorption competitiveness against mib decreased with increasing ozonation intensity in natural waters by contrast sha nom ozonation caused increased nom adsorption and competition against mib unexpectedly for low moderate ozone consumptions likely due to increased pore accessibility or blockage by humics with lower molecular weight for higher ozone consumptions this effect was outweighed by the competition alleviating uv absorbance reduction and nom adsorbability and competitiveness decline in sha water in this respect sha nom behaved differently than nom from the three natural waters c0 ebc of the ebcm correlated well with lmwuv synthetic water excluded underlining the predictability of adsorption competition against mib in ozonated natural waters and the relevance of incorporating lmw properties into estimating approaches as opposed to only using lmwoc further characterization with fticr ms showed that lmw organics with similar molecular properties low o c value or low h c value covering the area related with uv were preferentially removed both in ozonation and adsorption waterworks could use bulk uv to infer c0 ebc and thus optimize the required pac doses since lmwuv quantification via

18119,wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been identified as one of the reservoirs of antibiotics although nitrifying bacteria have been reported to be capable of degrading various antibiotics there are very few studies investigating long term effects of antibiotics on kinetic and microbial responses of nitrifying bacteria in this study cephalexin cfx and sulfadiazine sdz were selected to assess chronic impacts on nitrifying sludge with stepwise increasing concentrations in two independent bioreactors the results showed that cfx and sdz at an initial concentration of 100 μg l could be efficiently removed by enriched nitrifying sludge as evidenced by removal efficiencies of more than 88 and 85 respectively ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob made a major contribution to the biodegradation of cfx and sdz via cometabolism compared to limited contributions from heterotrophic bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria chronic exposure to cfx 30 μg l could stimulate ammonium oxidation activity in terms of a significant enhancement of ammonium oxidation rate p 0 01 in contrast the ammonium oxidation activity was inhibited due to exposure to 30 μg l sdz p 0 01 then it recovered after long term adaption under exposure to 50 and 100 μg l sdz in addition 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed that the relative abundance of aob decreased distinctly from 23 8 to 28 8 in the control phase without cfx or sdz to 14 2 and 10 8 under exposure to 100 μg l cfx and sdz respectively however the expression level of amoa gene was up regulated to overcome this adverse impact and maintain a stable and efficient removal of both ammonium and antibiotics the findings in this study shed a light on chronic effects of antibiotic exposure on kinetic and microbial responses of enriched nitrifying sludge in wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob cometabolism antibiotic biodegradation nitrification amoa mrna 1 introduction the massive

contaminated by various antibiotics awad et al 2014 barnes et al 2008 gao et al 2015 jechalke et al 2014 kolpin et al 2002 liang et al 2013 due to their bioactive property antibiotics can induce bio toxic effect to diverse non target organisms which is harmful to the ecosystem as a whole baguer et al 2000 gonzález pleiter et al 2013 robinson et al 2005 for example developmental malformations were observed in embryo larval zebrafish after exposure to β diketone antibiotics wang et al 2014 flaherty and dodson 2005 also reported significant changes in daphnia sex ratio after exposure to a mixture of three to five antibiotics total concentration 30 500 μg l more importantly the intensive use of antibiotics facilitates the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms even pathogenic bacteria which has been recognized as a global challenge for public health andersson and hughes 2014 guo et al 2017 wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been identified as reservoirs of antibiotics due to a range of diverse sources e g domestic operation hospitals industrial production the presence of antibiotics in wastewater could pose detrimental effects on operational performance of wwtps by impairing activity of functional microorganisms and or driving changes in microbial community structure grenni et al 2018 for example amorim et al 2014 showed that activities of both denitrifiers and phosphate accumulating organisms paos in a granular sludge sequencing batch reactor sbr were negatively affected after exposure to fluoroquinolones 9 μm yi et al 2017 also reported the suppression of phosphorus uptake and denitrification processes by ciprofloxacin exposure 0 2 and 2 mg l as an important process in biological nitrogen removal in wwtps nitrification consists of two steps including ammonium oxidation mediated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidation driven by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob different from denitrifiers and paos aob have been demonstrated to be able to degrade various micropollutants including antibiotics batt et al 2006 fernandez fontaina et al 2012 kassotaki et al 2016 for instance an aob strain nitrosomonas

in addition men et al 2016 and zhou et al 2019 confirmed that both ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa nitrososphaera gargensiss and the complete ammonia oxidizer comammox nitrospira inopinata could also biotransform certain micropollutants e g mianserin ranitidine and sulfamethazine the cometabolism of micropollutants can be attributed to a non specific key enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo which has a wide range of substrates along with ammonium oxidation process helbling et al 2012 sun et al 2012 tran et al 2013 on the other hand negative effects of antibiotics on nitrification were also documented for example lincomycin 0 5 10 6 mg l ofloxacin 2 10 mg l and sulfamethoxazole 2 10 mg l were all observed with significant inhibition on nitrification activity carucci et al 2006 dokianakis et al 2004 however most of these previous studies investigating the degradation of micropollutants by nitrifying cultures and or the effect of micropollutants on nitrifying cultures drew conclusions based on short term batch tests batt et al 2006 dawas massalha et al 2014 li et al 2015 men et al 2016 yu et al 2018 and the concentrations applied were much higher than environmentally relevant levels carucci et al 2006 dokianakis et al 2004 katipoglu yazan et al 2015 2016 yi et al 2017 which were usually at ng l and μg l levels baran et al 2011 chang et al 2010 dutta et al 2014 li and zhang 2011 mamo et al 2018 michael et al 2013 considering nitrifying bacterial communities might be shifted or adapted after long term exposure cultivation the chronic effect of antibiotics at environmentally relevant levels on nitrifying bacteria could be different from these studies based on short term batch tests or under exposure to higher concentrations of antibiotics usually mg l levels so far few studies have documented the long term effect of antibiotic exposure at environmentally relevant levels on the activity of the nitrifying bacteria and the community shift of the nitrifying sludge which is of more relevance for full scale wwtps due to continuous feeding of antibiotics in influent cephalexin cfx and sulfadiazine sdz have been widely used as broad spectrum antibiotics cfx is a β lactam antibiotic within the class of cephalosporins which is frequently used to treat certain bacterial infections including those of the middle ear bone and joint skin and urinary tract in australia cfx was the sixth most frequently prescribed antimicrobials in 2017 in united states it was the fourth most frequently prescribed outpatient antibiotic in 2016 after administration up to 90 of cfx will be excreted unchanged in urine within 6 h thornhill et al 1969 sdz belongs to sulphonamides and is widely used for the treatment of meningitis toxoplasmosis and infection of the upper respiratory tract up to 80 of administered sdz could be recovered in the urine either as parent compound or acetyl conjugate woolley et al 1980 cfx and sdz have often been detected in the influent of wwtps with concentrations up to 30 μg l gao et al 2012 leung et al 2012 lin et al 2010 mohapatra et al 2016 watkinson et al 2009 wu et al 2016 this study aimed to experimentally assess the long term impacts of cfx and sdz at environmentally relevant levels on the nitrification performance and microbial community structure of enriched nitrifying sludge can long term antibiotic exposure cause a significant shift in nitrifying sludge community can enriched nitrifying sludge achieve an enhanced antibiotic removal rate after long term adaption that warrants practical applications to this end cfx and sdz were selected and continuously fed into two independent sbrs with enriched nitrifying sludge respectively we highly investigated i the profiles of cfx and sdz removal by the nitrification process ii the shift of nitrifying sludge community based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and iii the expression of amoa gene in aob under long term exposure to cfx and sdz the findings obtained in this study could provide new insights into the understanding of the long term effects of antibiotic exposure on nitrifying bacteria which would be of significance for the stable and efficient operation of wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation two lab scale sbrs with a working volume of 8 l were used in this study both reactors were 70 cm in height and 16 cm in internal diameter the activated sludge collected from a local wwtp brisbane australia was used as the inoculum synthetic wastewater with 1000 mg l nh4 n was fed into the reactors for the enrichment of nitrifying bacteria the schematic diagram of the reactors and the detailed composition of the feeding solution can be found in fig s1 and tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary information si the reactors were operated in a 6 h cycle including 5 consecutive phases aerobic feeding 260 min aerobic reaction 30 min wasting 1 min settling 60 min and decanting 9 min in aerobic feeding stage 2 l synthetic wastewater was continuously pumped into the reactors the hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt in both reactors were maintained at 24 h and 15 d respectively a programmable logic controller plc was used to control the concentration of dissolved oxygen do and ph level in the reactors do was maintained in the range of 2 5 3 0 mg l and ph was kept at 7 5 7 8 by dosing 1 m nahco3 for the growth and enrichment of nitrifying bacteria before dosing antibiotics both reactors had reached full nitrification and kept stable for at least 3 months to investigate the long term impacts of cfx and sdz on nitrifying bacteria cfx and sdz were dosed individually into the feeding solution of each reactor cfx for sbr 1 and sdz for sbr 2 the entire reactor operation consisted of five phases in terms of antibiotic dosage levels which is outlined in table 1 2 2 sampling strategy and analysis methods 2 2 1 mlvss nitrogen species and antibiotics the concentration of mixed liquid volatile suspended solid mlvss in both reactors was measured weekly according to the standard method apha 2017 the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate in influent and effluent were analyzed twice a week for each reactor using the lachat quikchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee the determination of ammonium oxidation rate aor and nitrite oxidation rate nor in the two reactors are described in si the concentrations of cfx and sdz in influent and effluent were also measured twice a week after collection 1 5 ml samples were filtered into 2 ml verex amber vials phenomenex australia pty ltd with 0 22 μm syringe filters merck millipore ltd and then stored in a 20 c freezer the analysis was conducted with an ultra fast liquid chromatography shimadzu japan coupled with a 4000 qtrap hybrid triple quadruple linear ion trap mass spectrometer uflc ms ms the injection volume was 20 μl both cfx and sdz were analyzed in esi positive ion mode the detailed gradient elution procedure is shown in si 2 2 2 microbial community analysis the shifts of microbial community structure in both reactors under long term exposure to cfx and sdz were investigated by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing sludge samples of 3 ml were taken at the end of each phase except for phase 5 in which two samples were taken in the middle and end of the phase and centrifuged at 13000 g for 2 min the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were stored at 20 c dna extraction from the pellets was carried out using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa following the manufacturer s instructions the primer set 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 was used to amplify the 16s rrna gene purified amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform illumina usa the 16s rrna gene sequencing and data processing were conducted as described previously luo et al 2018 2 2 3 quantification of amoa gene by qpcr and amoa mrna by rt qpcr in order to reveal the expression level of amoa gene sludge samples of 3 ml were also collected from the reactor on a weekly basis the samples were centrifuged at 13000 g for 2 min the supernatant was discarded the pellets were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen before storing in a 80 c freezer for further rna and dna extraction total rna extraction was performed using qiagen rneasy mini kit catalogue number 74104 after the extraction dnase treatment was applied to eliminate the possible contamination of dna purified rna was then reversely transcribed to cdna using primer set amoa 1f 5 ggg gtt tct act ggt ggt 3 and amoa 2r 5 ccc ctc kgs aaa gcc ttc ttc 3 rotthauwe et al 1997 the amplification of cdna was conducted on an applied biosystems viia 7 real time pcr system the qpcr condition was as follows 2 min at 94 c and 30 cycles of 94 c for 30 s 52 c for 30 s 72 c for 1 min and a final extension at 72 c for 15 min the detailed procedure of the rt qpcr is given in si in order to qualify the abundance of amoa gene in the samples extracted dna was directly used for qpcr analysis which followed the same procedure and condition as cdna in rt qpcr analysis both qpcr and rt qpcr were conducted in biological triplicates 2 3 in situ batch tests in order to confirm aob s cometabolic ability to degrade antibiotics and determine whether nob and heterotrophic bacteria play important roles in the removal of cfx and sdz a series of in situ batch tests were conducted in both reactors after the entire long term experiment table 2 the aim of test 1 was to investigate the degradation of cfx sdz by nitrifying bacteria with the presence of ammonium the initial concentration of ammonium and cfx sdz were 100 mg n l and 100 μg l respectively samples of 5 ml were taken from the reactors every 30 min for the analysis of nitrogen species and cfx sdz until ammonium was completely consumed test 2 was conducted to test if nob could make contribution on antibiotic biodegradation by feeding cfx sdz and nitrite but without ammonium in order to avoid the activity of aob the initial concentrations of nitrite and cfx sdz were 100 mg n l and 100 μg l respectively samples of 5 ml were taken from the reactors every 15 min until nitrite was completely consumed in test 3 only cfx or sdz was individually added into each reactor to assess the contribution of heterotrophic bacteria samples of 5 ml were taken from the reactors every 60 min for 3 h after each test the sludge in the reactors was washed with phosphate buffered saline three times to remove residual cfx sdz the concentration of mlvss in each reactor was also measured before conducting each test each batch test was performed in biological triplicate 3 results 3 1 nitrification performance of the sbrs in order to evaluate nitrification performance under the long term exposure to cfx and sdz both sbrs with enriched nitrifying sludge were operated for more than 250 days to treat synthetic wastewater containing cfx or sdz with different concentrations the control phase phase 1 without antibiotic addition was conducted to collect the background information of the two reactors then cfx and sdz were then dosed individually into the feeding solution of each reactor with stepwise increasing concentrations during phases 2 5 3 1 1 complete nitrification under chronic cfx and sdz exposure the nitrification performance of both reactors throughout the experiment was monitored with the profiles of ammonium nitrite and nitrate in effluent despite the dosage of cfx and sdz from phase 2 to phase 5 ammonium and nitrite were not detected in effluent of both reactors fig 1 while nitrate was the main product 939 33 and 959 46 mg l in sbr 1 and sbr 2 respectively the nitrogen mass balance between influent and effluent showed that there was neglectable loss of nitrogen 2 6 and 0 4 in sbr 1 and sbr 2 respectively from phase 2 to phase 5 indicating complete nitrification capability in both reactors in terms of ammonium oxidation efficiency complete nitrification could still be achieved even under exposure to the highest concentration of cfx or sdz i e 100 μg l 3 1 2 cfx and sdz exhibited different effects on aor and nor the profiles of aor and nor in both reactors were monitored throughout the experiment in sbr 1 aor and nor did not change significantly under exposure to 10 μg l cfx p 0 05 fig 2 a when cfx concentration increased to 30 μg l both aor and nor increased significantly by 31 p 0 01 and 9 p 0 05 respectively fig 2a however when cfx concentration further increased to 100 μg l in phase 5 aor in sbr 1 decreased 8 compared with that exposed to 30 μg l cfx in phase 3 which was still significantly higher 21 p 0 01 than that in phase 1 fig 2a in addition when exposed to 100 μg l cfx a 17 decrease in nor was observed compared with phase 1 fig 2a these results suggest that chronic exposure to cfx up to 100 μg l led to a certain extent of stimulatory effect on aob activity while nob activity would be inhibited at higher cfx concentration 100 μg l in sbr 2 exposure to 10 μg l sdz in phase 2 did not affect the apparent activity of aob and nob in terms of aor and nor fig 2b after increasing sdz concentration to 30 μg l in phase 3 aob activity decreased by 22 compared with phase 1 fig 2b however when sdz concentration increased to 50 μg l in phase 4 no significant difference in aor was observed between phase 4 and phase 1 p 0 05 fig 2b indicating the recovery of aob activity in phase 5 aor remained at the similar level as in phase 1 despite the further increase of sdz concentration 100 μg l nob activity on the other hand was not significantly affected by sdz exposure from phase 2 to phase 5 compared with phase 1 p 0 05 fig 2b 3 2 removal profiles of cfx and sdz 3 2 1 efficient removal of cfx and sdz by enriched nitrifying sludge while the presence of cfx and sdz in influent did not affect the apparent nitrification efficiency of enriched nitrifying sludge in both reactors both cfx and sdz were removed to a high degree within the experimental period fig 3 from phase 2 to phase 4 the removal efficiencies of cfx and sdz were 95 and 93 in average respectively with average concentrations of 1 9 and 2 3 μg l in effluent in phase 5 the removal efficiency of cfx underwent fluctuations in the first 50 days and then became relatively stable thereafter fig 3a the removal efficiency of sdz on the other hand decreased slightly to 80 in the first 30 days of phase 5 and then gradually increased to around 90 fig 3b the average removal efficiencies for cfx and sdz in phase 5 were 88 and 85 respectively and the average removal rates were 3 6 and 3 4 μg l h with average concentrations of 12 1 and 11 4 μg l in effluent in our previous studies with short term batch tests wang et al 2019a b it took six days for enriched nitrifying sludge to completely degrade 50 μg l cfx and sdz 99 7 and 97 4 respectively which were much slower than the rates obtained in this study these results indicated that long term exposure to cfx and sdz enhanced the degradation capability of enriched nitrifying sludge 3 2 2 nob and heterotrophic bacteria made minor contributions to cfx and sdz removal the contributions of nob and heterotrophic bacteria in the removal of cfx and sdz were revealed by in situ batch tests fig 4 figs s2 and s3 when ammonium was present in the reactors test 1 it would be converted to nitrite by aob and then to nitrate by nob the removal rates of cfx and sdz were 8 1 and 6 3 μg l h g vss respectively however as nitrite became the only substrate in test 2 nob remained active in converting nitrite while aob would be in the state of endogenous respiration due to the absence of ammonium in this case the removal rates of cfx and sdz in this test were 0 8 and 0 9 μg l h g vss respectively in test 3 in which only cfx and sdz were added into the reactors neither aob nor nob was active the removal of cfx and sdz was therefore mainly resulted from the degradation of heterotrophic bacteria and or adsorption the removal rates of cfx and sdz were 0 4 and 0 3 μg l h g vss respectively as the removal rates of cfx and sdz obtained in test 2 and test 3 were significantly lower rates than those in test 1 p 0 01 fig 4 and no significant difference was found between the rates in test 2 and test 3 p 0 05 fig 4 it can be concluded that the cometabolism of aob was the main mechanism for the removal of cfx and sdz yet with little contributions from adsorption nob and heterotrophic bacteria 3 3 microbial community shift under chronic exposure to cfx and sdz the shifts of microbial community in sbr 1 and sbr 2 in different phases were explored with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing both cfx and sdz posed strong disturbance on the bacterial structure resulting in the washing out of some sensitive species and proliferation of more resistant ones fig 5 the identified functional aob and nob in both reactors were nitrosomonas and nitrobacter respectively the genus level compositions of microbial population in different phases in sbr 1 dosing cfx are shown in fig 5a flavobacterium and nitrosomonas were the dominant members in sbr 1 throughout the experiment however different responses to the increased cfx concentrations were found for these two genera the abundance of flavobacterium increased from 13 8 in phase 1 no cfx to 26 1 in phase 5 100 μg l cfx indicating its resistance to cfx exposure in contrast the abundance of nitrosomonas decreased from 23 8 in phase 1 no cfx to 13 7 in phase 5 100 μg l cfx indicating a detrimental effect of cfx exposure on its proliferation specifically when exposed to 10 and 30 μg l cfx the abundance of nitrosomonas was similar to that in phase 1 23 8 which were 21 0 and 21 4 respectively however after increasing cfx concentration to 50 μg l in phase 4 the abundance of nitrosomonas exhibited a dramatic decrease to 15 4 followed by 13 7 in phase 5 it is also noteworthy that the abundance of sm1a02 a genus belonging to phycisphaeraceae family increased from 3 5 in phase 1 to 18 9 in phase 4 50 μg l cfx and decreased to 11 3 at the end phase 5 100 μg l cfx suggesting its relatively strong resistance to cfx in addition while the abundance of methylophaga increased sharply from undetectable level in phase 1 no cfx to 21 0 in phase 2 10 μg l cfx it plummeted to 1 7 in phase 3 30 μg l cfx and became undetectable again in phase 5 100 μg l cfx the increasing cfx concentrations also induced different effects on the abundances of chthoniobacteraceae aquimonas xanthobacteraceae and terrimicrobium the abundances of chthoniobacteraceae and aquimonas increased from undetectable level and 0 2 in phase 1 to 7 0 and 7 0 in phase 5 100 μg l cfx while the abundances of xanthobacteraceae and terrimicrobium decreased from 7 3 to 8 4 in phase 1 to 2 7 and 0 1 in phase 5 respectively in sbr 2 enriched nitrifying sludge experienced a different shift in microbial community structure indicating different effects of sdz exposure on microbial compositions compared to cfx exposure while the abundance of nitrosomonas exposed to 10 μg l sdz 28 4 remained similar to that in phase 1 28 8 no sdz it dropped to 3 0 in phase 3 30 μg l sdz and recovered to 14 4 in phase 4 50 μg l sdz as sdz concentration further increased to 100 μg l in phase 5 the abundance of nitrosomonas decreased to 7 9 in the middle of the phase and recovered to 13 7 in end of the phase similarly arenimonas reached the lowest level 2 4 in phase 4 50 μg l sdz and recovered to 8 4 at the end of phase 5 100 μg l sdz suggesting its adaption to sdz the abundance of xanthobacteraceae kept increasing from 6 9 in phase 1 to 17 8 in the middle of phase 5 which was different from the deceasing trend in sbr 1 in addition the abundance of flavobacterium also exhibited different trend from that exposed to cfx while the abundance of flavobacterium reached the highest in phase 2 20 0 10 μg l sdz it decreased sharply to 5 0 at the end of phase 5 due to the increased sdz concentration similar trends to that of flavobacterium were also found with luteimonas truepera and hyphomicrobium while luteimonas reached its highest abundance in phase 3 16 3 30 μg l sdz both truepera and hyphomicrobium topped in phase 4 7 4 and 9 1 respectively 50 μg l sdz however their abundances all dropped at the end of phase 5 100 μg l sdz which were 6 2 1 7 and 4 4 respectively we further investigated the abundance shift of nitrosomonas under long term antibiotic exposure by conducting a correlation analysis of its abundance and the concentrations of cfx and sdz fig 6 the abundance of nitrosomonas was negatively correlated with the concentrations of both cfx and sdz suggesting the inhibitory effect of both antibiotics on the proliferation of nitrosomonas 3 4 up regulation of amoa gene expression under cfx and sdz exposure in order to reveal the genetic level response of enriched nitrifying sludge under exposure to various concentrations of cfx and sdz the abundances of amoa gene and the expression levels of amoa mrna in sbr 1 and sbr 2 in different phases were quantified using qpcr and rt qpcr respectively the amoa mrna level in each sample was then normalized with the amoa gene level in the corresponding sample to show the expression ratio of amoa gene in aob fig 7 in sbr 1 the expression ratio of amoa gene exposed to 10 μg l cfx phase 2 was statistically similar to that without cfx dosing phase 1 p 0 05 figs 7a and 8a in phase 3 the expression ratio of amoa increased when the sludge was initially fed with 30 μg l cfx and decreased to similar level as in phase 1 fig 7a the expression level of amoa gene in phase 4 50 μg l cfx also displayed a similar trend as in phase 3 fig 7a indicating an on going adaption process in the sludge it should be noted that the average expression ratio of amoa gene was significantly higher than that in phase 1 p 0 05 figs 7a and 8a when cfx concentration increased to 100 μg l in phase 5 the expression of amoa gene was further significantly up regulated p 0 01 figs 7a and 8a which also led to an increased aor p 0 01 fig 2a despite that the aob abundance in phase 5 was 10 lower than that in phase 1 fig 5a in sbr 2 the expression ratio of amoa gene was not affected by 10 μg l sdz in phase 2 figs 7b and 8b which was consistent with the results that the abundance and ammonium oxidizing capability of aob were similar to those in phase 1 figs 2b and 5b when exposed to 30 μg l sdz phase 3 the expression of amoa gene was up regulated fig 7b which is similar to that in phase 3 in sbr 1 as the nitrifying bacteria underwent sdz exposure of 50 μg l in phase 4 the expression level of amoa gene was further up regulated fig 7b in this phase the nitrifying bacteria gradually got acclimatized to sdz and the abundance of aob also increased fig 5b leading to a recovery of aor fig 2b in phase 5 with sdz exposure of 100 μg l the average expression ratio of amoa gene was lower than that in phase 4 50 μg l sdz yet it was still significantly higher than that in phase 1 p 0 01 figs 7b and 8b 4 discussion in this study the cometabolic antibiotic biodegradation capability of enriched nitrifying sludge was investigated in two independent sbrs by feeding two commonly used antibiotics cfx and sdz for more than 200 days meanwhile kinetic and microbial responses of nitrifying bacteria were systematically investigated by monitoring nitrification efficiency aor and nor in conjunction with multiple molecular approaches qpcr rt qpcr and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 4 1 cfx and sdz removal by nitrifying bacteria as chemolithoautotrophic bacteria aob are able to obtain energy to support their growth by oxidizing ammonia using its key enzyme amo which could also degrade a variety of micropollutants our study confirmed that cfx and sdz in both reactors were mainly degraded through the cometabolism of aob based on test 1 with the presence of ammonium both cfx and sdz could be efficiently degraded with removal rates of 8 1 and 6 3 μg l h g vss respectively fig 4 in contrast in test 2 with the presence of sole nitrite the removal rates of cfx and sdz decreased dramatically to 0 8 and 0 9 μg l h g vss respectively fig 4 the removal of cfx and sdz in test 2 could be contributed by the adsorption nob and heterotrophic bacteria in addition slow removal rates for cfx 0 4 μg l h g vss and sdz 0 3 μg l h g vss were also observed in test 3 fig 4 in which neither ammonium nor nitrite was provided in test 3 the removal of cfx and sdz was resulted from the adsorption and heterotrophic bacteria as the removal rates of cfx and sdz in test 2 and 3 were significantly lower than those in test 1 p 0 01 it suggested that the cometabolism of aob made a major contribution in the removal of cfx and sdz rather than adsorption nob and heterotrophic bacteria in addition our previous studies conducted the inhibition tests using allylthiourea atu to inhibit aob and nan3 to inactivate microbial activities and the results also showed that adsorption made a very little contribution to the removal of cfx and sdz 10 wang et al 2019a b differently cfx and sdz removal rates by enriched nitrifying sludge decreased significantly due to shock loading of cfx and sdz based on short term experiments 6 day exposure in our previous studies wang et al 2019a b however the results obtained from long term experiment with more than 200 day exposure demonstrated that more stable removal rates of cfx 3 6 μg l h in sbr 1 and sdz 3 4 μg l h in sbr 2 could be achieved which were higher than those obtained in short term batch tests 0 5 and 0 4 μg l h in average for cfx and sdz respectively wang et al 2019a b this could be associated with the adaptation of the nitrifying sludge under exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of antibiotics the possible intermediates and products of cfx and sdz in the degradation process were not identified in this study which warrants further studies it should be noted that our previous batch based studies have showed that the biotoxicity of these unknown intermediates and products might have been mitigated by enriched nitrifying sludge wang et al 2019a b despite with significant decrease of aob abundance the increased amoa mrna level augmented the synthesis of amo in aob which could not only guarantee the full nitrification performance of the reactors but also facilitate the cometabolic biodegradation of the antibiotics in another study conducted by kassotaki et al 2016 approximate 98 removal of 100 μg l sulfamethoxazole smx was also obtained in an sbr with an enriched culture of aob hrt 24 h aor 30 mg n h g vss in contrast in an sbr employing cas process the removal efficiency of smx was only 36 5 11 5 when treating 50 μg l smx during the 2 month exposure collado et al 2013 survey based studies also indicated that the cas based wwtps are generally unable to efficiently remove antibiotics batt et al 2007 gros et al 2010 zuccato et al 2010 for example the removal of cfx in a wwtp in shanghai china was 23 1 wu et al 2016 in another wwtp in hong kong china only 30 4 of cfx was removed li et al 2009 collectively efficient cfx and sdz removal could be achieved by enriched nitrifying sludge via the cometabolism of aob 4 2 kinetic and microbial responses of nitrifying bacteria to the chronic exposure to cfx and sdz nitrification is an essential process for biological nitrogen removal from wastewater in wwtps in this study the focus was also put on investigating kinetic responses of nitrifying bacteria by tracking nitrification efficiency aor and nor during long term exposure period our results indicated that both sbr 1 and sbr 2 could achieve full nitrification after long term exposure to cfx and sdz with stepwise increasing concentrations up to 100 μg l in each phase ammonium could be transformed into nitrate without nitrite accumulation in effluent and ammonium removal efficiency was stably maintained at approximately 100 during the entire experiment period although the nitrification process was not deteriorated in both reactors the added cfx and sdz resulted in different kinetic responses in terms of different aor variations under various antibiotic exposure concentrations based on statistical analysis in fig 2 the ammonium oxidation activity was significantly enhanced when increasing cfx concentrations to above 30 μg l the increased aor after long term exposure on the other hand was contradictory to that in our previous study wang et al 2019a in which aor was inhibited by 50 μg l cfx in batch tests the discrepancy could be associated with that enriched nitrifying sludge could not adapt to such a shock and short term exposure in this study cfx was slowly fed into the reactor with a stepwise increase from 10 to 100 μg l which might offer nitrifying sludge sufficient time to get adapted to cfx exposure and subsequently cope with its inhibitory effect in contrast to cfx the ammonium oxidation activity decreased under exposure to 30 μg l sdz but further recovered after long term adaption under exposure to 50 and 100 μg l sdz furthermore from microbial perspective the chronic exposure of cfx and sdz have caused the shift of community structure and the alternation of amoa gene expression the community structure analysis in sbr 1 fig 6a indicated that aob could cope with low concentrations of cfx 30 μg l while higher concentrations of cfx 50 μg l would decrease their abundance from 21 4 in phase 3 to 13 7 in phase 5 given that a significant increase in aor was observed during this period the enhanced aor could be resulted from up regulation of amoa gene with the increase of cfx concentration figs 7a and 8a which could compensate the adverse effect of reduced aob abundance the response of amoa gene under long term cfx exposure was consistent with our previous study in which short term cfx exposure also could trigger up regulation of amoa gene to neutralize its bacterial susceptibility wang et al 2019a in contrast with the effect of cfx aor and aob abundance in sbr 2 exhibited different profiles under chronic exposure to sdz under exposure of 30 μg l sdz aor decreased to be minimum 40 0 mg n l h g vss in phase 3 but it gradually recovered despite the increase of sdz concentration to 100 μg l sdz in phase 5 fig 2b the significant decrease of aor in phase 3 could be associated with the decreased aob abundance fig 5b although the expression level of amoa gene was up regulated in this phase it could not compensate the reduced aob population this phenomenon indicated that aob was more sensitive to sdz exposure than cfx exposure on the other hand long term sdz exposure could also get aob more adapted and resistant to sdz the surviving aob were able to cope with higher concentration of sdz in phase 4 50 μg l sdz the abundance of aob in phase 4 would therefore increase due to the recovery of its reproduction in combination with the further up regulated expression of amoa gene aor also recovered in phase 4 in phase 5 with sdz exposure of 100 μg l the aob abundance experienced a decrease followed by the recovery the reason could be associated with that the higher concentration of sdz posed more inhibitory effect on aob as the surviving aob became adapted to 100 μg l sdz then their abundance would increase on the other hand the average expression ratio of amoa gene in phase 5 was less than that in phase 4 fig 8b indicating that the cometabolic activity of aob might be compromised under exposure to a higher sdz concentration the reason could be that aob need more energy in repairing the damage caused by sdz and maintaining the normal cellular activity further experiments are required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms katipoglu yazan et al 2016 also reported relatively higher amoa mrna levels when the nitrifying biomass was chronically exposed to smx which is consistent with the observation in this study however it should be noted that the extremely high concentration of smx 50 mg l applied in katipoglu yazan et al 2016 might lead to different responses of the nitrifying sludge in certain aspects e g nitrification efficiency abundance and response of aob and nob and the removal of smx radniecki et al 2009 and yu and chandran 2010 also observed significant up regulation of amoa gene when aob experienced zncl2 exposure and decreased do concentration respectively these findings suggest a mechanism of aob to survive adverse environmental conditions in contrast another study by katipoglu yazan et al 2015 reported a significant reduction in aob abundance and amoa mrna level and total collapse of nitrification performance in the similar enriched nitrifying biomass after chronic exposure to 50 mg l tetracycline tet the reduced amoa mrna level in the study of katipoglu yazan et al 2015 might be due to the extreme high concentration of tet and the less tolerance to tet than smx thus resulting in the disappearance of the nitrifiers in the system and irreversible collapse of nitrification our recent study wang et al 2019b also suggested the down regulation of amoa gene in enriched nitrifying sludge under short term exposure of 50 μg l sdz but implied a potential up regulation trend of amoa gene by the end of the batch test it was assumed that the short exposure duration made it difficult to explore the actual future trend of amoa mrna level the results in this study with long term sdz exposure confirmed this up regulation trend of amoa gene although both nitrification and antibiotic removal performance were not deteriorated under long term antibiotic exposure due to amoa gene up regulation cfx and sdz did induce the decrease of aob abundance in both reactors moreover the adverse effect of antibiotics on the performance of other functional microorganisms e g denitrifiers and paos in wwtps have also been reported amorim et al 2014 yi et al 2017 these results suggest it is practically necessary to develop control strategies to avoid potential adverse and chronic effects of antibiotic moreover considering there are very diverse micropollutants in real wastewater future investigations are required to reveal possible synergistic effects of multiple contaminants and their possible biotransformation intermediates products on kinetic and microbial responses of nitrifying bacteria by feeding real wastewater matrix 5 conclusions this study investigated the chronic removal performance of cfx and sdz by enriched nitrifying sludge with stepwise increased concentrations and kinetic and microbial responses of the sludge the shift of microbial community and the key gene expression along the nitrification process the main findings of this study include 1 cfx and sdz could be efficiently removed by enriched nitrifying sludge via the cometabolism of aob with limited contributions from heterotrophic bacteria and nob 2 the apparent nitrification performance in both sbrs was not affected by cfx and sdz exposure chronic exposure to cfx up to 100 μg l led to a certain extent of stimulatory effect on aor while aor experienced a decrease due to exposure to 30 μg l sdz but recovered after adaption under exposure to 50 and 100 μg l sdz 3 the abundance of aob experienced a distinct decrease due to the chronic exposure to cfx and sdz while the expression level of amoa gene was up regulated to overcome this adverse impact thus ensuring a stable and efficient removal of both ammonium and the antibiotics declaration of competing

18119,wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been identified as one of the reservoirs of antibiotics although nitrifying bacteria have been reported to be capable of degrading various antibiotics there are very few studies investigating long term effects of antibiotics on kinetic and microbial responses of nitrifying bacteria in this study cephalexin cfx and sulfadiazine sdz were selected to assess chronic impacts on nitrifying sludge with stepwise increasing concentrations in two independent bioreactors the results showed that cfx and sdz at an initial concentration of 100 μg l could be efficiently removed by enriched nitrifying sludge as evidenced by removal efficiencies of more than 88 and 85 respectively ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob made a major contribution to the biodegradation of cfx and sdz via cometabolism compared to limited contributions from heterotrophic bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria chronic exposure to cfx 30 μg l could stimulate ammonium oxidation activity in terms of a significant enhancement of ammonium oxidation rate p 0 01 in contrast the ammonium oxidation activity was inhibited due to exposure to 30 μg l sdz p 0 01 then it recovered after long term adaption under exposure to 50 and 100 μg l sdz in addition 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed that the relative abundance of aob decreased distinctly from 23 8 to 28 8 in the control phase without cfx or sdz to 14 2 and 10 8 under exposure to 100 μg l cfx and sdz respectively however the expression level of amoa gene was up regulated to overcome this adverse impact and maintain a stable and efficient removal of both ammonium and antibiotics the findings in this study shed a light on chronic effects of antibiotic exposure on kinetic and microbial responses

toxic effect to diverse non target organisms which is harmful to the ecosystem as a whole baguer et al 2000 gonzález pleiter et al 2013 robinson et al 2005 for example developmental malformations were observed in embryo larval zebrafish after exposure to β diketone antibiotics wang et al 2014 flaherty and dodson 2005 also reported significant changes in daphnia sex ratio after exposure to a mixture of three to five antibiotics total concentration 30 500 μg l more importantly the intensive use of antibiotics facilitates the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms even pathogenic bacteria which has been recognized as a global challenge for public health andersson and hughes 2014 guo et al 2017 wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been identified as reservoirs

a wide range of substrates along with ammonium oxidation process helbling et al 2012 sun et al 2012 tran et al 2013 on the other hand negative effects of antibiotics on nitrification were also documented for example lincomycin 0 5 10 6 mg l ofloxacin 2 10 mg l and sulfamethoxazole 2 10 mg l were all observed with significant inhibition on nitrification activity carucci et al 2006 dokianakis et al 2004 however most of these previous studies investigating the degradation of micropollutants by nitrifying cultures and or the effect of micropollutants on nitrifying cultures drew conclusions based on short term batch tests batt et al 2006 dawas massalha et al 2014 li et al 2015 men et al 2016 yu et al 2018 and the concentrations applied were much higher than environmentally relevant levels carucci et al 2006 dokianakis et al 2004 katipoglu yazan et al 2015 2016 yi et al 2017 which were usually at ng l and μg l levels baran et al 2011 chang et al 2010 dutta et al 2014 li and zhang 2011 mamo et al 2018 michael et al 2013 considering nitrifying bacterial communities might be shifted or adapted after long term exposure cultivation the chronic effect of antibiotics at environmentally relevant levels on nitrifying bacteria could be different from these studies based on short term batch tests or under exposure to higher concentrations of antibiotics usually mg l levels so far few studies have documented the long term effect of antibiotic exposure at environmentally relevant levels on the activity of the nitrifying bacteria and the community shift of the nitrifying sludge which is of more relevance for full scale wwtps due to continuous feeding of antibiotics in influent cephalexin cfx and sulfadiazine sdz have been widely used as broad spectrum antibiotics cfx is a β lactam antibiotic within the class of cephalosporins which is frequently used to treat certain bacterial infections including those of the middle ear bone and joint skin and urinary tract in australia cfx was the sixth most frequently prescribed antimicrobials in 2017 in united states it was the fourth most frequently prescribed outpatient antibiotic in 2016 after administration up to 90 of cfx will be excreted unchanged in urine within 6 h thornhill et al 1969 sdz belongs to sulphonamides and is widely used for the treatment of meningitis toxoplasmosis and infection of the upper respiratory tract up to 80 of administered sdz could be recovered in the urine either as parent compound or acetyl conjugate woolley et al 1980 cfx and sdz have often been detected in the influent of wwtps with concentrations up to 30 μg l gao et al 2012 leung et al 2012 lin et al 2010 mohapatra et al 2016 watkinson et al 2009 wu et al 2016 this study aimed to experimentally assess the long term impacts of cfx and sdz at environmentally relevant levels on the nitrification performance and microbial community structure of enriched nitrifying sludge can long term antibiotic exposure cause a significant shift in nitrifying sludge community can enriched nitrifying sludge achieve an enhanced antibiotic removal rate after long term adaption that warrants practical applications to this end cfx and sdz were selected and continuously fed into two independent sbrs with enriched nitrifying sludge respectively we highly investigated i the profiles of cfx and sdz removal by the nitrification process ii the shift of nitrifying sludge community based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and iii the expression of amoa gene in aob under long term exposure to cfx and sdz the findings obtained in this study could provide new insights into the understanding of the long term effects of antibiotic exposure on nitrifying bacteria which would be of significance for the stable and efficient operation of wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation two lab scale sbrs with a working volume of 8 l were used in this study both reactors were 70 cm in height and 16 cm in internal diameter the activated sludge collected from a local wwtp brisbane australia was used as the inoculum synthetic wastewater with 1000 mg l nh4 n was fed into the reactors for the enrichment of nitrifying bacteria the schematic diagram of the reactors and the detailed composition of the feeding solution can be found in fig s1 and tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary information si the reactors were operated in a 6 h cycle including 5 consecutive phases aerobic feeding 260 min aerobic reaction 30 min wasting 1 min settling 60 min and decanting 9 min in aerobic feeding stage 2 l synthetic wastewater was continuously pumped into the reactors the hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt in both reactors were maintained at 24 h and 15 d respectively a programmable logic controller plc was used to control the concentration of dissolved oxygen do and ph level in the reactors do was maintained in the range of 2 5 3 0 mg l and ph was kept at 7 5 7 8 by dosing 1 m nahco3 for the growth and enrichment of nitrifying bacteria before dosing antibiotics both reactors had reached full nitrification and kept stable for at least 3 months to investigate the long term impacts of cfx and sdz on nitrifying bacteria cfx and sdz were dosed individually into the feeding solution of each reactor cfx for sbr 1 and sdz for sbr 2 the entire reactor operation consisted of five phases in terms of antibiotic dosage levels which is outlined in table 1 2 2 sampling strategy and analysis methods 2 2 1 mlvss nitrogen species and antibiotics the concentration of mixed liquid volatile suspended solid mlvss in both reactors was measured weekly according to the standard method apha 2017 the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate in influent and effluent were analyzed twice a week for each reactor using the lachat quikchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee the determination of ammonium oxidation rate aor and nitrite oxidation rate nor in the two reactors are described in si the concentrations of cfx and sdz in influent and effluent were also measured twice a week after collection 1 5 ml samples were filtered into 2 ml verex amber vials phenomenex australia pty ltd with 0 22 μm syringe filters merck millipore ltd and then stored in a 20 c freezer the analysis was conducted with an ultra fast liquid chromatography shimadzu japan coupled with a 4000 qtrap hybrid triple quadruple linear ion trap mass spectrometer uflc ms ms the injection volume was 20 μl both cfx and sdz were analyzed in esi positive ion mode the detailed gradient elution procedure is shown in si 2 2 2 microbial community analysis the shifts of microbial community structure in both reactors under long term exposure to cfx and sdz were investigated by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing sludge samples of 3 ml were taken at the end of each phase except for phase 5 in which two samples were taken in the middle and end of the phase and centrifuged at 13000 g for 2 min the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were stored at 20 c dna extraction from the pellets was carried out using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa following the manufacturer s instructions the primer set 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 was used to amplify the 16s rrna gene purified amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform illumina usa the 16s rrna gene sequencing and data processing were conducted as described previously luo et al 2018 2 2 3 quantification of amoa gene by qpcr and amoa mrna by rt qpcr in order to reveal the expression level of amoa gene sludge samples of 3 ml were also collected from the reactor on a weekly basis the samples were centrifuged at 13000 g for 2 min the supernatant was discarded the pellets were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen before storing in a 80 c freezer for further rna and dna extraction total rna extraction was performed using qiagen rneasy mini kit catalogue number 74104 after the extraction dnase treatment was applied to eliminate the possible contamination of dna purified rna was then reversely transcribed to cdna using primer set amoa 1f 5 ggg gtt tct act ggt ggt 3 and amoa 2r 5 ccc ctc kgs aaa gcc ttc ttc 3 rotthauwe et al 1997 the amplification of cdna was conducted on an applied biosystems viia 7 real time pcr system the qpcr condition was as follows 2 min at 94 c and 30 cycles of 94 c for 30 s 52 c for 30 s 72 c for 1 min and a final extension at 72 c for 15 min the detailed procedure of the rt qpcr is given in si in order to qualify the abundance of amoa gene in the samples extracted dna was directly used for qpcr analysis which followed the same procedure and condition as cdna in rt qpcr analysis both qpcr and rt qpcr were conducted in biological triplicates 2 3 in situ batch tests in order to confirm aob s cometabolic ability to degrade antibiotics and determine whether nob and heterotrophic bacteria play important roles in the removal of cfx and sdz a series of in situ batch tests were conducted in both reactors after the entire long term experiment table 2 the aim of test 1 was to investigate the degradation of cfx sdz by nitrifying bacteria with the presence of ammonium the initial concentration of ammonium and cfx sdz were 100 mg n l and 100 μg l respectively samples of 5 ml were taken from the reactors every 30 min for the analysis of nitrogen species and cfx sdz until ammonium was completely consumed test 2 was conducted to test if nob could make contribution on antibiotic biodegradation by feeding cfx sdz and nitrite but without ammonium in order to avoid the activity of aob the initial concentrations of nitrite and cfx sdz were 100 mg n l and 100 μg l respectively samples of 5 ml were taken from the reactors every 15 min until nitrite was completely consumed in test 3 only cfx or sdz was individually added into each reactor to assess the contribution of heterotrophic bacteria samples of 5 ml were taken from the reactors every 60 min for 3 h after each test the sludge in the reactors was washed with phosphate buffered saline three times to remove residual cfx sdz the concentration of mlvss in each reactor was also measured before conducting each test each batch test was performed in biological triplicate 3 results 3 1 nitrification performance of the sbrs in order to evaluate nitrification performance under the long term exposure to cfx and sdz both sbrs with enriched nitrifying sludge were operated for more than 250 days to treat synthetic wastewater containing cfx or sdz with different concentrations the control phase phase 1 without antibiotic addition was conducted to collect the background information of the two reactors then cfx and sdz were then dosed individually into the feeding solution of each reactor with stepwise increasing concentrations during phases 2 5 3 1 1 complete nitrification under chronic cfx and sdz exposure the nitrification performance of both reactors throughout the experiment was monitored with the profiles of ammonium nitrite and nitrate in effluent despite the dosage of cfx and sdz from phase 2 to phase 5 ammonium and nitrite were not detected in effluent of both reactors fig 1 while nitrate was the main product 939 33 and 959 46 mg l in sbr 1 and sbr 2 respectively the nitrogen mass balance between influent and effluent showed that there was neglectable loss of nitrogen 2 6 and 0 4 in sbr 1 and sbr 2 respectively from phase 2 to phase 5 indicating complete nitrification capability in both reactors in terms of ammonium oxidation efficiency complete nitrification could still be achieved even under exposure to the highest concentration of cfx or sdz i e 100 μg l 3 1 2 cfx and sdz exhibited different effects on aor and nor the profiles of aor and nor in both reactors were monitored throughout the experiment in sbr 1 aor and nor did not change significantly under exposure to 10 μg l cfx p 0 05 fig 2 a when cfx concentration increased to 30 μg l both aor and nor increased significantly by 31 p 0 01 and 9 p 0 05 respectively fig 2a however when cfx concentration further increased to 100 μg l in phase 5 aor in sbr 1 decreased 8 compared with that exposed to 30 μg l cfx in phase 3 which was still significantly higher 21 p 0 01 than that in phase 1 fig 2a in addition when exposed to 100 μg l cfx a 17 decrease in nor was observed compared with phase 1 fig 2a these results suggest that chronic exposure to cfx up to 100 μg l led to a certain extent of stimulatory effect on aob activity while nob activity would be inhibited at higher cfx concentration 100 μg l in sbr 2 exposure to 10 μg l sdz in phase 2 did not affect the apparent activity of aob and nob in terms of aor and nor fig 2b after increasing sdz concentration to 30 μg l in phase 3 aob activity decreased by 22 compared with phase 1 fig 2b however when sdz concentration increased to 50 μg l in phase 4 no significant difference in aor was observed between phase 4 and phase 1 p 0 05 fig 2b indicating the recovery of aob activity in phase 5 aor remained at the similar level as in phase 1 despite the further increase of sdz concentration 100 μg l nob activity on the other hand was not significantly affected by sdz exposure from phase 2 to phase 5 compared with phase 1 p 0 05 fig 2b 3 2 removal profiles of cfx and sdz 3 2 1 efficient removal of cfx and sdz by enriched nitrifying sludge while the presence of cfx and sdz in influent did not affect the apparent nitrification efficiency of enriched nitrifying sludge in both reactors both cfx and sdz were removed to a high degree within the experimental period fig 3 from phase 2 to phase 4 the removal efficiencies of cfx and sdz were 95 and 93 in average respectively with average concentrations of 1 9 and 2 3 μg l in effluent in phase 5 the removal efficiency of cfx underwent fluctuations in the first 50 days and then became relatively stable thereafter fig 3a the removal efficiency of sdz on the other hand decreased slightly to 80 in the first 30 days of phase 5 and then gradually increased to around 90 fig 3b the average removal efficiencies for cfx and sdz in phase 5 were 88 and 85 respectively and the average removal rates were 3 6 and 3 4 μg l h with average concentrations of 12 1 and 11 4 μg l in effluent in our previous studies with short term batch tests wang et al 2019a b it took six days for enriched nitrifying sludge to completely degrade 50 μg l cfx and sdz 99 7 and 97 4 respectively which were much slower than the rates obtained in this study these results indicated that long term exposure to cfx and sdz enhanced the degradation capability of enriched nitrifying sludge 3 2 2 nob and heterotrophic bacteria made minor contributions to cfx and sdz removal the contributions of nob and heterotrophic bacteria in the removal of cfx and sdz were revealed by in situ batch tests fig 4 figs s2 and s3 when ammonium was present in the reactors test 1 it would be converted to nitrite by aob and then to nitrate by nob the removal rates of cfx and sdz were 8 1 and 6 3 μg l h g vss respectively however as nitrite became the only substrate in test 2 nob remained active in converting nitrite while aob would be in the state of endogenous respiration due to the absence of ammonium in this case the removal rates of cfx and sdz in this test were 0 8 and 0 9 μg l h g vss respectively in test 3 in which only cfx and sdz were added into the reactors neither aob nor nob was active the removal of cfx and sdz was therefore mainly resulted from the degradation of heterotrophic bacteria and or adsorption the removal rates of cfx and sdz were 0 4 and 0 3 μg l h g vss respectively as the removal rates of cfx and sdz obtained in test 2 and test 3 were significantly lower rates than those in test 1 p 0 01 fig 4 and no significant difference was found between the rates in test 2 and test 3 p 0 05 fig 4 it can be concluded that the cometabolism of aob was the main mechanism for the removal of cfx and sdz yet with little contributions from adsorption nob and heterotrophic bacteria 3 3 microbial community shift under chronic exposure to cfx and sdz the shifts of microbial community in sbr 1 and sbr 2 in different phases were explored with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing both cfx and sdz posed strong disturbance on the bacterial structure resulting in the washing out of some sensitive species and proliferation of more resistant ones fig 5 the identified functional aob and nob in both reactors were nitrosomonas and nitrobacter respectively the genus level compositions of microbial population in different phases in sbr 1 dosing cfx are shown in fig 5a flavobacterium and nitrosomonas were the dominant members in sbr 1 throughout the experiment however different responses to the increased cfx concentrations were found for these two genera the abundance of flavobacterium increased from 13 8 in phase 1 no cfx to 26 1 in phase 5 100 μg l cfx indicating its resistance to cfx exposure in contrast the abundance of nitrosomonas decreased from 23 8 in phase 1 no cfx to 13 7 in phase 5 100 μg l cfx indicating a detrimental effect of cfx exposure on its proliferation specifically when exposed to 10 and 30 μg l cfx the abundance of nitrosomonas was similar to that in phase 1 23 8 which were 21 0 and 21 4 respectively however after increasing cfx concentration to 50 μg l in phase 4 the abundance of nitrosomonas exhibited a dramatic decrease to 15 4 followed by 13 7 in phase 5 it is also noteworthy that the abundance of sm1a02 a genus belonging to phycisphaeraceae family increased from 3 5 in phase 1 to 18 9 in phase 4 50 μg l cfx and decreased to 11 3 at the end phase 5 100 μg l cfx suggesting its relatively strong resistance to cfx in addition while the abundance of methylophaga increased sharply from undetectable level in phase 1 no cfx to 21 0 in phase 2 10 μg l cfx it plummeted to 1 7 in phase 3 30 μg l cfx and became undetectable again in phase 5 100 μg l cfx the increasing cfx concentrations also induced different effects on the abundances of chthoniobacteraceae aquimonas xanthobacteraceae and terrimicrobium the abundances of chthoniobacteraceae and aquimonas increased from undetectable level and 0 2 in phase 1 to 7 0 and 7 0 in phase 5 100 μg l cfx while the abundances of xanthobacteraceae and terrimicrobium decreased from 7 3 to 8 4 in phase 1 to 2 7 and 0 1 in phase 5 respectively in sbr 2 enriched nitrifying sludge experienced a different shift in microbial community structure indicating different effects of sdz exposure on microbial compositions compared to cfx exposure while the abundance of nitrosomonas exposed to 10 μg l sdz 28 4 remained similar to that in phase 1 28 8 no sdz it dropped to 3 0 in phase 3 30 μg l sdz and recovered to 14 4 in phase 4 50 μg l sdz as sdz concentration further increased to 100 μg l in phase 5 the abundance of nitrosomonas decreased to 7 9 in the middle of the phase and recovered to 13 7 in end of the phase similarly arenimonas reached the lowest level 2 4 in phase 4 50 μg l sdz and recovered to 8 4 at the end of phase 5 100 μg l sdz suggesting its adaption to sdz the abundance of xanthobacteraceae kept increasing from 6 9 in phase 1 to 17 8 in the middle of phase 5 which was different from the deceasing trend in sbr 1 in addition the abundance of flavobacterium also exhibited different trend from that exposed to cfx while the abundance of flavobacterium reached the highest in phase 2 20 0 10 μg l sdz it decreased sharply to 5 0 at the end of phase 5 due to the increased sdz concentration similar trends to that of flavobacterium were also found with luteimonas truepera and hyphomicrobium while luteimonas reached its highest abundance in phase 3 16 3 30 μg l sdz both truepera and hyphomicrobium topped in phase 4 7 4 and 9 1 respectively 50 μg l sdz however their abundances all dropped at the end of phase 5 100 μg l sdz which were 6 2 1 7 and 4 4 respectively we further investigated the abundance shift of nitrosomonas under long term antibiotic exposure by conducting a correlation analysis of its abundance and the concentrations of cfx and sdz fig 6 the abundance of nitrosomonas was negatively correlated with the concentrations of both cfx and sdz suggesting the inhibitory effect of both antibiotics on the proliferation of nitrosomonas 3 4 up regulation of amoa gene expression under cfx and sdz exposure in order to reveal the genetic level response of enriched nitrifying sludge under exposure to various concentrations of cfx and sdz the abundances of amoa gene and the expression levels of amoa mrna in sbr 1 and sbr 2 in different phases were quantified using qpcr and rt qpcr respectively the amoa mrna level in each sample was then normalized with the amoa gene level in the corresponding sample to show the expression ratio of amoa gene in aob fig 7 in sbr 1 the expression ratio of amoa gene exposed to 10 μg l cfx phase 2 was statistically similar to that without cfx dosing phase 1 p 0 05 figs 7a and 8a in phase 3 the expression ratio of amoa increased when the sludge was initially fed with 30 μg l cfx and decreased to similar level as in phase 1 fig 7a the expression level of amoa gene in phase 4 50 μg l cfx also displayed a similar trend as in phase 3 fig 7a indicating an on going adaption process in the sludge it should be noted that the average expression ratio of amoa gene was significantly higher than that in phase 1 p 0 05 figs 7a and 8a when cfx concentration increased to 100 μg l in phase 5 the expression of amoa gene was further significantly up regulated p 0 01 figs 7a and 8a which also led to an increased aor p 0 01 fig 2a despite that the aob abundance in phase 5 was 10 lower than that in phase 1 fig 5a in sbr 2 the expression ratio of amoa gene was not affected by 10 μg l sdz in phase 2 figs 7b and 8b which was consistent with the results that the abundance and ammonium oxidizing capability of aob were similar to those in phase 1 figs 2b and 5b when exposed to 30 μg l sdz phase 3 the expression of amoa gene was up regulated fig 7b which is similar to that in phase 3 in sbr 1 as the nitrifying bacteria underwent sdz exposure of 50 μg l in phase 4 the expression level of amoa gene was further up regulated fig 7b in this phase the nitrifying bacteria gradually got acclimatized to sdz and the abundance of aob also increased fig 5b leading to a recovery of aor fig 2b in phase 5 with sdz exposure of 100 μg l the average expression ratio of amoa gene was lower than that in phase 4 50 μg l sdz yet it was still significantly higher than that in phase 1 p 0 01 figs 7b and 8b 4 discussion in this study the cometabolic antibiotic biodegradation capability of enriched nitrifying sludge was investigated in two independent sbrs by feeding two commonly used antibiotics cfx and sdz for more than 200 days meanwhile kinetic and microbial responses of nitrifying bacteria were systematically investigated by monitoring nitrification efficiency aor and nor in conjunction with multiple molecular approaches qpcr rt qpcr and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 4 1 cfx and sdz removal by nitrifying bacteria as chemolithoautotrophic bacteria aob are able to obtain energy to support their growth by oxidizing ammonia using its key enzyme amo which could also degrade a variety of micropollutants our study confirmed that cfx and sdz in both reactors were mainly degraded through the cometabolism of aob based on test 1 with the presence of ammonium both cfx and sdz could be efficiently degraded with removal rates of 8 1 and 6 3 μg l h g vss respectively fig 4 in contrast in test 2 with the presence of sole nitrite the removal rates of cfx and sdz decreased dramatically to 0 8 and 0 9 μg l h g vss respectively fig 4 the removal of cfx and sdz in test 2 could be contributed by the adsorption nob and heterotrophic bacteria in addition slow removal rates for cfx 0 4 μg l h g vss and sdz 0 3 μg l h g vss were also observed in test 3 fig 4 in which neither ammonium nor nitrite was provided in test 3 the removal of cfx and sdz was resulted from the adsorption and heterotrophic bacteria as the removal rates of cfx and sdz in test 2 and 3 were significantly lower than those in test 1 p 0 01 it suggested that the cometabolism of aob made a major contribution in the removal of cfx and sdz rather than adsorption nob and heterotrophic bacteria in addition our previous studies conducted the inhibition tests using allylthiourea atu to inhibit aob and nan3 to inactivate microbial activities and the results also showed that adsorption made a very little contribution to the removal of cfx and sdz 10 wang et al 2019a b differently cfx and sdz removal rates by enriched nitrifying sludge decreased significantly due to shock loading of cfx and sdz based on short term experiments 6 day exposure in our previous studies wang et al 2019a b however the results obtained from long term experiment with more than 200 day exposure demonstrated that more stable removal rates of cfx 3 6 μg l h in sbr 1 and sdz 3 4 μg l h in sbr 2 could be achieved which were higher than those obtained in short term batch tests 0 5 and 0 4 μg l h in average for cfx and sdz respectively wang et al 2019a b this could be associated with the adaptation of the nitrifying sludge under exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of antibiotics the possible intermediates and products of cfx and sdz in the degradation process were not identified in this study which warrants further studies it should be noted that our previous batch based studies have showed that the biotoxicity of these unknown intermediates and products might have been mitigated by enriched nitrifying sludge wang et al 2019a b despite with significant decrease of aob abundance the increased amoa mrna level augmented the synthesis of amo in aob which could not only guarantee the full nitrification performance of the reactors but also facilitate the cometabolic biodegradation of the antibiotics in another study conducted by kassotaki et al 2016 approximate 98 removal of 100 μg l sulfamethoxazole smx was also obtained in an sbr with an enriched culture of aob hrt 24 h aor 30 mg n h g vss in contrast in an sbr employing cas process the removal efficiency of smx was only 36 5 11 5 when treating 50 μg l smx during the 2 month exposure collado et al 2013 survey based studies also indicated that the cas based wwtps are generally unable to efficiently remove antibiotics batt et al 2007 gros et al 2010 zuccato et al 2010 for example the removal of cfx in a wwtp in shanghai china was 23 1 wu et al 2016 in another wwtp in hong kong china only 30 4 of cfx was removed li et al 2009 collectively efficient cfx and sdz removal could be achieved by enriched nitrifying sludge via the cometabolism of aob 4 2 kinetic and microbial responses of nitrifying bacteria to the chronic exposure to cfx and sdz nitrification is an essential process for biological nitrogen removal from wastewater in wwtps in this study the focus was also put on investigating kinetic responses of nitrifying bacteria by tracking nitrification efficiency aor and nor during long term exposure period our results indicated that both sbr 1 and sbr 2 could achieve full nitrification after long term exposure to cfx and sdz with stepwise increasing concentrations up to 100 μg l in each phase ammonium could be transformed into nitrate without nitrite accumulation in effluent and ammonium removal efficiency was stably maintained at approximately 100 during the entire experiment period although the nitrification process was not deteriorated in both reactors the added cfx and sdz resulted in different kinetic responses in terms of different aor variations under various antibiotic exposure concentrations based on statistical analysis in fig 2 the ammonium oxidation activity was significantly enhanced when increasing cfx concentrations to above 30 μg l the increased aor after long term exposure on the other hand was contradictory to that in our previous study wang et al 2019a in which aor was inhibited by 50 μg l cfx in batch tests the discrepancy could be associated with that enriched nitrifying sludge could not adapt to such a shock and short term exposure in this study cfx was slowly fed into the reactor with a stepwise increase from 10 to 100 μg l which might offer nitrifying sludge sufficient time to get adapted to cfx exposure and subsequently cope with its inhibitory effect in contrast to cfx the ammonium oxidation activity decreased under exposure to 30 μg l sdz but further recovered after long term adaption under exposure to 50 and 100 μg l sdz furthermore from microbial perspective the chronic exposure of cfx and sdz have caused the shift of community structure and the alternation of amoa gene expression the community structure analysis in sbr 1 fig 6a indicated that aob could cope with low concentrations of cfx 30 μg l while higher concentrations of cfx 50 μg l would decrease their abundance from 21 4 in phase 3 to 13 7 in phase 5 given that a significant increase in aor was observed during this period the enhanced aor could be resulted from up regulation of amoa gene with the increase of cfx concentration figs 7a and 8a which could compensate the adverse effect of reduced aob abundance the response of amoa gene under long term cfx exposure was consistent with our previous study in which short term cfx exposure also could trigger up regulation of amoa gene to neutralize its bacterial susceptibility wang et al 2019a in contrast with the effect of cfx aor and aob abundance in sbr 2 exhibited different profiles under chronic exposure to sdz under exposure of 30 μg l sdz aor decreased to be minimum 40 0 mg n l h g vss in phase 3 but it gradually recovered despite the increase of sdz concentration to 100 μg l sdz in phase 5 fig 2b the significant decrease of aor in phase 3 could be associated with the decreased aob abundance fig 5b although the expression level of amoa gene was up regulated in this phase it could not compensate the reduced aob population this phenomenon indicated that aob was more sensitive to sdz exposure than cfx exposure on the other hand long term sdz exposure could also get aob more adapted and resistant to sdz the surviving aob were able to cope with higher concentration of sdz in phase 4 50 μg l sdz the abundance of aob in phase 4 would therefore increase due to the recovery of its reproduction in combination with the further up regulated expression of amoa gene aor also recovered in phase 4 in phase 5 with sdz exposure of 100 μg l the aob abundance experienced a decrease followed by the recovery the reason could be associated with that the higher concentration of sdz posed more inhibitory effect on aob as the surviving aob became adapted to 100 μg l sdz then their abundance would increase on the other hand the average expression ratio of amoa gene in phase 5 was less than that in phase 4 fig 8b indicating that the cometabolic activity of aob might be compromised under exposure to a higher sdz concentration the reason could be that aob need more energy in repairing the damage caused by sdz and maintaining the normal cellular activity further experiments are required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms katipoglu yazan et al 2016 also reported relatively higher amoa mrna levels when the nitrifying biomass was chronically exposed to smx which is consistent with the observation in this study however it should be noted that the extremely high concentration of smx 50 mg l applied in katipoglu yazan et al 2016 might lead to different responses of the nitrifying sludge in certain aspects e g nitrification efficiency abundance and response of aob and nob and the removal of smx radniecki et al 2009 and yu and chandran 2010 also observed significant up regulation of amoa gene when aob experienced zncl2 exposure and decreased do concentration respectively these findings suggest a mechanism of aob to survive adverse environmental conditions in contrast another study by katipoglu yazan et al 2015 reported a significant reduction in aob abundance and amoa mrna level and total collapse of nitrification performance in the similar enriched nitrifying biomass after chronic exposure to 50 mg l tetracycline tet the reduced amoa mrna level in the study of katipoglu yazan et al 2015 might be due to the extreme high concentration of tet and the less tolerance to tet than smx thus resulting in the disappearance of the nitrifiers in the system and irreversible collapse of nitrification our recent study wang et al 2019b also suggested the down regulation of amoa gene in enriched nitrifying sludge under short term exposure of 50 μg l sdz but implied a potential up regulation trend of amoa gene by the end of the batch test it was assumed that the short exposure duration made it difficult to explore the actual future trend of amoa mrna level the results in this study with long term sdz exposure confirmed this up regulation trend of amoa gene although both nitrification and antibiotic removal performance were not deteriorated under long term antibiotic exposure due to amoa gene up regulation cfx and sdz did induce the decrease of aob abundance in both reactors moreover the adverse effect of antibiotics on the performance of other functional microorganisms e g denitrifiers and paos in wwtps have also been reported amorim et al 2014 yi et al 2017 these results suggest it is practically necessary to develop control strategies to avoid potential adverse and chronic effects of antibiotic moreover considering there are very diverse micropollutants in real wastewater future investigations are required to reveal possible synergistic effects of multiple contaminants and their possible biotransformation intermediates products on kinetic and microbial responses of nitrifying bacteria by feeding real wastewater matrix 5 conclusions this study investigated the chronic removal performance of cfx and sdz by enriched nitrifying sludge with stepwise increased concentrations and kinetic and microbial responses of the sludge the shift of microbial community and the key gene expression along the nitrification process the main findings of this study include 1 cfx and sdz could be efficiently removed by enriched nitrifying sludge via the cometabolism of aob with limited contributions from heterotrophic bacteria and nob 2 the apparent nitrification performance in both sbrs was not affected by cfx and sdz exposure chronic exposure to cfx up to 100 μg l led to a certain extent of stimulatory effect on aor while aor experienced a decrease due to exposure to 30 μg l sdz but recovered after adaption under exposure to 50 and 100 μg l sdz 3 the abundance of aob experienced a distinct decrease due to the chronic exposure to cfx and sdz while the expression level of amoa gene was up regulated to overcome this adverse impact thus ensuring a stable and efficient removal of both ammonium and the antibiotics declaration of competing
