13530,removal of heavy metal ions from water is being a challenge and polysulfone psf membranes have shown great potential to remove them from contaminated solutions in this work the introduction of graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets g c3n4 into psf membranes was implemented to improve the permeability and separation performance of psf membranes g c3n4 was incorporated into the membrane matrix via nonsolvent induced phase inversion method the prepared mixed matrix membranes showed enhanced performances towards water filtration the incorporation of g c3n4 into the membrane matrix caused an increase in the desired physicochemical properties like hydrophilicity and surface charge density this in turn enhanced the rejection of heavy metal ions the presence of free nh2 groups on the surface of the membrane helps in increasing the water permeability of the mixed matrix membranes at 1 bar pressure the mixed matrix membranes showed rejections higher than 95 80 and 70 for lead cadmium and arsenic respectively anti fouling properties of psf membrane were also enhanced by g c3n4 which was due to a notable increase in hydrophilicity and the formation of hydration layer on the membrane preventing interactions between membrane surface and bovine serum albumin bsa these properties could be favourable in fulfilling the need of a potential candidate for filtration of waters contaminated by toxic ions keywords g c3n4 nanosheets mixed matrix membranes toxic metal ion anti fouling properties 1 introduction nanoparticles are usually incorporated into the membrane to improve the hydrophilicity and productivity of the membranes are gaining more importance 1 the nanoparticle induced membranes have the benefit of both polymeric material and nanostructure at the same time the performance of the membranes can be improved through two types of modification internal modification and surface modification the surface modification involves enhancing the hydrophilicity by surface coating the internal modification includes the blending of the membrane with nanoparticles that increases the hydrophilicity of surfaces and membrane pores followed by the formation of the membrane 2 4 a variety of nanoparticles has been widely investigated for the modification of membranes several metal oxides and carbon based materials have been explored in the preparation of mixed matrix membranes such as fe3o4 5 al2o3 6 graphene oxide 7 al ti2o6 8 reduced graphene oxide 9 mwcnt 10 cao et al incorporated exfoliated g c3n4 nanosheets into sodium alginate for better stability due to enhanced interactions this study also explained that the lamellar structure along with the triangular pores of g c3n4 enhanced the water pathway in the membranes these properties of the membranes contributed to the increased separation efficiency of water ethanol mixtures 11 for instance li et al prepared rgo g c3n4 composites in which water permeability was increased by the honeycomb like structure of g c3n4 12 arumugham et al introduced g c3n4 in cuo nanosheets and prepared a membrane with the polyphenyl sulfone the addition of g c3n4 increased the compatibility of the nanoparticles in the membrane matrix leading to high flux and protein rejection 13 wang et al studied the effect of g c3n4 fe oh 3 on the water flux of modified membranes they noticed a flux enhancement which was explained by the uniform pore size induced by the electrostatic interactions between nanoparticles 14 it was evident from the literature that out of all the carbon materials g c3n4 is gaining more importance due to its remarkable properties like high mechanical strength surface charge hydrophilic and chemical stability moreover in practical applications the use of facial and internal modification by blending approaches to the construction of high performance membranes is of great importance it appears that g c3n4 is the best choice to modify the core structure and surface of the polymeric membrane indeed it contains free nh2 groups that make its structure easily tuneable moreover the triangular voids formed by the arrangement of sp2 hybridized c and n atoms behave as water transporting channels in the membrane matrix 15 in overall literature g c3n4 is often used for photocatalytic applications heavy metal contamination by metal ions such as cadmium arsenic lead has become a global issue due to various human activities industrialization and globalization which are conquered by industries such as metal electroplating batteries pesticides pharmaceutical and mining they constitute a serious threat to mankind as they are non biodegradable and continue to accumulate in the human body 16 17 posing serious health problems such as liver and kidney disorders neurodegenerative disorders effects on the cardiovascular system 18 19 the separation of heavy metal ions is one of the major challenges in membrane technology 20 23 to the best of our knowledge the use of g c3n4 modified polysulfone membranes for heavy metal removal and fouling mitigation has not been reported in the literature the present work focuses on the preparation of novel g c3n4 mixed matrix membranes and the performance of these membranes towards heavy metal removal and fouling mitigation as for the literature survey very limited work has been published on g c3n4 mixed matrix membranes g c3n4 was prepared by simple one pot calcination of urea and melamine the as prepared g c3n4 was used for the preparation of the mixed matrix membrane by using psf as a base polymer and by varying both in stoichiometric amounts furthermore the effect of loading of g c3n4 on various physicochemical properties of the membrane was studied by the contact angle water uptake and ion exchange capacity studies lead cadmium and arsenic were chosen as heavy metal pollutants to study the rejection performance of the g c3n4 mixed matrix membranes bovine serum albumin bsa was used as a foulant

contents which was then transferred to a crucible this mixture was heated in a muffle furnace at 500 c for 5 h yellow semi crystalline powder was obtained this powder was subjected to ball milling for 1 h 2 3 preparation of mixed matrix membranes to prepare mixed matrix membranes the dope solutions were prepared by varying the amounts of g c3n4 and psf using n methyl pyrrolidone nmp as a solvent as shown in table 1 well grounded g c3n4 was taken in a reagent bottle containing nmp this solution was sonicated for 1 h in an ultrasonicator to ensure uniform dispersion of g c3n4 in the solvent followed by the addition of psf batch wise this dope solution was stirred for 24 h for the proper blending of components of the solution the above solution was cast on a glass plate manually with spacers to maintain uniformity in the thickness of the membrane the thickness of the membrane was around 80 120 μm the casted membrane was immersed in a coagulation bath containing distilled water non solvent media and the membrane formation takes place by phase inversion process 21 the membrane so formed was transferred into the distilled water bath and kept for 24 h for mechanical stability the schematic illustration is shown in fig 1 3 characterization 3 1 characterization of g c3n4 nanosheets and mixed matrix membranes the morphology of nanosheets and membranes was analyzed by field

water flux flux and rejection of heavy metals for all the aforementioned studies a self assembled cross flow unit of effective filtration area 0 0045 m2 was used depicted in fig 2 the blend membranes were cut in required dimensions and fixed into the cell an average of 3 readings was taken to minimize the error the pure water flux studies were carried out at trans membrane pressures varying from 1

filtration unit alternate solutions of bsa and water were chosen to carry out the fouling experiments all the studies were done at 1 bar pressure primarily the pure water flux was measured as j1 for 1 h at 10 min interval the feed solution was later replaced by bsa solution 100 mg l and this was recorded as permeate flux jp followed by the washing of the membrane with warm deionized water 40 c to remove the bsa adsorbed reversible foulant on the membrane surface and low pressure for 1 h finally the pure water flux of the washed membranes j2 was noted flux recovery ratio frr was calculated using the formula 6 28 to analyze the anti fouling property of the membranes in detail the total fouling rt reversible fouling rr and irreversible fouling rir were calculated using the eq 7 9 28 6 f r

c3n4 were analyzed using xrd depicted in fig 3 a the pristine g c3n4 shows two distinct peaks at 13 24 corresponding to 100 planes for tris triazine units and 27 4 corresponding to 002 planes for the aromatic part 29 these values are in accordance with jcpds number 87 1526 29 the bet nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of g c3n4 fig 3b has a distinct hysteresis curve depicting the type ii isotherm which is a characteristic of mesoporous materials the surface area was found to be 16 649 m2 g and the mean pore diameter and pore volume were 8 4629 nm and 0 035225 cm3 g which matches well with the literature 30 dynamic light scattering dls was done to know the particle size ranging from 400 to 500 nm fig 3c furthermore to know the charge of the nanoparticle the zeta potential was done which revealed that g c3n4 possessed a charge of 27 47 0 5 mv which could impact a hydrophilic character to the membrane fig 3 d shows the fesem image of g c3n4 which reveals the sheet like agglomerated structure corresponding to the stacking of 2d g c3n4 nanosheets 4 2 morphological studies of the membrane the plane surface and cross section of the prepared membranes were observed with scanning electron microscopy fesem to examine the influence of g c3n4 on the blend membrane structure as shown in fig 4 from fig 4a to d surface fesem images suggest that the membrane surface is even rougher by integrating g c3n4 nanosheets into the membrane matrix normally the surface morphology is affected by the hydrophilicity of the additive here g c3n4 as well as the viscosity of the casting solution 31 with the increase in the g c3n4 content of the membrane matrix some spots were bright color compared to the membrane s bulk surface especially the membrane containing 7 5 g c3n4 it was assumed that the intermittent locations were the g c3n4 clusters however the standardized distribution of the spots often showed a strong dispersion of g c3n4 in the casting solution the fesem cross sectional images of the prepared mixed matrix membranes are shown in fig 4 e f g and h all the membranes show an asymmetric type of morphology the cross sectional fesem images of the membranes show three distinct layers an upper skin layer a middle layer and a bottom dense layer 32 with plain psf membrane m0 a dense bottom layer can be observed and finger like projections only appear in the middle layer the presence of hydrophilic g c3n4 in the membrane matrix provides a pathway for water to penetrate along with solvent diffusion during the membrane preparation the inverted wide finger like projections are formed in all three layers in the case of the m3 membrane microvoids are also seen which illustrates the presence of hydrophilic moieties that sequentially increase solvent nmp nonsolvent water mass transfer during the phase inversion process inside the membrane matrix 20 this is attributed to the affinity of g c3n4 to the water molecules which causes the thermodynamic instability of the membranes in water enhancing the phase inversion process the film forming capacity of the membranes depends on the viscosity of dope solutions 31 the added g c3n4 shows enhanced interaction with nmp making nmp less available for the dissolution of psf and which leads to a more viscous solution and thereby to a thinner skin layer of mmms 33 in brief the cross sectional morphology disclosed the presence of microvoids intervened by smaller voids in the m3 membrane 34 the images on the bottom surface are seen in fig 4 i j k and l for respective bare and composite membranes the number of pores on the bottom surface have increased with a rise in g c3n4 nanosheets concentration and this can be verified by wide voids found in cross sectional pictures to inquire into the changes in surface roughness of the membranes afm analysis was executed which is illustrated in fig 5 the surface roughness parameter was brought out in terms of average roughness values ra the roughness of the m0 membrane is 5 0 nm which is the lowest value among the explored membranes the roughness of the membranes rises due to the integration of g c3n4 however m1 8 8 nm and m2 9 8 nm show a slight increase in the ra values which is attributed to the increase in the compatibility between g c3n4 and polymer matrix there is a drastic increase in the surface roughness of m3 membranes which is due to the decreased compatibility between g c3n4 and polymer matrix it reduces the thermodynamic stability disturbing the penetration of nanosheets closer into the polymer matrix during the process of phase inversion this agrees well with the theory proposed by mackay et al 31 for which the radius of gyration rg of the linear polymer is lesser than the radius of the nanosheets rp in this case g c3n4 most likely affects the thermodynamic stability and viscosity of the system 4 3 physico chemical characteristics of the membranes the permeation and anti fouling properties of the membranes are greatly dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of the membrane which stresses on membrane hydrophilicity the contact angle majorly depends on the adsorption of water by surface functional groups the contact angle of m0 m1 m2 m3 are shown in table 2 the contact angle of the m0 membrane was found to be 74 5 2 whereas the addition of g c3n4 tends to decrease its value highlighting an increase in hydrophilicity from values for m1 m2 and m3 membranes 66 4 58 74 and 54 3 hydrophilicity increases with the amount of g c3n4 which could be related to proper dispersion of g c3n4 in the polymer matrix and higher surface free nh2 groups which could easily interact with water through hydrogen bonding the values of porosity and water uptake capacity are shown in table 2 the porosity of the mixed matrix membranes was slightly higher than that of the neat psf membrane the huge increase in porosity is ascribed to the formation of microvoids due to the fast penetrating of water molecules during phase inversion and also the gaps produced between the hydrophobic psf and hydrophilic g c3n4 which also contributes to the formation of a porous membrane the increase in porosity can also be attributed to the increase in hydrophilicity of the membranes water uptake capacity was greater than that of the psf membrane indeed the water uptake capacity of the mixed matrix membranes is greatly affected by the uniform dispersion of g c3n4 in the membrane matrix which greatly influences the water absorption or water holding capacity of the membranes the water uptake capacity of the mixed matrix membranes lies between 250 270 which is compatible with the contact angle values table 2 from contact angle and water uptake studies it could be concluded that the increase in the content of g c3n4 increased the hydrophilicity of the membranes the water uptake capacity of the go psf composite membrane was found to be 70 35 which could be compared with the g c3n4 psf mixed matrix membranes the surface charge density was analyzed by zeta potential and ion exchange capacity studies depicted in table 2 there is not much difference between the ion exchange capacity values of all the prepared mixed matrix membranes however they show greater ion exchange capacity than the plain psf membranes there is an increase in the free nh2 groups on the surface of the membranes which can easily undergo protonation with hcl a slight decrease in ion exchange capacity can be observed for the m3 membrane due to the agglomeration of g c3n4 at high concentrations which limits the availability of the surface ionizable this phenomenon can also explain why the membrane charge at ph 7 of the m3 membrane is notably higher 42 mv than those of the other mixed matrix membranes which are similar to that of the neat membrane m0 the more negative charge of the membranes is also attributed to the more negative charge of nanoparticles 36 4 4 performance studies of the membrane the water permeability of the membranes is determined from the slope of the evolution of pure water flux with transmembrane pressure fig 6 a the pure water flux of the bare psf membranes is the lowest the reason being its higher hydrophobicity table 2 perfect straight lines were not obtained due to the widening of pores at higher pressure moreover when g c3n4 is incorporated into the membrane matrix water flux drastically increases this occurrence can be explained by the fact that the blending of g c3n4 into the membrane matrix increases thermodynamic instability which escalates solvent non solvent exchange in coagulation bath therefore leading to emerging of porous structure 37 the increase in porosity can be due to either larger pores or an increase in the number of pores both leading to an increase in hydraulic permeability poiseuille s relation the addition of the g c3n4 can also lead to a thinner skin layer fig 3 table 2 which also induces a permeability increase even though m3 is slightly less hydrophilic than m2 it exhibits a larger water flux due to its higher hydraulic permeability highlighted by pure water flux compared with other membranes these results could be compared with those obtained with go psf membranes 33 which showed pure water flux substantially lower around 10 lmh at 4 bar the developed membranes were evaluated by measuring the rejection of heavy metals from solutions containing 10 ppm of ions rejection and flux for the three membranes are represented in figs 6b and c the rejections obtained with m1 m2 and m3 membranes are 99 70 and 80 for lead cadmium and arsenate respectively usually rejection of ions are discussed in terms of donnan exclusion considering donnan s exclusion the order of salt rejection should follow the ratio of ion valence zco ion zcounter ion defined with respect to the sign of membrane charge 38 hence the ratio zco ion zcounter ion for pb no3 2 is 1 2 and its rejection should be lower than that of sodium arsenate rejection which exhibits a ratio of 1 1 for dihydrogen arsenate or 2 1 for hydrogen arsenate for a negatively charged membrane in this study the opposite trend is observed which is inconsistent with only donnan exclusion this clearly demonstrates that donnan s exclusion alone cannot explain rejection order similarly the evolution of rejection with a membrane charge density of the various membrane cannot be fully explained by donnan exclusion since the strong increase in zeta potential between m1 m2 and m3 should lead to an increase in anion rejection whereas a strong decrease is obtained the steric hindrance also plays a role in rejection which can explain why lead ion is more rejected than cadmium whereas both exhibit the same valence indeed lead ion size 133 pm 39 40 is larger than that of cadmium 109 pm which leads to a high steric exclusion at the pore entry evolution between m1 and m2 membranes can be explained by the slight increase in negative membrane charge which can lead to an increase in anion rejection arsenate and a decrease in cation rejection lead and cadmium fig 6d however neither a steric hindrance nor electrostatic interactions can explain the evolution of rejection between m2 and m3 the strong decrease in arsenate ion for the m3 membrane tends to show that the strong increase in pore size decrease in steric hindrance is the dominant mechanism compared with electrostatic interactions however both the strong increase in pore size and negative membrane charge should have lead to a decrease of cations which is not observed in this case theoretical studies have already highlighted that dielectric exclusion can potentially have a strong impact on the performances of nanoporous membranes 41 43 although this phenomenon is rarely considered to explain the impact of synthesis conditions on filtration performances several studies have recently considered it to discuss their trends 44 47 indeed the water molecule being polar an electric field inside pores can change the spatial orientation of solvent molecules and change its structure due to interactions with a water dipole moment this spatial orientation of solvent molecules induces a decrease of the dielectric constant of the solution inside pores which induces a solvation energy barrier at the pore entry the dielectric exclusion is usually described in the literature by the born model it should be stressed that dielectric exclusion is always unfavorable to the transfer of ions square value of zi and it increases with the decrease of solvent dielectric constant inside pores compared with that of bulk 78 4 this means that this phenomenon increases rejection irrespective of the ion sign anion or cation oppositely it strongly increases with the zi value since the square of its value appears in the born model 39 hence it is completely different from electrostatic interactions donnan exclusion which are favourable or unfavorable according to the sign of ion charge for this reason it is possible to discuss some trends which are unexpected from donnan s exclusion for this reason it is possible that the increase in membrane charge and the presence of g c3n4 could induce a stronger dielectric exclusion which could explain the unexpected evolution between m2 and m3 indeed although solutions were prepared with arsenate ions arsenic v is in the form of hydrogen arsenate haso4 2 and especially dihydrogen arsenate h2aso4 at ph close to 7 the rejection of monovalent dihydrogen arsenate being less impacted than of that divalent ions by the increase of dielectric exclusion as rejection which is the result of the rejection of these two oxyanion forms 40 48 will also be less impacted this notable contribution of dielectric exclusion cannot be demonstrated but it can perhaps feed the discussion about unexpected trends which are sometimes obtained after membrane synthesis or modification it should be mentioned that adsorption can also have a non negligible impact on rejection and could perhaps contribute to unexpected trends obtained during this study indeed it is possible that the various ions were differently adsorbed onto the membrane surface leading to variations in membrane charge indeed zeta potential values were estimated with the same electrolyte kcl and if adsorption of metal ions is important the membrane charge during filtrations may notably differ from values estimated with zeta potential measurements and also differs between ions a different contribution of the adsorption phenomenon can thus lead to unusual evolutions but unfortunately it is complicated to quantify its contribution on performances without a deep specific investigation of adsorption mechanisms in any case the best membrane in terms of toxic ion removal is also the m2 membrane its performances can be compared with other carbon materials investigated in the literature for instance zhang et al prepared graphene oxide framework membranes that showed moderate rejection of 40 90 of pb cu and cd 49 deng et al modified polyethyleneimine with multi walled carbon nanotube and obtained lead and copper more than 93 of rejection 50 4 5 anti fouling studies anti fouling studies were carried out for the prepared mixed matrix membranes at 25 c with 100 ppm bsa solution and the results are provided in fig 7 due to the fouling propensity of the membrane there is a difference between flux of pure water and that of bsa solution after the membrane hydraulic washing pure water flux was restored at different levels the fouling parameters namely rt rir rr and frr characterize the overall anti fouling performance of the membranes rir is the percentage of irreversible fouling which occurs as a result of the strong interaction between the foulants and membrane surface due to the pore blocking by the foulant rr is the amount of reversible fouling for which the foulants are reversibly bound to the membrane surface but can be removed by washing with warm water the various reasons for membrane fouling are electrostatic force hydrogen bonding hydrophobic and van der waals forces 51 52 the fouling mechanism is mainly dominated by hydrophobic interaction between the membrane surface and bsa hydrophilicity plays a major role in presenting resistance against the fouling by creating a layer of hydration on the membrane surface inhibiting the interaction of bsa and the membrane surface fig 6 d 53 in any case the flux recovery ratio of blend membranes was greater than that of bare psf membrane it is evident from contact angle results table 2 that the blend membranes showed greater hydrophilicity than the m0 membrane due to the incorporation of g c3n4 it seems that the increase in g c3n4 tends to mitigate total fouling and especially irreversible fouling except for the m3 membrane that exhibits worse anti fouling propensity than the m2 membrane the morphology of the membranes also has a significant impact on anti fouling properties adhesion sites are decreased in the case of membranes with smooth surfaces bestowing enhanced anti fouling properties on the membrane because of the very high roughness value of m3 fig 5 total fouling increased which is marked by a decrease in frr compared with the m2 membrane hence among mixed matrix membranes it can be concluded that m2 membrane exhibits the best anti fouling properties which are consistent with its lower contact angle i e higher hydrophobicity and lower roughness m2 showed higher frr and lower rt rir and rr along with higher rejection of bsa attributed to the increased hydrophilicity and formation of hydration layer which prevents the direct contact of the foulants with the membrane surface and also relatively smooth surface fig 5 in comparison with m3 since m2 membrane showed the highest frr 90 and lowest fouling propensity it was subjected to a long term study to evaluate the stability of the anti fouling property depicted in fig 8 it was submitted to a total of 48 h of filtration with alternating solutions of bsa and water for one complete cycle and flux was measured at fixed intervals of 30 min the pure water flux 11 lmh was higher than that of bsa solution indicating the membrane fouling during the 16 h of exposure to bsa solution the flux was maintained at 7 lmh further the membrane was washed for 1 h with warm deionized water to remove the foulants on the surface there was very less flux declining ratio and 82 of flux recovery ratio was seen after 48 h of a single cycle it could be noted that a decrease in flux compared to the primary anti fouling studies 92 was observed from these results it could be estimated that the gradual decline in the performance of m2 with time is due to the reduction of hydrophilic groups on the surface and in the pores as well 54 to sum up the m2 membrane had a strong anti fouling performance with increased flux recovery ratios the comparison of different antifouling membranes based on polysulfone is listed in table 3 the developed g c3n4 membrane showed good performance in both flux recovery ratio frr and protein rejection up to 48 h of study which corresponds to the increased hydrophilicity caused by g c3n4 5 conclusion the g c3n4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple one pot calcination method and were confirmed by various analytical techniques these as prepared g c3n4 nanosheets were incorporated into the psf polymer matrix for the preparation of mixed matrix membranes these membranes showed higher surface roughness values than the psf membrane the physicochemical characteristics like contact angle porosity water uptake showed that the mixed matrix membranes have better capability towards water filtration the enhanced negative charge on the membrane membranes which could help in rejecting heavy metal ions showed better rejection of all the three ions lead cadmium arsenate when compared to the psf membrane these membranes showed rejections 95 for lead 80 for cadmium 70 for arsenate at 1 bar pressure also the mixed matrix membranes showed higher frr 80 90 than the plain psf membrane because of their morphology and the formation of a hydration layer induced by hydrophilic moieties which contributed to their good anti fouling propensity out of the conclusions drawn from the preliminary anti fouling studies m2 was subjected to a long term study of 48 h wherein a very slow decline in flux recovery ratio was highlighted this could make it competitive among the commercial anti fouling membranes furthermore it can be concluded that mixed matrix membranes containing g c3n4 nanosheets have a great capability of heavy metal removal and good anti fouling properties which adds to the search for efficient membranes for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest 
13530,removal of heavy metal ions from water is being a challenge and polysulfone psf membranes have shown great potential to remove them from contaminated solutions in this work the introduction of

arsenic respectively anti fouling properties of psf membrane were also enhanced by g c3n4 which was due to a notable increase in hydrophilicity and the formation of hydration layer on the membrane

varying both in stoichiometric amounts furthermore the effect of loading of g c3n4 on various physicochemical properties of the membrane was studied by the contact angle water uptake and ion exchange capacity studies lead cadmium and arsenic were chosen as heavy metal pollutants to study the rejection performance of the g c3n4 mixed matrix membranes bovine serum albumin bsa was used as a foulant

nanosheets g c3n4 was prepared through the thermal decomposition method as shown in fig 1 24 equal amounts of urea and melamine were grounded using a mortar and pestle to ensure uniform mixing of the contents which was then transferred to a crucible this mixture was heated in a muffle furnace at 500 c for 5 h yellow semi crystalline powder was obtained this powder was subjected to ball milling for 1 h 2 3 preparation of mixed matrix membranes to prepare mixed matrix membranes the dope solutions were prepared by varying the amounts of g c3n4 and psf using n methyl pyrrolidone nmp as a solvent as shown in table 1 well grounded g c3n4 was taken in a reagent bottle containing nmp this solution was sonicated for 1 h in an ultrasonicator to ensure uniform dispersion of g c3n4 in the solvent followed by the addition of psf batch wise this dope solution was stirred for 24 h for the proper blending of components of the solution the above solution was cast on a glass plate manually with spacers to maintain uniformity in the thickness of the membrane the thickness of the membrane was around 80 120 μm the casted membrane was immersed in a coagulation bath containing distilled water non solvent media and the membrane formation takes place by phase inversion process 21 the membrane so formed was transferred into the distilled water bath and kept for 24 h for mechanical stability the schematic illustration is shown in fig 1 3 characterization 3 1 characterization of g c3n4 nanosheets and mixed matrix membranes the morphology of nanosheets and membranes was analyzed by field

the surface charge of the membranes was analyzed using zeta potential analyser for membranes 3 2 performance studies of the membranes the performance of the developed membranes was assessed by pure water flux flux and rejection of heavy metals for all the aforementioned studies a self assembled cross flow unit of effective filtration area 0 0045 m2 was used depicted in fig 2 the blend membranes were cut in required dimensions and fixed into the cell an average of 3 readings was taken to minimize the error the pure water flux studies were carried out at trans membrane pressures varying from 1 to 5 bar the permeate stream was measured and the pure water flux was calculated in terms of liters per meter square per hour lm 2 h 1 27 4 j w q a δ t q is the volume of collected water in liters a

filtration unit alternate solutions of bsa and water were chosen to carry out the fouling experiments all the studies were done at 1 bar pressure primarily the pure water flux was measured as j1 for 1 h at 10 min interval the feed solution was later replaced by bsa solution 100 mg l and this was recorded as permeate flux jp followed by the washing of the membrane with warm deionized water 40 c to remove the bsa adsorbed reversible foulant on the membrane surface and low pressure for 1 h finally the pure water flux of the washed membranes j2 was noted flux recovery ratio frr was calculated using the formula 6 28 to analyze the anti fouling property of the membranes in detail the total fouling rt reversible fouling rr and irreversible fouling rir were calculated using the eq 7 9 28 6 f r

c3n4 were analyzed using xrd depicted in fig 3 a the pristine g c3n4 shows two distinct peaks at 13 24 corresponding to 100 planes for tris triazine units and 27 4 corresponding to 002 planes for the aromatic part 29 these values are in accordance with jcpds number 87 1526 29 the bet nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of g c3n4 fig 3b has a distinct hysteresis curve depicting the type ii isotherm which is a characteristic of mesoporous materials the surface area was found to be 16 649 m2 g and the mean pore diameter and pore volume were 8 4629 nm and 0 035225 cm3 g which matches well with the literature 30 dynamic light scattering dls was done to know the particle size ranging from 400 to 500 nm fig 3c furthermore to know the charge of the nanoparticle the zeta potential was done which revealed that g c3n4 possessed a charge of 27 47 0 5 mv which could impact a hydrophilic character to the membrane fig 3 d shows the fesem image of g c3n4 which reveals the sheet like agglomerated structure corresponding to the stacking of 2d g c3n4 nanosheets 4 2 morphological studies of the membrane the plane surface and cross section of the prepared membranes were observed with scanning electron microscopy fesem to examine the influence of g c3n4 on the blend membrane structure as shown in fig 4 from fig 4a to d surface fesem images suggest that the membrane surface is even rougher by integrating g c3n4 nanosheets into the membrane matrix normally the surface morphology is affected by the hydrophilicity of the additive here g c3n4 as well as the viscosity of the casting solution 31 with the increase in the g c3n4 content of the membrane matrix some spots were bright color compared to the membrane s bulk surface especially the membrane containing 7 5 g c3n4 it was assumed that the intermittent locations were the g c3n4 clusters however the standardized distribution of the spots often showed a strong dispersion of g c3n4 in the casting solution the fesem cross sectional images of the prepared mixed matrix membranes are shown in fig 4 e f g and h all the membranes show an asymmetric type of morphology the cross sectional fesem images of the membranes show three distinct layers an upper skin layer a middle layer and a bottom dense layer 32 with plain psf membrane m0 a dense bottom layer can be observed and finger like projections only appear in the middle layer the presence of hydrophilic g c3n4 in the membrane matrix provides a pathway for water to penetrate along with solvent diffusion during the membrane preparation the inverted wide finger like projections are formed in all three layers in the case of the m3 membrane microvoids are also seen which illustrates the presence of hydrophilic moieties that sequentially increase solvent nmp nonsolvent water mass transfer during the phase inversion process inside the membrane matrix 20 this is attributed to the affinity of g c3n4 to the water molecules which causes the thermodynamic instability of the membranes in water enhancing the phase inversion process the film forming capacity of the membranes depends on the viscosity of dope solutions 31 the added g c3n4 shows enhanced interaction with nmp making nmp less available for the dissolution of psf and which leads to a more viscous solution and thereby to a thinner skin layer of mmms 33 in brief the cross sectional morphology disclosed the presence of microvoids intervened by smaller voids in the m3 membrane 34 the images on the bottom surface are seen in fig 4 i j k and l for respective bare and composite membranes the number of pores on the bottom surface have increased with a rise in g c3n4 nanosheets concentration and this can be verified by wide voids found in cross sectional pictures to inquire into the changes in surface roughness of the membranes afm analysis was executed which is illustrated in fig 5 the surface roughness parameter was brought out in terms of average roughness values ra the roughness of the m0 membrane is 5 0 nm which is the lowest value among the explored membranes the roughness of the membranes rises due to the integration of g c3n4 however m1 8 8 nm and m2 9 8 nm show a slight increase in the ra values which is attributed to the increase in the compatibility between g c3n4 and polymer matrix there is a drastic increase in the surface roughness of m3 membranes which is due to the decreased compatibility between g c3n4 and polymer matrix it reduces the thermodynamic stability disturbing the penetration of nanosheets closer into the polymer matrix during the process of phase inversion this agrees well with the theory proposed by mackay et al 31 for which the radius of gyration rg of the linear polymer is lesser than the radius of the nanosheets rp in this case g c3n4 most likely affects the thermodynamic stability and viscosity of the system 4 3 physico chemical characteristics of the membranes the permeation and anti fouling properties of the membranes are greatly dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of the membrane which stresses on membrane hydrophilicity the contact angle majorly depends on the adsorption of water by surface functional groups the contact angle of m0 m1 m2 m3 are shown in table 2 the contact angle of the m0 membrane was found to be 74 5 2 whereas the addition of g c3n4 tends to decrease its value highlighting an increase in hydrophilicity from values for m1 m2 and m3 membranes 66 4 58 74 and 54 3 hydrophilicity increases with the amount of g c3n4 which could be related to proper dispersion of g c3n4 in the polymer matrix and higher surface free nh2 groups which could easily interact with water through hydrogen bonding the values of porosity and water uptake capacity are shown in table 2 the porosity of the mixed matrix membranes was slightly higher than that of the neat psf membrane the huge increase in porosity is ascribed to the formation of microvoids due to the fast penetrating of water molecules during phase inversion and also the gaps produced between the hydrophobic psf and hydrophilic g c3n4 which also contributes to the formation of a porous membrane the increase in porosity can also be attributed to the increase in hydrophilicity of the membranes water uptake capacity was greater than that of the psf membrane indeed the water uptake capacity of the mixed matrix membranes is greatly affected by the uniform dispersion of g c3n4 in the membrane matrix which greatly influences the water absorption or water holding capacity of the membranes the water uptake capacity of the mixed matrix membranes lies between 250 270 which is compatible with the contact angle values table 2 from contact angle and water uptake studies it could be concluded that the increase in the content of g c3n4 increased the hydrophilicity of the membranes the water uptake capacity of the go psf composite membrane was found to be 70 35 which could be compared with the g c3n4 psf mixed matrix membranes the surface charge density was analyzed by zeta potential and ion exchange capacity studies depicted in table 2 there is not much difference between the ion exchange capacity values of all the prepared mixed matrix membranes however they show greater ion exchange capacity than the plain psf membranes there is an increase in the free nh2 groups on the surface of the membranes which can easily undergo protonation with hcl a slight decrease in ion exchange capacity can be observed for the m3 membrane due to the agglomeration of g c3n4 at high concentrations which limits the availability of the surface ionizable this phenomenon can also explain why the membrane charge at ph 7 of the m3 membrane is notably higher 42 mv than those of the other mixed matrix membranes which are similar to that of the neat membrane m0 the more negative charge of the membranes is also attributed to the more negative charge of nanoparticles 36 4 4 performance studies of the membrane the water permeability of the membranes is determined from the slope of the evolution of pure water flux with transmembrane pressure fig 6 a the pure water flux of the bare psf membranes is the lowest the reason being its higher hydrophobicity table 2 perfect straight lines were not obtained due to the widening of pores at higher pressure moreover when g c3n4 is incorporated into the membrane matrix water flux drastically increases this occurrence can be explained by the fact that the blending of g c3n4 into the membrane matrix increases thermodynamic instability which escalates solvent non solvent exchange in coagulation bath therefore leading to emerging of porous structure 37 the increase in porosity can be due to either larger pores or an increase in the number of pores both leading to an increase in hydraulic permeability poiseuille s relation the addition of the g c3n4 can also lead to a thinner skin layer fig 3 table 2 which also induces a permeability increase even though m3 is slightly less hydrophilic than m2 it exhibits a larger water flux due to its higher hydraulic permeability highlighted by pure water flux compared with other membranes these results could be compared with those obtained with go psf membranes 33 which showed pure water flux substantially lower around 10 lmh at 4 bar the developed membranes were evaluated by measuring the rejection of heavy metals from solutions containing 10 ppm of ions rejection and flux for the three membranes are represented in figs 6b and c the rejections obtained with m1 m2 and m3 membranes are 99 70 and 80 for lead cadmium and arsenate respectively usually rejection of ions are discussed in terms of donnan exclusion considering donnan s exclusion the order of salt rejection should follow the ratio of ion valence zco ion zcounter ion defined with respect to the sign of membrane charge 38 hence the ratio zco ion zcounter ion for pb no3 2 is 1 2 and its rejection should be lower than that of sodium arsenate rejection which exhibits a ratio of 1 1 for dihydrogen arsenate or 2 1 for hydrogen arsenate for a negatively charged membrane in this study the opposite trend is observed which is inconsistent with only donnan exclusion this clearly demonstrates that donnan s exclusion alone cannot explain rejection order similarly the evolution of rejection with a membrane charge density of the various membrane cannot be fully explained by donnan exclusion since the strong increase in zeta potential between m1 m2 and m3 should lead to an increase in anion rejection whereas a strong decrease is obtained the steric hindrance also plays a role in rejection which can explain why lead ion is more rejected than cadmium whereas both exhibit the same valence indeed lead ion size 133 pm 39 40 is larger than that of cadmium 109 pm which leads to a high steric exclusion at the pore entry evolution between m1 and m2 membranes can be explained by the slight increase in negative membrane charge which can lead to an increase in anion rejection arsenate and a decrease in cation rejection lead and cadmium fig 6d however neither a steric hindrance nor electrostatic interactions can explain the evolution of rejection between m2 and m3 the strong decrease in arsenate ion for the m3 membrane tends to show that the strong increase in pore size decrease in steric hindrance is the dominant mechanism compared with electrostatic interactions however both the strong increase in pore size and negative membrane charge should have lead to a decrease of cations which is not observed in this case theoretical studies have already highlighted that dielectric exclusion can potentially have a strong impact on the performances of nanoporous membranes 41 43 although this phenomenon is rarely considered to explain the impact of synthesis conditions on filtration performances several studies have recently considered it to discuss their trends 44 47 indeed the water molecule being polar an electric field inside pores can change the spatial orientation of solvent molecules and change its structure due to interactions with a water dipole moment this spatial orientation of solvent molecules induces a decrease of the dielectric constant of the solution inside pores which induces a solvation energy barrier at the pore entry the dielectric exclusion is usually described in the literature by the born model it should be stressed that dielectric exclusion is always unfavorable to the transfer of ions square value of zi and it increases with the decrease of solvent dielectric constant inside pores compared with that of bulk 78 4 this means that this phenomenon increases rejection irrespective of the ion sign anion or cation oppositely it strongly increases with the zi value since the square of its value appears in the born model 39 hence it is completely different from electrostatic interactions donnan exclusion which are favourable or unfavorable according to the sign of ion charge for this reason it is possible to discuss some trends which are unexpected from donnan s exclusion for this reason it is possible that the increase in membrane charge and the presence of g c3n4 could induce a stronger dielectric exclusion which could explain the unexpected evolution between m2 and m3 indeed although solutions were prepared with arsenate ions arsenic v is in the form of hydrogen arsenate haso4 2 and especially dihydrogen arsenate h2aso4 at ph close to 7 the rejection of monovalent dihydrogen arsenate being less impacted than of that divalent ions by the increase of dielectric exclusion as rejection which is the result of the rejection of these two oxyanion forms 40 48 will also be less impacted this notable contribution of dielectric exclusion cannot be demonstrated but it can perhaps feed the discussion about unexpected trends which are sometimes obtained after membrane synthesis or modification it should be mentioned that adsorption can also have a non negligible impact on rejection and could perhaps contribute to unexpected trends obtained during this study indeed it is possible that the various ions were differently adsorbed onto the membrane surface leading to variations in membrane charge indeed zeta potential values were estimated with the same electrolyte kcl and if adsorption of metal ions is important the membrane charge during filtrations may notably differ from values estimated with zeta potential measurements and also differs between ions a different contribution of the adsorption phenomenon can thus lead to unusual evolutions but unfortunately it is complicated to quantify its contribution on performances without a deep specific investigation of adsorption mechanisms in any case the best membrane in terms of toxic ion removal is also the m2 membrane its performances can be compared with other carbon materials investigated in the literature for instance zhang et al prepared graphene oxide framework membranes that showed moderate rejection of 40 90 of pb cu and cd 49 deng et al modified polyethyleneimine with multi walled carbon nanotube and obtained lead and copper more than 93 of rejection 50 4 5 anti fouling studies anti fouling studies were carried out for the prepared mixed matrix membranes at 25 c with 100 ppm bsa solution and the results are provided in fig 7 due to the fouling propensity of the membrane there is a difference between flux of pure water and that of bsa solution after the membrane hydraulic washing pure water flux was restored at different levels the fouling parameters namely rt rir rr and frr characterize the overall anti fouling performance of the membranes rir is the percentage of irreversible fouling which occurs as a result of the strong interaction between the foulants and membrane surface due to the pore blocking by the foulant rr is the amount of reversible fouling for which the foulants are reversibly bound to the membrane surface but can be removed by washing with warm water the various reasons for membrane fouling are electrostatic force hydrogen bonding hydrophobic and van der waals forces 51 52 the fouling mechanism is mainly dominated by hydrophobic interaction between the membrane surface and bsa hydrophilicity plays a major role in presenting resistance against the fouling by creating a layer of hydration on the membrane surface inhibiting the interaction of bsa and the membrane surface fig 6 d 53 in any case the flux recovery ratio of blend membranes was greater than that of bare psf membrane it is evident from contact angle results table 2 that the blend membranes showed greater hydrophilicity than the m0 membrane due to the incorporation of g c3n4 it seems that the increase in g c3n4 tends to mitigate total fouling and especially irreversible fouling except for the m3 membrane that exhibits worse anti fouling propensity than the m2 membrane the morphology of the membranes also has a significant impact on anti fouling properties adhesion sites are decreased in the case of membranes with smooth surfaces bestowing enhanced anti fouling properties on the membrane because of the very high roughness value of m3 fig 5 total fouling increased which is marked by a decrease in frr compared with the m2 membrane hence among mixed matrix membranes it can be concluded that m2 membrane exhibits the best anti fouling properties which are consistent with its lower contact angle i e higher hydrophobicity and lower roughness m2 showed higher frr and lower rt rir and rr along with higher rejection of bsa attributed to the increased hydrophilicity and formation of hydration layer which prevents the direct contact of the foulants with the membrane surface and also relatively smooth surface fig 5 in comparison with m3 since m2 membrane showed the highest frr 90 and lowest fouling propensity it was subjected to a long term study to evaluate the stability of the anti fouling property depicted in fig 8 it was submitted to a total of 48 h of filtration with alternating solutions of bsa and water for one complete cycle and flux was measured at fixed intervals of 30 min the pure water flux 11 lmh was higher than that of bsa solution indicating the membrane fouling during the 16 h of exposure to bsa solution the flux was maintained at 7 lmh further the membrane was washed for 1 h with warm deionized water to remove the foulants on the surface there was very less flux declining ratio and 82 of flux recovery ratio was seen after 48 h of a single cycle it could be noted that a decrease in flux compared to the primary anti fouling studies 92 was observed from these results it could be estimated that the gradual decline in the performance of m2 with time is due to the reduction of hydrophilic groups on the surface and in the pores as well 54 to sum up the m2 membrane had a strong anti fouling performance with increased flux recovery ratios the comparison of different antifouling membranes based on polysulfone is listed in table 3 the developed g c3n4 membrane showed good performance in both flux recovery ratio frr and protein rejection up to 48 h of study which corresponds to the increased hydrophilicity caused by g c3n4 5 conclusion the g c3n4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple one pot calcination method and were confirmed by various analytical techniques these as prepared g c3n4 nanosheets were incorporated into the psf polymer matrix for the preparation of mixed matrix membranes these membranes showed higher surface roughness values than the psf membrane the physicochemical characteristics like contact angle porosity water uptake showed that the mixed matrix membranes have better capability towards water filtration the enhanced negative charge on the membrane membranes which could help in rejecting heavy metal ions showed better rejection of all the three ions lead cadmium arsenate when compared to the psf membrane these membranes showed rejections 95 for lead 80 for cadmium 70 for arsenate at 1 bar pressure also the mixed matrix membranes showed higher frr 80 90 than the plain psf membrane because of their morphology and the formation of a hydration layer induced by hydrophilic moieties which contributed to their good anti fouling propensity out of the conclusions drawn from the preliminary anti fouling studies m2 was subjected to a long term study of 48 h wherein a very slow decline in flux recovery ratio was highlighted this could make it competitive among the commercial anti fouling membranes furthermore it can be concluded that mixed matrix membranes containing g c3n4 nanosheets have a great capability of heavy metal removal and good anti fouling properties which adds to the search for efficient membranes for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest 
13531,the emergence of endocrine disrupting chemicals edc in water and wastewater systems has high risk implications for the environment this manuscript discusses the treatment strategies for the removal of edc in water and wastewater systems the reviewed treatment outlines for edc removal are classified into physical biological and chemical treatments the application of edc treatments is discussed based on the removal and degradation process to eliminate the edc compounds interestingly the physical treatment of membrane filtration processes has been an efficient method for edc removal without using chemical disinfection in a treatment system nevertheless like other edc treatment methods the membrane filtrations are not able to remove emerging contaminants completely thus the overall factor of limitations and challenges in edc treatment methods such as solubility hydrophilicity degradability and polarity are discussed as to understand the applicability of the treatment techniques from the degradation pathways and the by products produced the integration treatment strategies through alternative approaches such as sequential and hybrid treatments that enhanced the considerable removal of edc are rely on the sample characteristics therefore this article gathered each treatment approach s effectiveness and limitations providing a potential outlook of edc

keywords endocrine disrupting chemicals emerging contaminants molecules removal treatment persistence 1 introduction during this decade increased awareness of the risks posed by emerging contaminants to human health has raised concerns for water quality improvement many researchers have focused on exploring treatments for removing emerging contaminants 1 2 at present endocrine disrupting chemicals edc are emerging contaminants that have continuously elicited interest in water and wastewater treatment studies 2 3 such interest is primarily due to the diverse threats that edc can pose to the environment and living organisms 4 as reported by the world health organization who and the united nations environment program unep in 2013 edc can induce endocrine disorders among wildlife and humans 5 moreover edc is believed to cause neurological disorders cardiovascular diseases various types of cancer and human reproductive system problems 6 li et al 6 asserted that strong evidence is available for the impact of edc exposure on human health edc refers to a mixture of chemical agents that interfere with human body systems processes including the synthesis secretion transport metabolism and binding action of natural blood borne hormones 7 they work as agents of functional changes that can disrupt the control system and chemical release of human hormones 8 the disruptor chemicals of the endocrine system originate from natural and synthetic sources natural edc sources which occur in living organisms are classified into groups of estrogens androgens progestogens and phytoestrogens as illustrated in fig 1 9 meanwhile synthetic edc is divided into six groups phthalates pesticides phenolic compounds polyhalogenated compounds drugs and pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps 10 estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 ethinylestradiol ee2 estriol e3 bisphenol a bpa nonylphenol np nonylphenol ethoxylates npneo octylphenol and triclosan are among the most common edc that has been investigated 11 14 most edc emergence is initiated from various manufacturing usage disposal and discharge of chemicals and pharmaceutical products which finally significantly impact the environment and living organism 4 15 there are diverse potential sources that lead to edc contaminations in the environment edc s widespread exposure mainly originates from wastewater discharge from household sewerage channel industrial operation medical waste system agricultural processing waste and permanent waste disposal such as landfill and dumpsite 16 this concentrated edc is entered different medium and area routes that used to be the discharge control system such as wastewater treatment facilities in particular the edc contaminants in wastewater effluent will follow a wastewater treatment system or open flow of runoff system where the effluent directly entered the groundwater and surface waterbody as the report by who in 2015 17 the extent of edc contamination exposure varies considerably among the species individual and localities depending on the type of medium exposure such as air soil water food and other types of consumer products thus the effects of edc exposure to the environments have various outcomes to the living species and habitats that dependent on sources intake the effects of edc have spread diversely and are mostly observed in fish birds mammals reptiles agricultural plants and humans low concentrations ng l of edc in surface water can alter the gender of some fish species and disrupt their reproductive system 18 19 meanwhile the impacts of edc on wildlife are reproductive dysfunctions egg thinning and delays of sexual maturation which affect the growth factors and populations of wildlife 20 in agricultural plants the exposure of estrogen 17β estradiol e2 and androstenedione has caused the removal of atmospheric co2 inhibited the algal growth and increasing the rehydration of plants 21 the human body s intake of edc through consumption inhalation and exposure also significantly affects body systems causing major damage in the central nervous system i e nonreproductive neural and neurogenesis processes and the reproductive system 22 moreover the effects of edc on the human reproductive system can include ovulation disorders endometriosis breast cancer uterine fibroids and pregnancy and fertility problems 23 24 edc has also been examined to determine if it can cause other health problems such as cardiovascular diseases obesity early puberty and mental retardation 25 the effects of edc on living organisms and human health are summarized in table 1 considering the various harmful effects of edc the remediation of water and wastewater systems involves various treatment methods such as biological physical and chemical treatments as illustrated in fig 2 the application of biological treatments has successfully degraded a large proportion of edc molecules however the biological degradation process fails to eliminate nonorganic edc molecules 33 comparatively physical treatment methods can remove recalcitrant nonorganic molecules several membrane filtration treatment methods such as ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have been utilized in edc removal 34 35 however membrane filtration processes are commonly known to suffer from fouling problems due to pore blockage 36 chemical treatment methods such as the advanced oxidation process aop can also be used for edc removal however the aop treatment method can potentially form by product residuals these limitations are attributed to the challenges posed by the biological persistence and also physical chemical characteristics of the targeted compounds such as hydrophilicity ph acid solubility pka water partition coefficient kow degradability and polarity of edc 37 38 therefore this article is aimed to evaluate the treatment efficiencies and strategies for edc removal 2 physical treatments 2 1 sedimentation sedimentation refers to the process of particle settlement under the effect of gravity this technique is commonly applied during the primary treatment stage of sewage treatment plants stps and wastewater treatment plants wwtps prior to the filtration and disinfection processes 39 at present the sedimentation method is ineffective in eliminating edc behera et al 40 reported that the removal efficiency for diclofenac and e3 estriol using the sedimentation method is less than 28 moreover significant removals have not been reported for estrone ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole by using the sedimentation method 41 42 in particular the ineffectiveness of the sedimentation method implies the challenges posed by contaminants in water with high hydrophilicity and solubility 43 the types of edc such as hormone e g estriol ppcps e g ibuprofen and pesticides have different physical chemical properties as reported by kim et al 44 mechanistic prediction model for compounds removal is based on the compounds molecular weight acid solubility pka and octanol water partition properties kwo pka coefficient indicates the compound charge at a given ph in contrast kow coefficient is the ratio of the concentration of a compound in two phases of a mixture of two immiscible solvents in general the high kow 2 value indicates the potential of the edc compounds that could accumulate in sediments relatively moderate and high removal efficiency might be observed for the compounds with lower pka and kow nevertheless due to the diverse physical chemical and molecular properties none of the treatment methods effectively removes all types of edc therefore edc treatment methods need to be assessed on each compound basis besides such difficulty requires an advanced secondary treatment to remove the remaining proportion of edc entirely in the aqueous phase post sedimentation process in this condition the high edc solubility compounds require a hydrophobic interaction treatment medium for removal lin et al 45 proposed advanced treatments such as granular activated carbon gac adsorption combined with sedimentation and filtration which were the major removal mechanisms in advanced water treatment plants wtps ppcps in raw water are completely removed through the combination of treatments in advanced wtps 45 therefore the physical and chemical properties such as the kow value is a good indicator to evaluate the suitable edc removal interaction evidently sedimentation treatment alone is insufficient for efficiently removing edc 2 2 adsorption 2 2 1 activated carbon ac adsorption ac adsorption processes by using gac and powder activated carbon pac have been extensively used in water and wastewater treatments this method has elicited considerable attention due to its simple operation absorbent regeneration potential and suitability for batch and continuous processes 46 in general the adsorption processes are applied at the early filtration stage of the water and wastewater treatment process the performance of ac adsorption to remove edc compounds depend on the adsorbent dose and contact time and the physical and chemical properties of the target compounds 47 the ac removes the water s absorbance through the hydrophobic interactions between the compound and the absorbent surface the water system that contains a dissolved organic compound is required to be removed prior to adsorption predominately the removal of the compounds before adsorption will provide longer periods between regenerations 48 the reduction in dissolved compounds reduces the absorbent loading and probably avoids interference during the adsorption process 49 moreover as reported by kennedy et al 50 in a full and pilot scale of organic micropollutants by ac adsorption an increase in background dissolved organic matter resulted in more and earlier micropollutants breakthrough in terms of characteristics the well developed pore structure and surface chemistry properties of ac contribute to its specific interactions with edc adsorbed compounds 16 vidal et al 51 reported that incorporating sulfur into the carbon structure results in a positive effect on dynamic adsorption capacity by increasing the total amount of adsorbed trimethoprim from 195 mg g to 240 mg g in addition the adequate contact time of adsorption and the dosage of ac affect the performance of edc removal 52 as demonstrated by noutsopoulus et al 53 high removal of triclosan 84 naproxen 91 ibuprofen 95 and ketoprofen 93 compounds was recorded at a high ac dose of 100 000 μg l 1 at 60 min contact time in practice ac adsorption treatment is highly effective in removing all target chemicals as studied by jiang et al 54 the powdered ac recorded the highest adsorption capacity 132 73 mg g compared to other carbon nanotubes 103 81 mg g graphene oxide 77 86 mg g and biochar 9 19 mg g adsorbents for estrogen removal besides fu et al 55 reported the high hydrophobicity of ppcps contaminants could be effectively eliminated 75 by incorporation with secondary filtration in their study acebutolol diazepam and diltiazem compounds were removed entirely from the treatment process moreover rao et al 56 studied the removal of ppcps residues from treated effluents and further emphasized the capability of ac adsorption treatments their results demonstrated that 90 98 of ppcps were removed from low concentration compounds exhibiting an evident relationship of dose response between compound concentration and adsorbent dosage a long contact time can significantly increase compound removal 56 nevertheless removal efficiency for edc varies depending on the compound type several compounds such as carbamazepine and propranolol have exhibited relatively low removal in this regard understanding the specific properties of targeted compound conditions should be emphasized to achieve optimum adsorbent capability 2 2 2 carbon nanotubes cnt since their discovery cnts have received considerable attention in various research areas the unique characteristics of the mechanical and electronic properties of multi walled cnts mwcnts have broadened their practical applications 57 to date cnts have received extensive research attention as a new type of adsorbents because of their potential applications in removing various natural and synthetic edc 58 in contrast with ac adsorbents cnt structures contain rolled graphite sheet layers they are called single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts when they have a single rolled graphite sheet layer and mwcnts when they have double or multiple rolled graphite sheet layers 59 moreover cnt adsorption properties considerably differ from ac properties regardless of the pore properties and surface areas the overall adsorption properties of cnts depend on the adsorption site purity and surface functional groups of nanometer thick layered carbon 60 moreover process parameters which include ph ionic strength initial solute concentration and temperature are major factors that affect the sorption rate of edc 61 the application of cnts as absorbent exhibit effective adsorption capacities in removing a wide range of edc such as bpa 92 mg g e2 27 2 mg g diuron 40 37 mg g and tetracycline 175 mg g 58 62 65 the mechanisms of the donor acceptor system π π bond formed between edc and cnts have been suggested to be significant forces that affect the adsorption performance of cnts 58 in addition significant edc adsorption is attributed to the larger van der waals interactions and multilayer adsorption properties of mwcnts 66 comparatively the compactness of an swcnt bundle eliminates groove areas and interstitial spaces reducing adsorption capability 54 in this regard the compactness of the bundles requires the rapid dispersion of particles to provide additional adsorption sites for swcnts 60 the modification of surface functional groups can further enhance the adsorption capability of swcnts 67 however although the adsorbents of mwcnts and swcnts have demonstrated adequate performance investigations on synthetic water samples remain limited 68 in contrast with ac adsorbents applying cnts to real treatment plants has not been well established in addition the toxic effects of cnt adsorbents are still debatable 69 in this regard additional research on real water systems and investigations on the effects of cnts is required to improve the understanding of cnt adsorbents application to edc removal 2 2 3 graphene oxide go nanosheets adsorption go nanosheets are new promising adsorbents for water contaminants because of their excellent hydrophilicity properties high surface area and abundant surface oxygen containing groups 70 the use of go nanosheets as absorbents has demonstrated outstanding removal performance for various contaminants including divalent metal ions aromatic organic compounds and various dyes from aqueous solutions 71 in addition contaminants are easily and rapidly extracted from water through the magnetic attraction of the hybrid go nanosheet adsorbents 71 interestingly jiang et al 72 reported the strong potential of go nanosheet adsorbents with a maximum adsorption capacity qm of 149 4 mg g to remove ee2 hormones in an aqueous solution the exothermic and spontaneous adsorption processes were claimed among the highest ee2 adsorption values compared with other adsorbents 73 nevertheless the investigation of go nanosheet absorbents for edc removal in actual water and wastewater systems remains limited at present and performance is unknown therefore this significant research finding can be the basis for further investigations in the future 2 2 4 cellulose adsorption cellulose is considered one of the most promising areas of scientific and technological development in the field of plant products interestingly cellulose based adsorbents have made significant contributions compared with other available synthetic material adsorbents for water treatment 74 however native cellulose is less effective in eliminating edc in aqueous solutions and having an undesirable adsorbent capacity for emerging compounds due to the low reproducibility of the process and the adsorbate s full capacity 74 75 to date various modified cellulose based adsorbent methods have been investigated for water treatment applications in particular the chemical modification of cellulose based adsorbents has been found to improve the adsorption capacity of cellulose adsorbents for edc removal 76 as reported by hu et al 77 cellulose grafting modification that utilizes quaternary ammonium salt has achieved considerable improvement in removing amoxicillin with a maximum adsorption capacity of 183 14 mg g moreover the findings that recorded superior removal performance are the adsorption capacities qm of 1072 86 mg g and 786 18 mg g for tetracycline and sulfamethazine respectively by using a sustainable α cellulose absorbent activated by koh 78 consequently the effectiveness of cellulose based adsorbents indicates the importance of using natural polymers as low cost sustainable and effective adsorbents for removing edc in water and wastewater systems nevertheless although many studies have investigated cellulose based adsorbents in water treatment most of these studies have focused on general water contaminants research on the application of cellulose based adsorbents to edc removal is still emerging further exploration and utilization of innovative methods are required to develop efficient cellulose based adsorbents for edc removal 2 3 membrane filtration 2 3 1 ro ro is a membrane filtration method that has been effectively used for the removal of dissolved micropollutants from drinking water systems 79 in the process dissolved contaminants are mainly rejected through the small molecular weight cut off mwco and membrane pore sizes and the electrostatic charge s repulsion between the dissolved contaminants and the membrane 80 besides the contaminants are effectively separated at low pka and kow value 2 of compound properties and at low solvent permeability of ro treatment 81 predominately thin film composite membrane tfc is the most outstanding membrane that provides significant selectivity compaction resistance and chemical stability in ro treatment compare to other membrane polymers such as polyamide polybenzimidazoline and poly piperazine amide 82 as reported by kassim et al 83 tfc membrane was fabricated from a thin layer of hybrid membrane formulated from a blend of polyvinyl alcohol pva chitosan and cross linked with tetraethylorthosilicate teos which was layered on the polysulfone psf membrane besides the tfc membrane are being further chemically modified to improve its rejection capacity for edc removal through graft polymerization and crosslinking modification 84 the significant characteristic of tfc that shows membrane performance has extensively attracted its application in ro treatment in general ro membrane filtration has been extensively used to separate edc compounds in wtps 85 in particular emerging compounds such as ppcps pesticides and bpas are effectively separated via ro membrane filtration 86 wang et al 87 found that the overall removal efficiency in the final treated water is greater than 95 at concentrations lower than 10 μg l for most ppcps compounds in addition katibi et al 36 reported that nearly complete rejection 98 was achieved for bpa separation with the application of polyamide based ro membranes nevertheless in contrast with other membrane filtration approaches e g nf and uf concentrates brine from ro treatment are primarily discharged to the surface water these ro concentrates are almost 20 of the influent concentration of rejected contaminants 88 thus one challenge in ro is the management of brine generated from the filtration process that exerts harmful effects on the environment predominately the brine concentration is vary depending on feed water quality effluent quality type of treatment and the nature of chemicals used 89 in current findings the effort of providing the environmentally friendly of brine treatment are still limited to be implemented although aops have been the most widely investigated method for brine treatment the energy intensive and high cost in a single treatment have limited its application interestingly xiang et al 90 has reviewed and proposed treatment options for concentrates produced by ro membrane processes and a hybrid treatment approach was recommended as a solution the proposed integrated hybrid are comprising fo pre coagulation ao and post biological treatment as a better option for brine treatment at lower cost and energy in the first stage the post treatment for the ro brine compound is to separate the dissolved compound from the concentrated brine the dissolved organic matter except for hydrophobic brine is removed using different separation processes such as forward osmosis and coagulation then the oxidation method is used to eliminate the concentrated hydrophobic compound separated at the early stage finally as a supplementary approach the post biological treatment provides an efficient degradation of the hydrophilic intermediates produced at the secondary stage eliminating the brine contamination from the ro water treatment process this hybrid approached showing significant potential in improving the operation cost and usage of energy in the treatment system however this significant approached are very depending on the ro brine characteristics in selecting the material and method of the treatment process 2 3 2 nanofiltration the nf membrane method has been recognized as a promising treatment method for micropollutants such as hormones and pharmaceutical contaminants in water and wastewater system 50 96 in principle nf membranes function with water pressure forced through nano sized pores between 0 2 nm and 0 4 nm and contaminants are adsorbed on the membrane via charge and size interactions 97 98 in addition nf membranes exhibit charge selectivity for dissolved components 99 monovalent ions and water can permeate whereas divalent and multivalent ions are retained 100 in practice the performance of nf membrane treatment is generally known to achieve high quality and produce effluents with low organic concentrations moreover the removal of microbes and viruses does not require adding chemical disinfectants 6 41 however liu et al 41 reported that the variety of membrane adsorbent types membrane supports such as polysulfone ceramic acetate polyacrylonitrile and polyethersulfone and the different size exclusion and charge repulsion properties of various edc compounds can change the removal range 10 99 9 consequently understanding the nf membrane mechanisms involved in rejecting target contaminant compounds is important semiao et al 96 found that the pore radius of the active layer is a determining factor for the removal of adsorbing contaminants i e estrone and estradiol in nf membranes semiao et al 96 added that a combination of partitioning effects and internal surface area access plays a role in the adsorption and retention of hormones i e estrone and estradiol by nf membranes in addition semiao et al 101 suggested that convection and diffusion are adequate transport modes for adsorbing hormones i e estrone and estradiol of nf membranes with convection mechanisms significantly contributing to the transport of hormones at pressures higher than 11 bar in this regard the hormone removal mechanisms that use nf membranes have been investigated extensively nevertheless many removal mechanisms for various contaminant types remain unknown numerous edc contaminants in water are still difficult to remove using single treatment methods in the actual applications of nf membranes to wtps multiple or hybrid treatments have been proposed to overcome the weaknesses of nf membranes therefore nf membranes are commonly combined with aop and concentrated residuals require further treatment 50 2 3 3 ultrafiltration uf uf is a low pressure cross flow membrane separation process with pore sizes ranging from 0 01 μm to 0 1 μm 91 uf membranes are effective in eliminating macromolecules and particles but their effectiveness is highly dependent on the type of material that constitutes the membrane 92 uf membranes have elicited considerable attention due to their extensive applications to advanced secondary effluent treatment however the application of uf membranes to the removal of edc is less effective uf membranes have been reported to reject extremely few target edc compounds compared with the nf and ro methods 93 a comparative review of patel et al 49 concluded that the removal of selected pharmaceuticals e g amoxicillin naproxen metoprolol and phenacetin via uf is moderately successful compared with nf processes in addition ojajuni et al 94 found that hydrophobic adsorption and size exclusion are the dominant mechanisms that retain edc on nf membranes meanwhile uf membranes retain typically hydrophobic edc consequently uf is rarely used as a single treatment for the removal of edc its limited use is attributed to the fact that the mwco range 10 100 kda of uf membranes is higher compared with the molecular weight 1 kda of most micropollutants 95 meanwhile huang et al 96 studied the ultrafiltration process on effluents through 1 kda cross flow into two phases colloidal phase 0 45 μm 1 kda and soluble phase 1 kda they compared the estrogenic activity with the other processes which are coagulation sedimentation cs gac adsorption magnetic ion exchange resin ndmp and ozone processes as shown in fig 3 the edc with lower kow values has higher removal activity by ndmp while the ozone process successfully removes both colloidal and soluble phases edc therefore the colloid bound edc has a good performance which suggested that the combination of ndmp and ozonation processes achieved a higher reducing estrogenic activity with satisfied the predicted no effect concentration 97 98 in this regard although uf allows the passage of low molecular weight organic solutes through its membrane it can be used as a pre treatment for ro because it can remove high concentred effluent from passed ro membrane sun et al 99 reported that compounds larger than pore is rejected by membrane surface and remain on the feed or concentrate side meanwhile the smaller compounds than the pore can pass through the membrane to filtrate the compounds with a high fouling tendency leachate effluents to ro membranes 99 100 2 4 ultrasonication us us is an advanced treatment process for removing low concentration ng l to μg l and complex contaminants in wastewater systems 101 102 it is fast clean and related to the wave degradation process which does not produce secondary products 101 in accordance with chadi et al 103 the wave degradation process of us treatment operates on the basis of the nucleation growth collapse of cavitation bubbles in water due to the high pressure and temperature caused by ultrasound waves complex contaminants exposed to ultrasound waves will undergo thermal and chemical reactions that promote the degradation of solutes in gaseous and aqueous solutions 104 in general the removal of edc via us treatment has achieved efficient performance for example im et al 105 found that the degradation of ppcps compounds acetaminophen and naproxen via us treatment demonstrated high removal efficiency for naproxen 99 and acetaminophen 86 1 at 1000 khz nevertheless naddeo et al 106 indicated that the speciﬁc removal rate depends on the chemical structure of the analyzed compound at a treatment time of 180 min triclosan is nearly completely degraded 95 however other pharmaceuticals such as erythromycin and iopromide are only partially removed 50 using the same ultrasound power at the same frequency in particular the degradation and removal of edc via us treatment are influenced by several factors chu et al 107 found that the removal efficiency of edc varies and is influenced by the following i water quality and sonication conditions ph temperature background ions promoters us frequency power and reactor type ii catalysts non carbon based and carbon based catalysts and iii compound properties to maximize the effectiveness of edc degradation through us treatment a comprehensive assessment is necessary to establish standard conditions for each environmental matrix thus the evaluation of us treatment for various types of water and wastewater sources should be explored 3 biological treatment 3 1 biological active carbon bac bac filtration is a combination of gac adsorbents under cover of a biofilm in principle bac treatments are dominated by adsorption and microbial degradation mechanisms 108 under this dual mechanism contaminants and dissolved oxygen in the treated solution interact with granular activated particles and microorganisms 109 in practice the combination of this dual mechanism process has been found to remove low level edc successfully during the treatment of drinking water 49 li et al 110 determined that the presence of a readily biodegradable carbon source is beneficial for e2 removal in a bac reactor and an e2 removal ratio higher than 99 was maintained regardless of the primary carbon source type as shown in fig 4 in particular bac filtration was implemented as a complementary treatment for solutions with low level concentrations chuang et al 111 found that treatment via bac filtration after ozonation can reduce the concentrations of most remaining estrogenic compounds by up to 95 consequently bac filtration is likely to be used as a tertiary treatment process 112 moreover the combination of advanced treatments with bac filtration under recycled carbon can provide considerable reductions in the capital costs of operation 113 tras 3 2 biological nitrification and denitrification bnd bnd is a biological process of oxidation and reduction that supports the high removal of organics through heterotrophic and slow growing nitrifying microorganisms 114 at present bnd treatments have been applied as secondary treatments after performing other advanced biological treatments such as the application of mbrs or anaerobic aerobic treatment systems 115 under this type of treatment edc removal performance is largely effective for estrogenic and several pharmaceutical compounds ting et al 116 reported that secondary activated sludge treatment followed by nitrification denitrification effectively stopped more than 95 of estrogenic activities however removal performance for other edc compounds such as carbamazepine diclofenac cloﬁbricacid gemfibrozil erythromycin and pesticides atrazine and fenoprop exhibited lower efﬁciency 117 in this regard the performance of a bnd treatment alone is less effective compared with dual or hybrid treatment processes wigginton et al 118 indicated that the major differences in ammonia oxidizing and nitrous oxide reducing community composition and structure between centralized and decentralized bnd wastewater treatment systems therefore the challenge posed by the bnd process can be effectively managed by combining it with other advanced biological treatments 3 3 microalgae at present microalgae based wastewater treatments have received considerable attention for removing edc effluents because they provide high quality treated efﬂuents 33 119 120 moreover microalgae treatments are considered economical practices due to the multiple uses of microalgae such as in pollutant removal and energy resources 119 young et al 121 reported that shallow raceway reactors produce high rate algal and consume oxygen via microalgal photosynthesis thus microalgae based treatment systems do not require external oxygen aeration in the system 122 in practice microalgae based treatments have been proven to remove edcs effectively from effluents through evaporation photodegradation and biodegradation mechanisms 33 wang et al 120 evaluated algae mediated biotransformation as possible mechanisms for removing 17α ethinylestradiol 75 3 removal and 17β estradiol 95 removal in addition ruksrithong et al 119 proved that biodegradation and adsorption were the predominant mechanisms for removing e1 and e2 consequently the effectiveness of microalgae based biodegradation has successfully eliminated most estrogenic and pharmaceutical effluents in wastewater systems nevertheless the removal performance for pesticide compounds is relatively low 32 89 compared with other edc compounds 123 in this regard the culture and growth of microorganisms can be further examined to understand the effectiveness of microalgae in removing pesticides in particular the integrated biological treatment process with microalgae is among the potential options for further improving performance 3 4 fungi the fungal treatment method utilizes the enzymatic biodegradation of micropollutants that have been alternatively used in edc removal the capability of fungi to degrade edcs in synthetic media and real wastewater has been widely explored among conventional methods used in practice fungal treatments can be considered efficient biological treatments for removing pharmaceutical compounds 37 naghdi et al 124 reviewed that literature found the stable fungal reactor requires systematic investigation on the contribution of biosorption and biodegradation during removal of phacs and micropollutants 125 in addition mir tutusaus et al 126 found that a fungal operation successfully removed analgesics and anti inflammatories and even eliminated the most recalcitrant pharmaceutical families such as antibiotics and psychiatric drugs from wastewater in practice the degradation efficiency of fungal treatments is dependent on several factors such as sterilization processes fungal nutrient additions and aeration rates 127 moreover the wastewater type can affect the survival of fungi during the treatment process highly concentrated wastewater can reduce the number of surviving fungi due to bacterial competition therefore the application of fungal biological treatments is reliable for secondary treatment or post treatment processes the pretreated effluents obtained using physical methods i e ro and coagulation flocculation are the most suitable for the fungal treatment process 126 3 5 biosorption el naggar et al 128 described biosorption as a dual mechanism i e bio oxidation and sorption process that occurs when microorganisms are immobilized onto an adsorbent in practice the removal of edcs using biosorption treatments is effective for highly hydrophobic compounds 138 dhangar et al 86 reviewed the removal of 17β estradiol 17α acetate pentachlorophenol 4tert octylphenol and triclosan achieved using a biosorption treatment process similar observations indicated that the soluble concentrations of target compounds decreased rapidly for selected microconstituents 129 in particular soluble or hydrophobic edc compounds are primarily targeted to be removed using biosorption treatments nevertheless in slow decrement processes most extremely hydrophobic compounds are also removed by a biodegradation mechanism the theory of the biosorption process in wastewater treatment can be deeply investigated using sufficient isotherm data mass transfer coefficients biological growth and destruction activity values estimated from independent measurements 130 131 therefore the efficiency of biosorption treatments in removing edcs should be compared with other biological treatments in addition regardless of hydrophobic properties the efficiency of removing edcs using biosorption treatments can be further enhanced via dual or hybrid treatment processes 3 6 membrane bioreactors mbrs the use of mbrs is a superior biological treatment method that has elicited substantial attention due to its technical innovations and high quality treated effluents compared with other conventional biological treatments i e activated sludge treatment 132 133 in particular the efficiency of mbrs is attributed to the retention of sludge on the membrane surface which promotes extensive microbial degradation and physical retention of all molecules 134 in accordance with hai et al 133 the effectiveness of mbr treatment is dependent on sludge age concentration the existence of anoxic and anaerobic compartments wastewater composition operating temperature ph and conductivity factors for example park et al 135 reported that considering the slow degradation of pharmaceuticals removal by using mbrs is better due to the relatively old ages of sludge leading to the development of distinct microbial communities in mbrs compared with that in activated sludge plants in addition arca ramos et al 136 determined that one stage and two stages enzymatic mbr is performed for the removal of micropollutants from secondary effluents in practice mbr treatments have demonstrated effective performance for the removal of edcs approximately 81 99 of various types of edc compounds e g pharmaceuticals pesticides and phenolic and estrogenic hormones have been removed via mbr treatment 117 132 137 in addition several ppcps such as salicylic acid and propylparaben have been eliminated 100 removal using mbr treatment nevertheless some pharmaceuticals ofloxacin sulfamethoxazole lorazepam and propranolol are poorly degraded via mbr treatment and has been another approach on membrane fouling and current density 138 in addition membrane fouling rates decrease the removal efficiencies in this regard alternative solutions should be explored to investigate the optimum configuration for high mbr treatment performance 3 7 constructed wetlands cw a cw is a natural treatment method that can be operated simply and has a low environmental impact cws are defined as an integrated engineered biological treatment system that can replicate the natural wetland concept through a combination of biological biodegradation physicochemical sorption and chemical oxidation interactions among plants substrates and soil 139 in general wetland types are classified into two basic systems vertical ﬂow cws vfcws and horizontal subsurface ﬂow cws hssfcws 140 141 thalla et al 142 defined vfcws as highly aerobic systems that drain wastewater vertically through the planted matrix allowing excellent oxygen transfer that favors aerobic microbial processes meanwhile hfcw systems are considered anoxic systems that favor anoxic oxidized and reduced zones microbial processes such as traditional denitriﬁcation 142 at present cw treatments have demonstrated effective performance in removing edcs for example chen et al 143 reviewed that a constructed wetland that utilized lightweight expanded clay aggregate leca substrate and macrophyte species which is iris sibirica effectively treated wastewater contaminated with carbamazepine with higher than 90 removal efficiency the removal mechanism is illustrated in fig 5 in addition the monitoring results of tatoulis et al 144 indicated that hssf is a promising technology design with many innovations such as reducing area minimized clogging risk and various plastic media to remove contaminants as well as suspended solids from municipal sewage due to its high treatment efficiency 144 145 technically the efficiency of cw treatment is predominated by the sorption processes composting materials of plant materials resistant to the biodegradation of organic materials the hydrophobic properties of the contaminants further enhance the sorption process for the support matrix i e plant materials of the treatment process 146 nevertheless the effectiveness of cw treatment is highly limited to the availability of land in a community area moreover the treatment requires city communities to find a suitable location for treatment areas 141 147 constructed wetland microcosms cwms also another approach on artificially designed ecosystem which utilizes both complex and ordinary interactions between supporting media macrophytes and microorganisms this design able to treat almost all types of wastewater green and sustainable technology that consists of lower energy input less operational cost and flood control 148 in this regard further investigations are necessary to extend the benefits of cw treatment 4 chemical treatment 4 1 chlorination chlorination is the most common conventional method used in drinking water and wastewater treatment processes 149 150 in principle chlorination is a chemical disinfection method used to eliminate microorganisms by disrupting the activity of cell membrane respiration in water treatment systems chlorination methods are located in either the primary or secondary treatment steps this method is used to control the biological growth and ensure that the appropriate chlorine residual levels are consistent throughout the distribution system 151 in general the performance of chlorination treatment is less effective for removing edcs chlorination treatment is most effective for removing estrogenic compounds 98 compared with other synthetic edcs 152 most pharmaceutical compounds were not completely degraded by chlorination and needed other process stages to increase removal efficiency 153 155 in addition matsushita et al 156 reported that pesticides with strong mutagenicity after chlorination could be degraded after the chlorination process by pac adsorption through hydrophobic interaction du et al 157 indicated that toxic and harmful by products had been identiﬁed after the treatment process in particular chlorination treatment requires an advanced process for secondary treatment or post treatment a single treatment via chlorination is ineffective in eliminating various types of edc compounds moreover chlorine dose contact time and ph conditions during the process can differ for each edc compound 158 therefore standard effective conditions for chlorination treatments can be developed to eliminate edcs simultaneously the chlorination conditions for removing edcs can be optimized 4 2 ozonation ozone o3 treatment is among the methods that have received continuous attention in wastewater treatment as part of the oxidation process ozone is a highly reactive gas that can oxidize bacteria organic materials and micropollutants in water and wastewater systems 159 in practice the efficiency of ozonation mostly depends on the reaction rate of the process leresche et al 160 found that oh radicals in the ozone process create fast reactions with the compounds that contain electron rich centres with electron donating substituents to degrade the organic and inorganic compounds in addition the optimization of ozone treatments depends on factors such as ozone dosage energy input density catalyst type temperature airflow rate and pressure 161 162 in general ozone has been demonstrated to remove edcs effectively the removal efficiency of edcs in water and wastewater systems by using the ozonation process ranges from 40 to 100 si et al 163 reported that complete removal of edc in wastewater is done through ozonation treatment moreover ozonation treatment recorded good performance in several pesticide and ppcps compounds with higher removal efficiency 164 165 moreover the treatment of edcs by using ozonation can also produce additional by product or transformation product tp residuals soltermann et al 166 observed a remarkable negative effect on the toxic oxidation by product bromate in bromide wastewater after ozonation treatment predominately the transformation products tp is a low concentration by products that produce through incomplete mineralization of micropollutants in ozonation process 109 as reported by kharel et al 167 the maximum yield of tp are occurred at the same specific ozone dose z 0 55 mg o3 mg doc from any individual wwtp the concentration of the tp is largely dependent on the ozone dose implemented in the process and the elements of wastewater matrix as well as the types of edc the major constituent such natural organic matter nom in wastewater matrix influencing the efficiency of the treatment process that competing with the targeted compounds 168 in practice prefiltration could use to remove the non targeted compound from the wastewater matrix in current practice the biological and physical post treatment methods are introduced in eliminates the tp residuals that danger the environment these effluents polishing treatment such as sand filtration moving bed fixed bed and granular gac filtration aop are introduced to stabilized tp from its parent compounds 169 170 nevertheless the current conducted analysis is still limited to the specific targeted compounds there are many nontargeted substances that are potentially relevant to be identified therefore further analysis and optimization studies should be conducted to reduces and eliminates the tp of reaction intermediates 4 3 fenton processes 4 3 1 fenton fenton processes are economical treatment methods that work through the degradation of contaminants from the oxidation reaction of hydroxyl radicals in practice organic pollutants are attacked by hydroxyl radicals resulting in the complete breakdown of contaminants into co2 water and inorganic salts as end products 171 hydroxyl radicals remove the electrons from the present contaminants to form hydroxide anions and gain a hydrogen atom to replace the atom that disappears during the process 172 in particular the performances of fenton treatments are primarily controlled by reaction process parameters mirzaie et al 173 asserted that the parameters of reaction concentration catalyst type ph radiation intensity water matrix substrate salinity feeding mode temperature and reaction time are significant for the performance of fenton treatment processes in general these processes are largely involved in the removal of edcs in water and wastewater treatment systems in sun et al 174 fenton oxidation techniques were successfully utilized to remove e3 bpa diethylstilbestrol des e2 and ee2 in cow manure wastewater achieving a removal efficiency of 84 9 99 5 99 1 97 8 and 84 5 respectively as shown in fig 6 in addition amin et al 175 achieved the removal of carbamazepine by using fenton like oxidation with fe fe2o3 nanowires while dwiwedi et al 176 removed using granulated activated carbon gac filtration nevertheless fenton processes suffer from certain limitations that prevent them from being used as effective treatment processes for edc removal mirzaie et al 173 determined that the regeneration of iron ions is infeasible and the ﬁnal efﬂuent should be treated to meet the discharge standards for iron concentrations in addition the consumption of greenhouse gas emissions is a critical aspect that should be focused on therefore further investigations should be conducted to develop a sustainable contaminant removal process 4 3 2 photo fenton in photo fenton treatment fe iii is widely used as a catalytic agent to produce hydroxyl radicals through the reaction with h2o2 under ultraviolet uv light 177 in this reaction preferably under acidic condition hydroxyl complexes such as fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 4 which absorb light in the uv visible region undergo photoreduction to generate hydroxyl radicals and fe2 178 in particular an acidic condition is preferable to achieve optimum performance nevertheless neutralization processes are required before discharge 179 at present photo fenton processes have been effectively used to remove many types of hormones phenolic pesticide and ppcps compounds pharmaceutical compounds have been effectively removed via photo fenton treatment with removal efficiency ranging from 95 to 100 180 182 for antibiotics removal such as ciprofloxacin amoxicillin sulfathiazole and sulfamethazine the efficiency achieved in range of 80 95 the photo fenton process under uv and solar radiation reduced total coliforms and e coli after 90 min 183 an interesting finding of silva et al 184 is the complete reduction of estrogenicity e2 and seven endocrine disruptors eds through led irradiation as an alternative to solar photo fenton in case solar radiation is not available thus reducing hazards associated with wwtp effluents reuse or discharge in this regard photo fenton processes seem promising methods for edc removal under certain conditions of photo fenton modification catalyst design and surface modification on the catalyst can improve the oxidation efficiency to remove the micropollutants 179 185 therefore investigating and extending knowledge on the formation of highly reactive ions will be beneficial for determining the fate of reactions 4 3 3 electro fenton electro fenton is an approach used to enhance the generation of hydroxyl radicals by combining fenton and electrocoagulation processes under these conditions the oxidizing power of h2o2 increases with the electrical assistance of the electro fenton process 186 in general electro fenton treatments operate under two configuration conditions which are through i the high catalytic activity of inert electrodes used as anode material with fenton reagents added to the reactor from the outside or ii hydrogen peroxide is added from the outside and fe2 is provided from sacriﬁcial cast iron anodes 187 188 during this process h2o2 that is electrochemically generated from the process is used to increase the degradation of high strength organic pollutants in wastewater systems 189 in particular electro fenton is highly effective in eliminating high concentrations of edc pollutants in wastewater treatment moreira et al 190 reported that electro fenton eliminates pharmaceutical and pesticide compounds at concentrations of 100 000 μgl 1 in addition other types of electro fenton based treatments such as bio electro fenton photo electro fenton and solar electro fenton have demonstrated highly effective performance in removing edcs 191 193 nevertheless this advanced treatment process requires high operation and maintenance costs the costs of conventional treatment methods are considerably lower than the costs of the electro fenton process in this regard the cost effectiveness of the proposed treatment plant should be reviewed and evaluated before wastewater treatment operation is conducted 4 4 photolysis photolysis is a photodegradation process that results from the irradiation and adsorption of a uv light photon that is conditionally processed by either direct absorption of the uv light photon or indirectly by using a photon sensitizer i e h2o2 194 in practice photolysis is a less effective process for the treatment of low edc concentrations 5 10 μg l 1 under uv light absorption with slow degradation rates however the artificial light treatment process can successfully eliminate most edcs at high concentrations 0 7 2 5 mg l 1 with a removal efficiency of 80 97 3 nevertheless under the indirect influence of h2o2 uv the influence of uv is greater than the typical disinfection practice and the standard uv aop applications 195 apart from uv light gamma radiation also exhibits potential in the degradation of edcs through photolysis rozsa et al 196 found that photolysis through gamma radiation successfully transformed atrazine at a concentration of 1 10 4 mol l 1 and 4 6 10 7 mol l 1 however gamma radiation requires high maintenance and operation costs in addition further investigations are required to evaluate the residual effects on the environment in this regard comparisons of photolysis are necessary to provide a clear assessment for selecting an efficient treatment 4 5 photocatalysis photocatalysis is a photoactivation process that transforms chemicals through the irradiation of semiconductor metal oxides as catalysts photocatalysis is among the most favored treatments due to its environmental compatibility 197 gopinath et al 198 reported that photocatalytic oxidation had been demonstrated to be a promising technique because of its nontoxicity relatively low cost lack of mass transfer limitations chemical stability and possible operation at ambient temperatures to date various types of photocatalysts have been used for this treatment process however tio2 and zno are the most frequently used catalysts for photocatalytic processes in water treatment due to their high photochemical stability and piezoelectric characteristics 198 199 in particular the application of zno exhibits higher edc removal efficiency compared with the application of tio2 in principle the efficiency of the edc removal process through photocatalyst treatment depends on process parameters such as catalyst dosage substrate concentration ph and photocatalyst modifications 200 tio2 catalyst will give the best performance compared with other catalysts in term of various design such as carbonaceous composites 197 201 in particular although a modified approach of photocatalysis and photosensitized oxidation has been widely studied to enhance the use of commercial photocatalysts tio2 the application of photocatalytic technology with tio2 to wastewater treatment has been limited within the wavelength range of radiation λ 388 nm nevertheless the photocatalysis process of uv tio2 has completely 100 eliminated pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater treatment regardless of this limitation 201 in this regard economic aspects and operational costs are major evaluation points in defining a suitable photocatalyst approach for wastewater treatment 4 6 green catalytic oxidation since introduced by collins in 2002 202 the applications of iron tetra amido macrocyclic ligand fe taml green catalysts in oxidation processes have received substantial attention from many researchers fe taml functions as a peroxide activator and provides a robust broad and green oxidation process 203 in practice the catalytic activation of h2o2 through fe taml catalysts has significantly contributed to enhancing the oxidation process in water treatment collins et al 204 determined that the slow kinetics of the h2o2 oxidation process is activated by the fe taml catalyst and results in the complete degradation of water contaminants in contrast with other catalysts fe taml can significantly produce an effective mild oxidizing condition within a shorter period i e low concentration usage neutral ph and ambient temperature conditions 202 in addition no residual toxicity product is produced from catalytic oxidation treatment in practice fe taml green catalysts have exhibited effective performance in edc removal wang et al 205 reported that the degradation of natural and synthetic estrogens is rapid with 95 of the original estrogens degraded after 15 min of treatment moreover the total degradation of phosphorothioate pesticides such as fenitrothion parathion and chlorpyrifos by using fe taml h2o2 oxidation has been observed 206 in particular the high degradation rates of fe taml catalysts are attributed to the head and tail ligand sections that considerably affect the lifetime and rates of hydrolytic degradation 204 such potential makes a remarkable contribution to the removal of emerging contaminants in wastewater treatment nevertheless data on the performance of fe taml catalysts in real wtps remain limited in this regard further investigations are necessary to develop a successful green oxidation treatment for water and wastewater plants 5 alternative treatment approached combinations of edc treatment methods have been used to overcome the limitations of single treatment methods a variety of treatment methods have been proposed through the integration of treatments into sequential and hybrid approaches these methods have successfully reduced the high concentrations of edcs and have eliminated the low concentrations of emerging contaminants in water and wastewater systems at present edc hybrid treatment methods have been mostly developed through the combination of chemical treatment with physical or biological treatment methods 207 208 in addition edc hybrid treatment methods have also been developed using a combination of physical and biological treatment methods 209 211 examples of remediation approaches for edc removal through the integration of sequential and hybrid treatments are presented in table 2 sequential treatment approaches for edcs integrate treatment in accordance with the categories followed by another treatment as indicated in table 2 two types of physical treatment methods are integrated to improve edc removal performance uf treatments are mostly considered to combine with other physical treatments such as adsorption treatment methods ac and cnt li et al 212 reported that the removal rate of ee2 increased dramatically from 7 01 to 80 03 by using a pac uf hybrid process compared with a single uf treatment as shown in fig 7 constructed wetland models have also been developed for sequential treatment to increase removal efficiency for edcs 213 214 the integration of advanced chemical processes through photocatalysis and ozonation o3 tio2 fe iii uv has successfully eliminated high bpa concentrations 100 μg l in water alternatively the integration of similar treatment processes is suitable for implementation in pre treatment and post treatment systems meanwhile hybrid treatment processes combine two or more treatments and formulate efficient removal strategies for edcs oxidation chemical based treatment processes such as ozonation have been combined with other physical and biological treatment processes combinations include ozonation with gac bac biofiltration and anaerobic treatment 112 215 216 in addition other chemical oxidation based treatments such as photocatalysis photo fenton and electrochemical oxidation have also been combined with physical based treatment processes 217 219 these hybrid treatment processes have successfully eliminated emerging contaminants at high concentrations of up to 200 μg l eliminations are comparative depending on the types of edcs removed meanwhile mbr based hybrid treatments are effective for eliminating large amounts of edc compounds in water and wastewater systems a few studies have applied hybrid mbr processes followed by functionalized biochar gac ro nf and uf these processes have successfully eliminated most edcs in wastewater samples 220 for example 500 μg l of edc compounds e1 e2 ee2 e3 bpa and 4 tert butylphenol are completely eliminated through the hybrid treatment of mbr with fbc 221 nghiem et al 222 also reported the gac post treatment was observed to significantly complement mbr treatments to obtain high overall removal efficiencies of less hydrophobic and biologically persistent trace organics the bpa contaminants found more effectively removed through the hybrid ozonation based treatment the hybrid ozonation treatment with adsorption and catalytic ozonation has successfully recorded high removal of bpa 223 hooper et al 224 observed approximately 15 blend of advanced treated reclaimed water met potable water quality criteria they conducted the ozonation treatments without the use of ro where nitrate is below the mcl of 10 mg nitrogen per liter and total dissolved solids are below the smcl of 500 mg per liter overall the performance in removing edc contaminants is improved through the mbr and hybrid ozonation based treatment system meanwhile an aop exhibits better removal performance as a hybrid based treatment 6 challenges and potentials the effects of edc on health and environmental issues have raised public concern due to their active capabilities at trace levels the trace levels of edc require accurate and sensitive quantification and detection for the broad determination of edc in environmental matrices 225 interestingly various interferences of edc sources can form new and unknown emerging contaminants that can continuously expand 226 the degradation of edc compounds can extensively lead to the formation of various matrices of by products 33 at present more studies should explore the effects of existing contaminants on the formation of intermediate reactions in water and wastewater treatment systems in addition the optimum process parameters reaction mechanisms and removal kinetics of the treated samples should be studied to ensure performance efficiency in the biological treatment method the factor of suitability capacity reliability and safety of using this biological water treatment technology is commonly raised 227 besides the uncontrolled growth of microorganisms during the treatment process could also affect the process stability in term of cleanliness and material durability 228 as reported by abu hassan et al 227 the selectivity of microorganisms towards specific contaminants could overcome the inadequacy of the water treatment to be precise the biological treatment method requires full monitoring of the living organism applied as the process started the changes in microbial communities and operating condition will affect the performances of treated water quality therefore the process sensitivity and stability of biological treatment are highly requiring a segregation of microbial community that meet the specific treatment condition of edc removal meanwhile physical treatment methods have been extensively used in edc treatment processes particularly for drinking water treatment the applications of adsorption treatments in the removal of edc are expanding with a variety of adsorbent materials the effectiveness of ac and cnt are comparable with the effectiveness of other adsorbent materials such as cellulose and graphite however the current study is mainly focused on the batch system adsorption approached the evaluation for continuous scale implementation is still limited besides the membrane filtration that shows the effectiveness is limited to a few membranes such as ro nf or uf 44 the study of membrane filtration is still limited under the selected number of compounds and process condition in addition hybrid mbr treatments have resulted in the considerable removal of edc in water and wastewater samples aop of chemical treatments are found to be the effective method for edc removal the application of chemical oxidation methods such as ozonation uv photocatalysis and photo fenton processes has been found to be the best edc removal process for most ppcps compounds however the potentials of aop and chemical treatments remain open to be studied a substantial consideration should be taken in identifying an effective treatment process that contributes efficiently besides a more advanced oxidation approached should be extensively studied in real industrial scale applications as a matter of fact optimum and standard edc treatment methods have not been well established in providing the solutions for the clean and safe conditions of water and wastewater systems the formidable challenge begins with the identification of reliable analytical techniques and edc treatment that cover complex environmental samples in addition the different conditions of various wwtps stps and drinking water treatment plants dwtps require specific operational protocols therefore the tremendous challenges when moving toward edc remediation initiatives have resulted in the exploration of a wide potential scope to identify the improvements for edc removal in principle an actual treatment solution for the removal of specific edc should be explored by integrating and optimizing advanced physical chemical and biological treatment methods the exploration and investigation of each advanced treatment process are necessary to determine unknown potential limitations the route of edc treatment is potentially exploring the importance of reproducibility efficiency toward a green environment in addition the most important aspect that potential to be focused on is the effectiveness of reducing the effects of treated edc samples on humans and other living organisms the establishment of specific treatment mechanisms is highly valuable in relation to human health and living organisms importance 7 conclusions edc has been proven to pose various potential threats to the environment and to living organisms given the various concentrations and complexity of edc compounds the treatment of edc contaminants requires accurate and appropriate sampling determination extraction quantification storage and preservation procedures in some cases each edc contaminant has different treatment procedures the appropriate selectivity of the treatment method that matched with edc characteristics is essential to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the treatment process in practice the hybrid treatment method through treatments combination is the most viable approach in eliminating various types of edc besides the aop show promising performance for application in the water treatment plant nevertheless the disadvantages of other available treatment are not limiting the application for water and wastewater treatment a continuous improvement of the limitations could extend the edc treatment and removal implementation s performance and applicability declaration of

13531,the emergence of endocrine disrupting chemicals edc in water and wastewater systems has high risk implications for the environment this manuscript discusses the treatment strategies for the removal of edc in water and wastewater systems the reviewed treatment outlines for edc removal are classified into physical biological and chemical treatments the application of edc treatments is discussed based on the removal and degradation process to eliminate the edc compounds interestingly the physical treatment of membrane filtration processes has been an efficient method for edc removal without using chemical disinfection in a treatment system nevertheless like other edc treatment methods the membrane filtrations are not able to remove emerging contaminants completely thus the overall factor of limitations and challenges in edc treatment methods such as solubility hydrophilicity degradability and polarity are discussed as to understand the applicability of the treatment techniques from the degradation pathways and the by products produced the integration treatment strategies through alternative approaches such as sequential and hybrid treatments that enhanced the considerable removal of edc are rely on the sample characteristics therefore this article gathered each treatment approach s effectiveness and limitations providing a potential outlook of edc

keywords endocrine disrupting chemicals emerging contaminants molecules removal treatment persistence 1 introduction during this decade increased awareness of the risks posed by emerging contaminants to human health has raised concerns for water quality improvement many researchers have focused on exploring treatments for removing emerging contaminants 1 2 at present endocrine disrupting chemicals edc are emerging contaminants that have continuously elicited interest in water and wastewater treatment studies 2 3 such interest is primarily due to the diverse threats that edc can pose to the environment and living organisms 4 as reported by the world health organization who and the united nations environment program unep in 2013 edc can induce endocrine disorders among wildlife and humans 5 moreover edc is believed to cause neurological disorders cardiovascular diseases various types of cancer and human reproductive system problems 6 li et al 6 asserted that strong evidence is available for the impact of edc exposure on human health edc refers to a mixture of chemical agents that interfere with human body systems processes including the synthesis secretion transport metabolism and binding action of natural blood borne hormones 7 they work as agents of functional changes that can disrupt the control system and chemical release of human hormones 8 the disruptor chemicals of the endocrine system originate from natural and synthetic sources natural edc sources which occur in living organisms are classified into groups of estrogens androgens progestogens and phytoestrogens as illustrated in fig 1 9 meanwhile synthetic edc is divided into six groups phthalates pesticides phenolic compounds polyhalogenated compounds drugs and pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps 10 estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 ethinylestradiol ee2 estriol e3 bisphenol a bpa nonylphenol np nonylphenol ethoxylates npneo octylphenol and triclosan are among the most common edc that has been investigated 11 14 most edc emergence is initiated from various manufacturing usage disposal and discharge of chemicals and pharmaceutical products which finally significantly impact the environment and living organism 4 15 there are diverse potential sources that lead to edc contaminations in the environment edc s widespread exposure mainly originates from wastewater discharge from household sewerage channel industrial operation medical waste system agricultural processing waste and permanent waste disposal such as landfill and dumpsite 16 this concentrated edc is entered different medium and area routes that used to be the discharge control system such as wastewater treatment facilities in particular the edc contaminants in wastewater effluent will follow a wastewater treatment system or open flow of runoff system where the effluent directly entered the groundwater and surface waterbody as the report by who in 2015 17 the extent of edc contamination exposure varies considerably among the species individual and localities depending on the type of medium exposure such as air soil water food and other types of consumer products thus the effects of edc exposure to the environments have various outcomes to the living species and habitats that dependent on sources intake the effects of edc have spread diversely and are mostly observed in fish birds mammals reptiles agricultural plants and humans low concentrations ng l of edc in surface water can alter the gender of some fish species and disrupt their reproductive system 18 19 meanwhile the impacts of edc on wildlife are reproductive dysfunctions egg thinning and delays of sexual maturation which affect the growth factors and populations of wildlife 20 in agricultural plants the exposure of estrogen 17β estradiol e2 and androstenedione has caused the removal of atmospheric co2 inhibited the algal growth and increasing the rehydration of plants 21 the human body s intake of edc through consumption inhalation and exposure also significantly affects body systems causing major damage in the central nervous system i e nonreproductive neural and neurogenesis processes and the reproductive system 22 moreover the effects of edc on the human reproductive system can include ovulation disorders endometriosis breast cancer uterine fibroids and pregnancy and fertility problems 23 24 edc has also been examined to determine if it can cause other health problems such as cardiovascular diseases obesity early puberty and mental retardation 25 the effects of edc on living organisms and human health are summarized in table 1 considering the various harmful effects of edc the remediation of water and wastewater systems involves various treatment methods such as biological physical and chemical treatments as illustrated in fig 2 the application of biological treatments has successfully degraded a large proportion of edc molecules however the biological degradation process fails to eliminate nonorganic edc molecules 33 comparatively physical treatment methods can remove recalcitrant nonorganic molecules several membrane filtration treatment methods such as ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have been utilized in edc removal 34 35 however membrane filtration processes are commonly known to suffer from fouling problems due to pore blockage 36 chemical treatment methods such as the advanced oxidation process aop can also be used for edc removal however the aop treatment method can potentially form by product residuals these limitations are attributed to the challenges posed by the biological persistence and also physical chemical characteristics of the targeted compounds such as hydrophilicity ph acid solubility pka water partition coefficient kow degradability and polarity of edc 37 38 therefore this article is aimed to evaluate the treatment efficiencies and strategies for edc removal 2 physical treatments 2 1 sedimentation sedimentation refers to the process of particle settlement under the effect of gravity this technique is commonly applied during the primary treatment stage of sewage treatment plants stps and wastewater treatment plants wwtps prior to the filtration and disinfection processes 39 at present the sedimentation method is ineffective in eliminating edc behera et al 40 reported that the removal efficiency for diclofenac and e3 estriol using the sedimentation method is less than 28 moreover significant removals have not been reported for estrone ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole by using the sedimentation method 41 42 in particular the ineffectiveness of the sedimentation method implies the challenges posed by contaminants in water with high hydrophilicity and solubility 43 the types of edc such as hormone e g estriol ppcps e g ibuprofen and pesticides have different physical chemical properties as reported by kim et al 44 mechanistic prediction model for compounds removal is based on the compounds molecular weight acid solubility pka and octanol water partition properties kwo pka coefficient indicates the compound charge at a given ph in contrast kow coefficient is the ratio of the concentration of a compound in two phases of a mixture of two immiscible solvents in general the high kow 2 value indicates the potential of the edc compounds that could accumulate in sediments relatively moderate and high removal efficiency might be observed for the compounds with lower pka and kow nevertheless due to the diverse physical chemical and molecular properties none of the treatment methods effectively removes all types of edc therefore edc treatment methods need to be assessed on each compound basis besides such difficulty requires an advanced secondary treatment to remove the remaining proportion of edc entirely in the aqueous phase post sedimentation process in this condition the high edc solubility compounds require a hydrophobic interaction treatment medium for removal lin et al 45 proposed advanced treatments such as granular activated carbon gac adsorption combined with sedimentation and filtration which were the major removal mechanisms in advanced water treatment plants wtps ppcps in raw water are completely removed through the combination of treatments in advanced wtps 45 therefore the physical and chemical properties such as the kow value is a good indicator to evaluate the suitable edc removal interaction evidently sedimentation treatment alone is insufficient for efficiently removing edc 2 2 adsorption 2 2 1 activated carbon ac adsorption ac adsorption processes by using gac and powder activated carbon pac have been extensively used in water and wastewater treatments this method has elicited considerable attention due to its simple operation absorbent regeneration potential and suitability for batch and continuous processes 46 in general the adsorption processes are applied at the early filtration stage of the water and wastewater treatment process the performance of ac adsorption to remove edc compounds depend on the adsorbent dose and contact time and the physical and chemical properties of the target compounds 47 the ac removes the water s absorbance through the hydrophobic interactions between the compound and the absorbent surface the water system that contains a dissolved organic compound is required to be removed prior to adsorption predominately the removal of the compounds before adsorption will provide longer periods between regenerations 48 the reduction in dissolved compounds reduces the absorbent loading and probably avoids interference during the adsorption process 49 moreover as reported by kennedy et al 50 in a full and pilot scale of organic micropollutants by ac adsorption an increase in background dissolved organic matter resulted in more and earlier micropollutants breakthrough in terms of characteristics the well developed pore structure and surface chemistry properties of ac contribute to its specific interactions with edc adsorbed compounds 16 vidal et al 51 reported that incorporating sulfur into the carbon structure results in a positive effect on dynamic adsorption capacity by increasing the total amount of adsorbed trimethoprim from 195 mg g to 240 mg g in addition the adequate contact time of adsorption and the dosage of ac affect the performance of edc removal 52 as demonstrated by noutsopoulus et al 53 high removal of triclosan 84 naproxen 91 ibuprofen 95 and ketoprofen 93 compounds was recorded at a high ac dose of 100 000 μg l 1 at 60 min contact time in practice ac adsorption treatment is highly effective in removing all target chemicals as studied by jiang et al 54 the powdered ac recorded the highest adsorption capacity 132 73 mg g compared to other carbon nanotubes 103 81 mg g graphene oxide 77 86 mg g and biochar 9 19 mg g adsorbents for estrogen removal besides fu et al 55 reported the high hydrophobicity of ppcps contaminants could be effectively eliminated 75 by incorporation with secondary filtration in their study acebutolol diazepam and diltiazem compounds were removed entirely from the treatment process moreover rao et al 56 studied the removal of ppcps residues from treated effluents and further emphasized the capability of ac adsorption treatments their results demonstrated that 90 98 of ppcps were removed from low concentration compounds exhibiting an evident relationship of dose response between compound concentration and adsorbent dosage a long contact time can significantly increase compound removal 56 nevertheless removal efficiency for edc varies depending on the compound type several compounds such as carbamazepine and propranolol have exhibited relatively low removal in this regard understanding the specific properties of targeted compound conditions should be emphasized to achieve optimum adsorbent capability 2 2 2 carbon nanotubes cnt since their discovery cnts have received considerable attention in various research areas the unique characteristics of the mechanical and electronic properties of multi walled cnts mwcnts have broadened their practical applications 57 to date cnts have received extensive research attention as a new type of adsorbents because of their potential applications in removing various natural and synthetic edc 58 in contrast with ac adsorbents cnt structures contain rolled graphite sheet layers they are called single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts when they have a single rolled graphite sheet layer and mwcnts when they have double or multiple rolled graphite sheet layers 59 moreover cnt adsorption properties considerably differ from ac properties regardless of the pore properties and surface areas the overall adsorption properties of cnts depend on the adsorption site purity and surface functional groups of nanometer thick layered carbon 60 moreover process parameters which include ph ionic strength initial solute concentration and temperature are major factors that affect the sorption rate of edc 61 the application of cnts as absorbent exhibit effective adsorption capacities in removing a wide range of edc such as bpa 92 mg g e2 27 2 mg g diuron 40 37 mg g and tetracycline 175 mg g 58 62 65 the mechanisms of the donor acceptor system π π bond formed between edc and cnts have been suggested to be significant forces that affect the adsorption performance of cnts 58 in addition significant edc adsorption is attributed to the larger van der waals interactions and multilayer adsorption properties of mwcnts 66 comparatively the compactness of an swcnt bundle eliminates groove areas and interstitial spaces reducing adsorption capability 54 in this regard the compactness of the bundles requires the rapid dispersion of particles to provide additional adsorption sites for swcnts 60 the modification of surface functional groups can further enhance the adsorption capability of swcnts 67 however although the adsorbents of mwcnts and swcnts have demonstrated adequate performance investigations on synthetic water samples remain limited 68 in contrast with ac adsorbents applying cnts to real treatment plants has not been well established in addition the toxic effects of cnt adsorbents are still debatable 69 in this regard additional research on real water systems and investigations on the effects of cnts is required to improve the understanding of cnt adsorbents application to edc removal 2 2 3 graphene oxide go nanosheets adsorption go nanosheets are new promising adsorbents for water contaminants because of their excellent hydrophilicity properties high surface area and abundant surface oxygen containing groups 70 the use of go nanosheets as absorbents has demonstrated outstanding removal performance for various contaminants including divalent metal ions aromatic organic compounds and various dyes from aqueous solutions 71 in addition contaminants are easily and rapidly extracted from water through the magnetic attraction of the hybrid go nanosheet adsorbents 71 interestingly jiang et al 72 reported the strong potential of go nanosheet adsorbents with a maximum adsorption capacity qm of 149 4 mg g to remove ee2 hormones in an aqueous solution the exothermic and spontaneous adsorption processes were claimed among the highest ee2 adsorption values compared with other adsorbents 73 nevertheless the investigation of go nanosheet absorbents for edc removal in actual water and wastewater systems remains limited at present and performance is unknown therefore this significant research finding can be the basis for further investigations in the future 2 2 4 cellulose adsorption cellulose is considered one of the most promising areas of scientific and technological development in the field of plant products interestingly cellulose based adsorbents have made significant contributions compared with other available synthetic material adsorbents for water treatment 74 however native cellulose is less effective in eliminating edc in aqueous solutions and having an undesirable adsorbent capacity for emerging compounds due to the low reproducibility of the process and the adsorbate s full capacity 74 75 to date various modified cellulose based adsorbent methods have been investigated for water treatment applications in particular the chemical modification of cellulose based adsorbents has been found to improve the adsorption capacity of cellulose adsorbents for edc removal 76 as reported by hu et al 77 cellulose grafting modification that utilizes quaternary ammonium salt has achieved considerable improvement in removing amoxicillin with a maximum adsorption capacity of 183 14 mg g moreover the findings that recorded superior removal performance are the adsorption capacities qm of 1072 86 mg g and 786 18 mg g for tetracycline and sulfamethazine respectively by using a sustainable α cellulose absorbent activated by koh 78 consequently the effectiveness of cellulose based adsorbents indicates the importance of using natural polymers as low cost sustainable and effective adsorbents for removing edc in water and wastewater systems nevertheless although many studies have investigated cellulose based adsorbents in water treatment most of these studies have focused on general water contaminants research on the application of cellulose based adsorbents to edc removal is still emerging further exploration and utilization of innovative methods are required to develop efficient cellulose based adsorbents for edc removal 2 3 membrane filtration 2 3 1 ro ro is a membrane filtration method that has been effectively used for the removal of dissolved micropollutants from drinking water systems 79 in the process dissolved contaminants are mainly rejected through the small molecular weight cut off mwco and membrane pore sizes and the electrostatic charge s repulsion between the dissolved contaminants and the membrane 80 besides the contaminants are effectively separated at low pka and kow value 2 of compound properties and at low solvent permeability of ro treatment 81 predominately thin film composite membrane tfc is the most outstanding membrane that provides significant selectivity compaction resistance and chemical stability in ro treatment compare to other membrane polymers such as polyamide polybenzimidazoline and poly piperazine amide 82 as reported by kassim et al 83 tfc membrane was fabricated from a thin layer of hybrid membrane formulated from a blend of polyvinyl alcohol pva chitosan and cross linked with tetraethylorthosilicate teos which was layered on the polysulfone psf membrane besides the tfc membrane are being further chemically modified to improve its rejection capacity for edc removal through graft polymerization and crosslinking modification 84 the significant characteristic of tfc that shows membrane performance has extensively attracted its application in ro treatment in general ro membrane filtration has been extensively used to separate edc compounds in wtps 85 in particular emerging compounds such as ppcps pesticides and bpas are effectively separated via ro membrane filtration 86 wang et al 87 found that the overall removal efficiency in the final treated water is greater than 95 at concentrations lower than 10 μg l for most ppcps compounds in addition katibi et al 36 reported that nearly complete rejection 98 was achieved for bpa separation with the application of polyamide based ro membranes nevertheless in contrast with other membrane filtration approaches e g nf and uf concentrates brine from ro treatment are primarily discharged to the surface water these ro concentrates are almost 20 of the influent concentration of rejected contaminants 88 thus one challenge in ro is the management of brine generated from the filtration process that exerts harmful effects on the environment predominately the brine concentration is vary depending on feed water quality effluent quality type of treatment and the nature of chemicals used 89 in current findings the effort of providing the environmentally friendly of brine treatment are still limited to be implemented although aops have been the most widely investigated method for brine treatment the energy intensive and high cost in a single treatment have limited its application interestingly xiang et al 90 has reviewed and proposed treatment options for concentrates produced by ro membrane processes and a hybrid treatment approach was recommended as a solution the proposed integrated hybrid are comprising fo pre coagulation ao and post biological treatment as a better option for brine treatment at lower cost and energy in the first stage the post treatment for the ro brine compound is to separate the dissolved compound from the concentrated brine the dissolved organic matter except for hydrophobic brine is removed using different separation processes such as forward osmosis and coagulation then the oxidation method is used to eliminate the concentrated hydrophobic compound separated at the early stage finally as a supplementary approach the post biological treatment provides an efficient degradation of the hydrophilic intermediates produced at the secondary stage eliminating the brine contamination from the ro water treatment process this hybrid approached showing significant potential in improving the operation cost and usage of energy in the treatment system however this significant approached are very depending on the ro brine characteristics in selecting the material and method of the treatment process 2 3 2 nanofiltration the nf membrane method has been recognized as a promising treatment method for micropollutants such as hormones and pharmaceutical contaminants in water and wastewater system 50 96 in principle nf membranes function with water pressure forced through nano sized pores between 0 2 nm and 0 4 nm and contaminants are adsorbed on the membrane via charge and size interactions 97 98 in addition nf membranes exhibit charge selectivity for dissolved components 99 monovalent ions and water can permeate whereas divalent and multivalent ions are retained 100 in practice the performance of nf membrane treatment is generally known to achieve high quality and produce effluents with low organic concentrations moreover the removal of microbes and viruses does not require adding chemical disinfectants 6 41 however liu et al 41 reported that the variety of membrane adsorbent types membrane supports such as polysulfone ceramic acetate polyacrylonitrile and polyethersulfone and the different size exclusion and charge repulsion properties of various edc compounds can change the removal range 10 99 9 consequently understanding the nf membrane mechanisms involved in rejecting target contaminant compounds is important semiao et al 96 found that the pore radius of the active layer is a determining factor for the removal of adsorbing contaminants i e estrone and estradiol in nf membranes semiao et al 96 added that a combination of partitioning effects and internal surface area access plays a role in the adsorption and retention of hormones i e estrone and estradiol by nf membranes in addition semiao et al 101 suggested that convection and diffusion are adequate transport modes for adsorbing hormones i e estrone and estradiol of nf membranes with convection mechanisms significantly contributing to the transport of hormones at pressures higher than 11 bar in this regard the hormone removal mechanisms that use nf membranes have been investigated extensively nevertheless many removal mechanisms for various contaminant types remain unknown numerous edc contaminants in water are still difficult to remove using single treatment methods in the actual applications of nf membranes to wtps multiple or hybrid treatments have been proposed to overcome the weaknesses of nf membranes therefore nf membranes are commonly combined with aop and concentrated residuals require further treatment 50 2 3 3 ultrafiltration uf uf is a low pressure cross flow membrane separation process with pore sizes ranging from 0 01 μm to 0 1 μm 91 uf membranes are effective in eliminating macromolecules and particles but their effectiveness is highly dependent on the type of material that constitutes the membrane 92 uf membranes have elicited considerable attention due to their extensive applications to advanced secondary effluent treatment however the application of uf membranes to the removal of edc is less effective uf membranes have been reported to reject extremely few target edc compounds compared with the nf and ro methods 93 a comparative review of patel et al 49 concluded that the removal of selected pharmaceuticals e g amoxicillin naproxen metoprolol and phenacetin via uf is moderately successful compared with nf processes in addition ojajuni et al 94 found that hydrophobic adsorption and size exclusion are the dominant mechanisms that retain edc on nf membranes meanwhile uf membranes retain typically hydrophobic edc consequently uf is rarely used as a single treatment for the removal of edc its limited use is attributed to the fact that the mwco range 10 100 kda of uf membranes is higher compared with the molecular weight 1 kda of most micropollutants 95 meanwhile huang et al 96 studied the ultrafiltration process on effluents through 1 kda cross flow into two phases colloidal phase 0 45 μm 1 kda and soluble phase 1 kda they compared the estrogenic activity with the other processes which are coagulation sedimentation cs gac adsorption magnetic ion exchange resin ndmp and ozone processes as shown in fig 3 the edc with lower kow values has higher removal activity by ndmp while the ozone process successfully removes both colloidal and soluble phases edc therefore the colloid bound edc has a good performance which suggested that the combination of ndmp and ozonation processes achieved a higher reducing estrogenic activity with satisfied the predicted no effect concentration 97 98 in this regard although uf allows the passage of low molecular weight organic solutes through its membrane it can be used as a pre treatment for ro because it can remove high concentred effluent from passed ro membrane sun et al 99 reported that compounds larger than pore is rejected by membrane surface and remain on the feed or concentrate side meanwhile the smaller compounds than the pore can pass through the membrane to filtrate the compounds with a high fouling tendency leachate effluents to ro membranes 99 100 2 4 ultrasonication us us is an advanced treatment process for removing low concentration ng l to μg l and complex contaminants in wastewater systems 101 102 it is fast clean and related to the wave degradation process which does not produce secondary products 101 in accordance with chadi et al 103 the wave degradation process of us treatment operates on the basis of the nucleation growth collapse of cavitation bubbles in water due to the high pressure and temperature caused by ultrasound waves complex contaminants exposed to ultrasound waves will undergo thermal and chemical reactions that promote the degradation of solutes in gaseous and aqueous solutions 104 in general the removal of edc via us treatment has achieved efficient performance for example im et al 105 found that the degradation of ppcps compounds acetaminophen and naproxen via us treatment demonstrated high removal efficiency for naproxen 99 and acetaminophen 86 1 at 1000 khz nevertheless naddeo et al 106 indicated that the speciﬁc removal rate depends on the chemical structure of the analyzed compound at a treatment time of 180 min triclosan is nearly completely degraded 95 however other pharmaceuticals such as erythromycin and iopromide are only partially removed 50 using the same ultrasound power at the same frequency in particular the degradation and removal of edc via us treatment are influenced by several factors chu et al 107 found that the removal efficiency of edc varies and is influenced by the following i water quality and sonication conditions ph temperature background ions promoters us frequency power and reactor type ii catalysts non carbon based and carbon based catalysts and iii compound properties to maximize the effectiveness of edc degradation through us treatment a comprehensive assessment is necessary to establish standard conditions for each environmental matrix thus the evaluation of us treatment for various types of water and wastewater sources should be explored 3 biological treatment 3 1 biological active carbon bac bac filtration is a combination of gac adsorbents under cover of a biofilm in principle bac treatments are dominated by adsorption and microbial degradation mechanisms 108 under this dual mechanism contaminants and dissolved oxygen in the treated solution interact with granular activated particles and microorganisms 109 in practice the combination of this dual mechanism process has been found to remove low level edc successfully during the treatment of drinking water 49 li et al 110 determined that the presence of a readily biodegradable carbon source is beneficial for e2 removal in a bac reactor and an e2 removal ratio higher than 99 was maintained regardless of the primary carbon source type as shown in fig 4 in particular bac filtration was implemented as a complementary treatment for solutions with low level concentrations chuang et al 111 found that treatment via bac filtration after ozonation can reduce the concentrations of most remaining estrogenic compounds by up to 95 consequently bac filtration is likely to be used as a tertiary treatment process 112 moreover the combination of advanced treatments with bac filtration under recycled carbon can provide considerable reductions in the capital costs of operation 113 tras 3 2 biological nitrification and denitrification bnd bnd is a biological process of oxidation and reduction that supports the high removal of organics through heterotrophic and slow growing nitrifying microorganisms 114 at present bnd treatments have been applied as secondary treatments after performing other advanced biological treatments such as the application of mbrs or anaerobic aerobic treatment systems 115 under this type of treatment edc removal performance is largely effective for estrogenic and several pharmaceutical compounds ting et al 116 reported that secondary activated sludge treatment followed by nitrification denitrification effectively stopped more than 95 of estrogenic activities however removal performance for other edc compounds such as carbamazepine diclofenac cloﬁbricacid gemfibrozil erythromycin and pesticides atrazine and fenoprop exhibited lower efﬁciency 117 in this regard the performance of a bnd treatment alone is less effective compared with dual or hybrid treatment processes wigginton et al 118 indicated that the major differences in ammonia oxidizing and nitrous oxide reducing community composition and structure between centralized and decentralized bnd wastewater treatment systems therefore the challenge posed by the bnd process can be effectively managed by combining it with other advanced biological treatments 3 3 microalgae at present microalgae based wastewater treatments have received considerable attention for removing edc effluents because they provide high quality treated efﬂuents 33 119 120 moreover microalgae treatments are considered economical practices due to the multiple uses of microalgae such as in pollutant removal and energy resources 119 young et al 121 reported that shallow raceway reactors produce high rate algal and consume oxygen via microalgal photosynthesis thus microalgae based treatment systems do not require external oxygen aeration in the system 122 in practice microalgae based treatments have been proven to remove edcs effectively from effluents through evaporation photodegradation and biodegradation mechanisms 33 wang et al 120 evaluated algae mediated biotransformation as possible mechanisms for removing 17α ethinylestradiol 75 3 removal and 17β estradiol 95 removal in addition ruksrithong et al 119 proved that biodegradation and adsorption were the predominant mechanisms for removing e1 and e2 consequently the effectiveness of microalgae based biodegradation has successfully eliminated most estrogenic and pharmaceutical effluents in wastewater systems nevertheless the removal performance for pesticide compounds is relatively low 32 89 compared with other edc compounds 123 in this regard the culture and growth of microorganisms can be further examined to understand the effectiveness of microalgae in removing pesticides in particular the integrated biological treatment process with microalgae is among the potential options for further improving performance 3 4 fungi the fungal treatment method utilizes the enzymatic biodegradation of micropollutants that have been alternatively used in edc removal the capability of fungi to degrade edcs in synthetic media and real wastewater has been widely explored among conventional methods used in practice fungal treatments can be considered efficient biological treatments for removing pharmaceutical compounds 37 naghdi et al 124 reviewed that literature found the stable fungal reactor requires systematic investigation on the contribution of biosorption and biodegradation during removal of phacs and micropollutants 125 in addition mir tutusaus et al 126 found that a fungal operation successfully removed analgesics and anti inflammatories and even eliminated the most recalcitrant pharmaceutical families such as antibiotics and psychiatric drugs from wastewater in practice the degradation efficiency of fungal treatments is dependent on several factors such as sterilization processes fungal nutrient additions and aeration rates 127 moreover the wastewater type can affect the survival of fungi during the treatment process highly concentrated wastewater can reduce the number of surviving fungi due to bacterial competition therefore the application of fungal biological treatments is reliable for secondary treatment or post treatment processes the pretreated effluents obtained using physical methods i e ro and coagulation flocculation are the most suitable for the fungal treatment process 126 3 5 biosorption el naggar et al 128 described biosorption as a dual mechanism i e bio oxidation and sorption process that occurs when microorganisms are immobilized onto an adsorbent in practice the removal of edcs using biosorption treatments is effective for highly hydrophobic compounds 138 dhangar et al 86 reviewed the removal of 17β estradiol 17α acetate pentachlorophenol 4tert octylphenol and triclosan achieved using a biosorption treatment process similar observations indicated that the soluble concentrations of target compounds decreased rapidly for selected microconstituents 129 in particular soluble or hydrophobic edc compounds are primarily targeted to be removed using biosorption treatments nevertheless in slow decrement processes most extremely hydrophobic compounds are also removed by a biodegradation mechanism the theory of the biosorption process in wastewater treatment can be deeply investigated using sufficient isotherm data mass transfer coefficients biological growth and destruction activity values estimated from independent measurements 130 131 therefore the efficiency of biosorption treatments in removing edcs should be compared with other biological treatments in addition regardless of hydrophobic properties the efficiency of removing edcs using biosorption treatments can be further enhanced via dual or hybrid treatment processes 3 6 membrane bioreactors mbrs the use of mbrs is a superior biological treatment method that has elicited substantial attention due to its technical innovations and high quality treated effluents compared with other conventional biological treatments i e activated sludge treatment 132 133 in particular the efficiency of mbrs is attributed to the retention of sludge on the membrane surface which promotes extensive microbial degradation and physical retention of all molecules 134 in accordance with hai et al 133 the effectiveness of mbr treatment is dependent on sludge age concentration the existence of anoxic and anaerobic compartments wastewater composition operating temperature ph and conductivity factors for example park et al 135 reported that considering the slow degradation of pharmaceuticals removal by using mbrs is better due to the relatively old ages of sludge leading to the development of distinct microbial communities in mbrs compared with that in activated sludge plants in addition arca ramos et al 136 determined that one stage and two stages enzymatic mbr is performed for the removal of micropollutants from secondary effluents in practice mbr treatments have demonstrated effective performance for the removal of edcs approximately 81 99 of various types of edc compounds e g pharmaceuticals pesticides and phenolic and estrogenic hormones have been removed via mbr treatment 117 132 137 in addition several ppcps such as salicylic acid and propylparaben have been eliminated 100 removal using mbr treatment nevertheless some pharmaceuticals ofloxacin sulfamethoxazole lorazepam and propranolol are poorly degraded via mbr treatment and has been another approach on membrane fouling and current density 138 in addition membrane fouling rates decrease the removal efficiencies in this regard alternative solutions should be explored to investigate the optimum configuration for high mbr treatment performance 3 7 constructed wetlands cw a cw is a natural treatment method that can be operated simply and has a low environmental impact cws are defined as an integrated engineered biological treatment system that can replicate the natural wetland concept through a combination of biological biodegradation physicochemical sorption and chemical oxidation interactions among plants substrates and soil 139 in general wetland types are classified into two basic systems vertical ﬂow cws vfcws and horizontal subsurface ﬂow cws hssfcws 140 141 thalla et al 142 defined vfcws as highly aerobic systems that drain wastewater vertically through the planted matrix allowing excellent oxygen transfer that favors aerobic microbial processes meanwhile hfcw systems are considered anoxic systems that favor anoxic oxidized and reduced zones microbial processes such as traditional denitriﬁcation 142 at present cw treatments have demonstrated effective performance in removing edcs for example chen et al 143 reviewed that a constructed wetland that utilized lightweight expanded clay aggregate leca substrate and macrophyte species which is iris sibirica effectively treated wastewater contaminated with carbamazepine with higher than 90 removal efficiency the removal mechanism is illustrated in fig 5 in addition the monitoring results of tatoulis et al 144 indicated that hssf is a promising technology design with many innovations such as reducing area minimized clogging risk and various plastic media to remove contaminants as well as suspended solids from municipal sewage due to its high treatment efficiency 144 145 technically the efficiency of cw treatment is predominated by the sorption processes composting materials of plant materials resistant to the biodegradation of organic materials the hydrophobic properties of the contaminants further enhance the sorption process for the support matrix i e plant materials of the treatment process 146 nevertheless the effectiveness of cw treatment is highly limited to the availability of land in a community area moreover the treatment requires city communities to find a suitable location for treatment areas 141 147 constructed wetland microcosms cwms also another approach on artificially designed ecosystem which utilizes both complex and ordinary interactions between supporting media macrophytes and microorganisms this design able to treat almost all types of wastewater green and sustainable technology that consists of lower energy input less operational cost and flood control 148 in this regard further investigations are necessary to extend the benefits of cw treatment 4 chemical treatment 4 1 chlorination chlorination is the most common conventional method used in drinking water and wastewater treatment processes 149 150 in principle chlorination is a chemical disinfection method used to eliminate microorganisms by disrupting the activity of cell membrane respiration in water treatment systems chlorination methods are located in either the primary or secondary treatment steps this method is used to control the biological growth and ensure that the appropriate chlorine residual levels are consistent throughout the distribution system 151 in general the performance of chlorination treatment is less effective for removing edcs chlorination treatment is most effective for removing estrogenic compounds 98 compared with other synthetic edcs 152 most pharmaceutical compounds were not completely degraded by chlorination and needed other process stages to increase removal efficiency 153 155 in addition matsushita et al 156 reported that pesticides with strong mutagenicity after chlorination could be degraded after the chlorination process by pac adsorption through hydrophobic interaction du et al 157 indicated that toxic and harmful by products had been identiﬁed after the treatment process in particular chlorination treatment requires an advanced process for secondary treatment or post treatment a single treatment via chlorination is ineffective in eliminating various types of edc compounds moreover chlorine dose contact time and ph conditions during the process can differ for each edc compound 158 therefore standard effective conditions for chlorination treatments can be developed to eliminate edcs simultaneously the chlorination conditions for removing edcs can be optimized 4 2 ozonation ozone o3 treatment is among the methods that have received continuous attention in wastewater treatment as part of the oxidation process ozone is a highly reactive gas that can oxidize bacteria organic materials and micropollutants in water and wastewater systems 159 in practice the efficiency of ozonation mostly depends on the reaction rate of the process leresche et al 160 found that oh radicals in the ozone process create fast reactions with the compounds that contain electron rich centres with electron donating substituents to degrade the organic and inorganic compounds in addition the optimization of ozone treatments depends on factors such as ozone dosage energy input density catalyst type temperature airflow rate and pressure 161 162 in general ozone has been demonstrated to remove edcs effectively the removal efficiency of edcs in water and wastewater systems by using the ozonation process ranges from 40 to 100 si et al 163 reported that complete removal of edc in wastewater is done through ozonation treatment moreover ozonation treatment recorded good performance in several pesticide and ppcps compounds with higher removal efficiency 164 165 moreover the treatment of edcs by using ozonation can also produce additional by product or transformation product tp residuals soltermann et al 166 observed a remarkable negative effect on the toxic oxidation by product bromate in bromide wastewater after ozonation treatment predominately the transformation products tp is a low concentration by products that produce through incomplete mineralization of micropollutants in ozonation process 109 as reported by kharel et al 167 the maximum yield of tp are occurred at the same specific ozone dose z 0 55 mg o3 mg doc from any individual wwtp the concentration of the tp is largely dependent on the ozone dose implemented in the process and the elements of wastewater matrix as well as the types of edc the major constituent such natural organic matter nom in wastewater matrix influencing the efficiency of the treatment process that competing with the targeted compounds 168 in practice prefiltration could use to remove the non targeted compound from the wastewater matrix in current practice the biological and physical post treatment methods are introduced in eliminates the tp residuals that danger the environment these effluents polishing treatment such as sand filtration moving bed fixed bed and granular gac filtration aop are introduced to stabilized tp from its parent compounds 169 170 nevertheless the current conducted analysis is still limited to the specific targeted compounds there are many nontargeted substances that are potentially relevant to be identified therefore further analysis and optimization studies should be conducted to reduces and eliminates the tp of reaction intermediates 4 3 fenton processes 4 3 1 fenton fenton processes are economical treatment methods that work through the degradation of contaminants from the oxidation reaction of hydroxyl radicals in practice organic pollutants are attacked by hydroxyl radicals resulting in the complete breakdown of contaminants into co2 water and inorganic salts as end products 171 hydroxyl radicals remove the electrons from the present contaminants to form hydroxide anions and gain a hydrogen atom to replace the atom that disappears during the process 172 in particular the performances of fenton treatments are primarily controlled by reaction process parameters mirzaie et al 173 asserted that the parameters of reaction concentration catalyst type ph radiation intensity water matrix substrate salinity feeding mode temperature and reaction time are significant for the performance of fenton treatment processes in general these processes are largely involved in the removal of edcs in water and wastewater treatment systems in sun et al 174 fenton oxidation techniques were successfully utilized to remove e3 bpa diethylstilbestrol des e2 and ee2 in cow manure wastewater achieving a removal efficiency of 84 9 99 5 99 1 97 8 and 84 5 respectively as shown in fig 6 in addition amin et al 175 achieved the removal of carbamazepine by using fenton like oxidation with fe fe2o3 nanowires while dwiwedi et al 176 removed using granulated activated carbon gac filtration nevertheless fenton processes suffer from certain limitations that prevent them from being used as effective treatment processes for edc removal mirzaie et al 173 determined that the regeneration of iron ions is infeasible and the ﬁnal efﬂuent should be treated to meet the discharge standards for iron concentrations in addition the consumption of greenhouse gas emissions is a critical aspect that should be focused on therefore further investigations should be conducted to develop a sustainable contaminant removal process 4 3 2 photo fenton in photo fenton treatment fe iii is widely used as a catalytic agent to produce hydroxyl radicals through the reaction with h2o2 under ultraviolet uv light 177 in this reaction preferably under acidic condition hydroxyl complexes such as fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 4 which absorb light in the uv visible region undergo photoreduction to generate hydroxyl radicals and fe2 178 in particular an acidic condition is preferable to achieve optimum performance nevertheless neutralization processes are required before discharge 179 at present photo fenton processes have been effectively used to remove many types of hormones phenolic pesticide and ppcps compounds pharmaceutical compounds have been effectively removed via photo fenton treatment with removal efficiency ranging from 95 to 100 180 182 for antibiotics removal such as ciprofloxacin amoxicillin sulfathiazole and sulfamethazine the efficiency achieved in range of 80 95 the photo fenton process under uv and solar radiation reduced total coliforms and e coli after 90 min 183 an interesting finding of silva et al 184 is the complete reduction of estrogenicity e2 and seven endocrine disruptors eds through led irradiation as an alternative to solar photo fenton in case solar radiation is not available thus reducing hazards associated with wwtp effluents reuse or discharge in this regard photo fenton processes seem promising methods for edc removal under certain conditions of photo fenton modification catalyst design and surface modification on the catalyst can improve the oxidation efficiency to remove the micropollutants 179 185 therefore investigating and extending knowledge on the formation of highly reactive ions will be beneficial for determining the fate of reactions 4 3 3 electro fenton electro fenton is an approach used to enhance the generation of hydroxyl radicals by combining fenton and electrocoagulation processes under these conditions the oxidizing power of h2o2 increases with the electrical assistance of the electro fenton process 186 in general electro fenton treatments operate under two configuration conditions which are through i the high catalytic activity of inert electrodes used as anode material with fenton reagents added to the reactor from the outside or ii hydrogen peroxide is added from the outside and fe2 is provided from sacriﬁcial cast iron anodes 187 188 during this process h2o2 that is electrochemically generated from the process is used to increase the degradation of high strength organic pollutants in wastewater systems 189 in particular electro fenton is highly effective in eliminating high concentrations of edc pollutants in wastewater treatment moreira et al 190 reported that electro fenton eliminates pharmaceutical and pesticide compounds at concentrations of 100 000 μgl 1 in addition other types of electro fenton based treatments such as bio electro fenton photo electro fenton and solar electro fenton have demonstrated highly effective performance in removing edcs 191 193 nevertheless this advanced treatment process requires high operation and maintenance costs the costs of conventional treatment methods are considerably lower than the costs of the electro fenton process in this regard the cost effectiveness of the proposed treatment plant should be reviewed and evaluated before wastewater treatment operation is conducted 4 4 photolysis photolysis is a photodegradation process that results from the irradiation and adsorption of a uv light photon that is conditionally processed by either direct absorption of the uv light photon or indirectly by using a photon sensitizer i e h2o2 194 in practice photolysis is a less effective process for the treatment of low edc concentrations 5 10 μg l 1 under uv light absorption with slow degradation rates however the artificial light treatment process can successfully eliminate most edcs at high concentrations 0 7 2 5 mg l 1 with a removal efficiency of 80 97 3 nevertheless under the indirect influence of h2o2 uv the influence of uv is greater than the typical disinfection practice and the standard uv aop applications 195 apart from uv light gamma radiation also exhibits potential in the degradation of edcs through photolysis rozsa et al 196 found that photolysis through gamma radiation successfully transformed atrazine at a concentration of 1 10 4 mol l 1 and 4 6 10 7 mol l 1 however gamma radiation requires high maintenance and operation costs in addition further investigations are required to evaluate the residual effects on the environment in this regard comparisons of photolysis are necessary to provide a clear assessment for selecting an efficient treatment 4 5 photocatalysis photocatalysis is a photoactivation process that transforms chemicals through the irradiation of semiconductor metal oxides as catalysts photocatalysis is among the most favored treatments due to its environmental compatibility 197 gopinath et al 198 reported that photocatalytic oxidation had been demonstrated to be a promising technique because of its nontoxicity relatively low cost lack of mass transfer limitations chemical stability and possible operation at ambient temperatures to date various types of photocatalysts have been used for this treatment process however tio2 and zno are the most frequently used catalysts for photocatalytic processes in water treatment due to their high photochemical stability and piezoelectric characteristics 198 199 in particular the application of zno exhibits higher edc removal efficiency compared with the application of tio2 in principle the efficiency of the edc removal process through photocatalyst treatment depends on process parameters such as catalyst dosage substrate concentration ph and photocatalyst modifications 200 tio2 catalyst will give the best performance compared with other catalysts in term of various design such as carbonaceous composites 197 201 in particular although a modified approach of photocatalysis and photosensitized oxidation has been widely studied to enhance the use of commercial photocatalysts tio2 the application of photocatalytic technology with tio2 to wastewater treatment has been limited within the wavelength range of radiation λ 388 nm nevertheless the photocatalysis process of uv tio2 has completely 100 eliminated pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater treatment regardless of this limitation 201 in this regard economic aspects and operational costs are major evaluation points in defining a suitable photocatalyst approach for wastewater treatment 4 6 green catalytic oxidation since introduced by collins in 2002 202 the applications of iron tetra amido macrocyclic ligand fe taml green catalysts in oxidation processes have received substantial attention from many researchers fe taml functions as a peroxide activator and provides a robust broad and green oxidation process 203 in practice the catalytic activation of h2o2 through fe taml catalysts has significantly contributed to enhancing the oxidation process in water treatment collins et al 204 determined that the slow kinetics of the h2o2 oxidation process is activated by the fe taml catalyst and results in the complete degradation of water contaminants in contrast with other catalysts fe taml can significantly produce an effective mild oxidizing condition within a shorter period i e low concentration usage neutral ph and ambient temperature conditions 202 in addition no residual toxicity product is produced from catalytic oxidation treatment in practice fe taml green catalysts have exhibited effective performance in edc removal wang et al 205 reported that the degradation of natural and synthetic estrogens is rapid with 95 of the original estrogens degraded after 15 min of treatment moreover the total degradation of phosphorothioate pesticides such as fenitrothion parathion and chlorpyrifos by using fe taml h2o2 oxidation has been observed 206 in particular the high degradation rates of fe taml catalysts are attributed to the head and tail ligand sections that considerably affect the lifetime and rates of hydrolytic degradation 204 such potential makes a remarkable contribution to the removal of emerging contaminants in wastewater treatment nevertheless data on the performance of fe taml catalysts in real wtps remain limited in this regard further investigations are necessary to develop a successful green oxidation treatment for water and wastewater plants 5 alternative treatment approached combinations of edc treatment methods have been used to overcome the limitations of single treatment methods a variety of treatment methods have been proposed through the integration of treatments into sequential and hybrid approaches these methods have successfully reduced the high concentrations of edcs and have eliminated the low concentrations of emerging contaminants in water and wastewater systems at present edc hybrid treatment methods have been mostly developed through the combination of chemical treatment with physical or biological treatment methods 207 208 in addition edc hybrid treatment methods have also been developed using a combination of physical and biological treatment methods 209 211 examples of remediation approaches for edc removal through the integration of sequential and hybrid treatments are presented in table 2 sequential treatment approaches for edcs integrate treatment in accordance with the categories followed by another treatment as indicated in table 2 two types of physical treatment methods are integrated to improve edc removal performance uf treatments are mostly considered to combine with other physical treatments such as adsorption treatment methods ac and cnt li et al 212 reported that the removal rate of ee2 increased dramatically from 7 01 to 80 03 by using a pac uf hybrid process compared with a single uf treatment as shown in fig 7 constructed wetland models have also been developed for sequential treatment to increase removal efficiency for edcs 213 214 the integration of advanced chemical processes through photocatalysis and ozonation o3 tio2 fe iii uv has successfully eliminated high bpa concentrations 100 μg l in water alternatively the integration of similar treatment processes is suitable for implementation in pre treatment and post treatment systems meanwhile hybrid treatment processes combine two or more treatments and formulate efficient removal strategies for edcs oxidation chemical based treatment processes such as ozonation have been combined with other physical and biological treatment processes combinations include ozonation with gac bac biofiltration and anaerobic treatment 112 215 216 in addition other chemical oxidation based treatments such as photocatalysis photo fenton and electrochemical oxidation have also been combined with physical based treatment processes 217 219 these hybrid treatment processes have successfully eliminated emerging contaminants at high concentrations of up to 200 μg l eliminations are comparative depending on the types of edcs removed meanwhile mbr based hybrid treatments are effective for eliminating large amounts of edc compounds in water and wastewater systems a few studies have applied hybrid mbr processes followed by functionalized biochar gac ro nf and uf these processes have successfully eliminated most edcs in wastewater samples 220 for example 500 μg l of edc compounds e1 e2 ee2 e3 bpa and 4 tert butylphenol are completely eliminated through the hybrid treatment of mbr with fbc 221 nghiem et al 222 also reported the gac post treatment was observed to significantly complement mbr treatments to obtain high overall removal efficiencies of less hydrophobic and biologically persistent trace organics the bpa contaminants found more effectively removed through the hybrid ozonation based treatment the hybrid ozonation treatment with adsorption and catalytic ozonation has successfully recorded high removal of bpa 223 hooper et al 224 observed approximately 15 blend of advanced treated reclaimed water met potable water quality criteria they conducted the ozonation treatments without the use of ro where nitrate is below the mcl of 10 mg nitrogen per liter and total dissolved solids are below the smcl of 500 mg per liter overall the performance in removing edc contaminants is improved through the mbr and hybrid ozonation based treatment system meanwhile an aop exhibits better removal performance as a hybrid based treatment 6 challenges and potentials the effects of edc on health and environmental issues have raised public concern due to their active capabilities at trace levels the trace levels of edc require accurate and sensitive quantification and detection for the broad determination of edc in environmental matrices 225 interestingly various interferences of edc sources can form new and unknown emerging contaminants that can continuously expand 226 the degradation of edc compounds can extensively lead to the formation of various matrices of by products 33 at present more studies should explore the effects of existing contaminants on the formation of intermediate reactions in water and wastewater treatment systems in addition the optimum process parameters reaction mechanisms and removal kinetics of the treated samples should be studied to ensure performance efficiency in the biological treatment method the factor of suitability capacity reliability and safety of using this biological water treatment technology is commonly raised 227 besides the uncontrolled growth of microorganisms during the treatment process could also affect the process stability in term of cleanliness and material durability 228 as reported by abu hassan et al 227 the selectivity of microorganisms towards specific contaminants could overcome the inadequacy of the water treatment to be precise the biological treatment method requires full monitoring of the living organism applied as the process started the changes in microbial communities and operating condition will affect the performances of treated water quality therefore the process sensitivity and stability of biological treatment are highly requiring a segregation of microbial community that meet the specific treatment condition of edc removal meanwhile physical treatment methods have been extensively used in edc treatment processes particularly for drinking water treatment the applications of adsorption treatments in the removal of edc are expanding with a variety of adsorbent materials the effectiveness of ac and cnt are comparable with the effectiveness of other adsorbent materials such as cellulose and graphite however the current study is mainly focused on the batch system adsorption approached the evaluation for continuous scale implementation is still limited besides the membrane filtration that shows the effectiveness is limited to a few membranes such as ro nf or uf 44 the study of membrane filtration is still limited under the selected number of compounds and process condition in addition hybrid mbr treatments have resulted in the considerable removal of edc in water and wastewater samples aop of chemical treatments are found to be the effective method for edc removal the application of chemical oxidation methods such as ozonation uv photocatalysis and photo fenton processes has been found to be the best edc removal process for most ppcps compounds however the potentials of aop and chemical treatments remain open to be studied a substantial consideration should be taken in identifying an effective treatment process that contributes efficiently besides a more advanced oxidation approached should be extensively studied in real industrial scale applications as a matter of fact optimum and standard edc treatment methods have not been well established in providing the solutions for the clean and safe conditions of water and wastewater systems the formidable challenge begins with the identification of reliable analytical techniques and edc treatment that cover complex environmental samples in addition the different conditions of various wwtps stps and drinking water treatment plants dwtps require specific operational protocols therefore the tremendous challenges when moving toward edc remediation initiatives have resulted in the exploration of a wide potential scope to identify the improvements for edc removal in principle an actual treatment solution for the removal of specific edc should be explored by integrating and optimizing advanced physical chemical and biological treatment methods the exploration and investigation of each advanced treatment process are necessary to determine unknown potential limitations the route of edc treatment is potentially exploring the importance of reproducibility efficiency toward a green environment in addition the most important aspect that potential to be focused on is the effectiveness of reducing the effects of treated edc samples on humans and other living organisms the establishment of specific treatment mechanisms is highly valuable in relation to human health and living organisms importance 7 conclusions edc has been proven to pose various potential threats to the environment and to living organisms given the various concentrations and complexity of edc compounds the treatment of edc contaminants requires accurate and appropriate sampling determination extraction quantification storage and preservation procedures in some cases each edc contaminant has different treatment procedures the appropriate selectivity of the treatment method that matched with edc characteristics is essential to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the treatment process in practice the hybrid treatment method through treatments combination is the most viable approach in eliminating various types of edc besides the aop show promising performance for application in the water treatment plant nevertheless the disadvantages of other available treatment are not limiting the application for water and wastewater treatment a continuous improvement of the limitations could extend the edc treatment and removal implementation s performance and applicability declaration of

13532,the emergence of organic micropollutants in surface waters and even groundwater and increasing salination in river delta areas drives water utility managers towards adoption and application of advanced and robust barriers in drinking water production like reverse osmosis ro filtration however water produced by ro called permeate contains hardly any minerals is corrosive and bitter in taste hence remineralisation is needed to improve the permeate water quality and comply with dutch drinking water regulation in order to test the performance of remineralisation using limestone calcite filtration a pilot scale filter has been set up and connected to an ro filtration system that treats anaerobic groundwater and equipped with on line sensors for ph conductivity and carbon dioxide the degree of re mineralisation was tested at different flow rates a smaller calcite grain size and with a lower temperature than previous studies the pilot shows that the degree of remineralisation performance can be monitored on the basis of a few on line sensors and a model that describes the dissolution of calcite keywords calcite filtration model software sensor water treatment remineralisation 1 introduction limestone filtration also called marble filtration or more specifically calcite filtration is a widely used and relatively inexpensive technique to condition soft desalinated water to a desired water hardness and alkalinity such that the filtered water is suited for potable use 1 to this end a contactor is filled with calcite i e calcium carbonate granules and permeate water is filtrated through besides temperature the rate of dissolution of calcite is determined by raw water chemistry i e ph alkalinity and lime carbonic equilibrium reactions and on physical aspects such as the filtration rate and contact time despite the availability of literature on the subject of calcite dissolution rate and the accumulation of a large data set over the past four decades see the review papers of 2 4 there is significant uncertainty in the absolute value of the dissolution rate under given conditions 5 in the netherlands the production and supply of

leads to an expression of the equilibrium co2 concentration for a given initial co2 concentration see e g 16 however the acquired results are not always accurate as one has to include the effect of the change of ph during the dissolution of caco3 and changes in solubility due to charge and electrical double layer effects on the surface of calcite 2 3 2 calculating the dissolution trajectory assuming that equilibrium will be fully reached one can calculate the required dose of aggressive co2 in the influent by the aid of 6 and the ratio of required formation of hco3 with respect to the amount of co2 that is required in a closed system graphically one can visualise the calcite dissolution trajectory as the line connecting the initial co2 vertical axis and bicarbonate concentration horizontal axis point with the intersection point of the solubility eq 6 at the desired bicarbonate concentration see fig 2 in other words initially water contains a given amount of co2 and no or very little hco3 and ca 2 and is brought into contact with calcite as soon as water gets into contact with calcite the dissolved co2 reacts resulting in a decrease of co2 concentration and an increase in hco3 concentration walking from the left point in e g the orange or blue line in fig 2 to the right when there is an abundant amount of caco3 present this process continues until the equilibrium concentrations are reached i e the orange or blue line intersects the green solubility line in a calcite contactor this same process happens albeit under the condition that the residence time is too short to achieve complete equilibrium two mechanism can be identified that limit the dissolution 1 the kinetics of the dissolution itself as described by 2 and 2 the diffusive mass transfer of the ca2 hco3 and co2 molecules through the diffuse film layer around the calcite particles 14 15 the models from these two papers are hereafter referred to as yamauchi model 15 and letterman model 14 respectively when one of the limiting mechanisms is much slower than the other the fastest mechanism can be ignored because the slowest determines the rate because calcite contactors are generally applied as packed bed reactors mass transfer is likely to be the limiting mechanism indeed 7 15 17 showed that the yamauchi model that assumes infinitely fast dissolution kinetics predicted the concentration of ca2 hco3 and co2 correctly over the whole bed height for different velocities because the letterman and yamauchi model have shown to be reliable models for calcite contactors these models are applied in this work as well they are described in the following section both the yamauchi model and the letterman model assume mass transfer in a packed bed with plug flow for one component say a in the solution this can be described with dispersed plug flow model 8 n d a d 2 c a d z 2 ε d c a d z r a t 0 here the subscript denotes the quantity belongs to the component a n d is the dimensionless axial dispersion number c the concentration in the bulk of the fluid z the dimensionless axial distance z z l l is the height of the reactor ε the porosity of the bed r the overall dissolution reaction rate and t u l the residence time of the reactor and u the superficial velocity of the fluid in this system the reaction rate describes how fast the compound a is entering the bulk fluid in a developed flow the following relation holds for mass transfer through a film layer 9 r k a a c a s c a where k overall dissolution rate constant per surface area of grain a is the interfacial area of the grain s surface per volume of liquid and c a s the concentration of a at the grain s surface which equals c a e q under the assumption that dissolution is much faster than film layer transport with the particle diameter d and its sphericity ψ a can be written as 10 a 6 1 ε d ε ψ after substitution of 9 and 10 in 8 neglecting axial dispersion and integrating the results

substituted by co2 eq 12 is used in this work to model the calcite dissolution of the reactor and 6 k a ψ is determined empirically 2 3 3 kinetic dissolution constant in 14 the contribution of dissolution kinetics diffusion through the liquid film layer and diffusion through the calcite grain s pores is taken into account with distinct model equations these equations are supplied with physics to be able to theoretically determine the value of k a for example relations that describe the boundary layer thickness and thus the mass transfer rate as function of the superficial velocity this is appealing because it allows for a prediction of reactor performance based on reactor configuration water composition and calcite properties alone however despite the increased complexity these equations cannot predict k a accurately and one has to rely on empirical relations the suggested reason for this is that surface interactions are important but cannot be captured in a model yet 7 17 18 table 2 compiles a list of kinetic dissolution constants under various temperature empty bed contact times and calcite grains the value of k is reported to be related to the square root of the filtration velocity 17 however their proposed relationship relies on 3 data points only moreover the filtration velocity does not appear to have a significant contribution for the collected values of k table 2 in case other factors could play a role see fig 3 it is important to note that differences of these k values may also be attributed to differences in operating temperatures and calcite material characteristics for example 17 report that in practice the quotient 6 k a φ can differ up to 70 due to differences in morphology and size distribution of calcite grains while process conditions average grain size and calcite content do not differ significantly we assessed whether other parameters could explain the differences in k temperature is a likely candidate and is reported to indeed have an influence 19 data of all literature sources as cited in table 2 show that the influence of temperature on k is significant and indicates a relation with activation energy e a according to the well known arrhenius relation k exp e a rt see fig 4 2 3 4 data fusion approaches different measuring options exist to allow monitoring of filtrate water quality and more specifically allow feedforward control of calcite contactors we list the following options measure co2 and measure ph and temperature in the permeate stream than calculate the initial hco3 concentration obtain the hco3 concentration by using a permeate stream ec calibration standard and measure ph and temperature in the permeate stream than calculate the initial co2 concentration obtain the hco3 concentration by using a permeate stream ec calibration standard and measure co2 and temperature in the permeate stream than calculate the ph of the permeate measure upstream the ph of the membrane feed and measure co2 at the permeate stream or obtain the hco3 concentration by using a permeate stream ec calibration standard than either calculate the bicarbonate concentration or the co2 concentration depending on the use case subsequently the triplets of two measured and one calculated value i e co2 ph hco3 1 co2 ph hco3 2 and co2 ph hco3 3 for case 1 2 and 3 respectively allow for calculating the equilibrium concentration and hence solving eq 12 near real time provided measurements are recorded near real time the accuracy and reliability of approaches 1 to 3 will be assessed in the results section approach 4 fell outside the scope of this study 2 3 5 model simulations the filtrate water quality was simulated based on the on line measurement data of the permeate contactor dimensions calcite material characteristics and process conditions the model was run on an intel i3 powered laptop using python for data processing calcite kinetics and visualisation and phreeqc 20 for calculating the speciation of calcite dissolution and account for the change of ph during the dissolution of caco3 and charge effects on the surface of calcite 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter sensitivity analysis 3 1 1 modelled conversion efficiency in order to assess the importance of parameters that drive the conversion of the dissolution of co2 or ca2 the conversion ratio is defined 15 13 η c a z 0 c a z c a z 0 c a e q using eq 13 and with the calibrated value of ka using pilot scale data 18 the efficiency of conversion is compared with results found in literature fig 5 the figure shows that the pilot experiment conditions and relatively speaking fine grain material in 18 with a grain diameter of 1 0 2 0 mm lead to approximately the same conversion efficiency as reported by 15 and hence counteract the operating temperature of 40 degrees celsius and coarse grain material 5 7 mm as reported in their work a larger grain size generally lead to lower efficiency as shown by the purple line with diamond shaped markers while higher temperatures lead to higher efficiencies 17 compared to the reference data 18 in addition to the theoretical conversion ratio or efficiency as in eq 13 we write the apparent conversion or here also referred to as the dissolution efficiency as the difference of inlet concentration compared to the outlet concentration relative to the inlet concentration 14 η app c a z 0 c a z c a z 0 the grain size and height of the calcite bed are typical design parameters to steer the calcite dissolution process without affecting the influent water quality figs 6 and 7 show the apparent and theoretical conversion efficiency of calcite or similarly carbon dioxide for varying grain sizes left pane and filter bed heights right pane of both figures note that the effect of the filter bed height can be traced back to the change in filtration velocity to keep the contact time the same for different filter bed heights furthermore the theoretical conversion efficiency will always be larger than the apparent conversion due to the equilibrium concentration being larger than zero conversely one minus the theoretical conversion will be smaller than for the apparent conversion case indeed a smaller grain size and higher filtration velocity promote calcite dissolution clearly eq 12 dictates that both the grain size as well as the filter bed height or filtration velocity have a significant effect but their effects become less pronounced with increasing residence time in addition we investigated the effect of grain size and porosity as well as the influence of the dispersion constant nd and imposed values of the dissolution rate constant ky for ground water temperature by plotting the efficiency of conversion against empty bed contact time see figs 2 and 3 in the supplementary material the dissolution of calcite is heavily dependent on the carbon dioxide equilibrium equations the effects of ph and co2 present in the influent here ro permeate stream on the apparent conversion efficiency is shown in fig 8 here we see that the apparent measurable conversion increases with decreasing ph and decreasing co2 at the same ph less carbon dioxide is dissolved than is the case if the system would be in equilibrium and hence more bicarbonate will be present in the system consequently the apparent conversion is higher for lower values of co2 concentration similarly lower ph leads to a more favourable shift of co2 to bicarbonate the difference for different ph or co2 concentrations increases with increasing bed contact time this makes sense as the driving force does not change with changing residence time but is altered by the different ph and hence its effect on the equilibrium the effect of grain size and bed height fig 6 with increasing bed contact time decreases on the apparent conversion this naturally follows from a convergence analysis of eq 12 note that the theoretical conversion eq 13 does not change with varying values of ph or inlet carbon dioxide concentration fig 4 of the supplementary materials the same results are caused by a cancelling out of the change in equilibrium concentration due to change in ph or co2 in both the modelling equations eq 12 as the equation for the theoretical conversion eq 13 3 1 2 effect of ph and initial bicarbonate concentration on co2 equilibrium the model equations rely heavily on the equilibrium concentration hence this concentration needs to be determined accurately therefore the co2 concentrations of the permeate water need to be known this can be measured directly or it can be deduced from the ph and hco3 concentrations in the permeate by applying eqs 1 4 or speciation calculations fig 9 shows the co2 equilibrium concentration affected by different water compositions that are brought into contact with an excess amount of calcite this figure demonstrates the sensitivity of the equilibrium co2 concentration to different values of initial ph and concentrations of hco3 and co2 it is clear that if only the hco3 and ph measurements are used they both need to be accurate higher accuracy is required for lower ph or a higher hco3 concentration fig 9 depicts that at a ph 4 8 a change or error of 50 in the hco3 concentration from 6 to 9 mg l yields an error of 100 in the equilibrium co2 concentration while at ph 5 3 the equilibrium concentration drops to less than 20 mg l co2 i e there is more than 50 less available note that a ph of 4 8 corresponds to a 50 lower h concentration compared to ph value 5 while a ph of 5 3 has a 50 higher h concentration due to the low conductivity of permeate stream relative large measurement errors are to be expected for both the ph and ec measurements the ec measurements relate to the hco3 concentration based on this analysis we expect that a data fusion approach using the measured values of ph and hco3 leads to a possible large bias in predicted co2 or hco3 content in the filtrate of a calcite contactor on the other hand less biased is introduced when the combination of ph and co2 or co2 and hco3 are used indeed this is supported by separate experiments see fig 5 of the supplementary material and 18 on the other hand the values of ph or hco3 concentrations negligibly influence the equilibrium co2 concentration when using co2 measurements even if their value is changed by 50 in that case only the co2 concentrations need to be accurate fig 10 3 2 data fusion within pilot scale experiments the model was fed with different sensor signals to predict the bicarbonate content such that the theoretical amount of dissolved calcite can be calculated of the filtrate of a pilot scale calcite contactor the pilot scale contactor was connected to ro treated infiltrated groundwater while the groundwater quality was subject to water quality variation due to the well configuration the well valve configuration changed daily at 8 00 am different data fusion inputs have been tested to predict the bicarbonate concentration in the filtrate hco3 f using measurements of co2 co2 m and hco3 actually hco3 m is derived from an ec calibration line see the supplementary material to predict ph in the permeate and bicarbonate in the filtrate i e co2 m ph hco3 m p using co2 m phm hco3 p and using co2 phm hco3 m p the predicted hco3 f was compared with calculated hco3 f values via the ec calibration line results are shown in fig 11 interestingly noise characteristics are kept reasonably small with the data fusion triplets co2 m ph hco3 m and co2 m phm hco3 while the signal to noise ratio is increased significantly for the triplet co2 phm hco3 m apparently the use of a ph sensitive ec measurement in combination with ph measurements lead to multiplication of noise in the model clearly this data duo leads also to a large model bias the co2 m phm p driven data fusion model slightly overestimates the hco3 f value but performs much better than phm hco3 m driven model from this test run it seems that the co2 m hco3 m driven model performs best of the three in addition to these data fusion tests the deviation in co2 sensor measurements was assessed with laboratory measurements and ec measurements and the sample standard deviation was estimated as being fairly low with a value of 4 5 see the supplementary material note that the model bias of the data fusion approaches were minimized by using a slightly smaller value of the grain diameter dp 1 25 mm in the model than would be expected using the size distribution d50 value of 1 5 mm fig 12 depicts the data fusion predictions of another calcite filter run but now the contactor has been filled with smaller grains d50 0 85 mm and the model parameter is set accordingly the results of the different data approaches are similar to those observed with larger grains finally comparing table 1 with fig 11 shows that the performance of the contactor is able to meet the requirements the aimed level of calcium hardness which is set at 1 mmol l in the dutch drinking water directive 6 calcium 0 05 mg l and bicarbonate 9 9 mg l have very low concentrations at the inlet stream hence the increase of bicarbonate to a level of approximately 140 mg l for 1 5 mm grains leads to a bicarbonate difference of 130 mg l i e 2 1 mmol l this would amount to a calcium level of 1 05 mmol l which meets the aimed hardness of drinking water within tolerance levels 4 conclusions a pilot scale experiment showed the feasibility of predicting the bicarbonate and calcium content in the filtrate water of a calcite contactor by fusing the co2 and ph sensor data with a calcite dissolution model in particular it is shown that monitoring the calcite content in mineralised reverse osmosis permeate water can be realised by a data fusion approach using co2 sensor data and either ph or electrical conductivity data using both co2 sensor data and either ph or ec measurements yielded accurate predictions of ca2 or co2 bicarbonate concentrations in the filtrate water accurate model calculations are not feasible with the combination of ph and ec measurements because a small bias in either of these measurements lead to large errors in the modelled co2 equilibrium concentration and consequently large errors in the calculated calcite concentrations although the ph value of permeate water has high measurement uncertainty sensitivity analysis and monitoring in a pilot scale set up show that the calculations which are needed for determining the dissolution of calcite can be done reliably on the basis of co2 and ph under the assumption of a correctly calibrated co2 measurement device compiled literature values showed show a stronger dependency of dissolution rate on temperature compared to other operation conditions like grain size superficial velocity or bed height it is shown that the dissolution model can be applied successfully under low temperature 12 c conditions declaration of

13532,the emergence of organic micropollutants in surface waters and even groundwater and increasing salination in river delta areas drives water utility managers towards adoption and application of advanced and robust barriers in drinking water production like reverse osmosis ro filtration however water produced by ro called permeate contains hardly any minerals is corrosive and bitter in taste hence remineralisation is needed to improve the permeate water quality and comply with dutch drinking water regulation in order to test the performance of remineralisation using limestone calcite filtration a pilot scale filter has been set up and connected to an ro filtration system that treats anaerobic groundwater and equipped with on line sensors for ph conductivity and carbon dioxide the degree of re mineralisation was tested at different flow rates a smaller calcite grain size and with a lower temperature than previous studies the pilot shows that the degree of remineralisation performance can be monitored on the basis of a few on line sensors and a model that describes the dissolution of calcite keywords calcite filtration model software sensor water treatment remineralisation 1 introduction limestone filtration also called marble filtration or more specifically calcite filtration is a widely used and relatively inexpensive technique to condition soft desalinated water to a desired water hardness and alkalinity such that the filtered water is suited for potable use 1 to this end a contactor is filled with calcite i e calcium carbonate granules and permeate water is filtrated through besides temperature the rate of dissolution of calcite is determined by raw water chemistry i e ph alkalinity and lime carbonic equilibrium reactions and on physical aspects such as the filtration rate and contact time despite the availability of literature on the subject of calcite dissolution rate and the accumulation of a large data set over the past

by using a permeate stream ec calibration standard and measure co2 and temperature in the permeate stream than calculate the ph of the permeate measure upstream the ph of the membrane feed and measure co2 at the permeate stream or obtain the hco3 concentration by using a permeate stream ec calibration standard than either calculate the bicarbonate concentration or the co2 concentration depending on the use case subsequently the triplets of two measured and one calculated value i e co2 ph hco3 1 co2 ph hco3 2 and co2 ph hco3 3 for case 1 2 and 3 respectively allow for calculating the equilibrium concentration and hence solving eq 12 near real time provided measurements are recorded near real time the accuracy and reliability of approaches 1 to 3 will be assessed in the results section approach 4 fell outside the scope of this study 2 3 5 model simulations the filtrate water quality was simulated based on the on line measurement data of the permeate contactor dimensions calcite material characteristics and process conditions the model was run on an intel i3 powered laptop using python for data processing calcite kinetics and visualisation and phreeqc 20 for calculating the speciation of calcite dissolution and account for the change of ph during the dissolution of caco3 and charge effects on the surface of calcite 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter sensitivity analysis 3 1 1 modelled conversion efficiency in order to assess the importance of parameters that drive the conversion of the dissolution of co2 or ca2 the conversion ratio is defined 15 13 η c a z 0 c a z c a z 0 c a e q using eq 13 and with the calibrated value of ka using pilot scale data 18 the efficiency of conversion is compared with results found in literature fig 5 the figure shows that the pilot experiment conditions and relatively speaking fine grain material in 18 with a grain diameter of 1 0 2 0 mm lead to approximately the same conversion efficiency as reported by 15 and hence counteract the operating temperature of 40 degrees celsius and coarse grain material 5 7 mm as reported in their work a larger grain size generally lead to lower efficiency as shown by the purple line with diamond shaped markers while higher temperatures lead to higher efficiencies 17 compared to the reference data 18 in addition to the theoretical conversion ratio or efficiency as in eq 13 we write the apparent conversion or here also referred to as the dissolution efficiency as the difference of inlet concentration compared to the outlet concentration relative to the inlet concentration 14 η app c a z 0 c a z c a z 0 the grain size and height of the calcite bed are typical design parameters to steer the calcite dissolution process without affecting the influent water quality figs 6 and 7 show the apparent and theoretical conversion efficiency of calcite or similarly carbon dioxide for varying grain sizes left pane and filter bed heights right pane of both figures note that the effect of the filter bed height can be traced back to the change in filtration velocity to keep the contact time the same for different filter bed heights furthermore the theoretical conversion efficiency will always be larger than the apparent conversion due to the equilibrium concentration being larger than zero conversely one minus the theoretical conversion will be smaller than for the apparent conversion case indeed a smaller grain size and higher filtration velocity promote calcite dissolution clearly eq 12 dictates that both the grain size as well as the filter bed height or filtration velocity have a significant effect but their effects become less pronounced with increasing residence time in addition we investigated the effect of grain size and porosity as well as the influence of the dispersion constant nd and imposed values of the dissolution rate constant ky for ground water temperature by plotting the efficiency of conversion against empty bed contact time see figs 2 and 3 in the supplementary material the dissolution of calcite is heavily dependent on the carbon dioxide equilibrium equations the effects of ph and co2 present in the influent here ro permeate stream on the apparent conversion efficiency is shown in fig 8 here we see that the apparent measurable conversion increases with decreasing ph and decreasing co2 at the same ph less carbon dioxide is dissolved than is the case if the system would be in equilibrium and hence more bicarbonate will be present in the system consequently the apparent conversion is higher for lower values of co2 concentration similarly lower ph leads to a more favourable shift of co2 to bicarbonate the difference for different ph or co2 concentrations increases with increasing bed contact time this makes sense as the driving force does not change with changing residence time but is altered by the different ph and hence its effect on the equilibrium the effect of grain size and bed height fig 6 with increasing bed contact time decreases on the apparent conversion this naturally follows from a convergence analysis of eq 12 note that the theoretical conversion eq 13 does not change with varying values of ph or inlet carbon dioxide concentration fig 4 of the supplementary materials the same results are caused by a cancelling out of the change in equilibrium concentration due to change in ph or co2 in both the modelling equations eq 12 as the equation for the theoretical conversion eq 13 3 1 2 effect of ph and initial bicarbonate concentration on co2 equilibrium the model equations rely heavily on the equilibrium concentration hence this concentration needs to be determined accurately therefore the co2 concentrations of the permeate water need to be known this can be measured directly or it can be deduced from the ph and hco3 concentrations in the permeate by applying eqs 1 4 or speciation calculations fig 9 shows the co2 equilibrium concentration affected by different water compositions that are brought into contact with an excess amount of calcite this figure demonstrates the sensitivity of the equilibrium co2 concentration to different values of initial ph and concentrations of hco3 and co2 it is clear that if only the hco3 and ph measurements are used they both need to be accurate higher accuracy is required for lower ph or a higher hco3 concentration fig 9 depicts that at a ph 4 8 a change or error of 50 in the hco3 concentration from 6 to 9 mg l yields an error of 100 in the equilibrium co2 concentration while at ph 5 3 the equilibrium concentration drops to less than 20 mg l co2 i e there is more than 50 less available note that a ph of 4 8 corresponds to a 50 lower h concentration compared to ph value 5 while a ph of 5 3 has a 50 higher h concentration due to the low conductivity of permeate stream relative large measurement errors are to be expected for both the ph and ec measurements the ec measurements relate to the hco3 concentration based on this analysis we expect that a data fusion approach using the measured values of ph and hco3 leads to a possible large bias in predicted co2 or hco3 content in the filtrate of a calcite contactor on the other hand less biased is introduced when the combination of ph and co2 or co2 and hco3 are used indeed this is supported by separate experiments see fig 5 of the supplementary material and 18 on the other hand the values of ph or hco3 concentrations negligibly influence the equilibrium co2 concentration when using co2 measurements even if their value is changed by 50 in that case only the co2 concentrations need to be accurate fig 10 3 2 data fusion within pilot scale experiments the model was fed with different sensor signals to predict the bicarbonate content such that the theoretical amount of dissolved calcite can be calculated of the filtrate of a pilot scale calcite contactor the pilot scale contactor was connected to ro treated infiltrated groundwater while the groundwater quality was subject to water quality variation due to the well configuration the well valve configuration changed daily at 8 00 am different data fusion inputs have been tested to predict the bicarbonate concentration in the filtrate hco3 f using measurements of co2 co2 m and hco3 actually hco3 m is derived from an ec calibration line see the supplementary material to predict ph in the permeate and bicarbonate in the filtrate i e co2 m ph hco3 m p using co2 m phm hco3 p and using co2 phm hco3 m p the predicted hco3 f was compared with calculated hco3 f values via the ec calibration line results are shown in fig 11 interestingly noise characteristics are kept reasonably small with the data fusion triplets co2 m ph hco3 m and co2 m phm hco3 while the signal to noise ratio is increased significantly for the triplet co2 phm hco3 m apparently the use of a ph sensitive ec measurement in combination with ph measurements lead to multiplication of noise in the model clearly this data duo leads also to a large model bias the co2 m phm p driven data fusion model slightly overestimates the hco3 f value but performs much better than phm hco3 m driven model from this test run it seems that the co2 m hco3 m driven model performs best of the three in addition to these data fusion tests the deviation in co2 sensor measurements was assessed with laboratory measurements and ec measurements and the sample standard deviation was estimated as being fairly low with a value of 4 5 see the supplementary material note that the model bias of the data fusion approaches were minimized by using a slightly smaller value of the grain diameter dp 1 25 mm in the model than would be expected using the size distribution d50 value of 1 5 mm fig 12 depicts the data fusion predictions of another calcite filter run but now the contactor has been filled with smaller grains d50 0 85 mm and the model parameter is set accordingly the results of the different data approaches are similar to those observed with larger grains finally comparing table 1 with fig 11 shows that the performance of the contactor is able to meet the requirements the aimed level of calcium hardness which is set at 1 mmol l in the dutch drinking water directive 6 calcium 0 05 mg l and bicarbonate 9 9 mg l have very low concentrations at the inlet stream hence the increase of bicarbonate to a level of approximately 140 mg l for 1 5 mm grains leads to a bicarbonate difference of 130 mg l i e 2 1 mmol l this would amount to a calcium level of 1 05 mmol l which meets the aimed hardness of drinking water within tolerance levels 4 conclusions a pilot scale experiment showed the feasibility of predicting the bicarbonate and calcium content in the filtrate water of a calcite contactor by fusing the co2 and ph sensor data with a calcite dissolution model in particular it is shown that monitoring the calcite content in mineralised reverse osmosis permeate water can be realised by a data fusion approach using co2 sensor data and either ph or electrical conductivity data using both co2 sensor data and either ph or ec measurements yielded accurate predictions of ca2 or co2 bicarbonate concentrations in the filtrate water accurate model calculations are not feasible with the combination of ph and ec measurements because a small bias in either of these measurements lead to large errors in the modelled co2 equilibrium concentration and consequently large errors in the calculated calcite concentrations although the ph value of permeate water has high measurement uncertainty sensitivity analysis and monitoring in a pilot scale set up show that the calculations which are needed for determining the dissolution of calcite can be done reliably on the basis of co2 and ph under the assumption of a correctly calibrated co2 measurement device compiled literature values showed show a stronger dependency of dissolution rate on temperature compared to other operation conditions like grain size superficial velocity or bed height it is shown that the dissolution model can be applied successfully under low temperature 12 c conditions declaration of

13533,the co culture of microalgae and specific bacteria is conducive for improving wastewater treatment efficiency in this study native bacterial strains isolated from pig biogas slurry were screened for effective biogas slurry treatment when co cultured with different microalgae scenedesmus obliquus and bacillus megaterium so b co culture was found more efficient in treating high concentration biogas slurry compared with the pure microalgae culture when the c n p ratio in biogas slurry was 106 16 1 and the initial microalgae bacteria inoculation ratio was 9 1 the co culture attained the maximum chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n removal rates of 85 98 81 03 and 65 48 respectively high c n ratio was favorable for nh4 n removal by the co culture in addition co culture with bacteria markedly increased the ratio of saturated unsaturated fatty acids in microalgae these results suggest that the co culture could efficiently reduce various nutrients in biogas slurry and simultaneously accumulate biomass with higher biofuel characteristics keywords biogas slurry consortium pollutant removal fatty acid nutrient proportion 1 introduction with the rapid development of livestock and poultry industry a large amount of biogas slurry has become an environmental pollution source causing great harm to water atmosphere and soil 1 biogas slurry mainly includes manure urine and flushing water of livestock and poultry which are ascribed to high concentration organic wastewater biogas slurry is rich in carbon organic or inorganic nitrogen urea ammonium or nitrate phosphorus and other nutrients 2 typical concentrations of major pollutants in biogas slurry can be expressed as 2000 30 000 mg l bod 200 2055 mg l tn 110 1650 mg l nh4 n and 100 620 mg l tp 3 livestock and poultry manure still contains high levels of ammonia and heavy metals especially copper zinc manganese even after anaerobic digestion which leads to environmental risks when used as farmland fertilizer 4 it is necessary to reduce carbon nitrogen especially ammonia phosphorus and other exogenous chemical pollutants in biogas slurry before environmental release or irrigation reuse 1 in recent years the use of microalgae have been hot topics in the fields of wastewater treatment and biofuel production 5 7 the combination of microalgae cultivation and biogas slurry treatment can reduce the cost of microalgae cultivation and produce high value by products while achieving biogas slurry recycling 8 12 current studies mainly focus on the treatment of low concentration wastewater such as secondary effluent from municipal sewage treatment plants 13 and domestic sewage 14 however the treatment on biogas slurry and other high concentration wastewater by microalgae is not efficient 15 because microalgae constantly release soluble microalgae products smp into the medium including carbohydrates amino acids proteins lipids organic acids bases and other components smp has a negative impact on microalgae growth and reduces biomass production 16 higher organic loads in high concentration wastewater lead to higher levels of smp resulting in greater inhibition many researchers found that co culture of microalgae and bacteria could improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment 17 18 bacteria can consume the oxygen produced by photosynthesis in microalgae and break down the organic matter in wastewater into carbon dioxide and low molecular weight organic matter providing nutrient source for the growth of microalgae 17 simultaneously the oxygen or organic matter produced by microalgae during photosynthesis can induce aerobic growth of bacteria the co culture of microalgae and bacteria can reduce part of the mechanical aeration energy consumption in the system reduce the cultivation cost and further recycle resources by harvesting microalgae biomass 18 currently the researches on the interaction between microalgae and bacteria mainly focused on the treatment of low concentration wastewater such as municipal wastewater 19 and paper mill wastewater 20 usha et al 20 treated the diluted pulp and paper mill wastewater with two species of scenedesmus sp in outdoor open pond and found that the removal rates of cod no3 n and po4 3 p were 75 65 and 71 29 respectively he et al 19 reported that chlorella vulgaris and bacteria consortia could remove n and p effectively from municipal wastewater but couldn t remove cod and the cod concentration even increased after treatment at present there are few reports on the effective treatment of high concentration wastewater and most of the studies focused on microalgae activated sludge co culture system 21 22 different microbial communities in different batches of activated sludge lead to unstable wastewater treatment efficiency 23 moreover the active sludge composition is complex and difficult to control manually the controllability of the wastewater treatment system can be enhanced by constructing a simplified microalgae bacteria co culture system with specific pair to microalgae and bacteria this study aims to screen bacteria that promote the growth of microalgae and develop a highly stable microalgae bacteria co culture system which can efficiently treat biogas slurry and obtain the mutual benefits of biogas slurry treatment and biofuel production four species of microalgae s obliquus c vulgaris c pyrenoidosa and desmodesmus sp g41 m were used for this study which had been proved to have strong antipollution abilities and good pollutant removal effects 24 firstly native bacteria that could be co cultured with microalgae and promote the microalgae growth were isolated and identified from pig farm biogas slurry to construct microalgae bacteria co culture systems for biogas slurry treatment two bacteria strains were demonstrated an outperformed promotion on the growth and pollutant removal ability of s obliquus and c vulgaris the process parameters of biogas slurry treatment by so b co cultures including the initial inoculation ratio of microalgae bacteria and the nutrient concentrations of biogas slurry were further optimized to improve the removal efficiencies of cod tp and nh4 n in addition the lipid produced by co culture was measured and evaluated for its potential application in simultaneous biofuel production this study may provide a scientific basis for the recyclable treatment of high concentration wastewater using a stable microalgae bacteria co culture system 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal strain and culture conditions s obliquus fachb 417 c vulgaris fachb 1072 and c pyrenoidosa fachb 10 were purchased from freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china desmodesmus sp g41 m was isolated from inner river water samples collected in xinjiang province china which was a high biomass and lipid production mutant strain 25 to obtain aseptic microalgae cultures 100 μl of diluted microalgae cultures 1 105 cells ml were plated onto bg11 plates containing mixed antibiotics penicillin kanamycin gentamicin and streptomycin the final concentration of each antibiotic was 25 u ml and cultured for 4 6 d single colonies were picked up from the plates and purified by plate streaking sterile microalgae were obtained after purification for 3 4 generations the strains were preserved in bg11 media at 25 2 c under cool white fluorescent light illumination at 45 μmol m2 s with the light dark cycle of 14 h 10 h the light intensity was measured by light meter auto ranging tm 205 n 2 2 experimental setups 2 2 1 isolation and identification of bacteria that can be co cultured with microalgae from biogas slurry bacteria were isolated from biogas slurry which was collected from an anaerobic tank of a pig farm in yantai shandong province and tested for their potential capacities of co culturing with microalgae biogas slurry was plated onto biogas slurry plates and lb plates and cultured for 2 3 d single colonies were picked up from the plates and purified by plate streaking bacteria that can use the secretions of microalgae for their own growth are thought to have the potential to be co cultured with microalgae the supernatants of microalgal cultures at logarithmic phase were collected by filtering through a 0 22 μm filter membrane aquo system 0 22 μm 50 mm and used for growing bacteria isolated from biogas slurry meanwhile the above bacteria were cultured in bg11 media as the control group bacteria that could grow in the supernatant of microalgae were selected and subject to molecular identification bacterial dna was extracted using sangon biotech dna extraction kit the 16s rrna gene fragments were amplified through the universal primers of 27f agagtttgatcmtggctcag and 1492 r ctacggctaccttgttacga pcr conditions for 16s rrna gene amplification were as follows 94 c for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 94 c for 1 min 57 c for 1 min and 72 c for 2 min the pcr products were sent to sangon biotech shanghai co ltd for sequencing sequencing results of five strains of bacteria were shown in supplementary information sequence analysis was performed using blast basic local alignment search tool the results of sequence analysis were shown in table 1 bacteria were related 99 sequence identity to staphylococcus sciuri staphylococcus saprophyticus kurthia gibsonii bacillus megaterium and rhizobium sp mn13 respectively it is generally believed that when the 16s rdna homology sequences are higher than 95 99 they can be considered as the same genus when the 16s rrna homology sequences are higher than 99 they can be defined as the same species in the genus 26 2 2 2 establishment of microalgae bacteria co culture system four microalgae and the above isolated bacteria that can be co cultured with microalgae were cultured in bg11 media and lb media to logarithmic phase respectively microalgae 3 105 cells ml and bacteria 1 105 cells ml were then inoculated into a 100 ml conical flask containing 50 ml bg11 media meanwhile sterile microalgae were inoculated as the control group the culture conditions were the same as described in 2 1 all the experiments were carried out in three replicates culture samples were collected daily for measuring the cell number of microalgae and the colony forming units of bacteria 2 2 3 treatment of biogas slurry by co culture systems in order to ensure the stability and traceability of the results artificial biogas slurry was used the physicochemical properties of different batches of biogas slurry change with the changes of the environment the substances in practical biogas slurry such as heavy metals are different from that of artificial biogas slurry which may have positive or negative effects on the co culture system artificial biogas slurry ⅰ was prepared according to the concentration of various pollutants in biogas slurry from pig farm 27 the formula was as follows glucose 1 g l na2co3 0 1 g l nahco3 0 1 g l na3po4 12h2o 0 25 g l urea 0 2 g l nh4 2so4 1 g l kno3 0 2 g l and nano2 0 2 g l the initial cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations were 1187 5 mg l 901 5 mg l 277 56 mg l and 22 4 mg l respectively microalgae 3 105 cells ml and bacteria 1 105 cells ml were inoculated into a 500 ml conical flask containing 200 ml artificial biogas slurry ⅰ the culture conditions were the same as described in 2 1 2 2 4 factors influencing pollutant removal in order to investigate the influence of inoculation ratio of microalgae to bacteria on biogas slurry treatment microalgae and bacteria were inoculated at different cell density ratios into a 500 ml conical flask containing 200 ml artificial biogas slurry ⅰ the bacterial inoculation density was set to 1 105 cells ml and the inoculation ratios of microalgae to bacteria were set to 3 1 6 1 9 1 12 1 and 15 1 respectively the culture conditions were the same as described in 2 1 culture samples were collected daily for testing chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents in microalgae cells in order to investigate the effects of concentrations of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus on biogas slurry treatment by co culture the proportion of nutrients was adjusted appropriately on the basis of artificial biogas slurry ⅰ three recipes of artificial biogas slurry with different nutrient concentrations were prepared the specific parameters were shown in table 2 biogas slurry ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ microalgae 9 105 cells ml and bacteria 1 105 cells ml were inoculated into a 500 ml conical flask containing 200 ml different artificial biogas slurry in order to investigate the factors that influence nh4 n removal the concentrations of nutrients were adjusted appropriately on the basis of artificial biogas slurry ⅲ three recipes of artificial biogas slurry with fixed c n p ratio but different nh4 n concentrations were prepared the specific parameters were shown in table 2 biogas slurry ⅲ 2ⅲ and 4ⅲ microalgae 9 105 cells ml and bacteria 1 105 cells ml were inoculated into a 500 ml conical flask containing 200 ml different artificial biogas slurry 2 3 growth and biomass analysis microalgae cell density was determined by cell counting using a hemocytometer and a light microscope nikon model ys100 bacteria cell density was determined by counting bacterial colony forming units on agar plates and measuring the optical density of bacterial suspension at 600 nm the biomass obtained was lyophilized and the cell dry weight was determined by gravimetric method 2 4 biochemical compositions analysis chlorophyll a chla and chlorophyll b chlb in microalgae cells were extracted with pure methanol 28 and their contents were calculated based on the absorbance values at 666 and 653 nm the contents of chla and chlb in the samples were calculated by the following equation 29 1 chl a b mg l 15 65 od666 7 34 od653 27 05 od653 11 21 od666 total lipids in microalgae cells were extracted with chloroform methanol according to the ultrasound assisted extraction method as described in a previous study 30 the lipid contents were determined gravimetrically and expressed as dry cell weight percentages fatty acids in microalgae cells were methylated by sulfuric acid methanol method 31 and the contents were determined with a gas chromatography thermo trace gc ultra thermo fisher usa the detailed procedure was described in a previous study 32 and the compounds were identified and quantified by comparing the peak area with that of the external standard of fatty acid methyl ester mixture sigma aldrich usa 2 5 physicochemical characteristics analysis five ml sample was collected daily from each conical flask starting from inoculation and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was appropriately diluted for analyses of cod tp and nh4 n according to the protocols recommended in the standard methods 33 the pollutant removal rate ri was calculated according to the following equation 34 2 ri si 0 si t si 0 ri is the removal rate of substrate i cod tp or nh4 n si t si 0 mg l are the concentrations of substrate at time t and the initial time respectively 2 6 statistical analysis results were expressed as mean value standard deviation in this study statistical analysis was performed using jmp 13 2 0 statistical software statistical significance was accepted when the p values were lower than 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening for bacteria can establish mutual beneficial relationship with microalgae in a common microalgae bacteria interaction microalgae provide organic nutrients for bacteria growth which is one of the prerequisites for a stable microalgae bacteria consortium therefore bacteria isolated from biogas slurry were first selected for their growth capacity in different microalgae supernatants among fourteen isolated bacterial strains data not shown only five strains demonstrated cell reproduction in microalgae supernatants table 3 microalgae supernatants contain organic carbon source which can be used for bacteria growth while inorganic bg11 media cannot support bacteria growth three strains s sciuri s saprophyticus and b megaterium could grow in the supernatant of s obliquus two strains s sciuri and k gibsonii could grow in the supernatant of c vulgaris two strains k gibsonii and r mn13 could grow in the supernatant of c pyrenoidosa and three strains s sciuri k gibsonii and r mn13 could grow in the supernatant of desmodesmus sp g41 m which meant those bacteria could directly utilize the secretions of different microalgae for their own growth the above results also indicated that bacteria strains showed species specific preference for the secretions of microalgal species therefore the above bacteria were co cultured with their corresponding microalgal strains respectively in subsequent experiments when s obliquus was co cultured with b megaterium both the cell densities of the microalgae and bacteria strains increased with culture time fig 1 a and b indicating that the interaction between s obliquus and b megaterium was mutually beneficial similar mutual promotion on both microalgae and bacteria growth was observed in the co culture of s sciuri and c vulgaris fig 1c and d indicating a mutualism relationship can be built between the above microalgae and bacteria strains k gibsonii repressed the growth of c vulgaris and desmodesmus sp g41 m fig 1c and g while it slightly increased the cell density of c pyrenoidosa after 8 d of co culture fig 1e in all three co cultures k gibsonii reproduced rapidly in the early stage of cultivation 2 4 d but decayed subsequently fig 1d f and h indicating it could not build a beneficial relationship with the tested algal strains r mn13 showed a similar growth trend fig 1f and h the sudden increase in microalgae cell density of c pyrenoidosa at 8 d fig 1e was in accordance with the decline of k gibsonii and r mn13 growth to a lower density after 8 d of co culture fig 1f indicating that the repression on microalgae growth might be due to the competition of bacteria with microalgae for the nutrients 35 the same strain of bacterium imposed different effects on the growth of different microalgae s sciuri inhibited the growth of desmodesmus sp g41 m but promoted the growth of c vulgaris r mn13 inhibited the growth of c pyrenoidosa but promoted the growth of desmodesmus sp g41 m those different ecological relationships might be regulated by diverse signaling molecules and physical attachment involved in species dependent interactions 36 although r mn13 promoted the growth of desmodesmus sp g41 m the amensalism relationship with its host would not benefit for a stable co culture system a mutually beneficial relationship between microalgae and bacteria is more conducive to the establishment of a stable microalgae bacteria consortium for pilot scale culture 37 38 based on the results that mutualism existed between s obliquus and b megaterium so b and between c vulgaris and s sciuri cv s the so b co culture and the cv s co culture were established and investigated in subsequent experiments b megaterium is a gram positive aerobic bacterium belonging to ammonification bacteria 39 s sciuri is also a gram positive aerobic bacterium and is able to fix the nitrogen 40 some studies have shown that bacillus can modulate water quality in aquaculture 41 however the isolates b megaterium and s sciuri have not been reported for wastewater treatment incorporation with microalgae 3 2 removal of pollutants by co cultures the treatment effects of so b co culture and cv s co culture on biogas slurry ⅰ were compared both the s obliquus culture and the b megaterium culture removed cod and tp after co culture the cod and tp removal rates significantly increased reaching 77 12 and 34 40 which were 141 91 and 42 86 higher than that of s obliquus culture and 175 63 and 133 38 higher than that of b megaterium culture fig 2 a and b this indicated the advantage of cooperation between microalgae and bacteria in wastewater treatment similar result was obtained in another study where the cod removal rate of the algae bacteria co culture was higher than that of the pure algae 42 in the co culture system o2 provided by algal photosynthesis contributed to the mineralization of heterotrophic bacteria thus improving the removal efficiency of cod the tp concentration of b megaterium culture decreased in the early stage and then increased while that of so b co culture continued to decrease during the process fig 2b indicating the phosphate released via bacterial endogenous respiration could be reused by microalgae in the co culture 43 the s obliquus culture removed a small amount of nh4 n with the removal rate of 8 16 while the nh4 n concentrations of both b megaterium culture and so b co culture gradually increased over culture time fig 2c suggesting that b megaterium might secrete nh4 n b megaterium was reported to be a highly active urea decomposing bacteria with high urease activity 690 u ml which could facilitate urea hydrolyzation to generate nh4 n 44 the c vulgaris culture could remove cod tp and nh4 n with the removal rates of 40 07 24 57 and 14 34 while the s sciuri culture could not effectively remove the above nutrients fig 2d f after co culture the removal rates of tp and nh4 n increased by 18 19 and 53 49 fig 2e and f while the removal rate of cod was slightly lower than that of c vulgaris culture fig 2d the cod concentration in s sciuri culture displayed a rapid downtrend within 24 h and then kept increasing and finally reached the same level as that in biogas slurry ⅰ fig 2d this reversal situation might be due to the organic compounds in s sciuri culture being either naturally excreted via bacterial growth or released via cytolysis 45 the cod concentrations of c vulgaris culture and cv s co culture kept decreasing and the final concentrations were almost the same the treatment of cod in cv s co culture was totally dependent on c vulgaris compared with the c vulgaris culture the cv s co culture improved the removal rates of tp and nh4 n 18 19 and 53 49 but due to the secretion of organic compounds by s sciuri the cod concentration of cv s co culture was higher than that of c vulgaris culture by contrast the so b co culture showed a significant cod removal effect compared with the s obliquus culture the so b co culture improved the removal rates of tp and cod 42 86 and 141 91 but due to the secretion of ammonia nitrogen by b megaterium the nh4 n concentration of so b co culture was higher than that of biogas slurry ⅰ the above results indicated that the effects of co cultures were better than that of pure cultures in wastewater treatment for one thing aerobic bacteria can degrade organic matter for another microalgae can absorb inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus for autotrophic growth therefore using the synergistic action between microalgae and bacteria to treat wastewater is an effective method 1 comparing the treatment effects of the two co cultures the so b co culture showed obvious advantages in treating cod and tp so it was selected to further optimize the culture conditions microalgae bacteria inoculation ratios nutrient proportions etc to improve the removal of nh4 n 3 3 optimization of conditions for pollutant removal by so b co culture 3 3 1 different microalgae bacteria inoculation ratios the biomass ratio of microalgae and bacteria can influence the nutrients removal and the space between algal and bacterial cells thus affecting microbial community structure and wastewater treatment efficiency 42 46 the influence of different inoculation ratios of microalgae to bacteria in so b co cultures on the treatment effect of biogas slurry ⅰ was investigated the growth of s obliquus was indicated by changing of chlorophyll contents which increased with culture time in all treatments after treatment for 6 8 d the chlorophylls reached the maximum values and then declined gradually fig 3 a co cultures achieved higher chlorophyll contents with the increase of microalgae ratios in the inoculums the maximum chlorophyll content was obtained in so b co culture with the highest microalgae bacteria ratio the cod concentrations of the co cultures declined rapidly within 6 d of treatment and changed slightly thereafter fig 3b thus 6 d of treatment is preferable considering the shorter treated time the cod removal rate of each co culture 3 1 6 1 9 1 12 1 and 15 1 reached 58 38 74 53 81 15 72 12 and 75 63 on 6 d among which the so b 9 1 co culture had the best effect with the increase of the proportion of microalgae from 3 1 to 6 1 the cod removal rates of the co cultures were significantly improved when the inoculation ratio continued to increase to 15 1 the cod removal rates could not be further improved but which were 94 98 110 10 higher than that of the sterile s obliquus culture ji et al 47 investigated the treatment of synthetic wastewater by co cultures with different microalgae bacteria inoculation ratios and found the 1 3 inoculation ratio was suitable for both biomass production and pollutant removal su et al 42 reported that the cod removal efficiency in municipal wastewater by microalgae sludge consortia did not differ among co cultures with different microalgae sludge ratios 10 1 5 1 and 1 1 our results demonstrated that the cod removal efficiency was significantly increased when the microalgae bacteria ratio was lower than 6 1 while excessive microalgae would not improve the cod removal even if the microalgae growth was greatly promoted fig 3c showed that the tp concentrations of all treatments decreased within 6 d exactly when the chlorophyll contents peaked and then increased with culture time the tp removal rate was significantly increased with the increase of microalgae proportion with the maximum tp removal rate of 43 04 being observed in co culture with 12 1 ratio which was 2 68 times higher than the sterile s obliquus culture nguyen et al 48 found that the tp removal efficiency by mixed culture of microalgae activated sludge was greatly improved with the fraction of microalgae in co cultures which was coincident with this study the increase of tp concentration in the late stage of so b co cultures could be probably explained by the disintegration of microorganisms leading to the release of phosphorus back into the cultures similar phenomenon was observed in an algae activated sludge symbiotic system in terms of municipal wastewater treatment 43 as being demonstrated in 3 2 fig 2c pure s obliquus culture removed a small amount of nh4 n while pure bacterium and so b co culture increased the nh4 n concentrations of the medium the higher proportion of microalgae the less increases of nh4 n concentrations were observed fig 3d confirming the dominant contribution of microalgae to nh4 n removal higher bacteria proportion in so b co culture 3 1 was not suitable for nh4 n removal in this work in addition the pig farm biogas slurry usually contains high amounts of nh4 n after anaerobic digestion and the relatively low cod tn ratio 1 3 is not favorable for efficient nitrogen removal by bacteria 49 under low c n ratio b megaterium might tend to decompose urea rapidly to generate more nh4 n than the microalgae can utilize leading to the increase of nh4 n concentration thus the nh4 n removal could be improved by adjusting the c n ratio not favorable for rapid urea decomposition which is depicted in details in the following section in summary the microalgae bacteria ratios ranged from 9 1 to 15 1 could significantly improve the removal rates of cod and tp by co cultures and there was no significant difference among different ratios considering the economic factors the so b 9 1 co culture was selected for further condition optimization in order to obtain a more efficient co culture 3 3 2 different nutrient proportions a signiﬁcant factor inﬂuencing treatment performance is the composition of wastewater previous studies had shown that the c n ratio and n p ratio in wastewater affected the cell growth of diverse microalgae and thus the removal rate of pollutants 50 52 the elementary composition of microalgal cells can provide a hint about the optimal nutrient ratio in wastewater the stumm empirical formula for microalgae is c106h263o110n16p 53 therefore two recipes of artificial biogas slurry with nutrient proportions closed to that empirical ratio were tested and compared with biogas slurry ⅰ to find out the optimal c n p ratio for treating biogas slurry by so b co culture fig 4 a showed that the chlorophyll contents of s obliquus in sterile cultures increased with culture time in biogas slurry with different nutrient proportions within 4 d and then declined rahman et al 50 reported that n p 16 1 was the most favorable growth condition for algae similar results were obtained in this study by adjusting the n p ratio from 80 2 to 16 1 the maximum chlorophyll contents of pure s obliquus culture in biogas slurry ii and iii were increased by 18 40 and 39 62 compared to that in biogas slurry i the so b co culture showed a different response from the pure microalgae culture to the c n p ratio changes there was an obvious delay in the microalgal growth of co culture when the c n ratio changed from 106 80 in biogas slurry i to 106 16 in biogas slurry ⅱ and ⅲ interestingly the co culture in biogas slurry iii could obtain a 33 03 higher chlorophyll content in the late stage comparing to the sterile microalgae culture this might be attributed to the promotion on rapid bacterial growth under a high c n ratio which resulted in a great bacterial growth advantage over microalgae in the early stage of co culture as a photosynthetic autotrophic organism microalga presented a faster reproduction rate in the early stage of co culture under a low c n ratio as observed in biogas slurry i the above results indicated the c n ratio exerted an important effect on the dominant species in the algae bacteria co cultures therefore the c n ratio should be taken into account seriously in actual application of algae bacteria co cultures in wastewater treatment fig 4b showed that both sterile s obliquus culture and so b co culture effectively treated cod in biogas slurry with different nutrient proportions the cod removal rates at 10 d of co culture were 21 82 14 86 and 6 47 ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ higher than those of sterile culture a release of phosphorus into the medium by so b co culture was observed in biogas slurry ⅰ while tp in biogas slurry ⅱ and ⅲ treated by co culture was continuously removed from the wastewater thus showed an increasing removal rate fig 4c the co culture exhibited more efficient tp removal rates than the pure microalgae culture within 2 d of treatment while they showed slightly lower tp removal rates during long time treatment 4 d by increasing the ratio of c n to 106 16 the tp removal rates were increased by 207 99 and 259 49 in biogas slurry ⅱ and ⅲ respectively fig 4d showed that the nh4 n removal rate in biogas slurry ⅰ treated by sterile s obliquus culture was 18 7 while the so b co culture could not remove nh4 n by reducing the portion of n in biogas slurry ⅱ both cultures effectively treated nh4 n with the removal rates of 59 66 and 64 31 similar results were observed in cultures grown in biogas slurry ⅲ the above results were consistent with the research of lu et al 54 that the removal rates of tp and cod in mixed dairy and slaughterhouse wastewater with high c n ratio were higher than that in dairy wastewater with low c n ratio qi et al 55 reported that higher cod n supported a better removal of nh4 n by microalgae cultures when treated high strength fermentable wastewater in summary compared with other two biogas slurry the biomass of s obliquus in biogas slurry ⅲ treated by so b co culture increased significantly meanwhile the removal rates of pollutants were significantly improved after treatment by the so b co culture the concentration of all pollutants in biogas slurry ⅱ and ⅲ were far lower than the requirements of china national standard gb 18596 2001 when the so b co culture was exposed to low c n ratio 106 80 and high nh4 n concentration 277 56 mg l it could not treat nh4 n in biogas slurry ⅰ by increasing the c n ratio and reducing the nh4 n concentration to 106 16 and 83 45 mg l the so b co culture could effectively remove nh4 n from biogas slurry ⅱ and ⅲ to find out which was the determining factor for nh4 n removal biogas slurry with fixed c n p ratio but higher nutrient concentrations were prepared for experiment as the nutrient concentrations increased the microalgae showed enhanced chlorophyll contents during cultivation and required shorter time to reach the stationary phase as observed in biogas slurry 4iii with 4 times higher nutrients fig 5 a although higher nutrient concentrations caused a slight reduction in the removal rates of nh4 n fig 5d the co culture still achieved preferable nh4 n removal rates of 58 48 and 45 70 under higher nh4 n concentrations 166 90 mg l and 333 80 mg l in biogas slurry 2iii and 4iii respectively as demonstrated in biogas slurry i with low c n ratio and 277 56 mg l nh4 n the co culture released nh4 n back into the medium yet as the nh4 n concentrations increased 333 80 mg l but maintained a fixed high c n ratio 106 16 the co culture presented continuous removal ability for nh4 n indicating the c n ratio was the key factor that controlled the nh4 n removal by co culture it s proposed that the c n ratio might regulate the interaction between microalgae and b megaterium and thus determines whether b megaterium induces a release of nh4 n yang 56 reported the nh4 n removal rate of digested piggery wastewater treated by the microalgae bacteria co culture increased from 17 46 to 56 13 with the increase of cod nh4 n ratio from 100 85 to 100 35 which was in accordance with this present result 3 4 analysis of lipid contents and fatty acid profiles dry cell weight lipid content and lipid productivity in sterile s obliquus culture and so b co culture were determined to evaluate the potential of simultaneous biofuel production by so b co culture treated biogas slurry as shown in fig 6 a and b the above indicators of microalgae bacteria co culture were 12 03 12 10 and 24 88 respectively higher than those of sterile microalgae culture indicating that b megaterium could promote the biomass yield lipid content and lipid productivity of s obliquus the lipid contents of s obliquus cultured in biogas slurry iii ranging 22 06 30 32 was comparable to that of lipid rich scenedesmus reported by shi et al 57 in addition to lipid content biomass production is an important factor contributed to the actual lipid productivity which determined the potential application of candidate microalgae 58 the lipid productivity of s obliquus cultured in biogas slurry in this study 12 27 15 32 mg l d was similar to that of s obliquus used in urban wastewater treatment reported by shen et al 59 therefore the so b co culture can be potentially applied in biofuel production while treating biogas slurry palmitic acid c16 0 stearic acid c18 0 oleic acid c18 1n9c linoleic acid c18 2n6c and linolenic acid c18 3n3 were the main fatty acid components in biodiesel 60 as shown in fig 6c the fatty acids in s obliquus mainly composed of c16 0 c18 0 c18 2n6c and c18 3n6 fitting for the basic criterion on carbon chain length of biodiesel c15 c22 61 the contents of the above fatty acids in sterile s obliquus culture were 41 80 9 03 6 81 and 29 48 respectively after co culture with b megaterium the contents of c16 0 and c18 0 increased by 12 33 and 12 10 while the contents of c18 2n6c and c18 3n6 decreased by 0 68 and 14 55 respectively the total content of fatty acids c16 0 c18 0 and c18 2n6c that suitable for biodiesel reached 81 42 in so b co culture which was improved by 23 77 compared with that in sterile microalgae the fatty acids in microalgae mainly include saturated fatty acids sfa and unsaturated fatty acids ufa and ufa is further divided into monounsaturated fatty acids mufa and polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa relevant studies have shown that raw materials containing fatty acids with low unsaturation level are more suitable for biodiesel production 61 since high level of unsaturated fatty acids will reduce oxidation stability and affect combustion heat and cetane number 62 after co culture with b megaterium the sfa content increased by 24 03 while the ufa content decreased by 19 44 fig 6d which was caused by the significant reduction in mufa and pufa contents therefore compared with sterile s obliquus culture the fatty acid composition of s obliquus in so b co culture was more suitable for biofuel production 4 conclusions a native bacterial strain b megaterium was isolated for the successful construction of a microalgae bacteria co culture system with s obliquus which demonstrated a high efficiency on biogas slurry treatment the c n ratio was the key factor regulating nh4 n removal by co culture the fatty acid composition of so b co culture was more suitable for biofuel production than that of sterile s obliquus culture the above results indicate the great potential of combining biogas slurry treatment and biofuel production by so b co culture which can not only alleviate the harm of biogas slurry to the environment but also reduce the cost of large scale microalgae cultivation this study is the first to report the key factor regulating nh4 n removal by microalgae bacteria co culture however regulatory mechanism needs to be explored in future work funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china nos 42076138

13533,the co culture of microalgae and specific bacteria is conducive for improving wastewater treatment efficiency in this study native bacterial strains isolated from pig biogas slurry were screened for effective biogas slurry treatment when co cultured with different microalgae scenedesmus obliquus and bacillus megaterium so b co culture was found more efficient in treating high concentration biogas slurry compared with the pure microalgae culture when the c n p ratio in biogas slurry was 106 16 1 and the initial microalgae bacteria inoculation ratio was 9 1 the co culture attained the maximum chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n removal rates of 85 98 81 03 and 65 48 respectively high c n ratio was favorable for nh4 n removal by the co culture in addition co culture with bacteria markedly increased the ratio of saturated unsaturated fatty acids in microalgae these results suggest that the co culture could efficiently reduce various nutrients in biogas slurry and simultaneously accumulate biomass with higher biofuel characteristics keywords biogas slurry consortium pollutant removal fatty acid nutrient proportion 1 introduction with the rapid development of livestock and poultry industry a large amount of biogas slurry has become an environmental pollution source causing great harm to water atmosphere and soil 1 biogas slurry mainly includes manure urine and flushing water of livestock and poultry which are ascribed to high concentration organic wastewater biogas slurry is rich in carbon organic or inorganic nitrogen urea ammonium or nitrate phosphorus and other nutrients 2 typical concentrations of major pollutants in biogas slurry can be expressed as 2000 30 000 mg l bod 200 2055 mg l tn 110 1650 mg l nh4 n and 100 620 mg l tp 3 livestock and poultry manure still contains high levels of ammonia and heavy metals especially copper zinc manganese even after anaerobic digestion which leads to environmental risks when used as farmland fertilizer 4 it is necessary to reduce carbon nitrogen especially ammonia phosphorus and other exogenous chemical pollutants in biogas slurry before environmental release or irrigation reuse 1 in recent years the use of microalgae have been hot topics in the fields of wastewater treatment and biofuel production 5 7 the combination of microalgae cultivation and biogas slurry treatment can reduce the cost of microalgae cultivation and produce high value by products while achieving biogas slurry recycling 8 12 current studies mainly focus on the treatment of low concentration wastewater such as secondary effluent from municipal sewage treatment plants 13 and domestic sewage 14 however the treatment on biogas slurry and other high concentration wastewater by microalgae is not efficient 15 because microalgae constantly release soluble microalgae products smp into the medium including carbohydrates amino acids proteins lipids organic acids bases and other components smp has a negative impact on microalgae growth and reduces biomass production 16 higher organic loads in high concentration wastewater lead to higher levels of smp resulting in greater inhibition many researchers found that co culture of microalgae and bacteria could improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment 17 18 bacteria can consume the oxygen produced by photosynthesis in microalgae and break down the organic matter in wastewater into carbon dioxide and low molecular weight organic matter providing nutrient source for the growth of microalgae 17 simultaneously the oxygen or organic matter produced by microalgae during photosynthesis can induce aerobic growth of bacteria the co culture of microalgae and bacteria can reduce part of the mechanical aeration energy consumption in the system reduce the cultivation cost and further recycle resources by harvesting microalgae biomass 18 currently the researches on the interaction between microalgae and bacteria mainly focused on the treatment of low concentration wastewater such as municipal wastewater 19 and paper mill wastewater 20 usha et al 20 treated the diluted pulp and paper mill wastewater with two species of scenedesmus sp in outdoor open pond and found that the removal rates of cod no3 n and po4 3 p were 75 65 and 71 29 respectively he et al 19 reported that chlorella vulgaris and bacteria consortia could remove n and p effectively from municipal wastewater but couldn t remove cod and the cod concentration even increased after treatment at present there are few reports on the effective treatment of high concentration wastewater and most of the studies focused on microalgae activated sludge co culture system 21 22 different microbial communities in different batches of activated sludge lead to unstable wastewater treatment efficiency 23 moreover the active sludge composition is complex and difficult to control manually the controllability of the wastewater treatment system can be enhanced by constructing a simplified microalgae bacteria co culture system with specific pair to microalgae and bacteria this study aims to screen bacteria that promote the growth of microalgae and develop a highly stable microalgae bacteria co culture system which can efficiently treat biogas slurry and obtain the mutual benefits of biogas slurry treatment and biofuel production four species of microalgae s obliquus c vulgaris c pyrenoidosa and desmodesmus sp g41 m were used for this study which had been proved to have strong antipollution abilities and good pollutant removal effects 24 firstly native bacteria that could be co cultured with microalgae and promote the microalgae growth were isolated and identified from pig farm biogas slurry to construct microalgae bacteria co culture systems for biogas slurry treatment two bacteria strains were demonstrated an outperformed promotion on the growth and pollutant removal ability of s obliquus and c vulgaris the process parameters of biogas slurry treatment by so b co cultures including the initial inoculation ratio of microalgae bacteria and the nutrient concentrations of biogas slurry were further optimized to improve the removal efficiencies of cod tp and nh4 n in addition the lipid produced by co culture was measured and evaluated for its potential application in simultaneous biofuel production this study may provide a scientific basis for the recyclable treatment of high concentration wastewater using a stable microalgae bacteria co culture system 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal strain and culture conditions s obliquus fachb 417 c vulgaris fachb 1072 and c pyrenoidosa fachb 10 were purchased from freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china desmodesmus sp g41 m was isolated from inner river water samples collected in xinjiang province china which was a high biomass and lipid production mutant strain 25 to obtain aseptic microalgae cultures 100 μl of diluted microalgae cultures 1 105 cells ml were plated onto bg11 plates containing mixed antibiotics penicillin kanamycin gentamicin and streptomycin the final concentration of each antibiotic was 25 u ml and cultured for 4 6 d single colonies were picked up from the plates and purified by plate streaking sterile microalgae were obtained after purification for 3 4 generations the strains were preserved in bg11 media at 25 2 c under cool white fluorescent light illumination at 45 μmol m2 s with the light dark cycle of 14 h 10 h the light intensity was measured by light meter auto ranging tm 205 n 2 2 experimental setups 2 2 1 isolation and identification of bacteria that can be co cultured with microalgae from biogas slurry bacteria were isolated from biogas slurry which was collected from an anaerobic tank of a pig farm in yantai shandong province and tested for their potential capacities of co culturing with microalgae biogas slurry was plated onto biogas slurry plates and lb plates and cultured for 2 3 d single colonies were picked up from the plates and purified by plate streaking bacteria that can use the secretions of microalgae for their own growth are thought to have the potential to be co cultured with microalgae the supernatants of microalgal cultures at logarithmic phase were collected by filtering through a 0 22 μm filter membrane aquo system 0 22 μm 50 mm and used for growing bacteria isolated from biogas slurry meanwhile the above bacteria were cultured in bg11 media as the control group bacteria that could grow in the supernatant of microalgae were selected and subject to molecular identification bacterial dna was extracted using sangon biotech dna extraction kit the 16s rrna gene fragments were amplified through the universal primers of 27f agagtttgatcmtggctcag and 1492 r ctacggctaccttgttacga pcr conditions for 16s rrna gene amplification were as follows 94 c for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 94 c for 1 min 57 c for 1 min and 72 c for 2 min the pcr products were sent to sangon biotech shanghai co ltd for sequencing sequencing results of five strains of bacteria were shown in supplementary information sequence analysis was performed using blast basic local alignment search tool the results of sequence analysis were shown in table 1 bacteria were related 99 sequence identity to staphylococcus sciuri staphylococcus saprophyticus kurthia gibsonii bacillus megaterium and rhizobium sp mn13 respectively it is generally believed that when the 16s rdna homology sequences are higher than 95 99 they can be considered as the same genus when the 16s rrna homology sequences are higher than 99 they can be defined as the same species in the genus 26 2 2 2 establishment of microalgae bacteria co culture system four microalgae and the above isolated bacteria that can be co cultured with microalgae were cultured in bg11 media and lb media to logarithmic phase respectively microalgae 3 105 cells ml and bacteria 1 105 cells ml were then inoculated into a 100 ml conical flask containing 50 ml bg11 media meanwhile sterile microalgae were inoculated as the control group the culture conditions were the same as described in 2 1 all the experiments were carried out in three replicates culture samples were collected daily for measuring the cell number of microalgae and the colony forming units of bacteria 2 2 3 treatment of biogas slurry by co culture systems in order to ensure the stability and traceability of the results artificial biogas slurry was used the physicochemical properties of different batches of biogas slurry change with the changes of the environment the substances in practical biogas slurry such as heavy metals are different from that of artificial biogas slurry which may have positive or negative effects on the co culture system artificial biogas slurry ⅰ was prepared according to the concentration of various pollutants in biogas slurry from pig farm 27 the formula was as follows glucose 1 g l na2co3 0 1 g l nahco3 0 1 g l na3po4 12h2o 0 25 g l urea 0 2 g l nh4 2so4 1 g l kno3 0 2 g l and nano2 0 2 g l the initial cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations were 1187 5 mg l 901 5 mg l 277 56 mg l and 22 4 mg l respectively microalgae 3 105 cells ml and bacteria 1 105 cells ml were inoculated into a 500 ml conical flask containing 200 ml artificial biogas slurry ⅰ the culture conditions were the same as described in 2 1 2 2 4 factors influencing pollutant removal in order to investigate the influence of inoculation ratio of microalgae to bacteria on biogas slurry treatment microalgae and bacteria were inoculated at different cell density ratios into a 500 ml conical flask containing 200 ml artificial biogas slurry ⅰ the bacterial inoculation density was set to 1 105 cells ml and the inoculation ratios of microalgae to bacteria were set to 3 1 6 1 9 1 12 1 and 15 1 respectively the culture conditions were the same as described in 2 1 culture samples were collected daily for testing chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents in microalgae cells in order to investigate the effects of concentrations of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus on biogas slurry treatment by co culture the proportion of nutrients was adjusted appropriately on the basis of artificial biogas slurry ⅰ three recipes of artificial biogas slurry with different nutrient concentrations were prepared the specific parameters were shown in table 2 biogas slurry ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ microalgae 9 105 cells ml and bacteria 1 105 cells ml were inoculated into a 500 ml conical flask containing 200 ml different artificial biogas slurry in order to investigate the factors that influence nh4 n removal the concentrations of nutrients were adjusted appropriately on the basis of artificial biogas slurry ⅲ three recipes of artificial biogas slurry with fixed c n p ratio but different nh4 n concentrations were prepared the specific parameters were shown in table 2 biogas slurry ⅲ 2ⅲ and 4ⅲ microalgae 9 105 cells ml and bacteria 1 105 cells ml were inoculated into a 500 ml conical flask containing 200 ml different artificial biogas slurry 2 3 growth and biomass analysis microalgae cell density was determined by cell counting using a hemocytometer and a light microscope nikon model ys100 bacteria cell density was determined by counting bacterial colony forming units on agar plates and measuring the optical density of bacterial suspension at 600 nm the biomass obtained was lyophilized and the cell dry weight was determined by gravimetric method 2 4 biochemical compositions analysis chlorophyll a chla and chlorophyll b chlb in microalgae cells were extracted with pure methanol 28 and their contents were calculated based on the absorbance values at 666 and 653 nm the contents of chla and chlb in the samples were calculated by the following equation 29 1 chl a b mg l 15 65 od666 7 34 od653 27 05 od653 11 21 od666 total lipids in microalgae cells were extracted with chloroform methanol according to the ultrasound assisted extraction method as described in a previous study 30 the lipid contents were determined gravimetrically and expressed as dry cell weight percentages fatty acids in microalgae cells were methylated by sulfuric acid methanol method 31 and the contents were determined with a gas chromatography thermo trace gc ultra thermo fisher usa the detailed procedure was described in a previous study 32 and the compounds were identified and quantified by comparing the peak area with that of the external standard of fatty acid methyl ester mixture sigma aldrich usa 2 5 physicochemical characteristics analysis five ml sample was collected daily from each conical flask starting from inoculation and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was appropriately diluted for analyses of cod tp and nh4 n according to the protocols recommended in the standard methods 33 the pollutant removal rate ri was calculated according to the following equation 34 2 ri si 0 si t si 0 ri is the removal rate of substrate i cod tp or nh4 n si t si 0 mg l are the concentrations of substrate at time t and the initial time respectively 2 6 statistical analysis results were expressed as mean value standard deviation in this study statistical analysis was performed using jmp 13 2 0 statistical software statistical significance was accepted when the p values were lower than 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening for bacteria can establish mutual beneficial relationship with microalgae in a common microalgae bacteria interaction microalgae provide organic nutrients for bacteria growth which is one of the prerequisites for a stable microalgae bacteria consortium therefore bacteria isolated from biogas slurry were first selected for their growth capacity in different microalgae supernatants among fourteen isolated bacterial strains data not shown only five strains demonstrated cell reproduction in microalgae supernatants table 3 microalgae supernatants contain organic carbon source which can be used for bacteria growth while inorganic bg11 media cannot support bacteria growth three strains s sciuri s saprophyticus and b megaterium could grow in the supernatant of s obliquus two strains s sciuri and k gibsonii could grow in the supernatant of c vulgaris two strains k gibsonii and r mn13 could grow in the supernatant of c pyrenoidosa and three strains s sciuri k gibsonii and r mn13 could grow in the supernatant of desmodesmus sp g41 m which meant those bacteria could directly utilize the secretions of different microalgae for their own growth the above results also indicated that bacteria strains showed species specific preference for the secretions of microalgal species therefore the above bacteria were co cultured with their corresponding microalgal strains respectively in subsequent experiments when s obliquus was co cultured with b megaterium both the cell densities of the microalgae and bacteria strains increased with culture time fig 1 a and b indicating that the interaction between s obliquus and b megaterium was mutually beneficial similar mutual promotion on both microalgae and bacteria growth was observed in the co culture of s sciuri and c vulgaris fig 1c and d indicating a mutualism relationship can be built between the above microalgae and bacteria strains k gibsonii repressed the growth of c vulgaris and desmodesmus sp g41 m fig 1c and g while it slightly increased the cell density of c pyrenoidosa after 8 d of co culture fig 1e in all three co cultures k gibsonii reproduced rapidly in the early stage of cultivation 2 4 d but decayed subsequently fig 1d f and h indicating it could not build a beneficial relationship with the tested algal strains r mn13 showed a similar growth trend fig 1f and h the sudden increase in microalgae cell density of c pyrenoidosa at 8 d fig 1e was in accordance with the decline of k gibsonii and r mn13 growth to a lower density after 8 d of co culture fig 1f indicating that the repression on microalgae growth might be due to the competition of bacteria with microalgae for the nutrients 35 the same strain of bacterium imposed different effects on the growth of different microalgae s sciuri inhibited the growth of desmodesmus sp g41 m but promoted the growth of c vulgaris r mn13 inhibited the growth of c pyrenoidosa but promoted the growth of desmodesmus sp g41 m those different ecological relationships might be regulated by diverse signaling molecules and physical attachment involved in species dependent interactions 36 although r mn13 promoted the growth of desmodesmus sp g41 m the amensalism relationship with its host would not benefit for a stable co culture system a mutually beneficial relationship between microalgae and bacteria is more conducive to the establishment of a stable microalgae bacteria consortium for pilot scale culture 37 38 based on the results that mutualism existed between s obliquus and b megaterium so b and between c vulgaris and s sciuri cv s the so b co culture and the cv s co culture were established and investigated in subsequent experiments b megaterium is a gram positive aerobic bacterium belonging to ammonification bacteria 39 s sciuri is also a gram positive aerobic bacterium and is able to fix the nitrogen 40 some studies have shown that bacillus can modulate water quality in aquaculture 41 however the isolates b megaterium and s sciuri have not been reported for wastewater treatment incorporation with microalgae 3 2 removal of pollutants by co cultures the treatment effects of so b co culture and cv s co culture on biogas slurry ⅰ were compared both the s obliquus culture and the b megaterium culture removed cod and tp after co culture the cod and tp removal rates significantly increased reaching 77 12 and 34 40 which were 141 91 and 42 86 higher than that of s obliquus culture and 175 63 and 133 38 higher than that of b megaterium culture fig 2 a and b this indicated the advantage of cooperation between microalgae and bacteria in wastewater treatment similar result was obtained in another study where the cod removal rate of the algae bacteria co culture was higher than that of the pure algae 42 in the co culture system o2 provided by algal photosynthesis contributed to the mineralization of heterotrophic bacteria thus improving the removal efficiency of cod the tp concentration of b megaterium culture decreased in the early stage and then increased while that of so b co culture continued to decrease during the process fig 2b indicating the phosphate released via bacterial endogenous respiration could be reused by microalgae in the co culture 43 the s obliquus culture removed a small amount of nh4 n with the removal rate of 8 16 while the nh4 n concentrations of both b megaterium culture and so b co culture gradually increased over culture time fig 2c suggesting that b megaterium might secrete nh4 n b megaterium was reported to be a highly active urea decomposing bacteria with high urease activity 690 u ml which could facilitate urea hydrolyzation to generate nh4 n 44 the c vulgaris culture could remove cod tp and nh4 n with the removal rates of 40 07 24 57 and 14 34 while the s sciuri culture could not effectively remove the above nutrients fig 2d f after co culture the removal rates of tp and nh4 n increased by 18 19 and 53 49 fig 2e and f while the removal rate of cod was slightly lower than that of c vulgaris culture fig 2d the cod concentration in s sciuri culture displayed a rapid downtrend within 24 h and then kept increasing and finally reached the same level as that in biogas slurry ⅰ fig 2d this reversal situation might be due to the organic compounds in s sciuri culture being either naturally excreted via bacterial growth or released via cytolysis 45 the cod concentrations of c vulgaris culture and cv s co culture kept decreasing and the final concentrations were almost the same the treatment of cod in cv s co culture was totally dependent on c vulgaris compared with the c vulgaris culture the cv s co culture improved the removal rates of tp and nh4 n 18 19 and 53 49 but due to the secretion of organic compounds by s sciuri the cod concentration of cv s co culture was higher than that of c vulgaris culture by contrast the so b co culture showed a significant cod removal effect compared with the s obliquus culture the so b co culture improved the removal rates of tp and cod 42 86 and 141 91 but due to the secretion of ammonia nitrogen by b megaterium the nh4 n concentration of so b co culture was higher than that of biogas slurry ⅰ the above results indicated that the effects of co cultures were better than that of pure cultures in wastewater treatment for one thing aerobic bacteria can degrade organic matter for another microalgae can absorb inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus for autotrophic growth therefore using the synergistic action between microalgae and bacteria to treat wastewater is an effective method 1 comparing the treatment effects of the two co cultures the so b co culture showed obvious advantages in treating cod and tp so it was selected to further optimize the culture conditions microalgae bacteria inoculation ratios nutrient proportions etc to improve the removal of nh4 n 3 3 optimization of conditions for pollutant removal by so b co culture 3 3 1 different microalgae bacteria inoculation ratios the biomass ratio of microalgae and bacteria can influence the nutrients removal and the space between algal and bacterial cells thus affecting microbial community structure and wastewater treatment efficiency 42 46 the influence of different inoculation ratios of microalgae to bacteria in so b co cultures on the treatment effect of biogas slurry ⅰ was investigated the growth of s obliquus was indicated by changing of chlorophyll contents which increased with culture time in all treatments after treatment for 6 8 d the chlorophylls reached the maximum values and then declined gradually fig 3 a co cultures achieved higher chlorophyll contents with the increase of microalgae ratios in the inoculums the maximum chlorophyll content was obtained in so b co culture with the highest microalgae bacteria ratio the cod concentrations of the co cultures declined rapidly within 6 d of treatment and changed slightly thereafter fig 3b thus 6 d of treatment is preferable considering the shorter treated time the cod removal rate of each co culture 3 1 6 1 9 1 12 1 and 15 1 reached 58 38 74 53 81 15 72 12 and 75 63 on 6 d among which the so b 9 1 co culture had the best effect with the increase of the proportion of microalgae from 3 1 to 6 1 the cod removal rates of the co cultures were significantly improved when the inoculation ratio continued to increase to 15 1 the cod removal rates could not be further improved but which were 94 98 110 10 higher than that of the sterile s obliquus culture ji et al 47 investigated the treatment of synthetic wastewater by co cultures with different microalgae bacteria inoculation ratios and found the 1 3 inoculation ratio was suitable for both biomass production and pollutant removal su et al 42 reported that the cod removal efficiency in municipal wastewater by microalgae sludge consortia did not differ among co cultures with different microalgae sludge ratios 10 1 5 1 and 1 1 our results demonstrated that the cod removal efficiency was significantly increased when the microalgae bacteria ratio was lower than 6 1 while excessive microalgae would not improve the cod removal even if the microalgae growth was greatly promoted fig 3c showed that the tp concentrations of all treatments decreased within 6 d exactly when the chlorophyll contents peaked and then increased with culture time the tp removal rate was significantly increased with the increase of microalgae proportion with the maximum tp removal rate of 43 04 being observed in co culture with 12 1 ratio which was 2 68 times higher than the sterile s obliquus culture nguyen et al 48 found that the tp removal efficiency by mixed culture of microalgae activated sludge was greatly improved with the fraction of microalgae in co cultures which was coincident with this study the increase of tp concentration in the late stage of so b co cultures could be probably explained by the disintegration of microorganisms leading to the release of phosphorus back into the cultures similar phenomenon was observed in an algae activated sludge symbiotic system in terms of municipal wastewater treatment 43 as being demonstrated in 3 2 fig 2c pure s obliquus culture removed a small amount of nh4 n while pure bacterium and so b co culture increased the nh4 n concentrations of the medium the higher proportion of microalgae the less increases of nh4 n concentrations were observed fig 3d confirming the dominant contribution of microalgae to nh4 n removal higher bacteria proportion in so b co culture 3 1 was not suitable for nh4 n removal in this work in addition the pig farm biogas slurry usually contains high amounts of nh4 n after anaerobic digestion and the relatively low cod tn ratio 1 3 is not favorable for efficient nitrogen removal by bacteria 49 under low c n ratio b megaterium might tend to decompose urea rapidly to generate more nh4 n than the microalgae can utilize leading to the increase of nh4 n concentration thus the nh4 n removal could be improved by adjusting the c n ratio not favorable for rapid urea decomposition which is depicted in details in the following section in summary the microalgae bacteria ratios ranged from 9 1 to 15 1 could significantly improve the removal rates of cod and tp by co cultures and there was no significant difference among different ratios considering the economic factors the so b 9 1 co culture was selected for further condition optimization in order to obtain a more efficient co culture 3 3 2 different nutrient proportions a signiﬁcant factor inﬂuencing treatment performance is the composition of wastewater previous studies had shown that the c n ratio and n p ratio in wastewater affected the cell growth of diverse microalgae and thus the removal rate of pollutants 50 52 the elementary composition of microalgal cells can provide a hint about the optimal nutrient ratio in wastewater the stumm empirical formula for microalgae is c106h263o110n16p 53 therefore two recipes of artificial biogas slurry with nutrient proportions closed to that empirical ratio were tested and compared with biogas slurry ⅰ to find out the optimal c n p ratio for treating biogas slurry by so b co culture fig 4 a showed that the chlorophyll contents of s obliquus in sterile cultures increased with culture time in biogas slurry with different nutrient proportions within 4 d and then declined rahman et al 50 reported that n p 16 1 was the most favorable growth condition for algae similar results were obtained in this study by adjusting the n p ratio from 80 2 to 16 1 the maximum chlorophyll contents of pure s obliquus culture in biogas slurry ii and iii were increased by 18 40 and 39 62 compared to that in biogas slurry i the so b co culture showed a different response from the pure microalgae culture to the c n p ratio changes there was an obvious delay in the microalgal growth of co culture when the c n ratio changed from 106 80 in biogas slurry i to 106 16 in biogas slurry ⅱ and ⅲ interestingly the co culture in biogas slurry iii could obtain a 33 03 higher chlorophyll content in the late stage comparing to the sterile microalgae culture this might be attributed to the promotion on rapid bacterial growth under a high c n ratio which resulted in a great bacterial growth advantage over microalgae in the early stage of co culture as a photosynthetic autotrophic organism microalga presented a faster reproduction rate in the early stage of co culture under a low c n ratio as observed in biogas slurry i the above results indicated the c n ratio exerted an important effect on the dominant species in the algae bacteria co cultures therefore the c n ratio should be taken into account seriously in actual application of algae bacteria co cultures in wastewater treatment fig 4b showed that both sterile s obliquus culture and so b co culture effectively treated cod in biogas slurry with different nutrient proportions the cod removal rates at 10 d of co culture were 21 82 14 86 and 6 47 ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ higher than those of sterile culture a release of phosphorus into the medium by so b co culture was observed in biogas slurry ⅰ while tp in biogas slurry ⅱ and ⅲ treated by co culture was continuously removed from the wastewater thus showed an increasing removal rate fig 4c the co culture exhibited more efficient tp removal rates than the pure microalgae culture within 2 d of treatment while they showed slightly lower tp removal rates during long time treatment 4 d by increasing the ratio of c n to 106 16 the tp removal rates were increased by 207 99 and 259 49 in biogas slurry ⅱ and ⅲ respectively fig 4d showed that the nh4 n removal rate in biogas slurry ⅰ treated by sterile s obliquus culture was 18 7 while the so b co culture could not remove nh4 n by reducing the portion of n in biogas slurry ⅱ both cultures effectively treated nh4 n with the removal rates of 59 66 and 64 31 similar results were observed in cultures grown in biogas slurry ⅲ the above results were consistent with the research of lu et al 54 that the removal rates of tp and cod in mixed dairy and slaughterhouse wastewater with high c n ratio were higher than that in dairy wastewater with low c n ratio qi et al 55 reported that higher cod n supported a better removal of nh4 n by microalgae cultures when treated high strength fermentable wastewater in summary compared with other two biogas slurry the biomass of s obliquus in biogas slurry ⅲ treated by so b co culture increased significantly meanwhile the removal rates of pollutants were significantly improved after treatment by the so b co culture the concentration of all pollutants in biogas slurry ⅱ and ⅲ were far lower than the requirements of china national standard gb 18596 2001 when the so b co culture was exposed to low c n ratio 106 80 and high nh4 n concentration 277 56 mg l it could not treat nh4 n in biogas slurry ⅰ by increasing the c n ratio and reducing the nh4 n concentration to 106 16 and 83 45 mg l the so b co culture could effectively remove nh4 n from biogas slurry ⅱ and ⅲ to find out which was the determining factor for nh4 n removal biogas slurry with fixed c n p ratio but higher nutrient concentrations were prepared for experiment as the nutrient concentrations increased the microalgae showed enhanced chlorophyll contents during cultivation and required shorter time to reach the stationary phase as observed in biogas slurry 4iii with 4 times higher nutrients fig 5 a although higher nutrient concentrations caused a slight reduction in the removal rates of nh4 n fig 5d the co culture still achieved preferable nh4 n removal rates of 58 48 and 45 70 under higher nh4 n concentrations 166 90 mg l and 333 80 mg l in biogas slurry 2iii and 4iii respectively as demonstrated in biogas slurry i with low c n ratio and 277 56 mg l nh4 n the co culture released nh4 n back into the medium yet as the nh4 n concentrations increased 333 80 mg l but maintained a fixed high c n ratio 106 16 the co culture presented continuous removal ability for nh4 n indicating the c n ratio was the key factor that controlled the nh4 n removal by co culture it s proposed that the c n ratio might regulate the interaction between microalgae and b megaterium and thus determines whether b megaterium induces a release of nh4 n yang 56 reported the nh4 n removal rate of digested piggery wastewater treated by the microalgae bacteria co culture increased from 17 46 to 56 13 with the increase of cod nh4 n ratio from 100 85 to 100 35 which was in accordance with this present result 3 4 analysis of lipid contents and fatty acid profiles dry cell weight lipid content and lipid productivity in sterile s obliquus culture and so b co culture were determined to evaluate the potential of simultaneous biofuel production by so b co culture treated biogas slurry as shown in fig 6 a and b the above indicators of microalgae bacteria co culture were 12 03 12 10 and 24 88 respectively higher than those of sterile microalgae culture indicating that b megaterium could promote the biomass yield lipid content and lipid productivity of s obliquus the lipid contents of s obliquus cultured in biogas slurry iii ranging 22 06 30 32 was comparable to that of lipid rich scenedesmus reported by shi et al 57 in addition to lipid content biomass production is an important factor contributed to the actual lipid productivity which determined the potential application of candidate microalgae 58 the lipid productivity of s obliquus cultured in biogas slurry in this study 12 27 15 32 mg l d was similar to that of s obliquus used in urban wastewater treatment reported by shen et al 59 therefore the so b co culture can be potentially applied in biofuel production while treating biogas slurry palmitic acid c16 0 stearic acid c18 0 oleic acid c18 1n9c linoleic acid c18 2n6c and linolenic acid c18 3n3 were the main fatty acid components in biodiesel 60 as shown in fig 6c the fatty acids in s obliquus mainly composed of c16 0 c18 0 c18 2n6c and c18 3n6 fitting for the basic criterion on carbon chain length of biodiesel c15 c22 61 the contents of the above fatty acids in sterile s obliquus culture were 41 80 9 03 6 81 and 29 48 respectively after co culture with b megaterium the contents of c16 0 and c18 0 increased by 12 33 and 12 10 while the contents of c18 2n6c and c18 3n6 decreased by 0 68 and 14 55 respectively the total content of fatty acids c16 0 c18 0 and c18 2n6c that suitable for biodiesel reached 81 42 in so b co culture which was improved by 23 77 compared with that in sterile microalgae the fatty acids in microalgae mainly include saturated fatty acids sfa and unsaturated fatty acids ufa and ufa is further divided into monounsaturated fatty acids mufa and polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa relevant studies have shown that raw materials containing fatty acids with low unsaturation level are more suitable for biodiesel production 61 since high level of unsaturated fatty acids will reduce oxidation stability and affect combustion heat and cetane number 62 after co culture with b megaterium the sfa content increased by 24 03 while the ufa content decreased by 19 44 fig 6d which was caused by the significant reduction in mufa and pufa contents therefore compared with sterile s obliquus culture the fatty acid composition of s obliquus in so b co culture was more suitable for biofuel production 4 conclusions a native bacterial strain b megaterium was isolated for the successful construction of a microalgae bacteria co culture system with s obliquus which demonstrated a high efficiency on biogas slurry treatment the c n ratio was the key factor regulating nh4 n removal by co culture the fatty acid composition of so b co culture was more suitable for biofuel production than that of sterile s obliquus culture the above results indicate the great potential of combining biogas slurry treatment and biofuel production by so b co culture which can not only alleviate the harm of biogas slurry to the environment but also reduce the cost of large scale microalgae cultivation this study is the first to report the key factor regulating nh4 n removal by microalgae bacteria co culture however regulatory mechanism needs to be explored in future work funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china nos 42076138

13534,the proliferation of pluripotent stem cells in mass cell culture is hindered by the release of cell metabolites such as lactate and ammonia in this work a porous strong acid cation exchange resin pk216lh and mg al layered doubled oxide ldo were used to take up nh4 and lactate respectively initially pk216lh could take up nh4 from an aqueous solution the uptake of nh4 by pk216lh followed pseudo second order kinetics and corresponded to the langmuir adsorption isotherm with an apparent activation energy of 28 2 kj mol and a maximum adsorption amount of 1 38 mmol g the simultaneous use of mg al ldo and pk216lh could not sufficiently take up lactate and nh4 in contrast the individual use of mg al ldo and pk216lh in two stages enabled efficient removal of lactate and nh4 keywords cation exchange resin ammonia lactate treatment 1 introduction cell culture is a method used to facilitate the controlled growth and proliferation of cells it is used in various fields mainly for research applications in the fields of regenerative medicine and genetic engineering industrial applications in the fields of pharmaceuticals and food manufacturing 1 and clinical applications in fields such as cell therapy 2 in recent years the medical applications of stem cells have been intensively studied the pharmaceutical industry is shifting from animal experimentation to conducting tests using cultured cells in view of the increasing opposition to the former 3 furthermore expectations from regenerative medicine are increasing pluripotent stem cells which possess the ability to differentiate into various types of cells are expected to be an important cell source for regenerative medicine therefore high quality cells need to be cultured in large quantities and at low cost 4 however cell proliferation in mass cell cultures is slowed down by the generation of cell metabolites which inhibit cell densification 5 cell metabolites such as lactate and ammonia inhibit cell growth currently regular changing of the medium is required to remove lactate and ammonia which increases expenditure studies have been conducted on medium regeneration by removing lactate and ammonia from the medium to perform high density mass cell cultures at low costs the removal of lactate and ammonia from a medium has been attempted using methods such as electrolysis 6 adsorption 7 cell modification 8 and modification of the medium composition 9 the medium comprises inorganic salts amino acids vitamins fatty acids sugars proteins and other compounds the medium regenerating method should ideally remove lactate and ammonia while leaving intact the other components of the medium furthermore the ph of the medium needs to be maintained at 7 0 7 4 removal of lactate and ammonia requires a process exhibiting high ph stability as large fluctuations in ph inhibit cell proliferation 10 in this study we investigated the uptake of ammonia by an easy to operate and highly versatile adsorption operation to construct a process for medium regeneration and utilization ammonia exists as nh4 under the ph conditions of the medium a cation exchange resin pk216lh was used as an adsorbent pk216lh is a strong acid cation exchange resin with a porous matrix structure it exhibits high durability under swelling and shrinkage and has been used for wastewater treatment pure water production and separation and purification processes in various fields 11 13 the strong acid cation exchange resin contains a sulfonic acid group so3h as an exchange group the sulfonic acid group dissociates into so3 and h in aqueous solution and can adsorb various cations further cation exchange does not occur once h is exchanged by another cation the strong acid cation exchange resin can be reused by regenerating it in the form of so3h using hydrochloric or sulfuric acid in this study we studied the uptake of ammonia by pk216lh the uptake mechanisms were investigated by analyzing the kinetics and adsorption isotherms previous studies have revealed that mg al layered double oxides mg al ldos effectively take up lactate from aqueous solutions 14 mg al ldo was obtained by calcining mg al layered double hydroxide mg al ldh 15 at approximately 500 c mg al ldo has the ability to regenerate the mg al ldh structure by intercalating anions with the release of oh in aqueous solution 16 20 lactate adsorption by mg al ldo followed a pseudo second order rate model with an apparent activation energy of 61 7 kj mol which suggests that it occurred through chemisorption additionally the adsorption followed the langmuir model the maximum adsorption amount was 1 66 mmol g it is hypothesized that mg al ldo adsorbed lactate by anion exchange between the oh anion present in the ldo and the lactate ion ch3ch oh coo present in the solution the ph of the solution at the end of the reaction was 11 12 to summarize we conducted an experiment to investigate the adsorption of lactate and ammonia from a mixed aqueous lactate ammonia solution using mg al ldo and pk216lh the significance of this study lies in its examination of the potential of pk216lh to take up ammonia from an aqueous solution and the possibility of treating a mixed aqueous lactate ammonia solution with mg al ldo and pk216lh this mode of using mg al ldo and pk216lh can then be applied to construct a treatment process for cell culture medium regeneration 2 experimental lactate special grade 85 0 and nh4cl special grade 99 5 purchased from kanto chemical co inc were used as the reagents pk216lh was purchased from mitsubishi chemical corp the water used in this study was distilled and thereafter deionized using an aquarius rfd240ha automatic water distillation apparatus manufactured by advantec 2 1 ammonia adsorption by pk216lh samples of 20 ml 1 50 mmol l aqueous nh4 solution initial ph 7 2 were placed into 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks and different amounts of pk216lh 0 01 1 0 g were added to each flask suction filtration was performed through 0 45 μm membrane filters following agitation for different durations between 1 min and 24 h at 17 37 and 57 c and the residual nh4 concentration was measured three times using high performance liquid chromatography hplc jasco tokyo japan column jasco ys 50 eluent 4 mmol l nitric acid flow rate 1 0 ml min temperature 40 c wavelength uv 210 nm with the error confined to 0 01 mmol l the ph of the filtrate was measured as well 2 2 treatment of mixed aqueous lactate ammonia mg al ldo having an mg al molar ratio of 3 2 was synthesized according to a previous study 21 and used as the adsorbent 2 2 1 simultaneous use of mg al ldo and pk216lh samples of 20 ml volume consisting of 10 mmol l aqueous lactate solution 10 mmol l aqueous nh4 solution initial ph 7

membrane filters following adsorption for 24 h at 37 c and the residual lactate or nh4 concentration of the filtrate was measured three times using hplc with the error confined to 0 01 mmol l the analytical conditions for lactate were as follows column jasco sh1011 eluent 5 mmol l sulfuric acid flow rate 1 0 ml min temperature 60 c wavelength uv 210 nm the ph of the filtrate was measured as well as a reference experiment 20 ml of a 10 mmol l aqueous lactate solution initial ph 7 2 was placed in a 50 ml erlenmeyer flask and 0 1 g of mg al ldo was added suction filtration was performed through 0 45 μm membrane filters following adsorption for 24 h at 37 c the residual lactate concentration of the obtained filtrate was measured three times using hplc with the error confined to 0 01 mmol l 2 2 2 two stage use of mg al ldo pk216lh in the first stage samples of 20 ml volume consisting of 10 mmol l aqueous lactate solution 10 mmol l aqueous nh4 solution were placed in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks and 0 1 g mg al ldo was added to each flask suction filtration was performed through 0 45 μm membrane filters following adsorption for 24 h at 37 c in the second stage the filtrate obtained from the first stage 20 ml was placed into a 50 ml erlenmeyer flask 0 01 1 0 g of pk216lh was added and suction filtration was performed through 0 45 μm membrane filters following adsorption for 24 h at 37 c the residual lactate or nh4 concentration of the obtained filtrate was measured three times using hplc with an error of 0 01 mmol l 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of ammonia by pk216lh fig 1 shows the effect of the pk216lh dosage on the uptake of nh4 and the ph of the solution following adsorption the uptake of nh4 increased with the increase in the dosage of pk216lh and 90 or higher removal was achieved at dosages of 0 5 g or higher additionally the ph of the solution decreased to approximately 2 at higher dosages of pk216lh fig 2 shows the effect of temperature on the amount of nh4 adsorbed by pk216lh at each temperature the amount of nh4 adsorbed increased rapidly in the early stages following which it became nearly constant the amount of nh4 adsorbed at each point in time did not vary significantly with temperature fig s1 shows the effect of temperature on the ph of the solution following the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh the ph became constant at approximately 2 at each temperature point kinetic analysis 22 23 was conducted based on the data in fig 2 the pseudo first order rate equation is reported as eq 1 1 log q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t where q e a n d q t mmol g are the amounts of nh4 adsorbed per gram of adsorbent at equilibrium and at time t min respectively whereas k 1 min is the pseudo first order kinetic rate constant following eq 1 plots of log q e q t vs t were constructed and the correlation with the linear approximation was evaluated to examine whether the adsorption follows the pseudo first order rate equation the pseudo second order rate equation is reported as eq 2 2 d q d t k 2 q e q t 2 integrating and transforming eq 2 yields eq 3 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 g mmol min is the pseudo second order rate constant following eq 3 a plot of t q t vs t was constructed and the correlation with the linear approximation was evaluated to determine whether the adsorption follows the pseudo second order rate equation the intraparticle diffusion model is reported as eq 4 4 q t k p t 1 2 c where k p is the rate constant considering the effect of intraparticle diffusion following eq 4 a plot of q t vs t 1 2 was constructed and the correlation with the linear approximation was evaluated to determine whether it follows the intraparticle diffusion model table 1 shows the correlation coefficients for each rate equation modeling the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh the correlation coefficient r2 attained its highest value of 1 00 for the pseudo second order rate equation at each temperature point evidently the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh follows the pseudo second order rate model fig s2 shows the fitting of the adsorption data to the pseudo second order rate equation the k 2 of the pseudo second order rate equation obtained from the approximation is listed in table 1 k 2 increased with increase in temperature an arrhenius plot was constructed for the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh based on these data fig s3 the arrhenius plot showed good linearity and the apparent activation energy calculated from the slope of the linear approximation was 28 2 kj mol adsorption is generally classified into physisorption and chemisorption it is known that the interacting force for physisorption is weak and the activation energy is 4 2 kj mol or lower 24 25 in comparison the interacting force for chemisorption is stronger and the activation energy is 8 4 83 7 kj mol 24 25 the apparent activation energy calculated lies in this range therefore it is evident that the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh is a process of chemisorption thereafter an adsorption isotherm 26 was examined fig 3 shows the adsorption isotherm of nh4 by pk216lh here c e mmol l represents the equilibrium concentration of nh4 q e increased with increase in c e the data from fig 3 was fitted to the langmuir and freundlich equations the langmuir equation is reported as eq 5 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e transforming eq 5 results in eq 6 6 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m where q m m m o l g is the maximum adsorption amount and k l is the langmuir constant the langmuir equation assumes single layer adsorption with a one to one correspondence between the adsorption sites and the adsorbate molecules and this is applied to chemisorption we investigated whether the results follow the langmuir equation by constructing plots of c e q e vs c e and evaluating the correlation with the linear approximation the freundlich equation is reported as eq 7 7 q e k f c e 1 n taking the logarithms of both sides of eq 7 yields eq 8 8 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where k f is the freundlich constant the freundlich equation is an empirical equation based on the assumption that adsorption occurs on non uniform surfaces and is often used to model liquid phase adsorption we investigated whether the results follow the freundlich equation by constructing plots of log q e vs log c e and evaluating the correlation with the linear approximation figs s4 and s5 show the langmuir and freundlich plots respectively based on the adsorption isotherm of nh4 by pk216lh the correlation coefficient r2 was approximately 1 00 for the langmuir plot which was higher than its value for the freundlich plot evidently the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh follows the langmuir model the maximum adsorption amount q m was 1 38 mmol g the mechanism for the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh is inferred based on the aforementioned results this adsorption follows a pseudo second order rate equation the value of the apparent activation energy is consistent with chemisorption the ph of the solution following adsorption was approximately 2 which means that h was released into the solution this adsorption corresponds to the langmuir adsorption isotherm which represents a single layer adsorption where the adsorption sites and the adsorbate molecules have a one to one correspondence therefore nh4 adsorption is hypothesized to occur via the cation exchange reaction with h which accompanies the dissociation of the sulfonic acid group on the surface of pk216lh 3 2 treatment of mixed aqueous lactate ammonia it has been proven in section 3 1 that pk216lh is an effective nh4 adsorbent however as discussed in the introduction cell proliferation slows down when the ph of the medium changes significantly the ph of the solution was reduced to approximately 2 when pk216lh was used therefore mg al ldo which increases the ph of solutions following adsorption was selected as the lactate adsorbent and pk216lh was used in combination with it to study the process of lactate and nh4 removal while the ph of the solution was controlled the target ph was 7 0 7 4 which was the initial ph of the medium 3 2 1 simultaneous use of mg al ldo and pk216lh fig 4 shows the uptake of lactate from the mixed aqueous lactate nh4 solution and the ph of the solution following the adsorption due to the simultaneous addition of mg al ldo and pk216lh the ph of the solution decreased as the dosage of pk216lh increased and it was approximately 8 at the pk216lh dosage of 1 0 g this may have occurred because the oh generated by the adsorption of lactate by mg al ldo was neutralized by the h dissociated from pk216lh the uptake of lactate from an independent aqueous solution by mg al ldo was 45 0 and this value remained identical at each dosage of pk216lh the uptake of lactate from the mixed aqueous solution at each dosage of pk216lh was lower than the uptake achieved from the independent aqueous solution this may have occurred because mg al ldo adsorbs cl which is a counterion of nh4 fig 5 shows the uptake of nh4 from the mixed aqueous lactate nh4 solution and the ph of the solution following adsorption due to the simultaneous addition of mg al ldo and pk216lh the results obtained from the independent nh4 aqueous solution shown in fig 1 are shown here as a reference the uptake of nh4 from the mixed aqueous solution at each pk216lh amount was considerably lower than the uptake of nh4 from the independent aqueous solution it is possible that mg2 was eluted from mg al ldo by the dissociation of h from pk216lh 18 19 and pk216lh adsorbed this mg2 based on the aforementioned results we conclude that the method of simultaneously using mg al ldo and pk216lh may be able to control ph to a target value but it cannot sufficiently remove lactate and nh4 hence it was judged to be unsuitable as a medium regenerating treatment 3 2 2 two stage use of mg al ldo pk216lh the uptake of lactate in the first stage was 45 0 and the ph of the filtrate was 11 1 fig 6 shows the uptake of nh4 from the mixed aqueous lactate nh4 solution and the ph of the solution following the adsorption in the second stage the results obtained from the independent aqueous solution of nh4 shown in fig 1 are included here as a reference the uptake of nh4 from the mixed aqueous solution was higher than that from the independent aqueous solution at each dosage of pk216lh it is hypothesized that mg2 did not elute from the mg al ldo in the first stage because of the high ph of the filtrate it is further hypothesized that pk216lh was able to adsorb nh4 in the second stage because mg2 was not present in the filtrate furthermore the dissociation of h from pk216lh proceeds because h undergoes a neutralization reaction with oh in the filtrate therefore it is hypothesized that a reaction occurred between the so3 group of pk216lh and nh4 the ph of the solution decreased following the adsorption because the amount of pk216lh increased this result supports the hypothesis of a neutralization reaction between h which dissociates from pk216lh and the oh in the filtrate these results demonstrate that lactate and nh4 can be removed by dosing mg al ldo and pk216lh separately in two stages the target ph may be achieved in the future by adjusting the amounts of mg al ldo and pk216lh in summary the novelty of this study is the discovery that pk216lh can take up ammonia from an aqueous solution and mg al ldo and pk216lh can treat a mixed aqueous lactate ammonia solution in two stages the target ph may be achieved in future studies by adjusting the dosages of mg al ldo and pk216lh 4 conclusions the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh followed a pseudo second order rate model with an apparent activation energy of 28 2 kj mol this suggests that the adsorption was brought about by chemisorption furthermore the adsorption was found to follow the langmuir model the maximum adsorption amount was 1 38 mmol g the adsorption of nh4 was hypothesized to occur via the cation exchange reaction with h accompanying the dissociation of the sulfonic acid group on the surface of pk216lh dosing mg al ldo and pk216lh simultaneously could not sufficiently take up lactate and nh4 in contrast dosing mg al ldo and pk216lh separately in two stages enabled the uptake of lactate and nh4 declaration of competing interest

resin pk216lh and mg al layered doubled oxide ldo were used to take up nh4 and lactate respectively initially pk216lh could take up nh4 from an aqueous solution the uptake of nh4 by pk216lh followed pseudo second order kinetics and corresponded to the langmuir adsorption isotherm with an apparent activation energy of 28 2 kj mol and a maximum adsorption amount of 1 38 mmol g the simultaneous use of mg al ldo and pk216lh could not sufficiently take up lactate and nh4 in contrast the individual use of mg al ldo and pk216lh in two stages enabled efficient removal of lactate and nh4 keywords cation exchange resin ammonia lactate treatment 1 introduction cell culture is a method used to facilitate the controlled growth and proliferation of cells it is used in various fields mainly for research applications in the fields of regenerative medicine and genetic engineering industrial applications in the fields of pharmaceuticals and food manufacturing 1 and clinical applications in fields such as cell therapy 2 in recent years the medical applications of stem cells have been intensively studied the pharmaceutical industry is shifting from animal experimentation to conducting tests using cultured cells in view of the increasing opposition to the former 3 furthermore expectations from regenerative medicine are increasing pluripotent stem cells which possess the ability to differentiate into various types of cells are expected to be an important cell source for regenerative medicine therefore high quality cells need to be cultured in large quantities and at low cost 4 however cell proliferation in mass cell cultures is slowed down by the generation of cell metabolites which inhibit cell densification 5 cell metabolites such as lactate and ammonia inhibit cell growth currently regular changing of the medium is required to remove lactate and ammonia which increases expenditure studies have been conducted on medium regeneration by removing lactate and ammonia from the medium to perform high density mass cell cultures at low costs the removal of lactate and ammonia from a medium has been attempted using methods such as electrolysis 6 adsorption 7 cell modification 8 and modification of the medium composition 9 the medium comprises inorganic salts amino acids vitamins fatty acids sugars proteins and other compounds the medium regenerating method should ideally remove lactate and ammonia while leaving intact the other components of the medium furthermore the ph of the medium needs to be maintained at 7 0 7 4 removal of lactate and ammonia requires a process exhibiting high ph stability as large fluctuations in ph inhibit cell proliferation 10 in this study we investigated the uptake of ammonia by an easy to operate and highly versatile adsorption operation to construct a process for medium regeneration and utilization ammonia exists as nh4 under the ph conditions of the medium a cation exchange resin pk216lh was used as an adsorbent pk216lh is a strong acid cation exchange resin with a porous matrix structure it exhibits high durability under swelling and shrinkage and has been used for wastewater treatment pure water production and separation and purification processes in various fields 11 13 the strong acid cation exchange resin contains a sulfonic acid group so3h as an exchange group the sulfonic acid group dissociates into so3 and h in aqueous solution and can adsorb various cations further cation exchange does not occur once h is exchanged by another cation the strong acid cation exchange resin can be reused by regenerating it in the form of so3h using hydrochloric or sulfuric acid in this study we studied the uptake of ammonia by pk216lh the uptake mechanisms were investigated by analyzing the kinetics and adsorption isotherms previous studies have revealed that mg al layered double oxides mg al ldos effectively take up lactate from aqueous solutions 14 mg al ldo was obtained by calcining mg al layered double hydroxide mg al ldh 15 at approximately 500 c mg al ldo has the ability to regenerate the mg al ldh structure by intercalating anions with the release of oh in aqueous solution 16 20 lactate adsorption by mg al ldo followed a pseudo second order rate model with an apparent activation energy of 61 7 kj mol which suggests that it occurred through chemisorption additionally the adsorption followed the langmuir model the maximum adsorption amount was 1 66 mmol g it is hypothesized that mg al ldo adsorbed lactate by anion exchange between the oh anion present in the ldo and the lactate ion ch3ch oh coo present in the solution the ph of the solution at the end of the reaction was 11 12 to summarize we conducted an experiment to investigate the adsorption of lactate and ammonia from a mixed aqueous lactate ammonia solution using mg al ldo and pk216lh the significance of this study lies in its examination of the potential of pk216lh to take up ammonia from an aqueous solution and the possibility of treating a mixed aqueous lactate ammonia solution with mg al ldo and pk216lh this mode of using mg al ldo and pk216lh can then be applied to construct a treatment process for cell culture medium regeneration 2 experimental lactate special grade 85 0 and nh4cl special grade 99 5 purchased from kanto chemical co inc were used as the reagents pk216lh was purchased from mitsubishi

by pk216lh fig 1 shows the effect of the pk216lh dosage on the uptake of nh4 and the ph of the solution following adsorption the uptake of nh4 increased with the increase in the dosage of pk216lh and 90 or higher removal was achieved at dosages of 0 5 g or higher additionally the ph of the solution decreased to approximately 2 at higher dosages of pk216lh fig 2 shows the effect of temperature on the amount of nh4 adsorbed by pk216lh at each temperature the amount of nh4 adsorbed increased rapidly in the early stages following which it became nearly constant the amount of nh4 adsorbed at each point in time did not vary significantly with temperature fig s1 shows the effect of temperature on the ph of the solution following the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh the ph became constant at approximately 2 at each temperature point kinetic analysis 22 23 was conducted based on the data in fig 2 the pseudo first order rate equation is reported as eq 1 1 log q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t where q e a n d q t mmol g are the amounts of nh4 adsorbed per gram of adsorbent at equilibrium and at time t min respectively whereas k 1 min is the pseudo first order kinetic rate constant following eq 1 plots of log q e q t vs t were constructed and the correlation with the linear approximation was evaluated to examine whether the adsorption follows the pseudo first order rate equation the pseudo second order rate equation is reported as eq 2 2 d q d t k 2 q e q t 2 integrating and transforming eq 2 yields eq 3 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 g mmol min is the pseudo second order rate constant following eq 3 a plot of t q t vs t was constructed and the correlation with the linear approximation was evaluated to determine whether the adsorption follows the pseudo second order rate equation the intraparticle diffusion model is reported as eq 4 4 q t k p t 1 2 c where k p is the rate constant considering the effect of intraparticle diffusion following eq 4 a plot of q t vs t 1 2 was constructed and the correlation with the linear approximation was evaluated to determine whether it follows the intraparticle diffusion model table 1 shows the correlation coefficients for each rate equation modeling the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh the correlation coefficient r2 attained its highest value of 1 00 for the pseudo second order rate equation at each temperature point evidently the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh follows the pseudo second order rate model fig s2 shows the fitting of the adsorption data to the pseudo second order rate equation the k 2 of the pseudo second order rate equation obtained from the approximation is listed in table 1 k 2 increased with increase in temperature an arrhenius plot was constructed for the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh based on these data fig s3 the arrhenius plot showed good linearity and the apparent activation energy calculated from the slope of the linear approximation was 28 2 kj mol adsorption is generally classified into physisorption and chemisorption it is known that the interacting force for physisorption is weak and the activation energy is 4 2 kj mol or lower 24 25 in comparison the interacting force for chemisorption is stronger and the activation energy is 8 4 83 7 kj mol 24 25 the apparent activation energy calculated lies in this range therefore it is evident that the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh is a process of chemisorption thereafter an adsorption isotherm 26 was examined fig 3 shows the adsorption isotherm of nh4 by pk216lh here c e mmol l represents the equilibrium concentration of nh4 q e increased with increase in c e the data from fig 3 was fitted to the langmuir and freundlich equations the langmuir equation is reported as eq 5 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e transforming eq 5 results in eq 6 6 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m where q m m m o l g is the maximum adsorption amount and k l is the langmuir constant the langmuir equation assumes single layer adsorption with a one to one correspondence between the adsorption sites and the adsorbate molecules and this is applied to chemisorption we investigated whether the results follow the langmuir equation by constructing plots of c e q e vs c e and evaluating the correlation with the linear approximation the freundlich equation is reported as eq 7 7 q e k f c e 1 n taking the logarithms of both sides of eq 7 yields eq 8 8 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where k f is the freundlich constant the freundlich equation is an empirical equation based on the assumption that adsorption occurs on non uniform surfaces and is often used to model liquid phase adsorption we investigated whether the results follow the freundlich equation by constructing plots of log q e vs log c e and evaluating the correlation with the linear approximation figs s4 and s5 show the langmuir and freundlich plots respectively based on the adsorption isotherm of nh4 by pk216lh the correlation coefficient r2 was approximately 1 00 for the langmuir plot which was higher than its value for the freundlich plot evidently the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh follows the langmuir model the maximum adsorption amount q m was 1 38 mmol g the mechanism for the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh is inferred based on the aforementioned results this adsorption follows a pseudo second order rate equation the value of the apparent activation energy is consistent with chemisorption the ph of the solution following adsorption was approximately 2 which means that h was released into the solution this adsorption corresponds to the langmuir adsorption isotherm which represents a single layer adsorption where the adsorption sites and the adsorbate molecules have a one to one correspondence therefore nh4 adsorption is hypothesized to occur via the cation exchange reaction with h which accompanies the dissociation of the sulfonic acid group on the surface of pk216lh 3 2 treatment of mixed aqueous lactate ammonia it has been proven in section 3 1 that pk216lh is an effective nh4 adsorbent however as discussed in the introduction cell proliferation slows down when the ph of the medium changes significantly the ph of the solution was reduced to approximately 2 when pk216lh was used therefore mg al ldo which increases the ph of solutions following adsorption was selected as the lactate adsorbent and pk216lh was used in combination with it to study the process of lactate and nh4 removal while the ph of the solution was controlled the target ph was 7 0 7 4 which was the initial ph of the medium 3 2 1 simultaneous use of mg al ldo and pk216lh fig 4 shows the uptake of lactate from the mixed aqueous lactate nh4 solution and the ph of the solution following the adsorption due to the simultaneous addition of mg al ldo and pk216lh the ph of the solution decreased as the dosage of pk216lh increased and it was approximately 8 at the pk216lh dosage of 1 0 g this may have occurred because the oh generated by the adsorption of lactate by mg al ldo was neutralized by the h dissociated from pk216lh the uptake of lactate from an independent aqueous solution by mg al ldo was 45 0 and this value remained identical at each dosage of pk216lh the uptake of lactate from the mixed aqueous solution at each dosage of pk216lh was lower than the uptake achieved from the independent aqueous solution this may have occurred because mg al ldo adsorbs cl which is a counterion of nh4 fig 5 shows the uptake of nh4 from the mixed aqueous lactate nh4 solution and the ph of the solution following adsorption due to the simultaneous addition of mg al ldo and pk216lh the results obtained from the independent nh4 aqueous solution shown in fig 1 are shown here as a reference the uptake of nh4 from the mixed aqueous solution at each pk216lh amount was considerably lower than the uptake of nh4 from the independent aqueous solution it is possible that mg2 was eluted from mg al ldo by the dissociation of h from pk216lh 18 19 and pk216lh adsorbed this mg2 based on the aforementioned results we conclude that the method of simultaneously using mg al ldo and pk216lh may be able to control ph to a target value but it cannot sufficiently remove lactate and nh4 hence it was judged to be unsuitable as a medium regenerating treatment 3 2 2 two stage use of mg al ldo pk216lh the uptake of lactate in the first stage was 45 0 and the ph of the filtrate was 11 1 fig 6 shows the uptake of nh4 from the mixed aqueous lactate nh4 solution and the ph of the solution following the adsorption in the second stage the results obtained from the independent aqueous solution of nh4 shown in fig 1 are included here as a reference the uptake of nh4 from the mixed aqueous solution was higher than that from the independent aqueous solution at each dosage of pk216lh it is hypothesized that mg2 did not elute from the mg al ldo in the first stage because of the high ph of the filtrate it is further hypothesized that pk216lh was able to adsorb nh4 in the second stage because mg2 was not present in the filtrate furthermore the dissociation of h from pk216lh proceeds because h undergoes a neutralization reaction with oh in the filtrate therefore it is hypothesized that a reaction occurred between the so3 group of pk216lh and nh4 the ph of the solution decreased following the adsorption because the amount of pk216lh increased this result supports the hypothesis of a neutralization reaction between h which dissociates from pk216lh and the oh in the filtrate these results demonstrate that lactate and nh4 can be removed by dosing mg al ldo and pk216lh separately in two stages the target ph may be achieved in the future by adjusting the amounts of mg al ldo and pk216lh in summary the novelty of this study is the discovery that pk216lh can take up ammonia from an aqueous solution and mg al ldo and pk216lh can treat a mixed aqueous lactate ammonia solution in two stages the target ph may be achieved in future studies by adjusting the dosages of mg al ldo and pk216lh 4 conclusions the adsorption of nh4 by pk216lh followed a pseudo second order rate model with an apparent activation energy of 28 2 kj mol this suggests that the adsorption was brought about by chemisorption furthermore the adsorption was found to follow the langmuir model the maximum adsorption amount was 1 38 mmol g the adsorption of nh4 was hypothesized to occur via the cation exchange reaction with h accompanying the dissociation of the sulfonic acid group on the surface of pk216lh dosing mg al ldo and pk216lh simultaneously could not sufficiently take up lactate and nh4 in contrast dosing mg al ldo and pk216lh separately in two stages enabled the uptake of lactate and nh4 declaration of competing interest
